Now retired, he was formerly the professor of the Philosophy of law and Public law at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.Biographische Daten von Reinhold Zippelius in: Wer ist Wer – Das deutsche Who’s Who 2000/2001. 39. Ausgabe, Schmidt-Römhild, Verlagsgruppe Beleke, Lübeck 2000, , p. 1581. Life and career Reinhold Walter Zippelius was born in Ansbach (west of Nuremberg), the son of Hans Zippelius and Marie (Stoessel) Zippelius. He embarked on his study of jurisprudence in 1947 at Würzburg and then at Erlangen. In 1949 he switched to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where between 1949 and 1961 he was supported by a scholarship-bursary. He received his doctorate in 1953. His habilitation (higher academic qualification), also from Munich, and supervised by Karl Engisch, would follow in 1961. After passing his public law exams (1956 and 1963) Zippelius worked in government service in Bavaria, in the end promoted to the level of Oberregierungsrat (senior government legal advisor) at the Interior Ministry. His habilitation in 1961 opened the way for an academic career, and in 1963 he accepted a teaching chair at Erlangen that covered a range of law related disciplines including Philosophy of law, Public law, Administrative/Civil Law and Church law. Despite attempts by Munich and other university level institutions outside Bavaria to lure him away, he remained at Erlangen for more than fifty years. Reinhold Zippelius retired from his professorship at Erlangen in 1995. Zippelius is a full member of the Mainz based Academy of Sciences and Literature (\\"Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur\\"). In 2002 The Faculty of Scientific Theory and History at Athens University awarded him an honorary doctorate (\\"doctor honoris causa\\"). Focus His academic research is centred on constitutional law, theory of the state, along with legal philosophy and method. The \\"critical rationalism\\" provides the theoretical base for Zippelius' concept of law. According to Zippelius, law does not consist of \\"abstract\\" norms which are loosened from life, but it is \\"law in action\\", which is procreated by human action and thereby transformed into the reality of the contemporary culture.Zippelius, Rechtsphilosophie, 6th ed., § 4 In terms of legal theory, his themes include solving legal problems with the assistance of key concepts, comparison of cases and the question of what counts as \\"right\\", especially as regards the validity of unfair laws. In terms of theory of the state, his themes include the legitimation and cultivation of democracy, especially regarding the rule of law, and the oligarchic components of pluralistic democracy, furthermore the federalism (the limitation of authorities, the functioning and the democratic ambiguity of federalism) and the problems of the bureaucracy.

During the construction of the stadium, the idea of building a modern boarding school came out. On December 8th, 1935 they put the first “brick” of the new boarding school with authorities participation. In 1936 the stadium was opened. The Lecaros Building (boarding school) was on the final stage of construction when the boarding school project was canceled by St. Ignatius Alonso Ovalle School in 1954. Due to the advanced construction, the idea of taking the preparatory courses to the new building was purposed. On the Centenary year of the original school, exactly on October 3rd, 1956, they open the new “Pocuro Building”. Later the secondary school became St. Ignatius El Bosque School At that moment already 400 students of primary school were using the new building in charge of Hermanas del Amor Misericordioso.

To date, the majority of completed projects have come forward in London and the major provincial cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield. Construction is now underway in Birmingham and Leeds. The UK Government is reportedly encouraging the sector's growth. By September 2019 the number of units either built or in construction was reported to have increased to 35,000 following large developments by a number of firms report in the media Build to Rent is the most contemporary development in the Private Rented Sector (PRS) and offers housing across the full spectrum of privately rented accommodation in terms of scale and service offering, often with affordable housing being integrated through discounted market rental homes.

Illeginni is located approximately directly south of Roi-Namur Island, the northernmost part in the atoll, and to the northwest of Kwajalein, the largest island and southernmost part of the atoll. The island runs roughly west-northwest to east-southeast. It is approximately long and averages about across. The northwestern end is a narrow finger that extends into several sandbars, while the southeastern end has a hook-shaped harbour on the north side. Illeginni was the site of a Sprint missile launcher during the 1960s, part of the Nike-X anti-ballistic missile program. Sprint was a very short range system, and relied on a number of bases being spread around the area to be defended, one of these containing the control systems and master radar. Meck Island was the main base in the test system, while Illeginni was a model of the distributed launch sites. As Nike-X was modified to become Safeguard, Illeginni's site was changed (before construction) to hold four Sprint and four LIM-49 Spartan launchers. The launcher was abandoned after the Safeguard test program ended in the early 1970s. A number of automated tracking cameras were installed as part of the Safeguard program, and one of these remains in use today to support overall operations of the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site. The island also includes one of the two remote receivers for the TRADEX radar on Roi-Namur, the other remote is on Gellinam, close to Meck. When used together, the three radars are known as the Multistatic Measurement System, or MMS. A helipad was installed on the eastern end of the island, but modern photography shows a new helipad on the former missile silos on the western end. A harbor has been dredged in the northern side of the eastern end of the island, where it is its widest. The coral dredged from the harbour was used to build the berm for the missile silos.

History The facility opened as Perthshire's district asylum to patients on 1 April 1864 to treat the county's 'pauper lunatics', and was the second district asylum in Scotland. It was built as a result of the Lunacy (Scotland) Act 1857 which created district boards with the power to found and run publicly funded asylums for patients who could not afford the fees charged by private asylums. Its location was remote, although the Highland Railway's mainline was relatively nearby. Rural locations were often chosen for such hospitals due to a belief that fresh air and separation from factors likely to cause anxiety would aid recovery. By July of its opening year it already had 172 patients. The original superintendent of the hospital was Dr William M'Intosh who encouraged the hospital's policy of using occupation and exercise to help patients. This meant that patients were engaged in activities such as working in the grounds and sewing. Other activities included participation in sports such as football and curling in winter and cricket in summer. Walks in the countryside and dances were also organised for patients in the summer months. The main building was designed by Dundee architects Edward and Robertson, and was able to accommodate 222 patients. Along with a governor's house, farm office and other works, the contract for construction was valued at £18,000. An administrative block was added in around 1871. The grounds included a stone circle, which prior to the laying of the asylum would have stood in an open field. When the asylum was being built cinerary urns were uncovered near the circle, including one which contained some partially burnt human bones. In 1894 it became one of the first asylums to build villas for its patients in an attempt to develop a 'colony or village system' of patient accommodation. During the First World War, it was used as a war hospital, offering beds for 350 other ranks. It was also used as a Military Psychiatric Hospital from 1917 to 1919, while its civilian patients were sent to other hospitals. At one point the complex included its own cemetery and a tramway linked it to Murthly railway station. By 1964 it was being run by the Board of Management for the Murray Royal & Murthly Hospitals. Training in nursing was carried out at the hospital, with the Murray and Murthly Hospitals Group Training School merging into Perth College of Nursing and Midwifery in 1969. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in 1984. While the main building was demolished, an administration block was retained and some of the villas are thought to survive. The archives of the hospital are held by the University of Dundee's Archive Services as part of the NHS Tayside Archives.

It marked a reunion of the band after a twelve-year breakup, and features songs from their original 1980–81 run and from their then-upcoming reunion album OC Confidential (2005). Background and recording The Adolescents had disbanded in April 1989, following the release of their third studio album, Balboa Fun*Zone. The band's 1980–81 lineup of singer Tony Brandenburg, bassist Steve Soto, drummer Casey Royer, and guitarist brothers Rikk and Frank Agnew (who had recorded their 1981 debut album, Adolescents, also known as The Blue Album) reunited for a performance that December, which was released eight years later as the live album Return to the Black Hole. In the years following the breakup, the members were involved in other musical projects: Soto formed the parody group Manic Hispanic in 1992, and he, Frank Agnew, and former Adolescents drummer Sandy Hanson simultaneously started a band called Joyride. Frank Agnew soon left to focus on his family life and maintained a low-profile musical career in subsequent years, playing on albums by Tender Fury, Rule 62, and Mr. Mirainga. Soto and Hansen continued with Joyride until 1996, then formed the band 22 Jacks. Royer, meanwhile, resumed his other band, D.I., while Brandenburg started a new group, Sister Goddamn, and Rikk Agnew briefly rejoined the gothic rock band Christian Death and released two solo albums in the early 1990s. In 1992, Brandenburg and Rikk and Frank Agnew joined other Southern California punk musicians for Pinups, an album of cover versions of punk rock songs from the 1970s and early 1980s on which Soto sang backing vocals. Brandenburg (now using the stage name Tony Reflex), Royer, and Rikk Agnew also formed ADZ; the group's name was a shortened form of Adolescents. Royer and Agnew both left ADZ after the band's first album, Where Were You?; both had substance abuse issues. Royer was addicted to heroin, while Agnew abused a variety of drugs and drank alcohol excessively throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, becoming obese in the process. Royer resumed D.I., while Rikk Agnew again briefly rejoined Christian Death. Brandenburg continued with ADZ throughout the 1990s with other members (Frank Agnew played lead guitar on five tracks on the band's 1995 album Piper at the Gates of Downey). The Adolescents' Blue Album lineup reunited in 2001. Royer soon left to continue D.I. and was replaced by Derek O'Brien, formerly of Social Distortion, D.I., and Agent Orange. The band began writing new material and issued an EP titled Unwrap and Blow Me! in 2003, limited to 100 copies and consisting of six new songs: \\"Hawks and Doves\\", \\"Where the Children Play\\", \\"California Son\\", \\"OC Confidential\\", \\"Pointless Teenage Anthem\\", and \\"Within These Walls\\". They were approached by Kung Fu Records to record a performance for the label's series of concert films, The Show Must Go Off! The performance took place at the House of Blues at Downtown Disney in Anaheim, California on October 3, 2003. It was filmed with a seven camera setup using 24p digital video, and a 24-track recording system to capture the audio. The set included songs from Adolescents, the Welcome to Reality EP (1981), and the new songs \\"OC Confidential\\", \\"California Son\\", \\"Lockdown America\\", \\"Hawks and Doves\\", and \\"Within These Walls\\". Rikk Agnew left the band by the end of the year, and they recorded their reunion album, OC Confidential (2005) without him. Release and reception Live at the House of Blues was released February 24, 2004 by Kung Fu Records as a combination DVD and compact disc; The CD includes the audio portion of the concert presented as a live album, while the DVD includes the concert film as well as audio commentary by the band, a multi- angle feature allowing the viewer to switch between the seven camera angles, a gallery photographs from the Adolescents' early years, and footage of the band performing a seven-song set in 1982. Scott Heisel of Punknews.org rated the package 2.5 stars out of 5, saying \\"the crew over at Kung-Fu's video department have put out another quality compilation of footage for their 10th release in the Show Must Go Off series. Editing is once again top-notch, as I hardly recall seeing any of the cameramen pop in the shots. The cuts are quick on the rash edgy So-Cal punk songs and the clips flow great among the members during the set. The sound of the show is admirable as well [...] The only [fault] I find production-wise is the brightness of the footage; it's rather dark and dreary.

He was born in Charlotte, North Carolina to Zechariah and Louise Alexander. His father was the owner of the Alexander Funeral Home, the only black funeral home in Charlotte. He played football at Second Ward High School, becoming known as \\"Ship-wreck Kelly.\\" Alexander studied at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and Renouard College of Embalming in New York City before returning to Charlotte to help run his father's business. His activism in the NAACP began in 1938 when he joined the Charlotte branch of the NAACP. In 1940 he took over leadership of the Charlotte branch, turning it into a powerful civil rights force within the city. In 1948 Alexander was elected president of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and began founding other chapters in the state of North Carolina. He would hold the post of President until 1984. Under his leadership, the NC Conference became the largest state conference in the country with over 120 branches. Alexander ran for the Charlotte City Council twice in the 1950s but was unsuccessful. As an activist in Charlotte he fought for the desegregation of restaurants and hotels in the area. He also supported the landmark Supreme Court of the United States Case Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education that said busing could be used to integrate schools. In 1965 Alexander's home was one of four homes bombed by someone trying to stifle the civil rights movement in Charlotte. Alexander's brother Frederick Alexander's home was hit along with civil rights lawyer Julius Chambers and activist Reginald Hawkins. No one was injured from the explosion. In 1950, Alexander was elected to serve on the National NAACP Board of Directors. In 1976 he was elected vice chair. In 1983 the NAACP board asked Alexander to become the acting chairman after a disruptive dispute between chairman Margaret Wilson and executive director Benjamin Hooks. Alexander accepted the chair and reorganized the NAACP. His work and leadership with the NAACP led him to be known as Mr. NAACP by his friends and colleagues. Alexander died on April 2, 1985 at the age of 69. He passed on his legacy of fighting for equality to his two sons, Kelly Alexander Jr who would become president of the NC Conference of the NAACP and Alfred Alexander who took over the family business.

Generally, Thais usually use whiteleg shrimp in this dish. Origin The origin of kung chae nampla is not clear but it believes that it has been a dish since in early Rattanakosin era (about 1782 – 1851) and it was originally found widespread in Thailand. It has become popular as an appetizer. Controversial issue Many people are afraid of sickness because raw shrimps that are used in this menu are risky of having Vibrio Parahaemolyticus bacteria. It can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea to ones who eat it (Germs from shrimp in fish sauce, 2014). Types There are different types of kung chae nampla. First of all, the original one, is served with chunks of gourd, cloves of garlic, and chilies with a spicy sauce that is served separately. Second, another version is served with lemongrass added. Lastly, there is the pour over version, which is served with the spicy sauce poured over the shrimp whereas other versions keep the spicy sauce separate when serving. Related dishes Similarly, there is also another spicy shrimp salad (, ). However, it has boiled shrimp, lime juice, kaffir lime leaves and lemon grass as the main ingredients.

The film collection consists of more than 5,000 35mm, 16mm, 8mm, and Super 8mm prints and the video collection includes more than 35,000 items on DVD, Blu- ray, LaserDisc, and VHS. The Film Study Center engages in the conservation, preservation, presentation, and circulation of moving image materials. The Film Study Center is an Associate of the International Federation of Film Archives. Founded in 1982, the Film Study Center archive traces its roots to film collections at Yale dating back to the 1960s, including the historic archives of a number of prominent film collectors. The FSC is currently involved in efforts to preserve film on film and to share its collection through public screenings, to ensure that films can continue to be presented as they were originally seen by audiences. The film collection of the Film Study Center is made up of a wide range of holdings, from Hollywood features to experimental shorts, from home movies to Bollywood musicals. The collection spans more than 120 years of cinema history, and includes films from around the globe as well as a number of films made by Yale alumni and about Yale and New Haven. Researchers can view films on site in the Film Study Center’s two screening rooms, which are capable of showing 16mm film and multiple video formats. One of these rooms is also equipped for screening 3D Blu-rays. The FSC also has two flatbed film viewing stations and twelve private video viewing booths for individual use. The FSC regularly screens its 35mm prints for the public in the Whitney Humanities Center Auditorium, the last 35mm- equipped public venue in New Haven County. Film Study Center staff regularly consult on special film projects around the University, including the preservation of film material in the Benny Goodman Collection in the Irving Gilmore Music Library of the Yale University Library.  History  In 1968, Yale began collecting 16mm film with the purchase of several hundred prints known as the John Griggs Collection of Classic Films. The Griggs films came to Yale largely through the efforts of experimental filmmaker Standish Lawder, then Assistant Professor in Yale’s History of Art Department, and Yale alumnus Spencer Berger, a film collector and historian of the Barrymore family. The purchase was funded by three alumni: Fred W. Beinecke, Richard E. Fuller, and Chester J. LaRoche Jr., all graduates of the University. Although modest, this acquisition encouraged other collectors to donate their films, which then became part a vital part of film curricula. Over the next 15 years, film as an academic discipline grew immensely, leading to the formation of both the Film Studies Program and the Film Study Center in 1982. During the 1980s, the 16mm archive burgeoned with film donations by Yale alumni Spencer Berger, Ralph Hirshorn, and others, while Yale’s 35mm archive was born with hundreds of rare prints of television programs produced by Herbert Brodkin, and collections such as those of the pioneering experimental director Mary Ellen Bute, a 1926 alumna of the Yale School of Drama. In 2013, the Film Study Center began its monthly screening series \\"Treasures from the Yale Film Archive,\\" showcasing 35mm prints from the archive's collection. The screenings feature introductions by Film Study Center staff as well as Yale faculty, and have also included guest filmmakers such as Michael Roemer, Warrington Hudlin, Tamar Simon Hoffs, Norman Weissman, and Frank and Caroline Mouris, as well as musical accompaniment for silent films by Donald Sosin. In July, 2017, the Yale Film Study Center formally became part of the Yale University Library.  Preservation  Films preserved by the Film Study Center include Passages from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (directed by Mary Ellen Bute) and The Boy Who Saw Through (produced by Bute and directed by George C. Stoney); Our Union, directed by Carl Marzani; To Be a Man, directed by Murray Lerner; and four films by animator Frank Mouris: Quick Dream, You're Not Real Pretty But You're Mine..., Chemical Architecture, and Coney Island Eats. In 2018, the Film Study Center completed preservation of director Nicholas Doob's 1979 film \\"Street Music,\\" which features performances by 19 street musicians including \\"Oliver \\"Pork Chop\\" Anderson,\\" Brother Blue, Bongo Joe Coleman, Jimmy Davis, Guy Mosley, Gene Palma, and \\"The Automatic Human Jukebox.\\" The Film Study Center also preserved 2-inch videotapes containing a 1972 broadcast by WTIC of \\"What's Happening,\\" a local news program that covered the visit to Yale by Duke Ellington and other jazz musicians including Eubie Blake, Dizzy Gillespie, Jo Jones, Charles Mingus, Max Roach, and Mary Lou Williams.

First edition, Blandford Press. p. 134, 230, 238 In 1926, a long internal conflict began in Mexico between the government of Plutarco Elías Calles and militias of laymen, priests and religious Catholics known as the Cristero War. One of the organizations involved was the Knights of Columbus, to which Nuñez belonged, and who along with other members supported and financed the armed struggle between 1926 and 1929 from his exile in the United States. Once the conflict with the government was over, Núñez returned to Mexico City. Throughout 1930, Edelmiro Traslosheros was dedicated to studying the predominant Scout organizations, and together with Núñez, begin to outline plans to found the Exploradores de México. In a private ceremony on November 1, 1931, in a mansion owned by Mrs. Refugio Golibar de Cortina, south of Mexico City in the direction of San Ángel, #2 Av.

On July 1, 1934, in a daring maneuver the National Council of Scouts of Mexico announced the merger of the Cuerpo de Exploradores Nacionales de México and the Scouts de México to the International Scout Bureau in London, and Núñez paid the arrears of the Cuerpo de Exploradores Nacionales de México. The London response was to award the title \\"Asociación de Scouts de México\\" to this merger. The title \\"Boy Scouts de Mexico\\" could not be used due to the legal suit between Jose Trinidad Padilla of Boy Scouts de Mexico, who had the title of name from 1930, and Núñez.

In the assignment problem, n objects have to be allocated fairly among n agents. Each agent has to receive exactly one object. Examples include the assignment of jobs to workers, of rooms to housemates, of time slots to users of a common machine, and so on. In general, a fair assignment may be impossible to attain. For example, if Alice and Batya both prefer the eastern room to the western room, only one of them will get it and the other will be envious. In the random assignment setting, fairness is attained using a lottery. So in the simple example above, Alice and Batya will toss a fair coin and the winner will get the eastern room. There are several ways to extend the \\"coin toss\\" method to situations in which there are more than two agents, and they may have different preference relations on the objects: * Random Priority (RP) is a truthful mechanism. It is ex-ante envy-free, and ex-post Pareto efficient, but not ex-ante Pareto-efficient. It is a very simple mechanism that only requires agents to have ordinal ranking on individual items. * Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes (CEEI) is a market-based mechanism: each item is viewed as a divisible commodity. Each agent is given 1/n-share of each commodity, then the agents are allowed to trade until there is equilibrium. It is ex-ante and ex-post Pareto-efficient, and ex-ante envy-free, but not truthful. This is a more complex mechanism that requires the agents to have full cardinal utility functions (or, alternatively, ordinal ranking on lotteries). * Probabilistic Serial (PS) is an algorithm that guarantees ex-ante envy-freeness, ex-ante and ex-post Pareto efficiency, but is not truthful. It requires only ordinal ranking on items.

History The two fountains were placed in 1641 at the sides of the Santissima Annunziata plaza, having been commissioned in 1626. The statues were originally intended to complement the Monument of the Four Moors in Livorno. To this end, artist Pietro Tacca began to work on them in 1627 with the help of two students: Bartolomeo Salvini and Francesco Maria Bandini. In 1641, following the death of Tucca, the fountains were placed in the Santissima Annunziata plaza on opposite sides of the Equestrian Monument of Ferdinando I. The fountains were restored over a period spanning from 1987 to 1988, and again between May and June 1996 by Giovanni Morigi under the direction of the Carlo Francini Office of Fine Arts of the City of Florence. Despite these efforts, the statues again began to show signs of material degradation and the fountains were eventually shut down. In 2013, money obtained by the Municipality of Public Land Concession for Special Initiatives was used to initiate a new restorative effort. Description These two fountains are considered masterpieces among Mannerist sculptures for their beauty and balance, using contemporary marine symbology (such as seashells, fish, legendary monsters, garlands of shellfish and algae, and masks) alongside traditional maritime themes and symbols. As emphasized, for example, by Giuseppe Richa in Notizie Istoriche delle chiese fiorentine (XVIII secolo), it was unconventional that sprays of water would not be directed upwards, but sometimes come out from mouths of the monsters directed downwards. Pietro Tacca's signature (PETRUS TACC F.) can be found on both fountains; this is most easily read with one's back to the basilica.

Background As reported by William Ruhlmann of AllMusic, the album was released without Mason's approval. Its release by Blue Thumb was prompted by the dispute between it and Mason, a dispute that started midway during the recording of Mason's previous album.

Part of the Spring Campaign, the siege began on 4 May 1849 and ended with the Hungarian capture of the castle by assault on 21 May. Actually it was the only fortress in the whole war to be taken by storm by the besiegers on either side. All the rest only capitulated after agreements between besiegers and besieged. The siege of Buda was also the shortest siege of the war (18 days). The senseless bombardment of Pest by Major General Heinrich Hentzi, the Austrian commander, destroyed the classicist buildings on the shores of the Danube, but other parts of the capitals also suffered heavy damage because of the artillery duels between the two sides. The capture of Buda Castle completed the liberation of the Hungarian capital cities (Buda and Pest). Thanks to this, the second Hungarian revolutionary Government led by Bertalan Szemere together with Governor-President Lajos Kossuth returned from Debrecen, the interim capital of the Hungarian revolution, to the real capital of Hungary. On 21 May 1849, the same day as the capture of Buda, the two emperors Franz Joseph I of Austria and Tsar Nicholas I of Russia signed the final treaty which agreed on the intervention in Hungary of 200,000 Russian soldiers (and an 80,000-strong reserve force, in case they were needed), in order to help the Austrian Empire to crush the Hungarian revolution.  Towards Vienna or to Buda?  After the relief of Komárom from the imperial siege, and the retreat of the Habsburg forces to the Hungarian border, the Hungarian army had two choices as to where to continue its advance.. One was to march on Pozsony and Vienna, in order to finally force the enemy to fight on his own ground; the other was to return eastwards and retake Buda Castle, which was held by a strong imperial garrison of 5,000 men under the command of Heinrich Hentzi. The first choice was supported mainly by the chief of the general staff, Lieutenant-Colonel József Bayer, and initially by Görgei; the second option's main proponent was General György Klapka, commanding I Corps.. The main reason for the first plan as supported initially by Görgei was the threat of Russian intervention. The Hungarian commander thought that his army had more chance of success if it could destroy the Austrian imperial army before the Tzar's troops arrived. Artúr Görgei However, Görgei was quickly convinced by those who wanted to liberate the castle of Buda first. So he changed his mind and supported the second choice. The reason was that although the first seemed very attractive, it would have been nearly impossible for it to succeed. While the Hungarian army gathered before Komárom had fewer than 27,000 men, the imperial army awaiting them around Pozsony and Vienna had 75,633, of which its effective combat strength was 54,443 with 237 guns, so it was twice the size of Görgei's force.Hermann Róbert, Buda bevétele, 1849. május 21, Budapesti Negyed 29–30. (2000/3-4) Furthermore, the Hungarian army was short of ammunition. On the other hand, capturing the Buda castle seemed more achievable at that moment, Klapka arguing that it was not suited to withstand a siege, and could be taken quickly with a surprise attack,. and besides it was also very important in many other respects. It could be achieved with the available Hungarian forces; a strong imperial garrison in the middle of the country could represent a major threat if the main Hungarian army wanted to move towards Vienna, because attacks from the castle could cut the Hungarian lines of communication, so it would need to be blockaded by a significant force in order to prevent such sorties. Also the fact that the only permanent bridge on the Hungarian part of the Danube (temporary pontoon bridges existed in many places), the Chain Bridge, was under the control of the imperial garrison in Buda Castle made it impossible to transport supplies to the Hungarian armies fighting in the West. Thus this real strategical importance underlined the need to take the castle as soon as possible. Furthermore, the presence of Josip Jelačić's corps in Southern Hungary made the Hungarian commanders think that the Croatian ban could advance towards Buda at any moment to relieve it, cutting Hungary in two. So the Hungarian staff understood that without taking the Buda Castle, the main army could not campaign towards Vienna without putting the country in grave danger, and that at that moment it was impossible to achieve victory against the numerically and technologically superior imperials gathered on the Western border of Hungary. This indicates that the arguments of those historians who wrote that Görgei made a mistake by not continuing the attack towards Vienna, because he had a great chance to take the Austrian capital and win the war before the Russian interventionBánlaky József: A magyar nemzet hadtörténete XXI, Buda visszavétele (1849. május elejétől végéig). Arcanum Adatbázis Kft. 2001. are wrong, and at that moment (before the arrival of the Hungarian reinforcements from the south) the only place which could bring a victory was the Castle of Buda. Beside the military arguments in favor of the siege of Buda, there were political ones too. After the declaration of the independence of Hungary, the Hungarian parliament wanted to convince foreign states to acknowledge Hungary's independence, and knew that there was more chance of achieving this after the total liberation of their capital city Buda-Pest. And the capital city also included the Buda castle. So the council of war held on 29 April 1849 decided to besiege and take Buda Castle, and then, after the arrival of reinforcements from southern Hungary, move to attack Vienna in order to force the empire to sue for peace and recognize the independence of Hungary.  The castle before the siege  Plan of Buda Castle The Turkish occupation of Buda ended on 2 September 1686, after a bloody siege by the Austrians. After that, the castle was the property of the Hungarian king (who was at the same time Holy Roman Emperor until 1804, and after that Austrian Emperor), and was defended by foreign (not Hungarian nationality) soldiers led by a foreign officer.. After the Hungarian revolution succeeded and the Batthyány Government was formed, the castle was still defended by foreign soldiers who had to recognize the Hungarian Government's authority. Because he did not want to do so, the commander of the garrison, Lieutenant General Karl Kress resigned and left on 11 May 1848. So too did those foreign units stationed in the castle who were against the Hungarian revolution, like the Italian 23rd infantry regiment, who clashed with the newly conscripted Hungarian soldiers on 11 June 1848, resulting in many deaths. After this conflict, on the orders of the Hungarian War Ministry, the Italian 23rd infantry regiment was withdrawn from Hungary.. Franz Joseph Sandman Buda and Pest in the 1840s. Seen from the Gellért Hill Following the Imperial campaign against Hungary led by Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz that began in mid-December 1848, the ensuing retreat of the Hungarian armies, and the Hungarian defeat in the Battle of Mór, the Habsburg troops entered the Hungarian capitals on 5 January 1849.. The free Hungarian parliament, the National Defense Committee (interim government of Hungary), and a long convoy of civilians with all their possessions fled through the cold and snowy winter east to the Tisza river, installing the interim capital at Debrecen.. The first thing Windisch-Grätz ordered after entering Buda was the occupation of the castle and the Gellért Hill. Windisch-Grätz named Lieutenant General Ladislas Wrbna as the commander of the Buda Military District, in other words the military commander of the imperial troops in the capitals. But at the end of February, when the commander-in-chief prepared to attack the Hungarian army, he took Wrbna with him on the campaign, leaving Major General Heinrich Hentzi, commander of the imperial garrison of the Castle of Buda, to take over command of the troops in Buda and Pest.. Castle of Buda on a Guild letter 1816 The people of Pest welcoming the first Hungarian Hussars who entered in Pest on 24th April 1849During April 1849 the main imperial force led by Field Marshal Windisch- Grätz suffered one defeat after another and retreated towards the western border of Hungary. The Hungarian victory of Nagysalló on 19 April had decisive results for the imperial occupation forces stationed in Hungary.. It opened the way towards Komárom, bringing its relief to within just a couple of days’ march. At the same time it put the imperials in the situation of being incapable of stretching their troops across the very large front which this Hungarian victory created, so instead of concentrating their troops around Pest and Buda as they had planned, Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden, Windisch-Grätz's replacement as the Imperial commander-in-chief in Hungary, had to order the retreat from Pest to avoid being caught by the Hungarian pincers. When he learned about the defeat at Nagysalló on the morning of 20 April, he wrote to Lieutenant General Balthasar Simunich, the commander of the force besieging Komárom, and to Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, the Minister- President of the Austrian Empire, that in order to secure Vienna and Pozsony, from Hungarian attack he was forced to retreat from Pest and even from Komárom.. He also wrote that the morale of the imperial troops was very low, and because of this they could not fight another battle for a while without suffering another defeat.. So the next day he ordered the evacuation of Pest, leaving an important garrison in the fortress of Buda to defend it against Hungarian attack. He ordered Jelačić to remain in Pest for a while, and then to retreat towards Eszék in Bácska where the Serbian insurgents allied with the Austrians were in a grave situation after the victories of the Hungarian armies led by Mór Perczel and Józef Bem.. On 24 April the last imperial soldiers left Pest. That same morning at 7 o'clock seven hussars, from the Hungarian II Corps entered the city, welcomed by the cheers of happy crowds of citizens who had been waiting so long to be liberated.. In Buda next day, Hentzi convened two meetings with his officers and declared that he would defend the Castle of Buda until his last breath.. Preparations for the defense of Buda The Castle of Buda, or as it is also known, the Upper Town of Buda (budai felsőváros) lies on a hill 167 meters above sea level, and 70 meters above the Danube which flows beneath it.. This so-called Castle Hill (Várhegy) has an oblong irregular shape of a sharp triangle with its tip towards the south and its base towards the north. Its length is 660 meters, and concerning its two edges, it is as it follows: on its northern, wider side with the Royal Palace is 156 meters high, while in its southern edge is 163 m high and 150 m wide. The castle hill is surrounded by suburbs, with the Danube to the east , Gellért Hill to the south Naphegy and Little Gellért Hill (Kis- Gellérthegy) to the southwest, Kissváb Hill (Kissvábhegy) to the west, and Rókus Hill (Rókushegy or Rézmál) to the northwest; also to the northwest are Ferenc Hill (Ferenchegy or Vérhalom) and Kálvária Hill (Kálvária-hegy) , and József Hill (Józsefhegy or Szemlőhegy) and Rózsa Hill (Rózsadomb) to the north. Across the Danube to the east there are no heights near the castle. The height of the walls surrounding the castle was not uniform. They were punctuated by old circular bastions, called rondellas, and newer, polygonal bastions, close enough together to enable them to bring fire to bear on enemy attacking the walls between them.. The fact that there were no moats, beneath the walls, and that the hill was surrounded by houses and gardens except for around the four castle gates, made the besiegers’ job easier. The castle's defenses were of 16th century standard, because the fortification modernization of later periods had almost no effect on this castle without exterior walls and defenses and consisting only of a \\"core fort\\". The most important defenses of the castle were its walls surrounding the edges of the Castle Hill. This wall was built in different periods, and was repaired in various ways in the 163 years between the sieges of 1686 and 1849. Because of this it was of different widths, without embrasures, protective structures, etc., and lacking the most elementary elements of modern siege technology. The gates were mostly vestiges of the past rather than real castle gates, lacking trenches or drawbridges. Comparing it with Hungarian castles like Arad, Temesvár, Komárom, Gyulafehérvár, Pétervárad or Eszék, it can be said that it was centuries behind these, and because of this the intention to defend it came as a surprise to many. But the imperials understood the importance of holding the Castle of Buda as long as they could, both for political and symbolic reasons as well because of having accumulated a huge store of military equipment there, and they did not want to give all of these up so easily. The Hungarian capitals Pest and Buda in 1850 (in German language). Districts of Buda (in German Ofen): – Festung (The Buda Castle), – Wasser-Stadt = Vízváros (Watertown), – Christina-Stadt = Krisztinaváros (Christinatown), – Land-Strasse = Országút (Main Road), – Raitzen-Stadt = Rácváros (Serbian Town). Hills: – St. Gerhards Block = Gellérthegy (Gellért Hill), – Sonnen Spiess = Naphegy (Sun Hill). The Gates of the Buda Castle: – Wasser Tor = Vízikapu (Water Gate), – Burg Tor = Várkapu (Castle Gate), – Weissbrg Tor = Fehérvári kapu (Székesfehérvár Gate), – Wiener Tor = Bécsi kapu (Vienna Gate), Other important locations during the siege: – Kettenbrücke = Lánchíd (Chain Bridge), – Köngl. Schloss = Budavári palota (Kings castle), – Georgi Platz = Szent György tér (St. George Square), – Fischer B. = Halászbástya (Fishermans Bastion), – Zeughaus = Fegyvertár (Arsenal), – Margarethen Insel = Margitsziget (Margaret Island) The strengthening of the castle of Buda in post-revolution Hungary started after Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelačić 's Croatian army entered Hungary to overthrow Lajos Batthyány's national Hungarian government and was advancing on the Hungarian capitals. But the first plans for this were drawn up after Jelačić had been defeated at Pákozd on 29 September 1848 and retreated from Hungary.. Although the enemy retreated, the fear he had caused made the Hungarians think about strengthening Buda and Pest. They carved out arms stores in the rock of the Gellért Hill.. At the beginning of October 1848, Artillery Lieutenant József Mack published a detailed plan to defend the capitals in the newspaper Kossuth Hírlapja (Kossuth's Gazette).. In this work Mack wrote that it was not true that the castle could not be defended, saying that with the 50 cannon in the castle any enemy could easily be kept at a distance. He claimed that enemy artillery could only threaten the castle from Gellért Hill, and that with just six 24-pdr cannon he could prevent anyone from installing their batteries there.. He also said that the cannon could prevent enemy rocket batteries from burning down the city. As for the forces necessary to hold the castle, Mack stated that 2,500 soldiers and 300 artillerymen would be enough. In the autumn of 1848 the Hungarian patriotic militiamen formed an artillery corps, and received a battery of 6-pdr guns. He also wrote that the cannons can prevent also the enemy rocket batteries to burn down the city. About the necessary forces to hold the castle Mack wrote that 2500 soldiers and 300 artillerymen are enough. In the Autumn of 1848 the Hungarian patriotic militiamen formed an artillery corp, and received a battery made of guns of 6 pounds.. In December 9 cannon and 2 howitzers arrived which, according to an inscription on one of them, were made in 1559. Some of these cannon would be actually used in the defense of the castle in May 1849. The Chain Bridge in Buda 1847 with the castle in the background, by Sámuel Lehnhardt When the victorious Hungarian Spring Campaign began, especially after their defeat in the Battle of Isaszeg, the imperial commanders started to be more and more concerned about the defense of the capitals and of Buda Castle. Hentzi prepared a plan for the defence of the capitals, and after this was criticized because it did not include Buda Castle, he quickly made another one.. But this plan was also criticized by Colonel Trattnern, the director of imperial military engineering, criticisms which were later proved to be justified.. Hentzi thought that the cannon in the 1st to 4th rondellas (the circular bastions) needed almost no protective entrenchments; that the gates were well protected by the artillery which could easily prevent enemy artillery positioning itself before them; that the curtain wall of the castle was so strong that 12-pdr cannon could not damage it, so it was unnecessary to make earth revetments around it; that an enemy attack on the Chain Bridge could easily be stopped with gunfire; that there was no need for shell-proof shelters because the Hungarians had no mortars; that Svábhegy was too far from the castle to be dangerous, contrary to the side of the Royal Palace, which is close to the Little Gellért Hill.. In mid-April, there were some indications that the imperials would retreat from Pest, such as the return of cotton sandbags to the inhabitants which had previously been commandeered in order to build defenses around the town.. On the other hand, Welden wrote a letter to Hentzi in which he ordered him to defend the Danube line, or at least Buda castle for as long as \\"the condition of the defensive features of the castle [walls, bastions] and of your food supply makes it possible\\".. The commander-in-chief noted that Hentzi should respond to attacks and gun fire coming from the direction of Pest with bullets and grapeshot only, so as to spare the splendid buildings of the city, giving him permission to use roundshot and shell only if the population of Pest behaved in an unacceptable manner towards the imperials. But Hentzi did not respect this order, and bombarded Pest, destroying the Classicist styled buildings on the shores of the Danube, and others in Pest, despite the fact that the inhabitants did nothing to provoke him, and despite a personal request from Görgei in this regard.. Welden's letter informs Hentzi that the food supply of the castle is enough for 6 weeks and there is enough ammunition for the defense. It also states that any cannon to be found in Buda and Pest must be brought into the castle, the waterworks which enabled the defenders to be supplied with water from the Danube must be strengthened with firing platforms for cannon, and the palisades on the left bank of the Danube must be removed because they could be advantageous for the enemy.. Heinrich Hentzi, captain of the castle's defending army Major General Heinrich Hentzi (1785–1849) was an experienced officer with deep knowledge of engineering, so he was qualified to lead the technical and logistical preparations for the defense of the castle.. He actually started these preparations in January 1849, after he was appointed to lead the repair of its fortifications, having presented himself to Field Marshal Windisch-Grätz when he occupied the capitals. In the winter of 1849 Hentzi carried out the construction of the works protecting the ends of the Chain Bridge and the palisade from the left end of the Chain Bridge and the Újépület (New Building). But after finishing those, the work stopped because the money ran out. On 24 April, when Jelačić's corps left the capitals for southern Hungary, Hentzi burned the pontoon bridge across the Danube. He then ordered the people who lived in the castle to store enough food and water for two months; those who could not do so had to leave. Over the next few days, until 3 May, Hentzi gathered beef cattle and other food for his soldiers, made enough ammunition for the infantry and artillery, and strengthened the fortifications of the castle. Under his command the engineering captains Pollini and Gorini supervised the work of 200 soldiers and of many laborers from the capitals and from the Swabian villages around them to strengthen the weak points of the fortifications, paying them a salary. They also made parapets and overhead cover for the cannon. Hentzi also ordered the manufacture of ammunition. Hentzi decreed that the Waterworks of Buda which supplied the castle with water from Danube should be fortified with palisades both north and south, to be defended by his soldiers, and a defensive work in what is now Clark Ádám Place, in which they could take cover.. He named a chevau-léger captain to be the leader of the firemen, and in order so far as possible to prevent fire breaking out during the siege, he ordered residents of the castle to remove all flammable material from their attics. He designated a detachment of pioneers to be ready to remove any grenade or bombs that might land on houses, to prevent greater damage. The northern fortification of the waterworks was around the pumping station allowing observation of the Chain Bridge to prevent an attack from there. Hentzi ordered that the planks which enabled crossing the unfinished bridges should be removed.. He also ordered that 4 so-called Rambart boxes, filled with 400 kg of gunpowder, should be put on the iron beams which led to the piers of the bridge. These 4 boxes were linked by wooden tubes in which was put tinder. In order to make the explosion of the chests more destructive, big stones were put in them. The southern fortification of the waterworks ensured the defense of the aqueduct which supplied the Royal Palace with water. Hentzi positioned his troops in the castle and outside, around the Waterworks and the end of the Chain Bridge, in the following way: – 3rd Battalion, 5th Border Guard Infantry Regiment: the defense line linking the barricade covering Víziváros (Water City), the Waterworks Fortress, and the promenade known as Ellipszis. – 3rd Battalion, 12th (Archduke Wilhelm) Infantry Regiment: the defensive work at the Buda end of the Chain Bridge, the barricade at the Vízikapu (Watergate), the houses numbered 80–85 used in the defense of the Waterworks Fortress, the Royal Palace, the stairs leading to the Castle from the lower barricade, and the lower part of the Palace Garden. – 3rd Battalion, 10th (Ban's) Infantry Regiment: Vienna Gate; Bastions I, II., V. and VII; circular bastion I. with a grenade thrower sentry post, and the sentry post below the Royal Palace, on the curtain wall, looking towards Krisztinaváros. – 1st Battalion, 23rd (Ceccopieri) Infantry Regiment: the Palace Gate, before the barricade at the gate at Vízikapu, by the grenade throwing sentry post between circular bastions I. and II., and also small detachments at the Nádor- barrack, at the so-called Country House (országház), at the military depot, at the town hall and at the meat factory. – 1st (Lieutenant-Colonel's) Squadron, 1st (Archduke John) dragoon regiment: one troop stationed in a shed down to the left of the Palace gate, the other in the Gróf Sándor house.. The two battalions from the Waterworks Fortress, together with one of the troops of dragoons, were used as pickets outside Buda, towards Óbuda and the vineyards of the Buda hills.. Before the siege, Hentzi had 85 guns altogether: the 57 he received from Welden, and another 28 which he retrieved and repaired. He placed these strategically as follow: – Rondella I: two 6-pdr, two 12-pdr, and one 19-pdr cannon; one 10-pdr howitzer, – Rondella II: three 12-pdr cannon, – Rondella III: one 3-pdr, two 12-pdr cannon, – Rondella IV: one 3-pdr, three 12-pdr cannon, – Bastion V:one 10-pdr howitzer, – Rondella VI: one 6-pdr, one 12-pdr, and one 18-pdr cannon, – Vienna Gate: one 6-pdr cannon, – Bastion VII: one 18-pdr and two 24-pdr cannon; three 10-pdr mortars, – Bastion VIII: two 12-pdr, one 18-pdr cannon; two 10-pdr howitzers, – Bastion IX, or Fisherman's Bastion (Halászbástya): four 60-pdr mortars, – Watergate: one 3-pdr cannon – Bastion X: two 12-pdr cannon; three 60-pdr mortars, – front facade of the Military Depot (Hadiszertár): three 30-pdr, three 60-pdr mortars, – Bastion XI: two 12-pdr cannon, – Upper terrace: two 24-pdr cannon; two 10-pdr howitzers; two 10-pdr mortars, four 60-pdr mortars, – Middle terrace: one 10-pdr howitzer, – Lower terrace: three 12-pdr, two 18-pdr cannon, – Main guardroom: two 3-pdr cannon, – Northern Waterworks Fortress: three 6-pdr cannon; one 7-pdr howitzer, – Southern Waterworks Fortress: four 6-pdr cannon; one 7-pdr howitzer, – Ellipsz: twelve wall guns.. Four 3-pdr, three 12-pdr and one 18-pdr cannon and a destroyer battery were kept in reserve.. The Hungarian march to Buda and preparations for the siege After the relief of Komárom on 26 April, and the Hungarian commanders’ council of war's decision of 29 April to besiege Buda, I. Corps departed from Komárom towards Buda next day. Formerly led by General János Damjanich, it was now commanded by General József Nagysándor, who took his excellent predecessor's place, because of an accident to the latter which rendered him unable to serve.. This departure was in accordance with the orders issued the same day by the High Command of the Hungarian army, requiring all the designated troops to do so.. Over the next few days, of the Hungarian forces stationed at Komárom, III. Corps also marched to Buda, while VII. Corps moved west to Győr, to observe the movements of the imperial armies on the western border of Hungary.. General Lajos Aulich ’s II. Corps, whose troops were mainly on the eastern banks of the Danube, also received the order to cross to the other bank to participate in the encirclement of Buda castle, as did György Kmety's division at Esztergom. Although the main Hungarian force moved towards Buda, they brought no heavy siege artillery with them, only field artillery, which unfortunately was not very effective in sieges. It seems that Görgei and the other Hungarian commanders thought Hentzi had not yet finished fortifying the castle for the siege, and that it could easily be occupied with a surprise attack if they arrived there quickly.So the Hungarian army corps hurried to Buda, not wanting to be slowed down by the heavy artillery. This mistake by Görgei prolonged the siege for many days, which could have been used for preparations for the offensive on the western front,. because Hentzi strengthened the castle in time which made it impossible to take it without heavy siege artillery[This doesn't make sense. If Gorgei was already hurrying, how could he ever have got there before Hentzi finished fortifying it? Could he have got the siege artillery there any quicker? What preparations could he have made if he had not hurried?]. The Hungarian main body reached Buda on 4 May and gathered on the western bank of the river, surrounding the castle. Only Szekulits's division of II. Corps remained on the eastern side. The Hungarian units deployed as follows: – Kmety's division northeast of the castle, next to the Danube in the Víziváros quarter of Buda, – On Kmety's right, northwest of the castle was General Károly Knezić’s III. Corps, in the sector between Kálvária Hill and Kissváb Hill, – General József Nagysándor's I. Corps was deployed between Kissváb Hill and Little Gellért Hill, – The sector between Little Gellért Hill and the Danube was occupied by II. Corps under General Lajos Aulich,. The Hungarians started to deploy their field artillery on the heights surrounding the castle: the Gellért Hill (one 6/12 pounds battery of 7 cannons[Your map shows “six 6-pdr cannon, one 7-pdr howitzer”]), on Naphegy (half a rocket battery: 4 rocket stands), Kissváb Hill (one 12 pounds battery of 7 cannons[Your map shows “two 7-pdr and two 10-pdr howitzers, three 12-pdr cannon”]), Kálvária Hill and Kis-Rókus Hill (one battery of eleven 7-pdr howitzers spread across the two).. The battery closest to the castle was the one on Naphegy, 600–700 meters away.[47] Altogether 5 batteries of artillery were deployed on the hills near the castle (25 cannons and 4 rocket stands).. On 4 May Görgei sent a captured Austrian officer as a messenger to ask Hentzi to surrender, proposing him a fair captivity. He argued that the castle was not suited to withstand a siege.. Görgei also promised not to attack the castle from the side facing Pest, but that if Hentzi fired his artillery at Pest he would show no mercy and would have all prisoners executed after capturing the castle.. Additionally, Görgei appealed to Hentzi's supposed Magyar sympathies (Hentzi having been born in Debrecen), but Hentzi replied that his loyalty was to the Kaiser. In the same reply, Hentzi also argued that the castle could be defended, and threatened Görgei, demanding that Görgei not attack the castle with artillery from any direction, or else Hentzi would destroy the city of Pest with a huge bombardment. Siege György Kmety by Károly Brocky Attack against the water defenses After receiving this negative response from Hentzi, Görgei ordered his artillery to start bombarding the castle. But the defenders responded to this bombardment with even heavier fire, forcing the Hungarian batteries to change position in order not to be destroyed.. This showed that for the moment the Hungarian field artillery was too weak against the imperial cannon. Another problem was that the Hungarian artillery did not have enough ammunition. On 6 May General József Nagysándor wrote in his report that the ammunition had run out, and he was forced to cease bombarding the castle. He also wrote that if he did not receive the rockets and shells he requested, he would not be able to attack the aqueduct. In reality these weapons were already in Pest, having been sent via Szolnok by rail, but they were mislaid in Pest, and were only found a week later. Buda may 4 On 4 May Görgey sent Colonel György Kmety to attack the water defenses between Castle Hill and the Danube, being the only place outside the castle still occupied by the imperials, because if those fell into the hands of the Hungarians, that would have threatened the Austrian defenders’ water supply. Kmety's order was to burn the Waterworks, which was surrounded by ramparts made of log piles. The Hungarian colonel led two battle-hardened battalions, the 10th and the 33rd, supported by two 6-pdr cannon. When they approached the imperial defenses, Kmety's troops came under heavy artillery fire from the side, from the Austrian units positioned on the Fisherman's Bastion and on the Joseph Bastion, and in front from the defenders of the Watergate, the entrance to the Waterworks. Despite this, the 10th battalion reached the rampart, but there the defenders unleashed grapeshot and an intense fusillade upon them, which forced them to retreat. Furthermore, Kmety and many of his soldiers were injured in this assault. During the retreat the battalion disintegrated, and the soldiers sought refuge in the houses nearby. Supported by rockets and 6-pdr cannon fire, Kmety repeated the attack with the 33rd battalion too, but again without success. The Hungarian losses were heavy. The attacking troops lost around 100 men,. among which the 10th battalion alone lost 1/3 of its men: 37 jägers, 5 warrant officers and 3 officers were dead or injured. After this Kmety reported to Görgey that it was impossible to take the Waterworks, because the imperial cannon in the castle dominated the road to it, causing heavy losses to the attackers and preventing any chance of success. During the attack on the Waterworks Görgei ordered a cannonade against the castle from the surrounding hills, but the fire of the imperial artillery from the castle silenced the Hungarian batteries on Kis-Rókus Hill and Naphegy Hill. Before the arrival of the siege artillery The failure of the attack on the Waterworks showed that the castle could not be taken by escalade, because of the great firepower of the imperial artillery and infantry, but only by breaching the walls of the castle with heavy siege artillery. This failure also made clear to Görgei that the conquest of the castle would not be an easy task, but would necessitate a long siege, conducted with heavy siege weapons which the besieging troops lacked (they only had light field artillery). So he wrote to Richard Guyon, the commander of the fortress of Komárom, and ordered him to send siege guns from there. On 6 May General Guyon sent 5 cannon capable of breaching the walls (four 24-pdrs, one 18-pdr), which arrived on 9 to 10 May, but without almost no ammunition.. The shore of the Danube by Pest in 1837 1 before its destruction in 1849. By Carl Vasquez-Pinas von LöwenthalThe shore of the Danube by Pest in 1837, before its destruction in 1849, 2. By Carl Vasquez-Pinas von LöwenthalBuda may 5–16In spite of all Görgei's solicitations, Guyon was reluctant to send the other siege guns to Buda, arguing that this would leave Komárom defenseless, despite the fact that these weapons were not actually part of the fortress's arsenal, because they were just captured from the imperials a few days earlier (26 April) in the Battle of Komárom.. The English-born general only sent the rest of the siege cannons towards Buda after he was asked to do so by Governor Lajos Kossuth.. While they waited for the arrival of the siege cannon from Komárom, Görgei ordered the construction of firing positions for a breaching battery and a field gun battery on (\\"Sun Hill\\"), one of the hills in Buda, because he considered that the I. (Fehérvár) rondella, facing in that direction, was the weakest point of the castle. The field gun battery was to cover the siege battery against fire from the castle. The batteries were more or less completed by 14 May, and the guns deployed in the early hours of the 16th. During the wait for the siege artillery, Görgei ordered feint night attacks against the castle to keep the enemy busy and to divert Hentzi's attention from his plans. Each army corps had to use four battalions, and the Kmety division two, for these attacks. The days of 5–7 The days of 5–7 May passed with desultory artillery fire by both sides. The besieging army was by no means inactive in the period between 5 and 16 May. In the early hours of 5 May, Kmety's forces again approached the water defenses, whereupon Hentzi started to bombard the Water City (Víziváros), showing again that he had no concern for the lives of the civilian inhabitants, and the Hungarians withdrew.. On the 10th, an epidemic of cholera and typhus broke out among the defenders. On the night of 10–11 May, Hentzi ordered a sortie to rescue the wounded and sick Austrians from the Víziváros hospitals. A border guard company and a sapper detachment took part. The first attempt was beaten back, but when the imperial troops led by Captain Schröder tried again in greater force at 7 am, they were successful, liberating 300 sick Austrian soldiers, and causing heavy losses to Kmety's troops stationed there. On 12 May the action continued with minor skirmishes, and on the 13th with an artillery duel. At first, Hentzi paid no attention to the construction of the siege batteries by the Hungarians, and put all of his effort into fulfilling his pledge to fire on Pest. His rage against the buildings and the population of Pest was not tempered even by a delegation of the people of Buda, who begged him to stop the destruction of Pest, saying that if he did not accept this they would leave the castle. Hentzi replied that they could leave the castle if they wished, but threatened that he would bombard Pest with explosive and incendiary projectiles if the Hungarian army did not stop the siege. Next day around 300 citizens left the castle of Buda. Unfortunately Hentzi kept his promise and firing went on nearly every day from 4 May onwards, and became particularly intense on 9 and 13 May, resulting in the burning and destruction of the beautiful neoclassical buildings of the Al-Dunasor (Lower Danube Row).. The population of Pest fled from the bombardment to outside the city. Hentzi's attack on the civilian buildings and the population was contrary to the rules of war, and was condemned by the Hungarian commanders. On the 13th Görgei wrote a letter to Governor Kossuth about the destruction caused by Hentzi's senseless bombardment of Pest: Rudolf von Alt – Lower Danube Row in Pest 1847, before its destruction in May 1849 by the cannons of Hentzi Last night commander Hentzi fulfilled his promise gruesomely. With well-aimed shots he managed to set the splendid Danube Row on fire in several places. Helped by the strong wind, the fire spread rapidly, and reduced the most beautiful part of Pest to ashes. – It was a terrible sight! The whole city was covered by a sea of flames, and the burning bombshells showered like a rain of stars, thundering grimly in the swirling smoke, onto the poor town. It is impossible to describe this sight accurately; but in this whole phenomenon I saw the burning of the torch lit for the funeral feast of the dying Austrian dynasty, because for those in this country who had the smallest consideration for this perfidious dynasty, yesterday's events obliterated it forever. This is why although I mourn the destruction of the capital city with all my heart, this outrageous act of the enemy, which I was powerless to prevent and which I did nothing to provoke, will make me try with all my power to avenge it by making even greater efforts to besiege the castle, and I feel it my most sacred duty to liberate the capital as soon as possible from this monstrous enemy.. Bombardment of Pest 1849 The 17-year-old Hungarian soldier Emil Büttner wrote in his letter about the \\"beauty\\" of the gruesome spectacle of the nocturnal artillery and rocket duel which caused such huge destruction to Pest and Buda: This offers us a gruesomely beautiful spectacle, when every night the shellfire begins, the whole area is on fire, the mortars firing their bombs flash here and there, followed each time by a hollow murmur. The sparkling bomb whizzes through the sky like a fiery dragon, often you can see as many as 8–10 of them in the air at the same time, and every one of them is followed by a howling 24-pounder [bomb]. Many of those that were poorly targeted explode in the air, and the flames pour out of their ripped orbs like squeezed lightning, followed every time by a horrible crack, their fragments whirr with different noises, dispersing in every direction, smashing and crushing whatever stands in their way. What kind of roaring and growling causes the constant howling of the cannon, the bursting shells and bombs of the enemy, and the unceasing salvoes from our guns from every direction? You can imagine they are a bit like the thunder heard sometimes in great thunderstorms. Büttner writes the following thoughts about the sight of the rockets used by the two armies, which were a relatively recent military innovation: The damages caused by the bombardment of Pest by the imperials: Lower Danube Row I never saw anything more beautiful. The many rockets slashed crackling through the air like fiery snakes, blistering and sparkling on their way, and if they fell through a window or roof, they lit up the surroundings in the most beautiful way, then after they burst they set fire to everything that was flammable. Görgei wanted to retaliate to the Austrian bombardment of Pest and avenge this destructive attack. He ordered the three huge telescopes from the observatory from the Gellért Hill to be brought to his headquarters, and posted his officers to observe through them. If Hentzi appeared on the walls of the castle, then one of his officers who had a very loud voice used a huge tin megaphone to tell the artillery officers on Kis-Svábhegy Hill where to fire their cannon. Although they did not manage to kill the Austrian commander, they came close many times, forcing Hentzi and his officers to run down from the walls. After that Hentzi showed himself as rarely as possible on the castle's defensive walls and bastions, and when he did so, he did not stand still for long, finishing his inspections very quickly. In the night of 14 May, Hentzi tried to destroy the pontoon bridge from the Csepel Island by floating 5 fireships and two vessels loaded with stones down the river, but because of the lack of sappers charged with this task, only one vessel was lit before they released them into the stream.. But these ships did not float down the middle of the river current as expected but close to the shore, where they were spotted by the Hungarian sappers at the Rudas Baths, who then approached them by boat and towed them to the shore. The real siege begins After the arrival of the heavy siege artillery, the Hungarian army could finally win superiority over the defenders’ artillery, and on 16 May the real bombardment of the castle began. After the installation of the siege cannon, the Hungarian artillery deployed for an effective siege in the following way: – In Pest at the Ullmann tobacco warehouse: half a 6-pdr battery, – On Margaret Island half a 6-pdr battery, – At the port for steamboats from Óbuda: half a 6-pdr battery. This was tasked with preventing any activity by the Nádor steamboat, which was in Austrian hands, – Bomba Square: one 6-pr and one 7-pdr howitzer, – In the first Kálvária Hill position: one 6-pdr battery, Buda may 16–20 – In the second Kálvária (Calvary) Hill position: some 12-pdr cannon and six 10-pdr howitzers, – At the Vienna Gate brick factory: two 60-pdr mortars, – Kissváb Hill: a battery of 12-pdr and 18-pdr cannon, with a furnace to heat the cannonballs, – On the left side of Naphegy Hill: one breaching battery of 24-pdr cannon, – On the right side of Naphegy Hill: some 12-pdr and 18-pdr cannon in 16 platforms behind a trench, – Along the Calvary stations on the road to Gellért Hill: four 18-pdr cannon, – On the crest of Gellért Hill: two 24-pdr cannon and a furnace to heat the cannonballs, – On the slope of Gellért Hill towards Rácváros: four 18-pdr and two 60-pdr mortars, – On Gellért Hill on the road to the Calvary: one 10-pdr howitzer, – On Gellért Hill, 200 paces down, near a vineyard: one 10-pdr howitzer, – To the left of that: one 12-pdr battery, – In a dug-out near the highest Calvary station: two 60-pdr bomb mortars, – Behind parapets near the Danube, level with the Rudas Baths: one 12-pdr cannon and a 10-pdr howitzer, – In Rácváros, at the Zizer house: one 24-pdr cannon.. With these cannon, together with those the army had before, at last the Hungarians could shoot cannonballs inside the castle, constantly disturbing the defenders’ rest and their troop movements.. The siege artillery finally started its work on 16 May, shooting at the walls but also at buildings within the castle reported by spies to be the depots and barracks of the enemy troops. Continuous firing began at 4 o'clock in the morning and went on until 6 o'clock in the afternoon. By next day had the section of wall south of the Fehérvár Rondella had been breached. 16 May was when Hentzi sensed that the siege was reaching a critical stage. He realized that the main Hungarian attack would not come from the east against the Waterworks, but from the west, against the breach created by the Hungarian artillery at the Fehérvár rondella.. In his council of war that night, he proposed continuing to bombard of Pest, but engineering captain Philipp Pollini objected, arguing that it would be better to fire on the Hungarian artillery, in order to try to destroy them. The council accepted Pollini's plan, so at 18:30 all the cannon which had been withdrawn earlier to protect them from the Hungarian artillery were sent back to the walls to duel with the Hungarian cannon.. Firing continued into the evening, and one round set fire to the roof of the palace. In revenge, Hentzi fired on Pest again next day. Transporting of the wounded at the siege of Buda This so enraged Görgey that he ordered his forces to carry out a reconnaissance in force in the early hours of 18 May, and if the action was sufficiently successful it would be converted into a full assault. I. Corps was to attack the breach in the Fehérvár Rondella, III. Corps to scale the IV. rondella with ladders, and Kmety's division was to make a demonstration attack against the Waterworks. The attack failed. Firstly, the approach to the walls was hindered by a system of obstacles put in place by the castle garrison. Secondly, the breach was not large enough to be climbed, and the ladders brought by the soldiers were too short. In the dark, the soldiers of I. Corps lost their way towards the breach, and when they finally found it, it was already dawn, so they were spotted by the defenders, targeted by grapeshot and a hail of bullets, and forced to retreat. III. corps attacked from the north and climbed the walls with their ladders, but the defenders repelled the attack, causing 34 dead and the loss of 21 ladders. Also the house which was the 65th battalion's base was set on fire by the enemy artillery, so the Hungarian soldiers could not retreat into it but had to run away across open ground under fire from the defenders. The 9th battalion had orders to fire on the defenders from the windows and roofs of the houses in Attila Street. The other battalions of III. corps gathered in the nearby houses and tried to climb the walls on ladders, but because the ladders were too short, this attack too was unsuccessful. The soldiers of the 9th battalion were so busy firing on the enemy that they did not hear their comrades retreat, so they were trapped in the houses when dawn arrived, and could not retreat next day because the defenders immediately fired on any who tried to come out of the houses. II. corps attacked the Waterworks with the bayonet, but was repelled. Kmety's troops also attacked the Waterworks, reaching the Watergate, but here they were halted and forced to engage in a futile firefight with the enemy. Bombardment and assault of the Castle of Buda 1849, by Károly Klette The causes of the failure were many: the troops were not coordinated enough, they did not receive clear instructions about when to turn the demonstration attack into a real one, or about the length of the ladders. In his memoirs Görgei acknowledges that the failure is mainly his fault, because he did not check beforehand whether the breach was large enough to be passable. He wrote that he ordered the attack rashly because he was angry about Hentzi's bombardment of Pest, and wanted to punish him by taking the castle as quick as possible. The shortness of the siege ladders also contributed to the failure. The Hungarians lost around 200 men in this abortive attack. After the attack Görgei asked for more ladders, which arrived from Pest a day later, on 19 May. On 18 May Hentzi tried to fill the breach created by the Hungarian artillery near the Fehérvár rondella, but a downpour during the night washed away the whole barrier. A battery was set up on the Fehérvár Rondella, which succeeded in temporarily silencing two Hungarian guns on 19 May, but the breach grew ever wider, to 30m/90ft wide, becoming unfillable. That night, another attempt was made to block the gap, but heavy artillery fire and musketry from the Hungarian side prevented the imperial engineers from doing an effective job. A sapper unit of Hungarian II. Corps managed to break into the Várkert (Castle Garden, next to the southern tip of the Castle walls and the Waterworks) through a house which had a wall in common with the Castle Garden, and a Hungarian Honvéd company sneaked in, and despite all the efforts of the defenders, could not be forced to retreat. On 20 May Hentzi again ordered that the breach by the Fehérvár rondella be filled, but although the sappers made a improvised parapet on top of the breach, the gap itself could not be filled, because the Hungarian artillery kept it under heavy fire. However, an eventual attack against the breach was not an easy task, because the imperial artillery on the I. rondella could bring fire to bear on the entrance to the breach and the area around it. During these actions engineering captain Philipp Pollini, who led the vain efforts to barricade the gap, was killed by Hungarian fire. Seeing the intensification of the Hungarian siege, and the effectiveness of the Hungarian artillery, the defenders’ morale fell. An Austrian deserter told the Hungarians that: ... the soldiers in the castle are depressed, wanting to escape from the siege. After the failure of the assault on the night of 17–18 May, Görgey ordered a detachment of a few companies to harass the defenders every night until 2 am. At 2 o'clock all the firing stopped. Görgei's plan was to make the defenders believe that after 2 am they would be safe and could rest until morning.. Then, on 20 May, he issued the order to storm the castle. On the night of 20 to 21 May, the Hungarian artillery bombarded the castle until 2 o'clock in morning as usual, then stopped.. Final assault The decisive assault was to start at 3 am on 21 May after every piece of ordnance had fired on the castle from every direction. Before the assault Görgei tried to raise the soldiers’ morale by promising a reward to whichever soldier took Hentzi prisoner. After the sudden bombardment of the imperial defenders, who thought at 2 o'clock that there would be no more fighting until the morning, the Hungarian attack began as follows: II. Corps, led by General Lajos Aulich, assaulted from the south.. Three battalions attacked the southern Palace Gardens (Palotakert), while two stormed the Waterworks. The other units of the corps remained in reserve. The soldiers of II Corps soon penetrated the castle via the large garden at the west wall. Not having ladders, they climbed the walls on each other's shoulders. The attackers entered by ladders at the Ferdinand Gate and over the rubble of the destroyed wall on the east side facing the Danube. Here, the imperial soldiers were soon surrounded and laid down their weapons.. Kmety's division had the task of capturing the Waterworks from the north, sending three battalions and a jäger company to carry out the initial assault. August von Pettenkofen – Siege of Buda But the main events occurred on the northern and western sides of the castle where the Hungarian I. and III. Corps attacked. Siege of Buda: Attack against the gap, by It was two battalions of I. Corps two battalions of I Corps led by General József Nagysándor in person that started the attack on the northern side, charging into the breach, while four battalions attacked the terraces on the southwest side of Castle Hill. The rest of I. Corps remained in reserve. The 28th, 44th and 47th Battalions led by Nagysándor advanced undetected right up to the breach, where they were spotted by the surprised defenders, who however resisted fiercely, stopping the Hungarians for a while, with the help of concentrated fire from front and flanks from the Austrian soldiers on the walls and bastions nearby. Then Nagysándor ordered the 3rd Battalion of the 39th (Don Miguel) Infantry Regiment, and part of the 17th Battalion as well, to come up from reserve and join the attack. The covering fire of the Hungarian artillery caused the defenders huge losses, and thanks to this and the determination of the attackers, Col. János Máriássy, one of the I. Corps divisional commanders, managed to lead two battalions through the castle gardens against the flank of the Austrians holding the breach, and thus enabled the main assault to get through.. During the charge the Hungarian soldiers lived through infernal scenes: It was horrible to watch, at the foot of the bastion, how the grapeshot swept away 3 or 4 [soldiers] at once, how the enemy cannonballs, fired from the other side, swept away entire ranks, how the bursting shells ripped out their intestines, tore off the hands, legs and heads from many of them. You could see here legs, hands, fragments of skull lying on the ground, dead men's intestines hanging down, blood and marrow dripping down from many of the ladders around the walls, many of them [the Hungarian soldiers] were struck dead by pieces of blown-up ladders, others by grenades with burning fuzes dropped or thrown down and then bouncing [in every direction] from the walls onto the crowd below, and others by pieces of stone and bricks smashed off the walls by cannonballs. At this point Col. Máriássy fell down for a couple of minutes because a blast hit him, and a cannonball smashed three ladders, which made his troops retreat. The siege of Buda, by Anton Strassgschwandtner But the 400 Hungarians who were already on the walls started to yell and wave Hungarian flags, urging them to continue the attack and not leave them to fall into the hands of the enemy. Then Máriássy regained consciousness, rallied his men and led them, supported also by the 6th Battalion, against the enemy who were already starting to topple the ladders. When they started to climb the ladders, the enemy soldiers (who were of Italian origin) decided to surrender, and reached out their hands in order to help them climb up. The Hungarian losses in the assault were heavy: among many others, Major Burdina fell, the commander of the Don Miguel regiment. Siege of Buda: Attack against the gap Other Italian soldiers among the imperial troops also preferred not to fight against the Hungarian soldiers, sympathizing with them because they understood the Hungarian cause, as their country was in revolt against the Austrian Empire as well. Because of this they were the first enemy troops to surrender when they saw the Hungarian soldiers approaching. For example, in the southwestern sector where the Palatine stables were, the soldiers of the 26th Battalion which scaled the walls on ladders and on bayonets stuck in between the bricks were welcomed by Italian soldiers shouting: \\"Evviva Ungheria!\\" (Long live Hungary!). After they entered the castle, the advancing Hungarians found around 30 imperial soldiers shot dead in a courtyard. One who was still alive told them that they had been shot by the Croatian soldiers. This probably happened because the imperial command or the Croatian soldiers themselves noticed that the Italians were reluctant to fight against the Hungarians. Thus the Hungarian troops entered through the breach. The first Hungarian flag was raised on the wall of Buda castle by Grácián Püspöky, the young standard-bearer of the 47th Honvéd Battalion. The first units to break into the castle through the gap were the 44th and 47th. Honvéd Battalions led by Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Driquet, and the \\"Don Miguel\\" infantry, supported by the fire of their comrades from the 34th and 17th Battalions, who climbed the wall east of the rondella, and by the 4th Battalion who fired down from behind them, and drove the defenders deeper and deeper into the streets of Buda castle. The Hungarians who entered the castle faced enemy infantry and artillery units at strategic points, who fired volleys and grapeshot at them, but they continued the assault, overwhelming, killing or capturing the imperial soldiers. During these events one battalion charged south,. Although the 6th Battalion under Captain Gergely Szalkay was supposed to protect the siege guns, when they saw the first assault repulsed they charged toward the castle. When they entered, at first they were pinned down around the stables by enemy fire. Szalkay ordered a charge which overcame the enemy opposition, occupying the arsenals and the Sándor Palace, then sent some of his troops onto the wall above the Waterworks to help Kmety's assault by firing on the enemy from the rear, and others to the armory south of Saint George Square to fire on the imperials who were in the Palatine Gardens defending the southern wall against II. Corps's attack. Szalkay then occupied the Palatine (Royal) Palace with the rest. Buda may 21 Siege of Buda 1849: Attack against the Vienna Gate The 63rd Battalion attacked the walls from Krisztinaváros. During the attack, the soldiers raising the ladders were wounded by the defenders’ fire, but when their comrades started to climb, the shots from above became fewer and fewer as the defenders abandoned the walls, seeing the Hungarians pouring into the castle through the breach, and retreated into the streets of Buda. Because they entered the castle after the main body had got in through the breach, the 63rd did not encounter serious resistance when they advanced towards Saint George Square (Szent György Tér). While I. and II. Corps were involved in this on the southern and western sides of the Castle, III. Corps attacked the wider northern side. The designated units of III. Corps (3rd and 42nd Honvéd Battalions, the 3rd Battalion of the 19th Infantry Regiment, and the 3rd Battalion of the 60th Infantry Regiment), led by General Károly Knezić, mounted an assault on the northern castle wall, the Vienna Gate and the Esztergom Rondella, supported by the 9th Battalion firing from houses in Attila street, while III. Corps's reserves waited between the Városmajor and the brick factory. The attackers tried to scale the Vienna Gate and the neighboring stretch of wall, and 30 Hungarian soldiers fell in this fight. The men of the 42nd Battalion were the first to climb the walls and enter, while the 3rd Battalion broke into the castle at the Vienna Gate. Then after the first troops had entered the castle, the 9th Battalion joined them, climbing the ladders near the Vienna Gate, and then manned the captured enemy guns near the 4th rondella, turning them against the retreating imperial soldiers. Siege of Buda: The wounding of Gen. Hentzi The attackers then started to advance along Úri Street and Országház Street towards the Fehérvár Gate and the Szent György Square to help I. Corps. The defenders therefore found themselves under fire from two sides, from I. and III. Corps. At 4 a.m., the Italian soldiers of the Ceccopieri regiment, who were fighting on the western walls of the southern end of the Castle Hill, by the Palace, in the region of the Riding Hall (Lovarda) and the Stables, surrendered. Thanks to this, around 500 Hungarian soldiers got into Saint George Square (Szent György tér). At 5 am, Gen. József Nagysándor was pleased to report to Görgey that there were nine battalions in the castle. Attempt of blowing up the Chainbridge by Col. Alois Alnoch on May 21, 1849 It was at this critical point that Hentzi, hearing what was happening in Szent György Square, rushed there with two companies of border guards and another two from the Wilhelm regiment, and stood at the head of the defenders trying to repel the Hungarians. He soon received a fatal bullet wound in his stomach, the bullet leaving his body through the back of his chest..Hermann Róbert, Heinrich Hentzi, a budavári Leonidász, Aetas, p. 57 Along with him, Captain Gorini commanding the Wilhelm companies and Captain Schröder were also mortally wounded. The castle commander being disabled effectively meant the castle had fallen to the Hungarian army. The rest of the defenders in Szent György Square under Lieutenant Kristin surrendered. However Hentzi did not die; after being wounded, he was carried to the hospital on Iskola (School) Square, and laid on a bed in the office of chief medical officer Moritz Bartl. Mór Than – A Hungarian sentinel on the bastion after the liberation of the Castle of Buda Hentzi had previously ordered the evacuation of the water defences, and the troops from there were redeployed in the castle. Kmety's troops thus secured the water defenses too. Imperial Col. Alois Alnoch von Edelstadt in charge of the water defenses saw that the situation was hopeless. Seeing Szekulics's brigade on the Pest side, and thinking that they were preparing to cross the Chain Bridge towards Buda,. he tried to blow up the Chain Bridge by throwing his cigar on the fuse leading to the 4 chests of explosives put there before the siege. However, he succeeded only in blowing himself up, while the bridge suffered only minor damage. In fact Szekulics had no order or intention to cross the bridge. Alnoch had tried to demolish the Chain Bridge in spite of Görgei's express request to spare \\"this majestic masterpiece\\". The last imperial troops to surrender were those in the palace, so by 7 o'clock the whole Castle of Buda was liberated. Buda Castle after the Siege Although before the attack Görgei had ordered his soldiers not to take any prisoners because of his anger at the damage caused by the defenders’ cannon to the city of Pest, the Hungarian soldiers mostly spared the lives of the surrendering enemy troops. Even Hentzi, on his death bed, supposedly said about the magnanimity of the Hungarian soldiers towards the defenders: \\"Indeed, the Hungarians are a chivalrous nation\\" General Görgei used 19 infantry battalions, 4 jäger companies and sapper units in the final attack. He kept his troops on constant alert against possible attempts by the imperial cavalry to break out from the castle. The imperials lost 30 officers and 680 men, of which 4 officers and 174 men died from the epidemics which broke out in the castle during the siege. 113 officers and 4,091 men surrendered and became prisoners of the Hungarians. 248 cannon of various types, 8,221 projectiles, 931 q (quintal) gunpowder, 5,383 q saltpetre, 894 q sulfur, 276 horses, and 55,766 cash Forints. According to László Pusztaszeri the Hungarians lost 1 captain, 4 lieutenants, 15 sergeants, 20 corporals and 630 men, while Róbert Hermann says either 368 dead and 700 wounded of all ranks (József Bayer's report), or 427 dead and 692 wounded (Lajos Asbóth's report). As a result of the fighting and of the senseless imperial bombardment of Pest, 40 buildings burned down in Pest and 98 in Buda, while 61 buildings suffered heavy damage in Pest and 537 in Buda. The most affected were the neoclassical buildings on the Lower Danube Row, which were lost forever, and the Royal Palace of Buda. Aftermath After the castle was taken, the Hungarian Lieutenant János Rónay found the wounded Hentzi in the hospital to which he had been taken and made the Austrian commander prisoner. Chief medical officer Moritz Bartl told the Hungarian officer that Hentzi was mortally wounded and could not be saved. Rónay treated him gently, but when Hentzi asked to shake hands, he refused, saying he respected him as an excellent general but would not shake his hand because of the bombardment of Pest. Görgei, in reality Lieutenant János Rónay, defending Hentzi from the angered mob Hentzi replied that his guns could have totally destroyed but did not, and that he only fired on those buildings which he had orders to do. As we showed above, Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden's orders to Hentzi contained nothing about destroying Pest; he gave permission only to bombard the city on the eastern bank of the Danube in exceptional situations, if the civilians behaved towards the castle in an unacceptable manner, which they did not. The damages caused by the bombardment of Pest by the imperials: The German Theater Lieutenant Rónay then transported Hentzi to the Hungarian headquarters, but on the way there, in Dísz Square, the people recognized Hentzi and wanted to hurt him because of what he had done to Pest. Only Lieutenant Rónay's forceful intervention saved the wounded general from being lynched.Hermann Róbert, Heinrich Hentzi, a budavári Leonidász, Aetas, p. 58 Around this event the legend was born of Artúr Görgei defending Hentzi's dead body from the enraged mob, which was depicted in many contemporary illustrations. When Hentzi reached the Hungarian HQ, many Hungarian officers (Gen. József Nagysándor, Col. Lajos Asbóth, and finally Görgei himself) visited Hentzi and behaved kindly towards him, but when they asked what his wishes were, he replied that he wanted to die. When asked why he wanted this, he replied that he knew that if he recovered, Görgei would hang him, remembering that in his letter demanding the surrender of the castle the Hungarian general had threatened to do so if Hentzi bombarded Pest or blew up the Chain Bridge. Görgei indeed had not forgotten his promise of 4 May, and declared to Lieutenant-Colonel Bódog Bátori Sulcz that he would hang Hentzi the next day if he recovered, saying that the Austrian general did not deserve to be called a hero. In the evening Hentzi's condition became critical, and Rónay sent for a priest, but apparently none could be found, perhaps because no priest wanted to give him the extreme unction. Hentzi died at 1 o'clock in the morning on 22 May. His and Col. Alnoch's bodies were put in two unpainted coffins and sent to the graveyard escorted by a squad of Huszárs to protect the bodies from the people's anger. In 1852 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria ordered a monument dedicated to Heinrich Hentzi, who did not deserve this because of the senseless damage he caused to the capital cities, and in October 1918 it was finally dismantled.Hermann Róbert, Heinrich Hentzi, a budavári Leonidász, Aetas, p. 59 Hentzi Monument Buda The chivalry of the Hungarian officers was not shared by all of their soldiers. Görgei wrote in his order of the day nr. 755/v that after the capture of Buda Castle, some Hungarian soldiers had robbed castle residents’ houses, stealing valuable objects from them as well as from the state properties and archives. He therefore ordered all stolen items to be returned within 24 hours, and that those who did not obey this order would be court-martialled.. The damages caused by the bombardment of Pest by the imperials: Lloyd-building Although General Mór Perczel accused Artúr Görgei of intentionally delaying the occupation of the Buda Castle to give the Austrian troops from around Vienna and Pozsony time to recover, because Perczel wanted to persuade the Hungarian government in Debrecen to bring Görgei before a court-martial, the liberation of the castle created huge satisfaction among the Hungarians which convinced Prime Minister Bertalan Szemere to award Görgei the First Class Military Order of Merit and the rank of lieutenant general.. But when he was visited by a Government delegation to invest him with the order and his promotion, Görgei refused. He said that he did not deserve these and did not approve of the greed of many soldiers and officers for rank and decorations, which was not compatible with Prime Minister Szemere's Republican political program, and that by refusing these distinctions he wanted to set an example for his subordinates. The leaders of the delegation, Senator Zsigmond Bernáth and Deputy Gábor Kazinczy saluted Görgei's decision.. In his meeting with the two politicians, Görgei told them that after the capture of Buda he was planning to stage a coup d'état, to use his army to force the retraction of the Declaration of the Hungarian Independence, as he thought that this political act by the Hungarian Parliament made any kind of compromise with the emperor and the imperial Government in Vienna impossible, and because he thought that as the threat of Russian intervention became more and more clear, the only hope for Hungary to save at least part of its autonomy and the achievements of the Hungarian revolution of 15 March 1848 was an agreement with the emperor. But when Bernáth and Kazinczy told him they shared his views and that there was a party in the Hungarian parliament called the Peace Party (Békepárt) which wanted to reach an agreement with Emperor Franz Joseph I., he renounced his planned coup, and declared that he hoped for a political, \\"constitutional\\" solution to the problem.. Kossuth and his family being welcomed by the population in the liberated Buda and Pest After receiving the news of the capture of Buda, on 22 May, Governor Lajos Kossuth and Prime Minister Bertalan Szemere published Görgei's report of the victory with a postscript, in which they wrote: \\"You have crowned the campaign you have conducted so far with the capture of the ancient Castle of Buda. You have given the Motherland its capital back, and the National Assembly and the Government their seat. Furthermore, through this victory, you have urged or rather made possible, that our national independence be recognized by Europe\\" On 23 May Kázmér Batthyány, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, wrote a letter to Ferenc Pulszky, the Szemere government's emissary to London, that after the liberation of Buda he was sure that the European nations, who hitherto had been reluctant to accept Hungary's declaration of independence as a \\"fait accompli\\", would open diplomatic relations with Hungary. Thus the Hungarian politicians believed that the conquest of Buda would prevent Russia from intervening in the conflict between Hungary and the Austrian Empire, because the European powers would accept Hungary as an independent state. But later events showed that these hopes were groundless, and the European nations looked away when 200,000 Russian soldiers crossed the Hungarian border in June to crush Hungarian independence. Vigadó On the other hand, after the mood of April and May 1849 during the Hungarian Revolutionary Army's victorious Spring Campaign, the imperial commanders and politicians had a constant fear of a Hungarian attack against Vienna, feeling that they could not repulse such an attack if the Russian intervention did not begin in time. The imperial intelligence had no clear information about Görgei's plans, but the political and military leaders’ correspondence shows they thought that if the Hungarian army were to cross the Austrian border, they would have no chance of repelling it without Russian help.. The imperial reports show a constant concern, lasting several weeks, about a Hungarian attack against Austria which would be helped by revolutionary forces in Vienna and the Austrian provinces. The damages caused by the bombardment of Pest by the imperials: the House of Representatives For example, a letter from Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, Minister-President of the Austrian Empire, shows that the people of Vienna were again in revolutionary mood. When Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, the former high commander of the imperial forces in Hungary returned to Prague, after being dismissed because of his defeats on the Hungarian front, the people gathered in front of him and shouted: \\"Long live Kossuth!\\". This constant fear on the part the imperial commanders and politicians also show the talent of General Ernő Poeltenberg commanding the 12,000 men of Hungarian VII. Corps, whose demonstration maneuvers not only kept at bay far more imperial troops (over 50,000, in fact), but also made them believe his force was capable of a successful advance into the Austrian Hereditary Provinces.. Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden, high commander of the imperial forces in Hungary, wrote to Schwarzenberg urging Russian intervention, saying the revolutions in Italy and Germany could reignite if Hungarian military successes continued, and that the Hungarian Revolution would not be suppressed quickly.. On 1 May Schwarzenberg wrote that the first 85,000 Russian troops had already entered the Austrian province of Galicia and taken position near the Hungarian border, awaiting further orders.. But in any case, as shown above (Towards Vienna or to Buda?), before and during the Siege of Buda the Hungarian army was so numerically inferior towards the imperial forces gathered around Pozsony and Vienna that the Habsburg commanders’ fears were groundless. The storming of Buda castle was the zenith of the Honvéd army's glory. It was not a simple victory, but one of the greatest Hungarian victories in the Independence War of 1848–1849, causing the loss of 5,000 elite soldiers of the Austrian Empire, and huge booty in artillery, muskets, ammunition, horses, etc., which were used in the following months in the struggle against the combined forces of two empires: The Habsburg and the Russian. In terms of the number of the prisoners and spoils, this victory was surpassed only by the Victory of Ozora, on 7 October 1848, in which 7,553 enemy soldiers were forced to capitulate to the same general, Artúr Görgei,. but those troops were among the units with the lowest fighting value in the Habsburg army, while those commanded by Hentzi were among its best. It also yielded a substantial quantity of arms and materiel, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent military operations. They were indeed soon to be necessary, because Welden was preparing for another attack when he heard of the fall of Buda, whereupon he abandoned his plans. It was now clear that Austria alone would be unable to put down the Hungarian struggle for independence. It is telling that the very day Buda was captured, Francis Joseph I finalised an agreement by which Tsar Michael I of Russia would send 200,000 soldiers to crush the Hungarian Revolution. The Emperor marked his gratitude for this friendly assistance by kissing the hand of the Tsar. The Capture of Buda is regarded as the conclusion of the victorious Spring Campaign of the Hungarian army, which resulted in the liberation of almost all Hungary from the Habsburg troops and their Russian, Serbian, Croatian and Romanian allies.. After this, the Summer Campaign saw the intervention in June of a quarter of the troops of the Russian Empire,. together with the reorganized numerically superior Habsburg army. In the face of these, the numerically and technologically desperately inferior Hungarian army, despite its admirable bearing which earned the respect of the enemy commanders, could only put up a heroic but hopeless resistance before it was defeated and forced to lay down its arms at Nagyszőlős on 13 August 1849 and in Komárom on 2 October 1849.. Legacy The famous Hungarian Romantic novelist Mór Jókai made the Hungarian Revolution and Independence War the subject of his popular novel A kőszívű ember fiai (literally: The Sons of the Man with a Stone Heart, translated into English under the title: The Baron's sons). In chapter XXIII., the Siege of Buda is vividly presented as one of the main plot events of the novel, in which several of his main characters appear fighting in the ranks of both the Hungarian and the Austrian army.. In 1965 this novel was also adapted as a movie of the same title (A kőszívű ember fiai), including the Siege of Buda as one of its most important scenes. Since 1992, the Hungarian Government is celebrating the day of the capture of the Castle of Buda, 21 May, as National Defence Day ().

Doucai () is a technique in painted Chinese porcelain, where parts of the design, and some outlines of the rest, are painted in underglaze blue, and the piece is then glazed and fired. The rest of the design is then added in overglaze enamels of different colours and the piece fired again at a lower temperature of about 850°C to 900°C.Medley, 204; Pierson, 14–15 The style began in the 15th century under the Ming dynasty in the imperial factories at Jingdezhen, and its finest products come from a few years in the reign of the Chenghua Emperor, mostly small pieces like the famous Chicken cups.Sotheby's; Rawson, 361 The style was discontinued after a few decades, as a suitable overglaze blue was developed, but later revived under the Qing dynasty. It is not to be confused with the wucai style, which was a related early technique for polychrome painting.Pierson, 14–15; Medley, 204–207 Doucai can be translated as \\"contrasted colours\\",Grove, Nillson \\"fitted colours\\",Valenstein, 190 \\"colours which fit together\\"Nillson or \\"dove-tailed colours\\".Medley, 204 Bowl with dragon chasing flaming pearl, Kangxi reign, 1662–1722 The technique was driven by the restrictions of the materials available at the time. The Chinese had developed high-fired porcelain, and found two colours that produced good results when painted under the glaze, even when fired at the high temperatures. Blue and white porcelain was being produced in enormous quantities and was well understood. There was also a less reliable red, derived from copper.Vainker, 180–181, 184–185, 187–188 But the other colours known to the Chinese turned black or brown at the temperatures required for porcelain; indeed a number of surviving examples have discoloured enamels but unaffected bodies and underglaze colour, after being caught in one of the many fires in Chinese palaces.Christie's Furthermore, the cobalt blue used for blue and white discoloured if used over the glaze, even at lower temperatures. The Jindezhen potters eventually arrived at the doucai technique to overcome these problems. History Polychrome cloisonné, using enamels on thin metal bodies, had been introduced as a \\"courtly invention of the early fifteenth century made exclusively for palace and court temple use\\".Clunas and Harrison- Hall, 82–86, 97, 86 quoted It tended to use porcelain shapes, and the imperial potters may have felt pressure to compete. Before 1850 a range of two-colour combinations, on a white background, were ordered by the court.Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 88 The doucai technique may have been derived from that of cloisonné.Rawson, 190 The doucai technique appeared in the reign of the Xuande Emperor (1426–1435), from which a dish with red and green enamels was excavated at the Jindezhen kilns.Vainker, 190 The technique achieved its first and finest flowering in the last years of the Chenghua Emperor, who reigned from 1464 to 1487, but the doucai pieces all date between 1472 and 1487, and are extremely rare.Vainker, 191–192; Sotheby's The emperor seems to have taken a personal interest in the wares, which are mostly small and fit comfortably in the hand. According to tradition, his ambitious courtesan and former nanny Consort Wan encouraged him in this taste, and may have inspired it. Objects decorated with chickens were symbols of fertility and often given at weddings, and it seems Wan liked to give the emperor a daily gift, which in the case of the \\"chicken cups\\" may have represented her desire for children.Cherry Hill Antiques, with the story from Chinese tradition; Sotheby's; Valenstein, 172–174; Nillson He was also a devout Buddhist, and several pieces have Buddhist inscriptions and symbols.Vainker, 192 After the Chenghua period the quality of imperial porcelain slowly declined for the rest of the Ming dynasty, and when quality revived under the Qing the Chenghua period had already acquired a reputation, which it has largely retained, as the finest period of Chinese porcelain.Valenstein, 170; Vainker, 191–192; Sotheby's Chenghua pieces, 1464–87; in the foreground a \\"chicken cup\\" like that sold in 2014 at Sotheby's. Chenghua wine cups were already fetching very high prices among collectors in the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1573–1619),Vainker, 193 and in the 18th century there are various literary references to \\"chicken cups\\" as objects of great value, including an episode in Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin (d. 1763), one of the Four Great Classical Novels of China. The Qianlong Emperor wrote a poem about the cups.Sotheby's There was a certain revival of the style in the Wanli period, and a larger one under the Yongzheng Emperor (1723–1735) of the Qing dynasty.Medley, 241–242 Pieces were occasionally produced thereafter, in particular of the chicken cups and stem cups with grapes, two of the most admired designs of the Chenghua period.Rawson, 361; British Museum, PDF, A.779, Chenghua stem cup with grapes (expand second curator's note) The discovery and examination by the archaeologist Liu Xinyuan () and his team of a heap of discarded broken porcelains of the Chenghua period at the imperial kiln site at Jingdezhen \\"revolutionised scholars' knowledge of patterns and forms of doucai\\".British Museum, PDF, A.780, expand lower curator's note.

Later pieces can also fetch high prices.Another Sotheby's sale, 2014, see Lots 104–106 Characteristics The rare Chenghua pieces are small, but of very high quality. They are thin- walled porcelain of the standard Jingezhen porcelain of the time. Decoration is restrained, with relatively large parts of the surfaces left as white background; often bowls are only decorated on their outside. The colours in Chenghua pieces are the underglaze blue, and overglaze red, green, yellow and an aubergine (eggplant) purple-brown. This last is transparent and can be used over the other colours, requiring yet another firing.Vainker, 190; Sotheby's; Grove Most pieces carry a six-character reign mark, and the Chenghua mark became \\"the most widely imitated of all marks\\" in later periods.Vainker, 191 The small \\"chicken cups\\", typically only some 8 cm wide and 4 cm high, have been often imitated in later periods. The subject was inspired by paintings. The Chenghua examples used successive layers of enamel to represent texture and shading; by imitations from the 18th century this could be achieved within a single coat.Sotheby's; British Museum Chenghua example, PDF,A.748; British Museum Qianlong example, PDF,A.714 – see lower curator's notes Doucai pieces from the 18th century and later are either imitations of the small Chenghua pieces, or much larger shapes typical of contemporary wares, where doucai has been adopted as a technique largely as a nod to the past.\\"Delicacy and Brilliance, Chinese Doucai Porcelain\\", Toovey's blog, May 2013 The usual distinction made with the wucai technique, which also combines underglaze blue with overglaze enamels in other colours, is that in doucai the whole design is painted or outlined in the blue, even if parts are overlaid by the enamels and invisible in the finished product.Grove; Vandelstein, 175; Nillson on wucai However, this is not true of all pieces classified as doucai, especially from the 18th century onwards. Fragments of incomplete examples, only done in blue, have been excavated from waste tips at the kiln.Sotheby's In wucai only parts of the design include blue, and these cover wider areas, and are often rather freely painted.Medley, 205–207 File:Percival David Collection DSCF3161 08.jpgInterior of Chenghua dish, 23 millimetres high, 84 wide, PDF,A.780 File:Vase (Ping) in the Form of a Mellon with Pine, Bamboo, Plum, Camellia, and Dragon LACMA M.71.65.8.jpgVase with Pine, Bamboo, Plum, Camellia, and Dragon Yongzheng reign, 1723–1735 File:Covered bowl with dragons in the Taoist Eastern Ocean, China, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, Qing dynasty, Yongzheng emperor, porcelain with doucai - Asian Art Museum of San Francisco - DSC01395.JPGCovered bowl with dragons in the Taoist Eastern Ocean, Yongzheng reign File:Pair of large dish with dragon and phoenix design, 1 of 2, China, Jingdezhen kiln, Qing dynasty, Yongzheng period, 1723-1735, doucai enamels - Matsuoka Museum of Art - Tokyo, Japan - DSC07273.JPGOne of a pair of large dishes with dragon and phoenix design, Yongzheng period, 1723–1735 File:Pair of large dish with dragon and phoenix design, 2 of 2, China, Jingdezhen kiln, Qing dynasty, Yongzheng period, 1723-1735, doucai enamels - Matsuoka Museum of Art - Tokyo, Japan - DSC07276.JPGUnderside of the last, Yongzheng period, 1723–1735 File:Dish, Yongzheng Reign, 1723-1735, underglaze blue and overglaze doucai enamels on porcelain - National Gallery of Art, Washington - DSC09805.JPGDish, Yongzheng Reign, 1723–1735 File:Covered box with flowers, China, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, Qing dynasty, Qianlong emperor, porcelain with doucai - Asian Art Museum of San Francisco - DSC01405.JPGCovered box with flowers, Qianlong Emperor, 1735–1796 File:Jar (Ping) with the Eight Immortals (Baxian) LACMA 53.41.6a.jpgWucai jar with the Eight Immortals, Wanli reign, 1573–1620  Notes References * \\"Christie's\\": Sale 2861, \\"The Imperial Sale\\", Lot 3582, 1 June 2011, \\"An important and very rare Ming imperial doucai stemcup\\" * Clunas, Craig and Harrison-Hall, Jessica, Ming: 50 years that changed China, 2014, British Museum Press, * \\"Grove\\", Medley, Margaret, Oxford Art Online, section \\"Ming; Jingdezhen porcelains, Polychome\\" in \\"China, §VIII, 3: Ceramics: Historical development\\" * Medley, Margaret, The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics, 3rd edition, 1989, Phaidon, * Nillson, Jan-Eric, \\"Doucai Chinese porcelain decoration\\", in Chinese porcelain glossary, Gotheborg.com * Pierson, Stacey, From Object to Concept: Global Consumption and the Transformation of Ming Porcelain, 2013, Hong Kong University Press, , 9789888139835, google books * Rawson, Jessica (ed).

His regular position is centre, but he also played as a flanker earlier in his career. Rugby career=2008–2013: Schoolboy rugby Louw was born in Bloemfontein and represented the at schoolboy level. He played for them as early as primary school level, at the Under-13 Craven Week in 2008. At high school level, he was twice selected to play for the Free State at the Under-18 Craven Week, the premier high school rugby union competition in South Africa, playing at the 2012 event in Port Elizabeth where he scored a try in their match against the and at the 2013 event in Polokwane, where he was utilised as a flanker and contributed a try in their defeat to the Pumas. 2014–present: Sharks / UKZN Impi After high school, Louw moved to Durban to join the academy. He started the first three matches of the 's 2014 Under-19 Provincial Championship season as a flanker before moving into the backline in the centre position, where he played for the rest of the season. He started eleven of the team's twelve matches during the regular season, scoring tries in their matches against and as his team finished fourth on the log to secure the final semi-final spot. Louw also started the semi-final, but could not prevent his side losing the match 20–43 to the Blue Bulls. At the start of 2015, Louw played Varsity Shield rugby with . He started four of their eight matches during the regular season, scoring eight tries. He scored hat-tricks in matches against the and the and single tries against and , topping the try-scoring charts for his side and fourth overall in the competition. UKZN Impi finished in second spot on the log to qualify for the final, in which Louw started and helped his side to a 29–24 victory over Wits to win the title for the first time. Soon after the conclusion of the Varsity Shield, Louw was also drafted into the squad for the 2015 Vodacom Cup. He made his first class debut on 17 April 2015, coming on as a replacement for the Sharks XV in their 13–36 defeat to the in George. He was promoted to the starting lineup for his home debut against the a week later, scoring two tries in a 52–12 victory in Empangeni. Another try followed in his next match against in a 24–27 defeat and he started a third consecutive match a week later against the in the team's final match of the regular season. The team finished sixth on the Southern Section log, failing to qualify for the quarter finals. After coming on as a replacement in the s' second match of the Under-21 Provincial Championship season, he firmly established himself as the team's first-choice inside centre, starting ten of their remaining eleven matches in that position. He scored tries against , and , as his team finished third, before losing to Louw's hometown team in the semi-finals. Louw was named in the Super Rugby squad for the 2016 season, but didn't feature in any matches for the team. Instead, he continued his development with the UKZN Impi in the 2016 Varsity Shield, making seven appearances. He scored one try against and two against as his team won seven of their eight matches. UKZN Impi would have finished joint-top of the log with , but they had 12 points deducted for fielding an ineligible player, therefore missing out on the title play-offs and a shot at promotion to the Varsity Cup. Louw was again named in the squad – participating in the 2016 Currie Cup qualification series that effectively replaced the Vodacom Cup – and made six appearances. After an appearance off the bench against the , he made his first start of the season against Namibian side the in Umlazi, scoring the first hat trick of his senior career in a 48–18 victory. He made a further four starts for the team, scoring tries in matches against and as they finished in tenth place on the log. He was included in their squad for the 2016 Currie Cup Premier Division, but didn't feature for the team, instead making five starts for the in the 2016 Under-21 Provincial Championship. At the end of October 2016, he was included in the Super Rugby squad for the 2017 season.

Craig Haney is an American social psychologist and a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, noted for his work on the study of capital punishment and the psychological impact of imprisonment and prison isolation since the 1970s. He was a researcher on The Stanford Prison Experiment. Education Haney obtained his B.A from the University of Pennsylvania and his M.A., Ph.D. in Psychology and J.D. in Law from Stanford University. Career In 1971, while at Stanford, Haney collaborated with Philip Zimbardo in conducting what is known today as The Stanford Prison Experiment, for which Haney served as a principal researcher. This experience help to set in course Haney’s subsequent career and work with prison systems. It ingrained in Haney that “context matters, prisoners are people, mistreatment has consequences”, and perpetuated his passion about the psychological impact of incarceration, and his advocacy for humanization and reform. Haney is a Distinguished Professor of Psychology and the UCSC Presidential Chair (for a three-year term which runs from 2015 until 2018) at the University of California Santa Cruz where he has been a member the faculty for some 39 years. He was selected as the University’s Distinguished Faculty Research Lecturer in 2014. He has taught Psychology and Law I & II, Social Justice, Society, and Policy, and Graduate Research Methods, and The Social Context. His work with graduate students involves applied research on criminal justice topics including: the effects of imprisonment, criminogenic social histories, the effects of death qualification, and the impact of pretrial publicity on legal decision making. Teaching awards include, in 2015, his second Excellence in Teaching award bestowed by the UC Santa Cruz faculty senate. Publications Haney has published four books, numerous research articles and entries in law reviews, including: * Death By Design: Capital Punishment as a Social Psychological System (Oxford University Press, 2005), which received the Herbert Jacobs Prize from the Law and Society Association as “the most outstanding book on law and society” published that year. * Reforming Punishment: Psychological Limits to the Pains of Imprisonment (American Psychological Association, 2006), which was nominated for a National Book Award. * The Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring the Causes and Consequences (The National Academies Press, 2014), for which he was a co-author along with other members of the National Academies charged with studying the causes and consequences of high rates of incarceration in the United States. * Prisons Worldwide (Praeger Publishers, 2016), three volumes co-authored with Lynne Haney. Haney has also written for the Huffington Post. Testimony and media Haney has served as an expert witness in several influential United States Federal Court cases related to the prison environment and punishment, including: Toussaint v. McCarthy (1984), Madrid v. Gomez (1995), Coleman v. Brown (1995), and Ruiz v. Johnson (1999). Moreover, Haney's work was influential in the United States Supreme Court 5-4 ruling of Brown v. Plata (2011), which upheld a lower court ruling that the California prison population be reduced. Commenting on this last case, Haney stated: \\"When prisons are unduly painful, they become harmful and the system begins to break down and fail.\\" He noted further, \\"Prisoners can carry the consequences of that harm back out into the free world once they're released. I was very gratified to see the Supreme Court embrace that concept”. In 2012, Haney testified before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary at a hearing on “Reassessing Solitary Confinement”. In 2014, he spoke on the National Public Radio program, Fresh Air with Terry Gross, about the impacts of solitary confinement. In 2018, Haney was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey on a 60 Minutes segment that addressed the psychological consequences of long-term isolation.

It is part of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone. Sairecabur proper is high; other mountains in the range are high Curiquinca, high Escalante and high Cerro Colorado, all of which have erupted a number of lava flows. Also in close proximity to Sairecabur lie the volcanic centres Licancabur, Putana and Juriques. Sairecabur and Saciel Sairecabur proper is accompanied by a wide caldera. Before the formation of this caldera the volcano may have been high and thus one of the highest volcanoes on Earth. After the formation of this caldera lava effusion occurred during the Pleistocene and Holocene; there is no reported historical activity, however. Eruption products on Escalante and Sairecabur include andesite and dacite. The climate is dry, cold and very sunny. An Inca sanctuary has been found on Sairecabur, and sulfur mines exist in the mountain chain. More recently, the Receiver Lab Telescope was installed on the volcano. It is the highest submillimeter telescope in the world at an altitude of .  Geology and geography = Geological context  West of South America, the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate. This process has formed the Andean Volcanic Belt, which is subdivided into the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone and the Southern Volcanic Zone. These belts have different underlying crusts and thus have different typical magma compositions. These volcanic zones are separated from each other by zones where there is no volcanism, associated with a shallow dip of the seismic zone of the subducting plate. Sairecabur is part of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ). A number of stratovolcanoes can be found in the area, many of which were affected by explosive eruptions that have destroyed parts of their edifices. Effusion of large amounts of lava took place from several cones. Many volcanoes are extinct and only a few have documented activity. The geologist Juan Brüggen in 1950 estimated that there were about 800 volcanoes in northern Chile, about 37 of them east of the Salar de Atacama. Also part of the volcanism are large ignimbrites, which are usually thought to be of Miocene age. Those in the area of Sairecabur often originated in the neighbourhood to the conical volcanoes. The volcanoes formed over crust with thicknesses reaching , thus the erupted magmas are heavily influenced by the crust. A number of the highest stratovolcanoes in the world are in the CVZ. Historical activity has been low in comparison to the volcanic zones of southern Chile and Colombia/Ecuador. In Chile, much of the area of the CVZ is desertic and thus difficult to research. Sairecabur is constructed on the two Pliocene-Pleistocene Puripicar and Chaxas formations. Some lavas from Sairecabur have also overrun the Purico formation, which is of Pleistocene age and includes ignimbrites from the Purico Complex. The basement beneath Sairecabur and Licancabur contains a large number of faults.  Geography  Licancabur seen from Sairecabur Sairecabur is located at a distance of from San Pedro de Atacama. The volcano saddles the frontier between Bolivia and Chile, where it lies in the Antofagasta Region. Laguna Verde lake, Licancabur volcano and Portezuelo de Chaxas pass lie south of Sairecabur. East of the Sairecabur range lie Mount Nelly and Cerro Laguna Verde. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904) traced the frontier between Bolivia and Chile along the Sairecabur chain. Disagreements between the topographic maps in the two countries mean that the naming of the mountains is often confusing. Escalante is also known as Apagado. The volcano is associated with a mountain range of the same name. The Sairecabur range forms a drainage divide between the Salar de Atacama on the western side and a number of small endorheic basins in Bolivia on the eastern side. Licancabur and Juriques farther south and Tocorpuri farther north are part of the same divide. Dry valleys on the eastern side of the Sairecabur range ultimately drain into Laguna Verde. The Rio Purifica originates on Sairecabur's slope at an altitude of , it later converges with the Rio Puritama to form the San Pedro de Atacama River.  Geology  The Sairecabur range is a long chain of volcanoes going from Escalante volcano (south of Putana Volcano) to Sairecabur proper in the south, including at least ten centres which have been active in postglacial time. Two additional centres exist northeast of Escalante. high Sairecabur is the highest volcano in the range. A wide caldera exists south of Sairecabur and formed on an older volcano. Lava flows extend from Sairecabur as far as to the northwest, and further young lava flows formed south of this caldera. The high Escalante () has a crater lake. Puritama volcano west of Sairecabur has generated lava flows that extend along tectonic canyons. high Curiquinca () and high Cerro Colorado () are found northwest and northeast, respectively, of the range. Caldera of Sairecabur The caldera is bounded by cliffs reaching a height of , which are buried by lava flows from Sairecabur on the northern rim; one of these lava flows reaches the caldera bottom. The pre-collapse volcano was about high and would have been one of the highest volcanoes in the world; Ojos del Salado reaches an altitude of . Sairecabur proper has three cones. Thick () and short lava flows emanated from the northern cone. Glacial erosion has affected Sairecabur and moraines cover some lava flows south of Sairecabur. The total volume of the Sairecabur proper is about . Lava flows with a young appearance extend from each of these ten centres. An older centre has generated a long lava flow that flowed southwestwards. Some older lava flows from Sairecabur were later buried by lava flows from Licancabur. Cerro Colorado and Curiquinca are aligned in a west-east pattern. Other volcanoes in the area such as Lascar-Aguas Calientes, Licancabur-Juriques and La Torta- Tocorpuri also form such alignments which seem to be controlled by north-south tension in the crust. Sairecabur is located on faults which are also apparent at Laguna Verde.

Mafic enclaves are found in the post- caldera lavas. The colour of the rocks is black, brown or gray. Minerals include amphibole, biotite, bronzite, -containing augite, clinopyroxene, hornblende, magnetite, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, pyroxene and quartz. In addition, apatite, ilmenite, iron oxides and zirconia are found. At least one lava erupted after the caldera-forming eruption contains olivine. Lavas erupted before the caldera-forming eruption of Sairecabur contain glass and have a microlithic texture. The magmas are calc-alkaline with medium-high content. Fumarolically altered rocks are found on the eastern flanks of the chain. Desert patine covers post-caldera lavas. Based on crystal composition, the magmas of Sairecabur formed at temperatures of . The process started by partial melting of the mantle involving peridotite and subsequent interaction with the crust and fractional crystallization. Andesites erupted before the caldera formation were produced at temperatures higher than dacites erupted after the formation of the caldera. , and isotope ratios are typical for magmas in CVZ. The isotope ratios are consistent with these found in the crust, specifically of the so-called \\"Antofalla\\" domain of Andean crust, the remnant of a terrane of Gondwana.  Geological history  The 7 million year-old Chaxas ignimbrite massif has been related to the caldera-forming eruption at Sairecabur. These dacitic ignimbrites spread southwest towards the Salar de Atacama. This high age estimate for the Chaxas ignimbrite however has been questioned, considering that it is inconsistent with stratigraphic relationships of this ignimbrite to older ignimbrite. The lava formations are named Post-Caldera Lavas I and Post-Caldera Lavas II; the first is of Pleistocene and the second of Holocene age. A fresh flow that extends northwest from Sairecabur appears to be the most recent flow. The formation of the caldera preceded the formation of the other cones in the range. The edifice this caldera formed during the Pliocene-Quaternary considering the morphology of its deposits. During the ice ages, a valley due west of the main Sairecabur summit was occupied by a long glacier that extended down to an elevation of ; the main Sairecabur summit grew inside of the valley occupied by the glacier, which also left lateral and terminal moraines. Sairecabur volcano is the youngest volcano in the chain; Escalante is also young but not as young as Sairecabur. There are no reports of contemporaneous activity nor has fumarolic activity been reported, although fumaroles and hot springs were found at the shores of Laguna Verde which border on Sairecabur. Future activity at Sairecabur may disturb activity at Atacama Large Millimeter Array.  Climate and biology  The climate at Sairecabur is dry and cloudless, leading to the absence of glaciers and permanent snowcover at Sairecabur. Overall the Atacama Altiplano has a desert climate with precipitation below , but during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene the climate was wetter. isotope ratios of present-day snowfall are consistent with the isotope ratios determined for precipitation that arises in the continent, rather than from the Pacific Ocean. The rainshadow effect exercised by the Andes and the stability of the South Pacific High are responsible for this dryness. The dry and cloudless climate together with the low latitude and high altitude gives the region some of the highest insolations on Earth; at Sairecabur it amounts to 98% of the solar constant. The coincidence between the southern hemisphere summer solstice on 21 December and the perihelion, the point of lowest Earth- Sun distance, on 3 January contribute to the high insolation. Ultraviolet radiation is also high in the area, with values reported for ultraviolet radiation B and ultraviolet radiation A respectively. Temperatures at ranged in 1991–1994. A series of measurements in 1995 indicated that surface temperatures at an altitude of range from in winter, and soil temperatures at depths of also in winter between almost and less than . There are large differences between daytime and night temperatures. Between 1991–1994 the average speed of wind amounted to . Research on plant diversity in the region west of Sairecabur and Licancabur has shown that about 250 plant species occur there, and on the volcano itself extremophilic yeast species have been found. In 1955, penitentes, a form of ice, was reported to be widespread at Saciel.  Human history = Pre-modern times  Sairecabur and Curiquinca both have mountain sanctuaries made by the Inca. Licancabur and Juriques farther south were also sites of such sanctuaries. Sairecabur was considered to be a sacred mountain, and andesite found at some archeological sites in the Atacama may come from Sairecabur.  Recent times  A sulfur mine is active at Saciel, north of Sairecabur. Sulfur mining there, at Cerro Colorado and Putana in the 1950s contributed to the growth of San Pedro de Atacama, where the mined sulfur was transported to. A report in 1955 indicated the presence of about ore containing 55–60% sulfur. A long mining dirt road with a single lane leads from the El Tatio highway to Sairecabur. Sairecabur is since 2003 the site of the diameter Receiver Lab Telescope, a telescope which operates in the terahertz range of the electromagnetic spectrum; ground-based astronomy in this range was long considered to be impossible since the atmosphere absorbs radiation in that frequency range heavily. With an altitude of the telescope is the highest submillimeter telescope in the world.  Gallery  File:Sairecabur chain from co colorado to vn sairecabur.jpgThe Sairecabur range.

It is reddish-purplish (wine-colored) in colour, almost uniform, except for tiny white spots which are only seen with a magnifying glass; there are also white granules on the edge of the mantle. The ventral aspect of the mantle is violet, on a pink background, darker towards the edge and more diffused towards the foot with some violet specks. The foot is narrower than the mantle and somewhat longer, protruding from behind when crawling; its anterior border is furrowed, with the upper lip cleft. The head has conical tentacles, white and solid. The black digestive gland is seen by transparency in the center of the sole of the foot and of the flanks. The whole surface of the mantle is upholstered with tubercles of caryophyllidia of equal form and shape, arranged tightly and with a bundle of spicules that barely protrudes from the tubercle.

Research interests=Long-distance dispersal Nathan's earlier work (since 1999) focused on seed dispersal, and long-distance dispersal (LDD) in particular. In a series of studies he and his colleagues demonstrated the strength of the mechanistic approach in understanding seed dispersalMechanisms of long-distance dispersal of seeds by wind, Nature, 2002 and plant dynamics, as well as the importance of rare long-distance dispersal events in plants (Nathan 2006 Science), their underlying mechanisms and their role in determining spread rates of plants in future environments. Movement Ecology In an interview for Science Watch (October 2010),Ran Nathan on the Growing Importance of Movement Ecology, Science Watch Nathan revealed that the idea to establish Movement Ecology as a new field of research was born in 2002, when he was a first-year faculty member supervising one student on seed dispersal and another on bird migration, facing the question “what name should I call my research group”? This has led him to wonder why different movement phenomena are studied in isolation from each other, and why there is still no general unifying theory of organismal movement. He then decided to call his research group \\"movement ecology\\", and later on noticed this term has already been used in the literature, but very occasionally at the time and never in the context of a unifying research paradigm. In 2006, Nathan initiated and led an international group at the Israel Institute for Advanced Studies in JerusalemIsraeli Institute for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem which has set the foundation for development of the field of Movement Ecology as a new integration of movement research.

Mansoor wants Raja to success his place after his death, so he trained him faithfully and treated him as his blood son. Raja never failed any mission given by Mansoor. When killing people, Raja always wears a police uniform with the name of Siddhanth (Ashmit Patel), to pretend to be a police officer conducting operations, which makes Siddhanth blamed for many times. During one of his operations, Raja meets Shruti and falls for her. However, Raja feels hopeless for his love to Shruti because of his profession, so he lies to her by saying he's a house agent. Unaware of Raja's real identity and profession, Shruti gradually falls for him too. Inspector Siddhant, who's in charge of Mansoor's case, disappoints his senior for his failure to close the case in the promised time. Damie (Kamlesh Sawant), another of his seniors blames him too for not only he failed to collect evidence against Mansoor, but Mansoor's men started killing people, which never happened before he took over the case. Their senior then decides to transfer this case to Damie. Damie, in fact, is a corrupted officer who's bribed by and works for Mansoor, after he takes over the case, he solved the murder committed by Mansoor's men easily. He arrests an innocent man and threatens to kill him to make him claim responsibility for those murders, and state he has no relation with Mansoor, in front of a video camera.

Early life and family  Higham was born to a British veteran of the First World War (the literary agent, David Higham) and Margaret Anne Stewart, an American woman. Born in 1925, he grew up in London but had already met relatives in Texas and Oklahoma with his mother in 1929 and 1935. Following the outbreak of the Battle of Britain in 1940, Higham's parents sent him to the United States. He attended the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. Education and career  From 1943 to 1947, he served as a pilot and flight sergeant in the Royal Canadian Air Force in Europe and Asia (Burma Road). He studied at the University of New Hampshire and Harvard University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1950 cum laude. In 1953, he received his master's degree at Claremont Graduate University in California. From 1954 to 1957, he was an instructor at the University of Massachusetts.

In 1963, he became a professor at Kansas State University. He became professor emeritus there in 1999. Though he described himself as a \\"historical generalist\\" in a 1998 interview, Higham's primary publications were on the subject of aeronautics, especially military-scientific aspects. He did, however, also write extensively on geopolitics in general. In 1977, he founded Sunflower University Press, which existed until 2005 and published books on military science and military history. He was editor of Military Affairs (now The Journal of Military History) from 1968 to 1988 and of Aerospace Historian from 1970 to 1988.

It is located in Chastellux- sur-Cure in the Yonne, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. This castle is still inhabited by the family who built it, a rarity in France. The oldest existing part of the building, the Saint-Jean tower, was built c. 1080 AD. The main building was the first part to be registered as a monument historique in 1925. The Saint-Jean tower and the surrounding buildings were later classified in 1976 and 1989, respectively.Notice number PA00113641, base Mérimée, ministère français de la Culture  History  The house of Chastellux takes its name from a place called Castrum Lucii located on the banks of the Cure, 15 km from Avallon. Initially, the building in its original state was a Roman fort made of wood and stone. There remains many traces of Roman influence in the region, including the mosaic of Chagnats found in the fields and currently on display at the museum of Avallonnais, Avallon.  Middle Ages  The oldest evidence of presence of the lords of Chastellux on the current site of the castle is an account of a hearing at \\"the ancient Saint Jean tower in 1116\\". The hearing was about a property rights dispute between local barons and clergy of the Abbey of Molesme. For ten centuries, the castle of Chastellux did not stop growing, embellished and restored by successive generations of the family. Planted on a rocky peak surmounting the Cure, its strategic location helped to protect the castle from attack. Located on the borders of the Yonne and Nièvre, the fortress hosted armies that came to defend the borders of Burgundy, being an independent duchy at the time. The Tower of Saint Jean Main view of the Castle and courtyard c. 1925. In the twelfth century, the castle became a fortress, composed of tall towers linked by a thick battlement and guarded by a walkway. Wooden buildings are backed along the walls. They are used for livestock housing and the storage of animal feed. Comfort was nonexistent and homes played a very minor role compared to the \\"defensive\\" role of the fortress. The tower of St. John is the last remnant of this fortress. The tower, one of the oldest in Europe, consists of five levels. The staircase leading to the floors was cut into the thickness of the wall (a thickness of 3.5 meters at ground level). On the second floor is a prison officer and a dungeon accessed through an opening in the floor. The roof is topped with a lantern containing the warning bell, to alert the castle inhabitants of impending danger. For additional protection, there was a second wall with several smaller towers, two of which still exist today. A ditch joining the two valleys close this second wall is no longer present. In the 13th century, out of necessity, a larger building was built. The year 1240 was inscribed on stone walls, providing a date of construction of the guard room, which is the second oldest structure (after the tower of Saint-Jean). The scaffolding of tower of the Ermitage and the Archives still exists today. On the west side a keep was created as well as an archives tour and the defensive tower of Amboise. Throughout the history of the lords Chastellux remained near the Dukes of Burgundy and fought with them especially during the fall of Paris in 1417. The marshall of France, Claude de Chastellux defeated the Franco- Scottish army at the Battle of Cravant in 1423. This victory allowed him to receive several honorary privileges, such as the title of first hereditary canon of the Auxerre Chapter. He is buried in the chapel within the castle. Over the last fifteen years of his life, the Marshal of Chastellux enlarged the second main building located between the tower of the Archives and the bastion of the tower of Amboise and built the Octagonal Tower and the castle chapel.  Modern times  François-Jean de Chastellux, painted by Charles Willson PealeIn 1592, Olivier de Chastellux, Quarré Baron, Viscount of Avallon, and governor of Cravant, Yonne, raises the military bastion located at the end of the castle near the Tower of Amboise, Tower of Amboise was converted into a living quarters at this time. He also built a terrace that surrounded the castle. Until the end of the reign of Louis XIII, the castle remained a fortress with a large garrison. In 1615 the Prince of Conde ordered the establishment of a company of 100 trained infantry and a company of 60 cavalry and the establishment of its castle and place of Chastellux. The castle site made for a strategic location for the defense of Burgundy. Hercules, son of Oliver, was elected to the nobility of Burgundy States in 1618. In 1621, to demonstrate his esteem and gratitude for services rendered and for those of his father, Louis XIII meets the various strongholds in Chastellux. He meets with the lordship of Chastellux, the barony of Quarré- les-Tombes, Yonne and the Viscount of Avallon in county of Chastellux. In 1780, François-Jean de Chastellux participates in the American Revolutionary War with George Washington. He explored the country and studied its diversity and later published reference books on his travels. He entered the Académie française in 1775. He is also known for being one of the first in France to receive and successfully test the vaccine against smallpox. In 1786, on the death of his father-in-law, the Duke of Duras, Henri-Georges the count of Chastellux took command of the horsemen in honor to Princess Victoire, daughter of Louis XV, and begins his service. In anticipation of looming threats of the French Revolution, the princesses of France flee Italy in February 1791. They asked the Chastellux to accompany them, while the children of Henri-Georges stay in Autun. The castle suffered considerable damage during the revolution. Revolutionaries vandalized the castle: all the old medieval weapons were stolen in 1792, the winery was looted and auctioned. On 5 August 1793, the furniture and archives were seized, paintings, priceless, are burned on August 10 at place Saint-Julien Avallon, currently the site of City Hall. The furniture was stolen, sold, and dispersed. All traces of the family blazon, found on woodwork, painting or a decorative element were promptly destroyed.  Contemporary times  The Chateau de Chastellux (west view) The park of the Château de Chastellux (east view) After nineteen years of exile in Italy, the Earl and Countess of Chastellux did not return to inhabit the castle at the end of the Empire (1810). Their daughter, Georgine Chastellux became the wife of Charles de la Bédoyère. Charles de la Bédoyère helps Napoleon from his return from the island of Elba and consequently Louis XVIII makes charges for his arrest. After the fall of Waterloo, Louis XVIII shot Charles La Bédoyère on August 19, 1815 in Paris, despite the friendship between the monarch and the house of Chastellux. Under the Restoration, the brother of Georgine, César Laurent Chastellux renovates the castle and the grounds. He removed the decorative additions of the eighteenth century and fully restored its medieval decor. In 1940, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny briefly took over the castle with his staff and forced the Earl and Countess of Chastellux to leave. However, the Earl and Countess of Chastellux return after three months of absence. In 1975: a chimney fire set fire to the roof and attic. The tower of Amboise still bears the traces of this fire, with the absence of a roof. Several films were shot at the Château de Chastellux during the 20th century. These include Mon oncle Benjamin (1969), L'épingle noire (1982), Le fantôme du lac (2004).  Protection  The castle, not including the tour of Saint-Jean, was registered as a monument historique since 10 November 1925. The Saint-Jean tower has been classified as historical monument since 10 November 1976. The collection of facades and roofs of the outbuildings, terraces and basement, were classified as a historic monument on 17 February 1989. The castle and its surroundings are a protected site and a site registered by order of 9 September 1935.  Visiting  The castle is privately owned but has been open to visitors since 2008.

The structure is constructed in the shape of a dove, but instead reminds many onlookers of a hen; hence, the locals have taken to calling it the chicken church, a name by which the building is often known across the internet. The building was erected during the 1990s by Daniel Alamsjah, who claimed to have been inspired by God to build a prayer house through a dream he had in 1989. Alamsjah is Christian, but envisioned Gereja Ayam as a place to welcome followers of any religion for prayer or meditation. Due to financial difficulties and local resistance, the construction was never finished. The construction was halted in 2000 and the building has since largely been left to deteriorate. In spite of this, in recent years the place has become reasonably frequented by tourists, as well as by couples seeking either to take wedding photographs or to be wed in the building. Besides serving in a religious capacity, the building has also been used to rehabilitate handicapped children or drug addicts, or as an insane asylum. Following depictions of the site in several films over the past decade, the church has achieved a level of fame and is now a tourist attraction.

During the American Civil War, ladies' aid societies formed across the country to provide medical services and supplies to soldiers. In St. Louis, they partnered with the Western Sanitary Commission in bringing aid to Union soldiers across the state.  History  The St. Louis chapter of the Ladies' Union Aid Society was organized by twenty-five Unionist women in response to the Battle of Wilson's Creek. Wounded soldiers were in need of clean clothes and bandages, and founding member Adaline Weston Couzins sent them supplies by train. The founding women were united by national loyalty despite being located in a divided border city in slave-state Missouri. The Society grew to more than 200 members during the Civil War.  Members  Anna L. Clapp served as the only president of the St. Louis Ladies' Union Aid Society. Through the U.S. surgeon general, Clapp obtained contracts to secure medical supplies and encouraged other Unionist women to work in military hospitals. Other members of this chapter included Margaret Breckinridge, activist Jessie Benton Fremont and lawyer Phoebe Couzins. Abolitionist Mary Meachum later headed the Colored Ladies Soldiers' Aid Society in St. Louis in 1864, assisting escaped slaves and black Union soldiers.

The Missouri Institute for the education of the Blind was the first institute to adopt the Braille System in the United States and the Western Sanitary Commission provided military camps with trained nurses, hospitals, and sanitary conditions. Biography Pollak was born in Prague and his family moved to Vienna when he was five. His father was a successful merchant. Pollak graduated from medical school in Vienna in 1835. He received postgraduate training in several cities in Europe. He gained unique experience when the Austrian government asked him to be part of a delegation to Russia to learn more about cholera. After moving to the United States, Pollak practiced medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, for several years. In the mid-1840s, Pollak became friends with U.S. senator Alexander Barrow and military colonel Zachary Taylor, the future U.S. president. Taylor and Barrow asked Pollak to accompany them on a trip to Louisiana, where they introduced him to influential people in several cities. Based on these contacts, he decided to move to St. Louis in 1844. In St. Louis, Pollak established a successful medical practice. He was a general practitioner, but he had a special interest in eye and ear issues. He has been described as the first ophthalmologist in St. Louis. Pollak served several terms as treasurer of the St. Louis Medical Society, and he served one term as president. In 1850, Pollak helped to start the Missouri School for the Blind. Until 1847, the state of Missouri issued no funds for the education of the blind, and in that year they only provided enough funding to educate fifteen students for a two- year period. The state legislature had usually taken the stance that it was wasteful to educate the blind. By 1851, a private citizen, Eli William Whelan, connected with Pollak and they started a foundation to plan for the Missouri School for the Blind. The organization applied for state funding, and the legislature agreed to give the school $3,000 per year for five years if they raised the initial $10,000. The Missouri School for the Blind opened in late 1851, and the founders allowed it to fall under the control of the Missouri legislature in 1855. During Pollak's time with the school, he introduced Braille to his students. The system had not been embraced in the United States before that time, but Pollak had learned about it when he trained in Europe. Most schools preferred other systems for the blind, because Braille was not understood by those who could see. Braille was not adopted widely in the U.S. until the early 1890s. In 1856, Pollak was one of fifteen founders of the Academy of Science, St. Louis. He opened the first eye and ear clinic in St. Louis in 1860; it was based at Mullanphy Hospital. During the Civil War, he served on the United States Sanitary Commission. He worked at the eye and ear clinic until his death at the age of 89. Pollak had gotten married in 1873 to the former Sallie Perry, and he was survived by his wife and two sons. Pollak was described after his death as the \\"oldest and most illustrious member\\" of the St. Louis Medical Society.

It manufactured Portland cement, the most common type of cement in the world. In the early 20th century, the Atlas Portland Cement Company produced 8 million barrels for the construction of the Panama Canal (1903-1914); its product was the majority of cement used on that project.

Sexism is inherently a product of culture, as culture instills a certain set of beliefs or expectations for what constitutes as appropriate behavior, appearance, or mannerisms for a sex. Sexism in American political elections is generally cited as a socially-driven obstacle to female political candidates, especially for non-incumbents.< When women are seen as threatening to a man's power or leadership, it can often produce hostile sexism. Sexism occurs against those who identify as female. Women are undervalued in society because of their sex. This is seen in elections when qualified women are judged based on appearance and lose to men.  Sexism in politics  Sexism in the United States functions as a way to distribute power based on an individual's ability to meet gender expectations, however, sexism typically rewards men over women and as such men are granted more power as well as opportunities. Sexism exists as a process within patriarchy as it is the dominant cultural practice in the United States, although, it can function separately in that feminine behavior or appearance can be rewarded. Politics represents the field in the United States in which a significant amount of power is available for distribution, as such politics is a field rife with sexism and this effect is increasingly present in high- stakes elections such as Presidential Elections. As the head of the Executive Branch, Presidents, have access to an extraordinary number of governmental abilities such as assigning Supreme Court Seats and Vetoing bills by Congress, and thus this position carries with it a symbolic and legitimate connection to the informal establishment of patriarchy. The extreme prominence of Presidential Elections means that a large amount of sexist media and discriminatory attack ads are created, therefore it offers an opportunity to examine the role of Sexism in politics. This recent presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a model for the effect of sexism in presidential elections as Clinton, is the first female candidate to be nominated one of the two major political parties, and thus she has received a great deal of sexist portrayal and rhetoric from the media as well as Trump's Campaign. “Sexism in the systematic inequitable treatment of girls and women by men and by the society as a whole”. Implications of sexism include girls having lower expectations of their own capabilities and also being subject to ridicule for being assertive. These factors have a direct effect on women who want to run for political positions. Women are less likely to run for political positions due to internalized sexism and a lack of female role models that hold political positions in the US. Cisgender men cannot be subject to negative political sexism seeing that the stereotype promotes males holding political positions. This is supported by the facts that cisgender men hold 59% of elected political positions in the U.S whereas cisgender women hold only 37.6%.  Sexism toward female candidates  Sexism towards female candidates, and towards females, in general, is the most apparent form of sexual discrimination in American society and tends to manifest itself in more direct forms of discrimination and sexual objectification through a focus on behavior and appearance standards expected of women. This manifests itself in two distinct ways, the first being that a female candidate satisfies social expectations of beauty, resulting in over sexual objectification, such as in the case of Sarah Palin in her Vice Presidency Campaign with John McCain in 2008. The second being in the case of Hillary Clinton, where perceptions and disdain for the candidate lead to sexual discrimination in the opposite fashion, referring to the candidate with labels characterized as stereotypically negative female traits. Although female candidates are viewed more as caring compared to their male competition when it comes to topics like military issues, women are disadvantaged because a topic like that is thought to be “owned” to men. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, terrorism and national security were top priorities to the American public, possibly making it more difficult for a female candidates running to gain support. Furthermore, women that reject traditional gender roles are viewed as competent for the job of an executive position but lack emotions, creating an unappealing image of them. When the image is reversed, women who run in elections who are viewed as caring and full of emotions, end up being viewed as not competent. When women follow traditional gender stereotypes or reject them they struggle in political elections. Stereotypes held against female candidates are more relevant to executive elective positions that are seen as “masculine” based on policies that are in the spotlight. Women are also less likely to make the decision to run for office than men, despite having the same characteristics and qualifications. This is mainly due to two factors, the first is that women are less likely to be encouraged to run for office, and the second, women tend to view themselves less qualified for holding office as opposed to men, even if an individual woman has the same or even higher qualifying attributed than an individual male candidate. Hostile sexists, those who believe powerful women are a threat to men, often hire less qualified men over more qualified women, causing a disadvantage to women that want to gain political power. This form of sexism is apparent in President Trump's attacks on Hillary Clinton during her campaign when she reinforced the value of her gender. Benevolent sexism, the view that women should be cared for by men, holds positive stereotypes towards women but still views them as subordinate to men. This upholds the view that men should be in political positions of power, emphasizing gender inequality. The effects of sexism and sexual objectification result in the negative perception of female candidates and subsequently their poor performance, thus sexism has a noticeably detrimental impact on the success of women in political elections and this trend is evident in Presidential Elections. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her 23 July 2020 address to Congress, condemned Rep. Congressman Ted Yoho stating, he had shown the world “that you can be a powerful man and accost women”. She added, “Having a wife does not make a decent man.” The address was made three days after Republican Congressman Yoho called Cortez, a “f****** b****” on the Capitol Hill on 20 July 2020. Celebrities and politicians hailed Alexandria for her comments and for standing up against sexism at work.  Sexism towards transgender candidates  Transgender persons are significantly underrepresented in political positions. Only 0.1% of elected officials in the US openly identify as LGBTQ. This leads to a severe lack of LGBTQ role models. This causes LGBTQ identifying persons who might want to run for political office to be discouraged from doing so. The psychological importance of role models has been scientifically proven, demonstrating how the lack of LGBTQ people in politics can discourage new ones from running.  The role of media  Since the first televised presidential debate in 1960, the rise of media, especially visual media, has had increased importance on political elections. By televising elections, more emphasis was placed on the physical appearance of the candidates and how that reflected their perceived ability or skill. As well, the idea of what a president looked like was cemented in American minds as a white male. This such coverage has only increased since the rise of social media. This poses additional challenges to female candidates. They have difficulties getting equal news coverage to their male counterparts, receiving 50% less coverage. When covered, the information emphasizes on the female candidates’ personal traits, such as physical appearance, rather than their positions on political issues. Research has also found that voters put more value in qualities seen as masculine and rank male candidates as more effective than their female counterparts who are similarly qualified. But, when women try to use more traditionally masculine approaches, they are portrayed in the media as too angry or aggressive. This also crosses over into a female candidate's physical appearance. The Barbara Lee Family Foundation advised a “powerful yet approachable” look in a guidebook meant for female candidates, pointing to a women's need to balance traits viewed as masculine and feminine. Women politicians are also scrutinized in the media for their family lives. Female candidates without families are portrayed as not able to understand the average American family, while women with kids are seen as distracted by their additional responsibilities of motherhood. Through media coverage, sexist tropes against female candidates can be amplified. Media platforms give pundits with sexism-laced rhetoric an opportunity to spread their message. During the 2008 presidential campaign, candidate Hillary Clinton began to tear up when speaking about her experiences running. In response, comedian Bill Maher said, “The first thing a woman does, of course, is cry,” despite all of the other campaign moments in which Clinton did not cry.  Likability  A key component of political campaigns is a candidate's likability. Although likability applies to candidates of all gender identities, female candidates are disproportionately affected. As of September 2019, women are underrepresented in Congress (24% of House and Senate seats are held by women, but they comprise over 50% of the United States population). Hurdles can exist in electing more women. Sociologist Marianne Cooper writes that women are judged in such different ways than their male counterparts because “their very success violates our expectations about how women are supposed to behave.\\" She adds that the simple under-representation of women means people don't have the ability to expect women in authority positions. This concept can be applied to government as well: because of female under-representation in government, female candidates are held to preexisting, oftentimes toxic expectations, which in turn damage a candidate's likability. These expectations are oftentimes not straightforward. Sexism can be expressed through both implicit and explicit means; this is reflected in how people view women in positions of authority, including female political candidates. For example, explicit bias against women can be seen in attack ads that deride candidates for being feminists, as seen with former House candidate Amy McGrath. An example of implicit gender bias is challenging a woman's credentials and qualifications, as seen in attacks against Senator Jacky Rosen’s campaign.

Bobby Berosini Bohumil Berousek, known professionally as Bobby BerosiniPETA v. Bobby Berosini from the Supreme Court of Nevada is a Czech-born American entertainer best known for his long-running show involving live orangutans. Berosini emigrated from Czechoslovakia in 1964, and eventually made his way to Las Vegas. He was a fixture at the Stardust Resort & Casino starting in the mid-1970s, and his act was featured in Going Ape!, a 1981 comedy film starring Tony Danza and Danny DeVito. Earlier, in 1978, one of his orangutans, Manis, appeared as Clyde in Every Which Way but Loose with Clint Eastwood. In 1989 a Stardust dancer secretly videotaped Berosini grabbing, slapping, punching and shaking his orangutans before going on stage with them. The dancer, Ottavio Gesmundo, sent the tapes to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and the resulting outcry forced the Stardust to cancel Berosini's act for a few days. He returned to star in the \\"Lido de Paris\\" at the Stardust until it closed in 1991 and then starred in the resort's \\"Enter the Night\\" for several years. Although he later moved his act to Branson, Missouri, he has only made sporadic appearances in Las Vegas since then. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service later canceled Berosini's wildlife permit. Berosini sued Gesmundo, PETA and another animal rights group, the Performing Animal Welfare Society, for defamation and invasion of privacy. In 1990, a jury found in favor of Berosini and awarded him $3.1 million in damages. However, the Nevada Supreme Court threw out the judgment in 1994, saying that the tape was an accurate portrayal of Berosini's behavior and fell within the realm of \\"protected opinion.\\" It also ruled that Berosini had no expectation of privacy in the crowded backstage area.High court throws out $4.2 million judgment animal trainer won in libel, privacy suit This judgment was affirmed on a rehearing of the case a year later, and in 1996, a Nevada District Court judge ordered Berosini to pay a total of $417,000 in attorneys' fees to PETA and PAWS.Geer, Carri. Animal rights group's requests on Berosini assets rejected. Las Vegas Review-Journal, 1998-04-30. PETA subsequently alleged that Berosini had moved more than $2 million out of the country to avoid paying court costs. Berosini and his wife, Joan, claimed that the money was for a land investment in Central and South America. In February 2000, a federal magistrate ordered Berosini to return the money, finding that Berosini was deliberately hiding his assets.Geer, Carri. Berosini ordered to return $2 million to United States. Las Vegas Review-Journal, 2000-02-15. Berosini and PETA agreed to a settlement in which Berosini paid $340,000 in court costs and interest. However, two years later, Berosini was ordered to pay three law firms $250,000 for the time they spent trying to find the $2 million.Former showman and his wife ordered to pay three law firms. Las Vegas Review-Journal, 2002-03-11. Berosini contested this judgment four times on appeal and lost each time, and PETA claims that it is considering further legal action against Berosini for filing a frivolous appeal.Court rules that orangutan beater must pay PETA attorneys--PETA press release Berosini told Harper's Magazine in 1993 that he and his wife received numerous death threats against themselves and their orangutans in the middle of the night.

Biography = Career  After he obtained his agrégation d'histoire in 1967, Patrick Le Roux defended his State thesis entitled L'armée romaine et l'organisation des provinces ibériques d'Auguste à l'invasion de 409 in March 1980 at the Bordeaux Montaigne University under the direction of Robert Étienne. A member of the Casa de Velázquez, he taught Roman history at Paris West University Nanterre La Défense then at Toulouse II, Rennes II and Paris XIII of which he is emeritus professor. He also took part to excavations in Conimbriga (Portugal) and Baelo Claudia (Province of Cádiz) and more specifically in the of the forum.  Contribution to Roman history  If he first worked on the Roman army and remained faithful throughout his professional career to the history of Roman Spain and epigraphic sources, Patrick Le Roux brought his analysis and reflection of historian of antiquity to questions as diverse as those related to Latin law, the world of cities, Roman citizenship and Roman western provinces. He actively participated in several important debates within the community, for example on \\"romanisation\\". Finally, he has contributed to the systematic inclusion of historiographical constructions in research on Roman history. His current work focuses on the Roman provincial stories compared to contemporary national models, without neglecting research on the inscriptions, cities and armies of Roman times.

Life He was born in Naumburg am Queis in Silesia, now in Poland. He came from a family of musicians and was taught early on by his father. As a child he was a chorister of Vincent Church in Wroclaw. From the age of 12 he attended the Matthias Gymnasium because he wanted to become a priest. However chronic ear- ache developed after he fell into some water and he was considered to be no longer suitable for a priest's life. After he left the Gymnasium he began teacher-training. In 1790 he became a school-master. He was noticed because of the good music performances of his pupils. From 1797 he worked as a violinist at the Vincenzkirche in Breslau, now in Poland, and later as an organist at St. Klara. In 1798 he became a violinist and concertmaster in Breslau's theatre orchestra. On April 1, 1805 he was its Director of Music. In 1812 he became the Director of Music at the university, also teaching at the Catholic seminary and was also director of the Royal Institute of Sacred Music. In 1819 he founded the Association of Sacred Music at the university with Friedrich Wilhelm Berner and Johann Theodor Mosewius. Schnabel was awarded the honorary doctorate in 1823. His son Joseph Schnabel, who also composed, was an organist and music teacher in Glogau. He died on 16 June 1831 in Breslau. Compositions Schnabel's compositional work consisted mainly of instrumental church music. He established an especially Silesian tradition, also known as the Breslau School. Schnabel's most famous work is based on material that he found in the archives of the Wrocław cathedral by an unknown composer of the early 18th century, the piece is known as Transeamus usque Bethlehem and this is now part of the standard repertoire of many church choirs. * Herr, unser Gott! * Four Hymns for vespers * Inclina Domine * Missa in E/A * Mass in F minor * Mass in G * Graduale: Natum vidimus * (arrangement) In addition to church music, Schnabel composed military music, songs for male quartets, a clarinet concerto and a quintet for string quartet and guitar.

You have to know that Israel will remain our first enemy.\\" *The Popular Mobilization Forces of Iraq congratulated Trump on Twitter and stated that \\"together we will defeat ISIS\\". * Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) Head of Foreign Relations Falah Mustafa Bakir said: \\"I want to congratulate Mr. Donald Trump on becoming the next president of the United States, after a hard-fought campaign.

The series theme was performed by electronic pop duo Nova Social. The series debuted on June 1, 2008 on the Cartoon Network channel in the intervals of The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack; and was used thereafter as an interstitial until 2010, when it was moved to Cartoon Network's sister-network Boomerang, where it ran till 2015. The cartoon series consists of five two-and-a-half-minute episodes: “Hydrant,” “Bones,” “Flying Discs,” “Stink,” and “Sniff.” In form, the series is a parody of spy thrillers of the James Bond variety, in which the eponymous Cat-22, an agent for a secret organization of cats directed by Gato Primo (voiced by Garrett Fisher),The name \\"Gato Primo\\" comes from Matt Schwartz's original sketch for the character.

Thereupon, 22 is seen in \\"disguise\\" (a brown beanie with doggie ears), attempting to gain information from his moronic canine friend, Guthrie (David Markus) (and, on occasion, the brutal bulldog, Percy); invariably, complications follow, involving comic injury and humiliation, which are generally only heightened by Gato's attempts to extract him from the situation.

The main block of the brick house, built about 1830, is an important early work of a regional master builder, and it is attached to an older wood-frame ell. It was built on land that was among the first to be settled in the eastern part of the town. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The Kemp-Shepard House stands in a rural area of eastern Georgia, on the north side of Highbridge Road just east of its crossing over an inlet of Arrowhead Mountain Lake. It stands on about of land, a remnant of a once-larger farm property, much of which was inundated when the lake was formed in 1937. The main block is a 1-1/2 story brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof and stone foundation. To the rear of this is an attached wood-frame gable- roofed wing. The main block is three bays wide, with the main entrance set in a recessed opening in the right bay, flanked by sidelight windows. The door and windows are set in rectangular openings with stone sills and lintels. There are two sash windows on the attic level, with a diamond-shaped brickwork pattern nearer the gable. The cornice edge of the gable consists of corbelled brickwork. The interior retains many original finishes. The rear wing exhibits late 18th century construction techniques in its framing, and its original vertical batten siding has been covered by wooden clapboards. with The Kemp- Shepard property was first settled in the 1780s or early 1790s, at which time the c. property had a log cabin built on it; this cabin was demolished in the 1980s. A wood-frame farmhouse, the ell of the present house, was built sometime between 1790 and 1810. About 1830 the main block of the house was built. It is the earliest known work of Levi N. Kemp, a poorly documented mason whose known surviving work is of very high quality. The brickwork appearing on this house was emulated in part by other masons, who built some of the other surviving brick houses in the area. The house remained in the hands of Kemp descendants (later named Shepard) into the late 20th century, and did not receive modern amenities such as plumbing and electricity until the 1980s.

History In the late 2014, Poramin Insom, a student in Masters in Security Informatics from Johns Hopkins University wrote a paper on implementing the zerocoin protocol into a cryptocurrency with Matthew Green as faculty member. The project to create a standalone cryptocurrency implementing the Zerocoin protocol was named \\"Moneta\\". On 28 September 2016, Zcoin (XZC), the first cryptocurrency to implement the zerocoin protocol, was launched by Poramin Insom and team. Roger Ver and Tim Lee were Zcoin's initial investors. Poramin also set up an exchanged named \\"Satang\\" that can convert Thai Baht to Zcoin directly. On 20 February 2017, a malicious coding attack on Zerocoin protocol created 370,000 fake tokens which perpetrators sold for over 400 Bitcoins ($440,000). Zcoin team announced that a single-symbol error in a piece of code \\"allowed an attacker to create Zerocoin spend transactions without a corresponding mint\\". Unlike Ethereum during the DAO event, developers have opted not to destroy any coins or attempt to reverse what happened with the newly generated ones. In April 2018, a cryptographic flaw was found in the Zerocoin protocol which allowed attackers to steal, destroy, and create Zcoins. The Zcoin cryptocurrency team while acknowledging the flaw, stated the high difficulty in performing such attacks and the low probability of giving economic benefit to the attacker. In September 2018, Zcoin introduced the Dandelion protocol that hides the origin IP address of a sender without using The Onion Router (Tor) or Virtual Private Network (VPN). In November 2018, Zcoin conducted the world's first large-scale party elections for Thailand Democrat Party using blockhain instead of relying the election commission to count the votes. In December 2018, Zcoin implemented Merkle tree proof, a mining algorithm that deters the usage of Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) in mining coins by being more memory intensive for the miners. This allows ordinary users to use central processing unit (CPU) and graphics card for mining, so as to enable egalitarianism in coin mining. In the same month, Zcoin released an academic paper proposing the Lelantus protocol that remove the need of trusted setup and hides the origin and the amount of coins in a transaction. In February 2019, Zcoin was added to wallet supported by Binance cryptocurrency exchange. In the same month, Zcoin partnered with Binance Charity Foundation to raise funds for \\"Lunch for Children\\" program in Africa. The charity used blockchain to track and verify the progress of funds from donor to receiver. On 30 July 2019, Zcoin formally departed from the zerocoin protocol by adopting a new protocol called \\"Sigma\\" that prevents counterfeit privacy coins from inflating coin supply. This is achieved by removing a feature called \\"trusted setup\\" from the zerocoin protocol. In August 2019, Zcoin was added to an Africian cryptocurrency exchange named OVEX. In December 2019, Zcoin introduced a decentralised crowdfunding and decision making system to fund ancillary tasks for the project. In January 2020, Zcoin will implement Receiver Address Privacy (RAP) so that users can share a single permanent address to the public to receive money without the outsiders knowing any transaction history in the address. In May 2020, Zcoin announced that all founder rewards will be ceased, while at the same time increase development funding to 15% of the block reward, and allocated 35% of the block reward to masternodes. Besides, a US$100,000 reserve fund was set up to protect against price volatility. In September 2020, Zcoin completed first halving of block rewards.

It was designed by Foster and Partners and developed by HB Reavis.CTBUH Global News: Construction Begins in Warsaw on Poland’s Future Tallest Building Once completed, it will become the tallest building in Poland and in the European Union at 310-metres (1,017 ft) in height. Varso Tower is estimated to be completed by 2020.https://warszawa.naszemiasto.pl/varso- osiagnie-310-metrow-do-konca-roku-taras-widokowy-na/ar/c1-7523269  Design and construction  The Varso complex is located in Wola district, in the corner of Chmielna Street and John Paul II Avenue. Construction takes place on a plot of 1.72 ha, purchased in 2011 from PKP (Polish State Railways) by the Slovak company HB Reavis for ca. 171 mln PLN. The estimated cost of the construction is at around 500 mln EUR. Initially the project was named Chmielna Business Center and was later changed to Varso, which references Latin name for Warsaw - Varsovia.  Project  Original plan was to build a 130 m tall skyscraper. Project was later revised and total height of Varso Tower was increased to 310 m including a spire surmounting the building. Varso Place is a complex of three buildings: a 310 m main tower (roof height reaching 230 m with 80 m spire on top) and two buildings with a height of 81 m and 90 m called respectively Varso 1 & Varso 2. The total area of the Varso Place is 140000 m² with 10 300 m² dedicated to commercial services. British based architecture studio Foster and Partners designed the main tower and HRA Architekci was responsible for designing the remaining Varso 1 and Varso 2 buildings. At a height of 230 meters, Vista Terrace will become a public observation deck offering panoramic views of the city (current tallest observation deck in the city of Warsaw is located on 30th floor of Palace of Culture and Science at a height of 114 m). A restaurant and a bar called Skytop Restaurant & Bar will occupy 46th and 48th floors. All three buildings will be connected to each other on the ground floor level and the entire complex will be connected to Warsaw Central station. A four storey underground car park will accommodate approximately 1100 cars, 80 motorbikes and 750 bicycles. Modernising surrounding Chmielna Street is a part of the investment and it will include new pavements, street lamps, benches, bike stands and signage as well as planting shrubs and trees.  Construction timeline  The general contractor is HB Reavis Construction - a company from the HB Reavis Group. The building permit for Varso was obtained in December 2016 with construction work commencing the same month. In October 2017, at a depth of 10 m, a 60 ton glacial erratic was excavated at the construction site. It was pulled out using a specialized crane and then transported to Mokotów Field, where it stood next to the National Library. In the future, it will be moved back and displayed next to the entrance of Varso Tower. Varso Tower under construction, 2019 Varso 1 (81 m) will be the first to open in February 2020, with a two-level fitness club (Zdrofit) and a clinic. A four-star NYX hotel offering 331 rooms will open in May. Varso 2 (90 m) will open in May including the Cambridge Innovation Center and BGK bank. A passage along the first floors of all VARSO buildings will be gradually opened throughout the year. Varso Gallery will include restaurants, bars and many services including Nutrimind Group, Menya Musashi, Karmello, Salad Story, Vincent, Wrap Me, table and Ox and Quattro Formaggi as well as beauty salon Nail Spa, travel agency Sun Way Travel and currency exchange. Autumn 2020 - Varso Tower will reach a height of 236 m (surpassing the roof height of the Palace of Culture and Science). December 2020/ January 2021 - The 80 m spire will be installed taking the total height to 310 m. End 2021 - End of the construction. 2022 - companies will start occupying Varso Tower, Skytop Restaurant & Bar and Vista Terrace will open.https://varso.com/ See also *List of tallest buildings in Poland *Architecture of Warsaw References Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Warsaw ","title":"Varso"},{"id":"52227174","text":"Havrevold is a surname.

He served as imperial secretary, and possibly protasekretis, under three emperors, Romanos I Lekapenos, Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, and Romanos II, rising to the ranks of patrikios and magistros, and the post of Eparch of the City. Daphnopates' public career ended with the accession of Nikephoros II Phokas in 963, when he went into retirement. Daphnopates also participated in the encyclopaedism movement, writing several homilies and theological as well as historical works, few of which survive. Daphnopates is best known for his surviving correspondence, and is considered by some modern scholars as the author of the last section of the chronicle of Theophanes Continuatus.  Life  Daphnopates was probably born between 890 and 900. He was of Armenian origin, and apparently spoke Armenian, as he translated a letter by the Bishop of Siwnik, written in Armenian, into Greek. Although he lived and worked in Constantinople, his family hailed from elsewhere, as he records in a letter a visit by his mother by ship to Pylae, on the Asian shore of the Propontis, probably during the early 920s. During the return trip, Daphnopates himself nearly drowned when a heavy storm came upon his ship. Only with great effort and luck was the ship able to reach the coast at Cape Akritas. Daphnopates first appears in the sources in the mid-920s, having apparently entered the service of the imperial court shortly before. In 924/5, Daphnopates composed three replies of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944), to letters by Tsar Symeon I of Bulgaria. In these letters, Romanos I criticized Symeon as rapacious and warlike, while trying to move him to accept a peace bringing an end to the long war between Byzantium and Bulgaria. Ten more letters to rulers and ecclesiastical leaders in Bulgaria and Armenia, written on behalf of Romanos I in the period 925–933, survive, indicating that Daphnopates probably held the post of head of the imperial chancery (protasekretis). A number of modern scholars—Ivan Dujčev, R. J. H. Jenkins, and Patricia Karlin-Hayter—have suggested that Daphnopates was the author of the anonymous speech celebrating the conclusion of peace with Bulgaria in 927 () and the concurrent marriage of Tsar Peter, the son and successor of Symeon, with Maria Lekapene, the granddaughter of Romanos I. The Greek historian Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka however rejected this identification. Daphnopates remained active in the imperial chancery under Constantine VII (r. 913–920, 945–59) after 945. In late 945/6 he composed a symbolic letter addressed by the emperor to Saint Gregory of Nazianzus (Letter No. 11). At about the same time he also wrote a letter to the emperor himself concerning a eulogy on a recently deceased person, identified by modern scholars with Romanos Lekapenos, who died on 15 June 948. In return, the emperor sent a courtier with rich gifts. Daphnopates' further activity under Constantine VII is obscure, but he reappears under his successor Romanos II (r. 959–963) in the same capacity. Three letters (Nos. 13, 14, 16) survive addressed to the emperor, and one letter (No. 15) by Romanos II to Daphnopates. Romanos II further promoted Daphnopates to the high post of Eparch of the City. Letter No. 15 indicates his closeness to the emperor, who requested him to interpret a dream that he had had. In accordance to this dream, the emperor intended to reinstate an anonymous leading official, who some modern scholars have identified as Daphnopates' predecessor and eventual successor as Eparch, Sisinnios, or the Patriarch of Constantinople, Polyeuctus. Either because he was directly affected, or because he was not in favour of restoring the official in question, Daphnopates sent an evasive reply. After the death of Romanos II on 15 March 963, Daphnopates apparently composed his funeral oration. Shortly after, following the rise of Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969) to the throne, he retired from public service. The most probable reason for this retirement was his age, since he does not appear to have been punished in any way by the new regime. Daphnopates continued to correspond with high officials, including his successors, Sissinios and Constantine, keeping up connections or intervening on behalf of former colleagues. To the same period probably are to be dated two further letters consoling disgraced officials.  Writings  Apart from his political work and his correspondence, Daphnopates was an active author, although most of his works do not survive. He wrote a number of homilies and hagiographies (on Saint George, Theophanes the Confessor, and of version A of the hagiography of Theodore Stoudites; the latter is sometimes attributed to Michael Monomachos), as well as composing a collection of excerpts of John Chrysostom, in what Alexander Kazhdan called \\"a work typical of 10th-century encyclopaedism\\". The 11th-century historian John Skylitzes mentions him as having written a chronicle which he used, and as Skylitzes made use of parts of Theophanes Continuatus for earlier events, modern scholarship generally considers him the author of the final portion of the Theophanes Continuatus, bringing the work up to 963. His authorship has been rejected, however, by several scholars, including A. Markopoulos (\\"Theodore Daphnopatès et la Continuation de Théophane\\", JÖB 35 (1985), pp. 171–182), the authors of the French edition of Skylitzes' history, Bernard Flusin and Jean-Claude Cheynet, and by the editors of Daphnopates' correspondence, J. Darrouzès and L. G. Westerink. Daphnopates' correspondence, including an epitaph on Romanos II, was published in a critical edition by J. Darrouzès and L. G. Westerink: Théodore Daphnopatès, Correspondance, Paris: CNRS (1978). For his theological and hagiographical works, cf. V. Latyšev, \\"Dve reči Feodora Dafnopata\\", PPSb 59 (1910), pp. 15–38.

The possibilities for such technological mediation depend on the type of LMOOC proposed. There are several types of courses identified in the literature, but the two most common ones are cMOOCs and xMOOCs.Downes, S. (2008). Places to go: Connectivism & connective knowledge.

Cetis White Paper. The former, inspired by the notions of open education (techniques and resources), do not run on a single platform (but are distributed across many), promote immersion and interaction. The latter usually represent a continuation of other types of e-Learning courses that institutions have undertaken and, therefore, have a similar course structure, following standard face-to-face educational models. For LMOOCs based upon an xMOOC platform, the resources and tools available for students typically include: textual materials in the form of Web pages, structured PDF files or URLs to content outside the platform, audiovisual recordings (often developed and stored on social video sites such as YouTube or Vimeo), tasks and exercises such as closed multiple-choice tests that are the basic evaluation mechanism, open answers ,for example, based upon free writing, which can be compared to model answers or evaluated using peer-to- peer correction and, lastly, forums that represent a key component for learners to interact and practice mediated communication in the target language, providing a valuable mechanism for students to help each other and answers their peers' questions. For LMOOCs based upon the cMOOC model, a range of online Web 2.0 tools can be used so as to enable students to undertake the remixing, repurpose and co-create content and interaction, promoting the community nature of collaborative and social learning. xMOOC activities are typically highly structured and may not, as such, provide students with the communicative opportunity required to use what has just been seen and/or heard in an open and flexible way, including fine-grained feedback of different and complementary types. However, conversely, the often unstructured and constantly changing nature of cMOOCs together with, as Brennan (2014) notes, the cognitive load related to the sheer volume of information, number of tweets, posts, etc., available; the varying degrees of difficulty of activities (with little if any guidance available); and the need to use different tools and platforms, etc., can offer learners additional difficulties. Current research (Sokolik, 2014) attempts to combine the benefits of both types of model.  New student and instructor profiles and roles  Castrillo de Larreta-Azelain (2014), being one of the first published papers that focuses on the roles, competences and methodological strategies of teachers in LMOOCs, on the basis of empirical research, identifies their main roles from a theoretical and practical standpoint.Castrillo de Larreta- Azelain, MD (2014). Language Teaching in MOOCs: the Integral Role of the Instructor. In E. Martin Monje & E. Barcena (eds.) Language MOOCs: Providing Learning, Transcending Boundaries. (2014).

CALL, 18(4), 311–326. (Hampel & Stickler, 2005) although focusing on Crompton's framework,Compton, L. K.L. (2009). Preparing language teachers to teach language online: a look at skills, roles, and responsibilities. Computer Assisted Language Learning, 22:1, 73-99. (Crompton, 2009) which includes the three major sets of online language teaching: technology, pedagogy and evaluation. The author's proposed model for redefining the teacher's role in this area is designed according to the different stages present in a LMOOC. The main task of the teaching teams in LMOOCs is shifted almost completely to the design and elaboration of the course before it actually takes place. It is argued that the instructional design necessary for the course requires a systematic, sequential plan based on Mastery Learning that consists of four steps. Moreover, the application of heuristic strategies to help present and transmit the contents of the course is suggested. In LMOOCs, teachers need to become curators, facilitators, leaders and administrators, solving problems, suggesting complementary material, moderating forums, motivating students, and overseeing the whole learning experience during the course. Finally, before, during, and after the LMOOC, instructors are also researchers, collectors, and analyzers of learners' data. As for students, Anderson et al.(2014)Anderson, A., Huttenlocher, D., Kleinberg, J. y Leskovec, J. (2014). Engaging with massive online courses. In WWW'14 Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World Wide Web. New York: ACM. 687-698. identify five different possible roles that MOOC participants can adopt: \\"1. Viewers, who primarily watch lectures, handing in few – if any – assignments. 2. Solvers, who mainly hand in assignments for a grade, viewing few – if any – of the audiovisual materials. 3. All-rounders, those who balance the watching of the videos with the handing in of assignments. 4. Collectors, who mostly download lectures, handing in a few assignments. Unlike the viewers, they may or may not be actually watching the lectures. 5. Bystanders, those who registered for the course but may not even log in at all.\\"  Accessibility  MOOCs are examples of the evolution of e-Learning environments towards a more revolutionary computer and mobile- based scenario along with social technologies that will lead to the emergence of new kinds of learning applicationsKop, R., & Bouchard, P.

The next generation: design and the infrastructure for learning in a mobile and networked world. In: Olofsson, A. D., and Lindberg, J. Ola (Eds.). Informed Design of Educational Technologies in Higher Education: Enhanced Learning and Teaching. Hershey, PA: Information Science Reference (an Imprint of IGI Global). 57–78. These applications should take advantage of the unique conditions of mobility and the ubiquity of Internet access, exploring successful actions for education. However, the access to MOOC platforms still present barriers, there is also a lack of accessibility on the learning resources, the communicating tools, and even less personalized user interfaces. All these issues present definitively barriers that add extra difficulties, such as the need to develop specific digital or even social skills for students with functional diversity. Students using assistive technologies may have problems while navigating in the MOOC environment, accessing the platform (registration process), and even using the learning content contained in the platform. A driving force has been precisely the beneficial application of multimedia and audiovisual content in the area of education to favor language learning, the majority of web applications and pages are based on collections of shared visual and audio-visual resources (such as Flickr or YouTube). MOOCs are also full of video-presentations, animations, automatic self-assessment (some of them multimedia-based) integrated into them. This introduction of audiovisual content into e-Learning platforms adds a new difficulty to the accessibility requirements since they include new elements that widen the digital divide and not only for people with disabilities. How MOOCs are designed, how their interfaces work, how communication is handled, how assessments take place (for instance, the way a student has to record his/her audio for a language speaking recording) and what form the learning content takes, all issues impact on the accessibility of these systems. The challenge for any language learning environment is one of accessibility in terms of the community with whom it wishes to engage, ensuring that processes such as enrolling in a course, navigating the system, accessing learning and assessment materials, and peer interacting are achievable through the use of assistive technologies. Moreover, in accessible language learning there are still some challenges to be faced, namely: * Readability: the precise identification of theoretical concepts should be to provide audio and images through the combination of text (which should be correctly semantically tagged). * Personalisation: the MOOC platforms must be capable of user's personalization, in terms of: profile selection, colors, enough contrast, voice-activated assistants) that will help to capture student's attention. * Means for communication: anxiety is one of the main variables that affect students with disabilities while facing this type of learning. As much communication tools are provided, the disorder is diminished. * Intelligibility: in speech communication, intelligibility is a measure of how comprehensible speech is in given conditions and is negatively impacted by background noise and reverberation. A MOOC interface design is often determined by the platform since some of the features – learning and testing tools – cannot be edited or customized by the academic assistants. Its materials and its mode of delivery might adhere to a set of accessibility standards. The majority of learning activities undertaken continues to take place using some hardware/software that was not designed for its specific use with educational applications and, hence, usability issues often arise. Moreover, there are technical problems or incompatibility, when it is not possible to have the required technology, or it is not possible to obtain materials in alternative formats. Moreover, MOOC environments typically contain a variety of components that do not always share a consistency of interface logic or interactive elements, ranging from posts in a forum, making up elements in tests or timed quizzes through playing embedded videos or downloading a variety of document formats. Video lectures are key elements in the MOOC model, and the hurdles of interacting with the platform or content should be minimized. -However, alternative accessible formats, subtitles, and/or sign language interpreters for audiovisual materials, audio-description recordings are not easily available even though there exist great guidelines, such as Sánchez (2013).Sánchez, E. (2013). Usability guidelines for labeling MOOC video lectures Web site: http://uxthoughtsabout.wordpress.com/2013/06/11/small-details-matter- videolectures-page The pedagogical and visual design of the MOOCs, their information architecture, usability and visual and interaction design could be having a negative impact on student engagement, retention and completion rates as it has been previously analyzed in adult learning.Tyler-Smith, K. (2006). Early attrition among first-time eLearners: A review of factors that contribute to drop-out, withdrawal, and non-completion rates of adult learners undertaking eLearning programs. Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, 2(2), 73-85. Whilst designing a service based on MOOCs to be used by people with functional diversity, it is important to consider the accessibility level of each of the parts of the system and also the role of the meta-information related to functional diversity, for instance, to define specific user profiles. Although the usual accessibility barriers may remain, the model of large scale participation and social accessibilityTakagi, H., Kawanaka, S., Kobayashi, M., Itoh, T., & Asakawa, C. (2008).

If enough interaction between users exists, students within the system can learn from their fellow students and make a contribution by helping their fellow students. In the end, resources can be media enriched, achieving a greater level of quality: transcriptions for mind mapping, audio recordings for podcasting, etc. All resources grouped together into learning resource collections that will benefit all of the stakeholders and the variety of the ubiquitous processes. The flexibility of the language learning service offered by MOOCs to learn at any time, place and pace, enhancing continuous communication and interaction between all participants in knowledge and community building, especially benefits this disadvantaged group which can, therefore, improve their level of employability and social inclusion, where language learning plays such an important role.  Challenges  The MOOC model, while opening up education to a larger audience, also faces difficulties that will have to be overcome before they can replace other approaches to online teaching and learning. Some of these challenges are general to all MOOCsChen, X., Barnett, D. R., & Stephens, C. (2013). Fad or future: The advantages and challenges of massive open online courses (MOOCs).

Regarding the former, given that most courses are essentially xMOOCs, then they are intended to provide the same learning experience to all students who undertake them, thereby limiting possibilities for individual instruction and personalized learning. A further problem is that of student assessment, how to do it and how to prevent cheating,Carr, N. (2012, September 27). The crisis in higher education.

European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning. http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ982976.pdf closed tests are typically used but lack the flexibility of open written / oral answers. High dropout rates and the associated lack of participation within the forums also limit the possibilities for collaborative learning, so necessary for the development of many different competences. Finally, the economic issue of how to cover the expenses of preparing, running and managing a course. The former or specific challenges of a Language MOOC reflect the nature of learning a language as a skill acquisition process as well as one of knowledge assimilation, where the students need to actually use and apply the linguistic structures which they are learning in a realistic setting with quality (near-) native feedback. Research on language MOOCs, and related technology and methodology, offer ways to address some of these challenges, motivating students and implicating them more fully in learning activities related to the development of their second language competences. Furthermore, as the nature of society changes, then so to will the way in which online language learning is undertaken. As in other areas of online learning, the role of mobile devices is becoming ever more important here, leading to the notion of mobile-driven or mobile-assisted LMOOCs, or MALMOOCs, where such devices go beyond being just portable course clients to act as mobile sensor-enabled based around extensible app-based devices that can extend language learning into everyday real-world activities. Other emerging educational technologies that will arguably be important for LMOOCs cover areas, such as learning analytics, gamification, personal learning networks, adaptive and automated assessment.

Kukuczka was assassinated during an attempt to threaten the Polish embassy in East Germany into allowing him to migrate to West Berlin, becoming one of only three non-German escapee victims of the Berlin Wall. Biography Czesław Jan Kukuczka was born on 23 July 1935, in Kamienica, in Limanowa County, Poland, and grew up there. As a young boy, the local magazine “Gorczańskie Wieści\\" mentioned him as \\"the most active of the hotheads - young, full of ideas, and capable of dedication.\\" At the age of 17, Kukuczka was recruited to participate in the construction of Nowa Huta, a socialist model city on the eastern outskirts of Krakow being built by the Polish People's Republic, but soon returned home disillusioned with his work there. A year later, at 18 years-old, Kukuczka was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to two and a half years in prison in Nowy Sącz and Jaworzno, but was released after one year on parole. Shortly after his release Kukuczka was married and would father three children, and subsequently worked again in construction before working as a firefighter for the fire department in Jaworzno. On Sunday, 3 March 1974, Kukuczka disappeared without a trace and was not seen again until appearing on 29 March 1974, in East Berlin, East Germany.Biography at Chronik der Mauer.deBiography at Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer.deGrenzübergang Friedrichstraße Forscher rekonstruieren Fall um Mauertoten (Researchers at the former Friedrichstraße border crossing reconstruct the case around masonry), Berliner Zeitung Onliine, 6 November 2016 Death On Friday, 29 March 1974, at 12:30 PM, Kukuczka arrived at the Polish Embassy in East Berlin claiming to have an important message, and was admitted to the embassy without further control. He would be hosted by Colonel Maksymilian Karnowski, a member of the East Berlin operational group of the Polish Ministry of the Interior (MSW), and an employee named Olszewski. Kukuczka demanded that he be allowed to cross into West Berlin at 3:00 PM, via the border crossing and international train station at Friedrichstraße, and threatens to detonate a bomb that he was carrying with him, with the detonating cord connected to his left hand. Kukuczka also claimed that if his demands were not met, a supposed accomplice would bomb the Polish Information and Cultural Center on Karl-Liebknecht- Straße, and the events would be reported about in the western world because of another accomplice he claimed to have in West Berlin. Further in his conversation, Kukuczka indicated wishing to immigrate to the United States where he had aunts, and according to documents found on his person their address was in the city of Hollywood, Florida. Kukuczka was counting on Polish embassy personnel to create the necessary travel documents so he could leave East Berlin, which they did provide him with. Kukuczka departed the Polish Embassy at 2:40 PM with the necessary documents, and was transported to Bahnhof Friedrichstraße by a car belonging to the Stasi, the East German secret police. He disembarked at the train station, used the rest room, then attempted to make his way through the border security. West German students vising from Bad Hersfeld would reported to the police in West Berlin that they witnessed a shabbily dressed Kukuczka pass them unsuspectingly, who was then shot in the back by a civilian wearing a dark coat and tinted sunglasses just two meters from his victim, and was seriously injured but still alive. Strangely, Kukuczka was not transported to the Krankenhaus der Volkspolizei (People's Police Hospital), the nearest hospital where most victims of the Berlin Wall were taken, but instead to the hospital within the Stasi Prison in Hohenschönhausen, 10 kilometers away. By 6:30 PM, Kukuczka was dead from numerous internal injuries caused by the gunshot wounds. Kukuczka's widow in Poland, Emilia, was presented with an urn containing his remains on 24 May 1974, along with a package containing personal effects from her deceased husband, and a death certificate, all presented by the district prosecutor. The next day, the mayor of Kamienica reported that a church burial had taken place with only Kukuczka's close family in attendance, and the full details regarding his death, such as the fake bomb and the visit to the embassy, were not made known to the family or local residents until after the Berlin Wall fell. Aftermath Kukuczka is notable as one of only three known escapee deaths at the Berlin Wall to be neither German or an East German resident, along with Franciszek Piesik, also Polish, and Vladimir Odinzov, a Soviet soldier.

The book is historically significant, as it shows that black Southern cooking was not solely the domain of poverty cooking, but provides evidence of a sophisticated cosmopolitan skill with complex dishes. Early life Malinda Russell was born around 1812 in Washington County, Tennessee, and raised in Greene County. Little is known of her childhood, other than that her mother, Karon, died when Russell was a child. Karon was one of the first group of slaves freed by a man from Virginia named Mr. Noddie. Russell attained a high level of education for the period. In the 1830s, when Russell was around 19 years old, she traveled to Virginia with a certificate vouching for her character, written by a Doctor More. Her plan was to go from Lynchburg, Virginia, to Liberia. By the time she arrived, she was penniless, having been robbed by a fellow traveler, and took employment working for a Lynchburg family as a nurse and traveling companion. A slave woman, Fanny Steward, who had been freed by her Virginia master, taught Russell how to cook, using The Virginia House-wife written by Mary Randolph. Career Domestic Cook Book: Containing a Careful Selection of Useful Receipts for the Kitchen 1866 Russell became a cook, predominantly of baked goods. She married Anderson Vaughn while still in Virginia and had an invalid son with him. Vaughn died after four years and Russell began working as a laundress to support herself and their child. At some point, she returned to Tennessee and operated a boarding house on Chuckey Mountain near Cold Spring for three years. She then ran a successful pastry shop for around six years. When her Tennessee home was raided by traveling gangs of whites in 1864, she fled with her son to Paw Paw, Michigan, where she published the first known cookbook by a black woman, Domestic Cook Book: Containing a Careful Selection of Useful Receipts for the Kitchen, as a means to provide income for her and her son and earn money to return to Greeneville, Tennessee. Within months of her publication, the town of Paw Paw was destroyed by fire and further trace of Russell is unknown. Russell self-published her book, in 1866, giving a brief history of her life and stating in the preface to it that she hoped to earn passage to return home from its proceeds. Most of the recipes were for elegant deserts, like floating island, puff pastry and rose cake, along with main course dishes like catfish fricassee, Irish potatoes with cod, and sweet onion custard, containing none of the soul food traditionally accepted as Southern cuisine. She also provided recipes for ointments and colognes, as well as household tips. The book, containing 265 recipes, was written for people who already knew how to cook, as little instruction for preparation methods is given. Most recipes contain a list of ingredients, though in some cases, a cooking tip is provided. Legacy In 2000, the Domestic Cook Book was purchased by Jan Longone, an antique cookbook collector and curator of American culinary history at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor's William L. Clements Library from the collection of Helen Evans Brown. Longone realized that it was the first known cookbook written by an African American woman and spent the next seven years researching and trying to piece together Russell's history. Longone published information about the book and what she knew of Russell's life in Gastronomica (2001) and the article attracted attention. In 2007, Longone published a limited-edition facsimile of Russell's cookbook and held a symposium at the Clements Library, where she distributed the copies. Malinda Russell's A Domestic Cook Book is now held by the University of Michigan Library's Special Collections Research Center as part of the Janice Bluestein Longone Culinary Archive. PDF downloads are available for both the original 1866 work and the 2007 facsimile via Hathi Trust.

Built in 1869 as a single-family and enlarged into three units in 1890, it is a well-preserved example of period worker housing. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history The Normand House stands near the northern end of Burlington's Old North End neighborhood, on the west side of Intervale Avenue between Willow and Oak Streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a nearly flat shed roof, clapboarded exterior, and stone foundation. The building's architectural styling is limited to brackets in its eaves and a decorative spindled valance on the front porches. A covered stairway extends up the back of the right side, providing access to the rear unit of the building. The interior, significantly altered since the building's early construction, nevertheless retains some early woodwork. with The front portion of the house is its oldest, built in 1869 by Louis LaValle, a developer, for his personal use, and was one of the first houses built in the area. About 1890 it was converted into three units, raising the main block's roof from a gable to its present shed-roof configuration, and building a large ell onto the rear. It is from this period that the Queen Anne stylistic elements were added to the exterior. The original rear of the property, facing St. Mary's Street, had a second house built on it and was separated from this lot. The building was used as rental housing for workers for most of the 20th century.

View from Vallisaari Island to Suomenlinna and continental Helsinki. Vallisaari () is an island in Helsinki, Finland. It is located between Suomenlinna and Santahamina. The island has some ponds, and it was first known for hundreds of years as a place where sailors could take fresh water. Some fortifications were built on the island, but while neighbouring Suomenlinna became the main sea fort for Helsinki, Vallisaari was a supply point where cattle was grazing and firewood was collected. Sweden and Russia were at war in 1808 and the Russians besieged Suomenlinna, they used Vallisaari as their base. When ruling the Grand Duchy of Finland Russians began developing fortifications in Vallisaari. It was part of Krepost Sveaborg. After Finland gained its independence in 1917, weaponry of the Defence Forces was stored in Vallisaari until the 21st century. Ordnance, torpedoes, and mines were loaded and maintained; weather observations were made; and gas masks were repaired. There was some civilian population, too, which lead quite rural life farming on the island The civilian population was largest in the 1950s, when the island had even its own primary school. The Finnish Defence Forces gave up the islands in 2008 and Vallisaari was opened as tourism destination in 2016. Before the island was opened, vegetation has been cleared, stairs and railings build and info signs and dry toilets added. The plumbing is not in such a shape that it could be used any more. Now Vallisaari is the most diverse nature destination in the metropolitan area. The Russian history of the island is reflected in the plants, some of which were brought to the island with animal fodder. Military activities have kept the embankments and the meadows between fortifications open, thereby enriching the diversity of nature. Several rare insects and bats fly on the island.

Design and development Though the Handley Page H.P.20 had demonstrated the efficacy of leading edge slots used in coordination with flaps in delaying the onset of stall at high angles of attack in 1921, they were only adopted slowly across Europe. The Handley Page Gugnunc of 1929 had two groups of slots, one which opened with the flaps and the other automatically opened by air pressure changes as the stall approached. The Bodiansky 20 was one of the first French aircraft to use this system. It was also the first French aircraft to have a welded steel tube fuselage structure, made in the factory of the aircraft constructor S. Poite. The cantilever wing of the Bodiansky 20 was built in three parts, with a short-span, thick, rectangular plan central section and nearly triangular plan outer panels which carried 8° of dihedral and thinned linearly outwards. The aspect ratio of the wing, 10.9, was high. Structurally the central section was a welded steel tube part of the fuselage and the outer panels were wooden, each with two spars and plywood skinned. Slats, which opened to form the slots, filled the whole leading edges of the outer panels and were divided into two sections. These sections matched the division of the trailing edge into ailerons outboard and flaps inboard. The outer slots opened automatically on the approach of the stall, whereas the inboard slats deployed when the flaps were lowered to their single down setting. It was powered by a nose- mounted, Renault 4Pb, a four-cylinder, air-cooled, upright inline engine, though its mountings, part of the tubular fuselage structure, could accept engines with powers in the range . The exhaust was fitted with a silencer and its outlet was aft of the cabin. Fuel was held in two tanks in the wing centre-section and oil in the fuselage aft of the engine firewall. Its enclosed cabin, entered via centrally hinged, multi-part glazing, had two forward seats, equipped with dual controls, and a rear bench seat. It was normally flown from the left-hand seat, where the rudder bar was fitted with brake pedals. The flap lever was placed centrally. The fuselage was fabric covered apart from the engine area and the sloping fuselage roof and upper part aft of the cabin, which was covered with electron metal sheet. The tail of the Bodiansky 20 was conventional, with a small, triangular, in-flight adjustable tailplane mounted at the top of the fuselage frame. It carried generous, aerodynamically balanced elevators with a semi-elliptical trailing edge and was fitted with ground-adjustable trim tabs. The vertical tail was similar in profile and design to the horizontal surfaces; the rudder extended to the keel and worked in a deep elevator cut-out. Structurally these surfaces were steel tube framed and fabric covered. It had fixed tailwheel landing gear with a track of . The mainwheels, equipped with brakes, were independently mounted on bent axles hinged from the central fuselage and restrained by drag struts from the forward lower fuselage frames. Each wheel had a short, vertical oleo strut from the forward part of the outer end of the wing centre- section. The tailwheel castored and was sprung and damped with rubber rings. The Bodiansky 2 first flew on 6 July 1931. Only one, registered F-ALZB, was built and its subsequent history in unknown.

Two were built. Design and development The Adler (Eagle) was designed to be a fast, light transport aircraft, carrying payloads of over distances of around . It had thick section, low-set, high aspect ratio (10.8) wings and was powered by a Junkers L5 six-cylinder liquid-cooled inline engine. The wing was in three parts, with a very short, rectangular plan centre-section built into the fuselage structure and containing the fuel tanks. Its ends were braced on each side with pairs of streamlined steel struts to the upper fuselage. Long-span cantilever outer panels were strongly straight-tapered in plan and also tapered in thickness from below, giving the Adler 4° of dihedral. The wings were built around pairs of trellis type spars and covered with corrugated duralumin. High aspect ratio ailerons filled the outer halves of the trailing edges. The fuselage of the fuselage was based on a cross-braced, rectangular section steel frame. Its Junkers L5 engine was mounted in the nose and neatly cowled, with its oil tank aft of a firewall and a retractable honeycomb radiator on the fuselage underside. The region behind the engine contained an enclosed cockpit over the leading edge and a cabin which extended back to the trailing edge; the sides of this part of the fuselage were dural covered and its slightly shaped upper and lower surfaces canvas covered. The rear fuselage was entirely canvas covered. The cockpit contained two side-by-side seats provided with dual controls and was accessed via the cabin. This was a space long, wide and high, which could seat four, each with their own window, or be used to carry freight or mail. Aft of the cabin there was a small entry lobby with a port-side door and a facing, enclosed, toilet. The Adler did not have a conventional fin but the in-flight adjustable tailplane was mounted above the fuselage on a small, thin aerofoil-section step with its rear underside cut- away, and braced from below with a single strut on each side. The one-piece elevator was aerodynamically balanced. The rudder, also balanced, was hinged from the rear fuselage and the rear of the step. Its tailskid landing gear was fixed, with each mainwheel on its own bent axle from the central fuselage underside and with drag struts back to the lower fuselage frames. Short, near vertical, rubber shock absorber legs stood between the wheels and the forward spar at the extreme edge of the wing centre section. The tailskid was a steel tube with a wooden shoe. Operational history The exact date of the first flight of the Albatros L.83 Adler is unknown but was in the first half of 1931. Two were built. The history of the first (D-2024) is not known but the second (D-2211) was registered to the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (DVS) transport flying school in February 1932.

Ensminger was one among thousands of victims of the Camp Lejeune water contamination scandal, which is believed to be one of the largest water contamination incidents in United States history.  Life and Death of Janey Ensminger  Jane “Janey” Yoshi Ensminger was born on July 30, 1976 in South Carolina to Etsuko and Jerry Ensminger. Her mother is Japanese and her father is American. She was the only one of the Ensmingers’ children to have been conceived, carried or born while the family was living at Camp Lejeune. Janey was diagnosed with leukemia in 1983 and was the only child in the entire family’s known history to have been diagnosed with cancer. She was subjected to many bone marrow extractions and spinal taps, fighting the cancer for nearly 2½ years before succumbing to it. Right after her death, her parents divorced. H.R. 1742 H.R. 1742 was introduced into Congress by U.S. Representative Brad Miller on May 5, 2011. It was the result of Jerry Ensminger's conviction that Janey's leukemia was caused by toxic chemicals in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune, which Jerry did not know about until 1997, when a federal government report concluded that for nearly three decades the tap water at Camp Lejeune had been contaminated by toxic chemicals associated with childhood and adult cancers, especially leukemia. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law in 2012, saying at the White House ceremony that the country has a “moral and sacred duty” to care for those sickened by the contaminated drinking water.

Biography His family originally came from Ceraso, in the Province of Salerno. Around 1848, he began an apprenticeship with his father, Michele (c.1808-1865), who was also a painter and a great admirer of Titian. (Some of Michele's works may be seen at the Palace of Caserta, near Naples.) Illustration from Le Député d'Arcis In 1858, he met Léon Bonnat, who was studying in Rome. When Bonnat returned to Paris in 1860, Cortazzo decided to go with him; to take lessons and work in his studio. Having had a conservative education, he struggled to choose sides in the dispute between the Academics and the Impressionists.Sophie Monneret, L’Impressionnisme et son époque, Eds. Robert Laffont, 1991 He initially earned his living doing portraits for a largely bourgeois clientele and producing genre scenes on commission for Goupil & Cie.Biographical notes @ Stephen Ongpin Fine Art. He was, however, attracted by more \\"exotic\\" styles; especially Japanese painting. As a result, he created two works: \\"Japanese Fantasy\\" and \\"Japanese Woman\\", although they still displayed aspects of the Academic style. Some of his works also show the influence of photography.Clara Schiavone, \\"La pittura di Oreste Cortazzo\\", Annali Cilentani, #11, 1995, pgs.21-37 From 1870 to 1885, he was a regular participant in showings at the Salon. He also exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1878) and the International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry in Glasgow. After that, he derived inspiration from the English Romantics and produced numerous landscapes in that style. His works received honorable mention at the Exposition Universelle (1889). He also illustrated several works by Balzac, including the novels, La Rabouilleuse, Le Député d'Arcis, Albert Savarus and Un début dans la vie; the novelette, Peines de cœur d'une chatte anglaise and the essays, Petites misères de la vie conjugale, and Physiologie du mariage. He was also one of several artists who provided drawings for a lavish edition of Romeo and Juliet; published in London in 1890 by Raphael Tuck & Sons. Many of his paintings were acquired by Léon Bonnat and are currently at the Musée Bonnat-Helleu in Bayonne.

Possession of up to 20 grams is a misdemeanor offense, punishable by up to a year in prison, a fine of up to $1000, and the suspension of one's driver's license. Several cities and counties have enacted reforms to apply lesser penalties, however. Medical use was legalized in 2016 by way of a constitutional amendment. Appearing on the ballot as Amendment 2, the initiative was approved with 71% of the vote. The Victor Licata case On October 16, 1933, 21-year-old Victor Licata used an axe to murder his parents, two brothers, and a sister while they were asleep. Despite evidence Licata had a pre-existing history of mental illness, police and the press made unattributed claims that he was \\"addicted\\" to marijuana. On October 17, 1933, the Tampa Bay Times wrote: > W. D. Bush, city chief detective, said he had made an investigation prior to > the crime and learned the slayer had been addicted to smoking marihuana > cigarettes for more than six months. However, a day later the Chief of Tampa Police Department downplayed the role the drug had in the murders, although he pledged himself to the cause of marijuana prohibition: > Maybe the weed only had a small indirect part in the alleged insanity of the > youth, but I am declaring now and for all time that the increasing use of > this narcotic must stop and will be stopped.\\" (October 18, 1933) An October 20, 1933, editorial on page six of the Tampa Morning Tribune was entitled \\"Stop This Murderous Smoke\\". The editorial writer called for the prohibition of marijuana: > [I]t may or may not be wholly true that the pernicious marijuana cigarette > is responsible for the murderous mania of a Tampa young man in exterminating > all the members of his family within his reach — but whether or not the > poisonous mind-wrecking weed is mainly accountable for the tragedy its sale > should not be and should never have been permitted here or elsewhere. Medical use=CBD oil legalized (2014) On June 16, 2014, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law Senate Bill 1030, the \\"Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act\\". The bill allowed the use of low-THC, high-CBD cannabis oil produced from the strain of cannabis known as Charlotte's Web. Qualifying conditions allowed under the bill were epilepsy, cancer, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It passed the House 111–7 and Senate 30–9. Failed initiative, Amendment 2 (2014) In 2013, supporters of a constitutional amendment to legalize medical cannabis began collecting signature to place the issue on the 2014 ballot. The group United for Care turned in 745,613 of the required 683,149 signatures, and on January 27, 2014, the Supreme Court of Florida ruled 4-3 that the initiative had successfully qualified. Appearing on the ballot as Amendment 2, the initiative ultimately failed with 57.6% of the vote (this was short of the 60% supermajority required for constitutional amendments in Florida). Contributing to its defeat was casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who donated $5.5 million to the initiative's opposition campaign. The main sponsor in support of the initiative was attorney John Morgan, who spent close to $4 million. Right to Try Act expanded (2016) In March 2016, Gov. Scott signed into law House Bill 307 to expand the state's Right to Try Act (allowing the use of certain drugs for terminally ill patients) to include the use of cannabis. The bill also sought to address problems that had arisen with the implementation of the state's CBD law that was approved in 2014. House Bill 307 passed the House 99–16 and the Senate 28–11. Approved initiative, Amendment 2 (2016) In 2016, a second attempt was made to pass a constitutional amendment to legalize medical cannabis in Florida. Appearing on the ballot as Amendment 2, the initiative was approved on November 8, 2016, by a vote of 71.3% for versus 28.7% against. The initiative legalized the use of cannabis with a doctor's recommendation for treatment of: cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic nonmalignant pain caused by a qualifying medical condition or that originates from a qualified medical condition, or other comparable debilitating medical conditions. Under Amendment 2, a patient can access medical cannabis if a physician determines that the benefits of the drug would likely outweigh the potential health risks. Initially, under Florida regulations smoking the medication was not allowed; instead the product could be consumed as edibles or by vaping, oils, sprays, or pills. However, on May 25, 2018, Leon County Circuit Court Judge Karen Gievers ruled that the ban on smoking was unconstitutional. That ruling was appealed by the administration of Gov. Rick Scott, but the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped the appeal and asked for the legislature to lift the restriction. A bill that removed the prohibition on smoking was signed into law in March 2019. County and municipal reforms=Miami-Dade County (2015) In June 2015, Miami-Dade County commissioners approved by a 10–3 vote a plan to allow civil citations to be issued for possession of up to 20 grams of cannabis. Persons issued a citation are required to pay a $100 fine or perform two days of community service. Broward County (2015) In November 2015, Broward County commissioners approved by a unanimous vote a plan to allow civil citations to be issued for possession of up to 20 grams of cannabis. The penalty was set at $100 for a first offense, $250 for a second, and $500 for a third. Palm Beach County (2015) In December 2015, Palm Beach County commissioners approved by a 4–1 vote a plan to allow civil citations to be issued for possession of up to 20 grams of cannabis. First and second offenses are punishable by a $100 fine; a third offense cannot be cited. Instead of a fine, cited individuals can opt for 10 hours of community service. Tampa (2016) In March 2016, Tampa city council approved by a 5–1 vote a plan to allow civil citations to be issued for possession of up to 20 grams of cannabis. The penalty was set at $75 for a first offense, $150 for a second, and $300 for a third. Orlando (2016) In May 2016, Orlando city council approved by a 4–3 vote a plan to allow civil citations to be issued for possession of up to 20 grams of cannabis. The penalty was set at $100 for a first offense and $200 for a second. As an alternative, eight hours of drug education or community service can be substituted. The program went into effect in October 2016. Other Other cities and counties that have approved decriminalization ordinances are: Miami Beach (2015), Hallandale Beach (2015), Key West (2015), West Palm Beach (2015), Volusia County (2016), Osceola County (2016), Alachua County (2016), Port Richey (2016), Cocoa Beach (2019), and Sarasota (2019).

Mission and Role  The mission of GRLI \\"to catalyze the development of globally responsible leadership and practice worldwide\\" is in line with the view promoted by GRLI that: :\\"The management challenge for the 21st Century is to create resilient societies, sustainable economies and a healthy environment in which all human beings can flourish and prosper. This calls for individual and collective leadership that strives not to be the best in the world but the best for the world.\\" The GRLI aims at building a world where leaders contribute to the creation of economic and societal progress in a globally responsible and sustainable way. A starting point for global leadership includes, according to GRLI, fairness, freedom, honesty, humanity, tolerance, transparency, responsibility and solidarity, and sustainability. Considered a resource for business education for cultivating leadership integrity, the GRLI challenges business schools and other learning institutions to explain and promote organizational cultural changes toward social responsibility. It also cooperates with institutions of higher education to further develop their curricula. The initiative has catalysed the creation of two new academic journals: the Journal of Global Responsibility and the Sustainability, Accounting, Management and Policy Journal. The GRLI, in partnership with Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) and other networks, has given rise to several projects including: * the Sulitest – an online sustainability literacy test developed and promoted by KEDGE Business School in France, * the AIM2Flourish global learning initiative – a global initiative steering future business leaders towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with an online platform for sharing positive stories on business as an agent for world benefit, championed by the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, USA; * the 50+20 Agenda – a vision and global movement focused on \\"transforming management education in order to serve people, the planet and profit\\".  History  The GRLI was founded in 2004 by the European Foundation for Management Development and the United Nations Global Compact. The initiative's 2005 founding report identified a need for deep systemic change in business, recognizing that this change \\"needed to take place at the personal, organizational and systemic levels\\".

History The site was originally the carriage sidings on the north side of the line between Bournemouth West Junction (the southern leg of the Branksome triange) and . The carriage sidings has 11 roads before World War II (no. 1 road being closest to the main line); six more (12-16) were added during the war, with no. 17 road added in 1956. The Southern Railway had provided a four-road carriage shed that straddled roads 7 to 10. As part of the 1966-67 electrification scheme, Bournemouth West was closed, the line between Bournemouth West Junction and Gas Works Junction (the eastern leg of the Branksome triange) was closed and lifted, and the carrige sidings converted into a depot for the new electric multiple units. For the conversion, roads 5 and 6 were lifted, and roads 2 and 3 were truncated. A new four-track inspection shed was erected, this covered the old no. 1 road, the two old main lines and a new road laid to the south of the old main lines. The carriage washing plant that had been installed in 1956 was retained, along with a long headshunt to the west for access. Bournemouth West Junction Signal Box was retained, but downgraded to the status of a groundframe. The inspection shed was modified with a two-track extension in 1986, to accommodate the upcoming Class 442 units.  Allocation  The original allocation was the entire fleet of 4-REP (Class 430, later Class 432) and 4-TC (Class 491, later Class 438) units. The spare 4-TC driving trailer could often be seen out in the open from the A338 Wessex Way. In 1987, the depot had an allocation of Classes 423, 432, and 438 EMUs.

It has smooth grey bark, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves, flower buds in groups of between nine and eighteen, white flowers and hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus infera is a mallee, rarely a tree, that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, shiny, grey to copper-coloured bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green, egg-shaped to more or less round leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are broadly lance-shaped to elliptic or egg-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and eighteen on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a horn-shaped operculum. Flowering occurs between September and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody hemispherical capsule about long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim of the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus infera was first formally described in 1990 by Anthony Bean and the description was published in the journal Austrobaileya from a specimen collected in the Durikai State Forest near Warwick in 1988. The specific epithet (infera) is a Latin word meaning \\"lower\\" or \\"inferior\\", referring to this species usually being in the understorey of taller eucalypts. Distribution and habitat Durikai mallee grows in or near temporary watercourses as a component of open forest and is only known from Herries Range south-west of Warwick. Conservation status This mallee is listed as vulnerable under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. The main threat to the species is habitat loss due to land clearing.

Since 1975 possession of up to 100 grams has been decriminalized, however. Several of the state's major cities have also enacted further reforms. Medical use was legalized in 2016 through a bill passed by the state legislature. The first legal sales of medical cannabis occurred in January 2019. Decriminalization (1975) On August 22, 1975, Republican governor James Rhodes signed a bill decriminalizing cannabis, making Ohio the sixth state to do so. Under Ohio law, the possession of up to 100 grams of marijuana is a \\"minor misdemeanor\\" which carries a maximum fine of $150. Possession of more than 100 grams but less than 200 grams of marijuana is a misdemeanor punishable by up to thirty days in jail and a $250 fine.Jackie Borchardt, Ohio law enforcement officials say marijuana convictions aren't a priority, Cleveland Plain Dealer (September 17, 2015). The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports report that in 2013, 17,000 arrests for marijuana possession were made in Ohio. A 2013 report by the ACLU found that in Ohio, African Americans were 4.1 times more likely than Caucasians to be arrested for marijuana possession.The War on Marijuana in Black and White: Billions of Dollars Wasted on Racially Biased Arrests (June 2013), American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, pp. 58, 170. Issue 3: Failed legalization proposal (2015) In 2015, a ballot measure to legalize recreational use of cannabis in Ohio was defeated at the polls. The measure, known as Issue 3, would have (a) legalized the use and sale of cannabis by persons age 21 and older; (b) allowed the commercial-scale cultivation of cannabis, but only at ten pre-designated sites chosen by the measure's sponsors; (c) allowed persons age 21 and older to possess of up to 1 ounce (28 grams) of commercially- purchased cannabis and up to 8 ounces (224 grams) of home-cultivated cannabis; and (d) allowed home cultivation of up to four flowering cannabis plants for Ohioans who held a $50 license. The initiative was sponsored by a group of investors that included boy band singer Nick Lachey, NBA Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson, NFL defensive end Frostee Rucker, and fashion designer Nanette Lepore. Support for Issue 3 was weaker than overall support for legalization, as the measure was criticized for its plan to create a monopoly of cannabis producers. The initiative failed to receive the endorsement of the Drug Policy Alliance and Marijuana Policy Project, and received only a \\"tepid endorsement\\" from NORML. Issue 3 was defeated by a 65–35 margin on election day. Legalization of medical cannabis (2016) In June 2016, Governor John Kasich signed House Bill 523 to legalize the medical use of cannabis in Ohio. The bill, sponsored by state Representative Stephen Huffman, was approved by an 18-15 vote in the state Senate and by a 67-29 vote in the state House. The bill set up a rulemaking process under which a \\"state-run or licensed system of growing facilities, testing labs, physician certification, patient registration, processors, and retail dispensaries\\" was established.Alan Johnson, Ohio's medical marijuana law goes in effect Thursday, but no pot for two years, Columbus Dispatch (September 6, 2016). The system was required to be fully operational by September 2018, with the Ohio Department of Commerce to make rules for cultivators by May 6, 2017, to issue rules and regulations for cultivators, and the remainder of rules to be promulgated by October 2017.Jackie Borchardt, Small businesses prepare for Ohio medical marijuana market months before regulations announced, Cleveland Plain Dealer (July 7, 2016). In the interim, patients with one of 21 qualifying conditions were permitted to go to Michigan or another state with legalized medical cannabis, legally acquire cannabis there, and bring it back to Ohio for use in accordance with Ohio law. The twenty-one qualifying conditions are: AIDS/HIV, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cancer, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Crohn's disease, epilepsy (or other seizure disorder), fibromyalgia, glaucoma, hepatitis C, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, \\"pain that is either chronic and severe or intractable,\\" Parkinson's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord disease or injury, Tourette's syndrome, traumatic brain injury, ulcerative colitis, and \\"any other disease or condition added by the state medical board.\\"Tom Knox, Here are the conditions that qualify for medical marijuana in Ohio, Columbus Business First (June 16, 2016). Cultivation of cannabis and ingestion by way of smoking are prohibited under the law, which permits use only in edible, oil, vapor, patch, tincture, or plant matter form. The first licensed sales of medical cannabis occurred on January 16, 2019. \\"Smoke a joint, lose your license\\" repealed (2016) Senate Bill 204 was signed into law by Governor Kasich on June 13, 2016. It repealed a requirement in state law that possession of cannabis or any other illegal drug be punished with a mandatory six month driver's license suspension (instead, the bill made the suspensions optional). The policy was originally enacted in the early 1990s in response to the passage of the Solomon–Lautenberg amendment at the federal level. Senate Bill 204 was sponsored by Republican State Senator Bill Seitz, passing with only two opposing votes in the House and unanimously in the Senate. Municipal reforms In September 2015, Toledo residents voted 70%–30% to depenalize misdemeanor cannabis offenses, with no fines and no jail time for: possession or cultivation of under 200 grams, possession of hashish under 10 grams, possession of paraphernalia, and gifts of under 20 grams. Some provisions of the ordinance were later struck down in court, however. In November 2018, Dayton residents voted 73%–27% to approve an advisory referendum urging city leaders to decriminalize cannabis. City commissioners then voted unanimously in January to eliminate all penalties for possession of up to 100 grams. In June 2019, Cincinnati City Council voted 5–3 to eliminate all penalties for possession of up to 100 grams of cannabis except in cases of public use. In July 2019, Columbus City Council voted unanimously to reduce the penalty to a $10 fine for possession of up to 100 grams and a $25 fine for between 100 and 200 grams. Possession of paraphernalia was also reduced to a $10 fine. In January 2020, Cleveland City Council voted 15–2 to eliminate penalties for possession of up to 200 grams of cannabis. Other jurisdictions in Ohio that have approved decriminalization ordinances include: Bellaire (2016), Logan (2016), Newark (2016), Roseville (2016), Athens (2017), Fremont (2018), Norwood (2018), Oregon (2018), Windham (2018), Bremen (2019), Nelsonville (2019), Northwood (2019), and Plymouth (2020).

Issues The only judgment was given by Lord Hoffman. He commenced his speech by summarising the issues as follows: Section 323 provides as follows: :(1) This section applies where before the commencement of the bankruptcy there have been mutual credits, mutual debts or other mutual dealings between the bankruptcy and any creditor of the bankrupt proving or claiming to prove for a bankruptcy debt. :(2) An account shall be taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of the mutual dealings and the sums due from one party shall be set off against the sums due from the other. :(3) Sums due from the bankrupt to another party shall not be included in the account taken under subsection (2) if that other party had notice at the time they became due that a bankruptcy petition relating to the bankrupt was pending. :(4) Only the balance (if any) of the account taken under subsection (2) is provable as a bankruptcy debt or, as the case may be, to be paid to the trustee as part of the bankrupt’s estate. Facts Mr Stein was declared bankrupt by court order on 16 July 1990. At that time he was the recipient of legal aid, and was in litigation with Mr Blake. Mr Stein was suing for breach of contract, and Mr Blake had various counterclaims, including claims under costs orders which Lord Hoffman described \\"indisputable\\". Mr Stein's trustee in bankruptcy executed a deed of assignment on 4 April 1991 under which he assigned the benefit of those claims back to Mr Stein in return for 49% of the net proceeds. Mr Stein once again obtained legal aid in relation to those claims, and Mr Blake brought this action to have the proceedings dismissed on the ground that the effect of the statutory set-off under section 323 meant that the claims could not validly be assigned. In the Court of Appeal, where Millett LJ had given the lead judgment, it had been held that the operation of insolvency set-off was procedural. Accordingly, because the assignment had taken place before an account had been taken, the full amount of the claim had been assigned without any deduction for set-off. Against this decision Mr Blake appealed. Decision Lord Hoffman gave a long and careful exposition of the law relating to both procedural and insolvency set-off as it had developed from the time of Queen Anne. He noted that whilst procedural set-off required the claims to be a definite amount at the time the claims merged into a cause of action by way of issuing legal proceedings, insolvency set-off was not so limited. It was possible to set-off claims which were unliquidated, future or subject to contingencies under the insolvency set-off regime. He further held that the operation of the set-off was automatic, and did not require any action on the part of the parties, following National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork & Assemblies Ltd [1972] AC 785 on this point. The operation of the insolvency set-off rules was to extinguish the balance of any debt automatically. He endorsed the view expressed by Neill J in Farley v Housing & Commercial Developments Ltd [1984] BCLC 442 that after the operation of the set-off the claim for any balance did survive, and further, that as this was an asset of the bankrupt's estate, it was an asset which could be assigned by the trustee. Lord Hoffman also clarified that the effective date of the set-off was the date upon which the bankruptcy commenced. Accordingly, where the debt of the bankrupt is a contingent debt, then the debt must be valued at that date for the set-off to be given effect. In this respect the House of Lords followed the earlier Australian High Court decision in Gye v McIntyre (1991) 171 CLR 609. In relation to the proper construction of the terms of the deed of assignment, Lord Hoffman held that this did indeed assign the net balance of the claim to Mr Stein. He noted that counsel for Mr Blake had made an appeal to policy that it was unfair that defendants should suffer potential claims by litigants who were bankrupt and supported by legal aid (against whom they could not recover their costs), but he expressed the view that this was a matter for Parliament, and not something which should affect the determination of the issue in the appeal.

Oil products are the main energy source, mainly consumed by fishing vessels and sea transport. Electricity is produced by oil, hydropower and wind farms, mainly by the SEV, which is owned by all the municipalities of the Faroe Islands. The Faroe Islands are not connected by power lines with continental Europe, and thus the archipelago cannot import or export electricity. Overview Per capita annual consumption of primary energy in the Faroe Islands was 67 MWh in 2011, almost 60% above the comparable consumption in continental Denmark. After taking a dip in the early 1990s the electricity production in the Faroe Islands has steadily been on the rise since then, going from 174,422 MWh in 1994 to 314,409 MWh in 2015. Wind power was introduced in 1993, producing as little as 423 MWh at first, but rising to 55,789 MWh by 2015. The energy sector employed 154 people or 0.6% of the islands' total workforce as of November 2015. There are several 50 kW electric vehicle charging stations on the islands. Electricity The 3.3 MW Botnur power plant on Suðuroy was built in 1921. The islands have 6 hydroelectric plants,Hydro electric power 4 diesel plantsThermal Power and several wind power plants with a capacity factor above 40%.Terji Nielsen. Wind energy in the Faroe Islands page 19-21. SEV, 2015 Demand (and thus, production) is up to 55 MW in 2019 (record was 62 MW in November 2019), up from 40 MW at daytime peak previously (nighttime low is 15 MW). In 2014, the DKK 180 million 12MW Húsahagi wind farm with Enercon turbines became operational near Torshavn and increased wind capacity from 6.6 to 18.6MW; this decreased oil consumption by 8,000 ton (approximately 4M€) per year. A 2.3MW 700kWh lithium-ion battery at €2 million at Húsahagi became operational in 2016, stabilizing the wind power output. Wind power is expected to save consumers DKK 57 million. Six Enercon E82/3MW wind turbines (18MW combined) are to be installed at Eiði, at a cost of DKK 0.239 per kWh. A further 64 GWh per year is to be produced by a new privately owned wind farm near Torshavn. Power prices increased from 0.64 per kWh in 2007, to DKK 1.31 per kWh in 2019. Planners also consider converting the existing hydropowerBárður A. Niclasen. Vedvarende energi 2015 to pumped-storage hydroelectricity, as rain and wind are high in winter and low in summer. Tidal power,Tidal Energy on the Horizon offshore wind power and thermal energy storage solutions are also being considered, as the islands have a goal of 100% green electricity production by 2030.Green Progress The municipality- owned company SEV is the main electricity supplier in the Faroe Islands with 97% of the total production, and private producers supplying the rest. System power capacity is 100 MW oil motor, 37 MW hydropower and 18 MW wind power. Transmission The main electricity grid on the Faroe Islands has the highest voltage of 60 kiloVolt, of which there is 90 km overhead wire and 6 km cable.60kV map The 20kV system is 460 km and reaches most towns in the main islands, whereas the 10 kV system covers the connected outlying islands, and Torshavn.10 kV map Due to extreme weather conditions and its lack of interconnections, the Faroe Islands experience one to three total blackouts annually, a ratio higher than that of continental Europe. Most of the powerlines have therefore been buried underground as cables for better protection, improving grid stability. When SEV detects grid issues, automatic demand response at large consumers reduce consumption to increase grid stability. Self-contained islands Suðuroy has its own grid with 20 and 10 kV, and is powered by the 3.3 MW Botnur power plant and 8 MW diesel at Vágur and 2 MW at Trongisvágur. The Faroe Islands' first solar park was installed with 250 kW capacity in Sumba in late 2019, expected to produce 160 MWh/year (equivalent to 35 tons of oil), from diffuse light for 1,000 hours per year; mainly in the summer when rain and wind are low. For the month of January 2020, the plant produced 672 kWh. Seven Enercon wind turbines at a combined 6.3 MW are being installed at Porkeri Mountains, along with batteries and a syncron compensator to stabilize the grid. Production is expected to be 20 GWh per year, reducing oil consumption by 4,300 tonnes. Along with Suðuroy, the islands of Fugloy, Hestur, Mykines, Skúvoy and Stóra Dímun are also not part of the main grid or connected to other islands. They are each electrified through their own fossil fuel powerplants. Statistics In 2018 the main electricity was 352 GWh, with 51.2% from oil engines, 30.7% from hydropower, and 18.1% from wind. In 2014 50.8% of the electricity production of SEV in the Faroe Islands came from green energy like hydro (mostly Eiði and Vestmanna) and wind, while 49.2% was produced by the thermal power plants, which was 12.4% less than in 2013. *fossil fuel: 49.2% *hydro: 39.5% *wind: 11.3%% (2014) *nuclear: 0% Total annual production: 305.4 GWh (2014) of which the production of thermal, hydropower and wind power was: *Thermal: 150,2 GWh *Hydropower: 120,7 GWh *Wind: 34,5 GWh Oil consumption Fishing vessels are the main consumer of oil in the Faroe Islands. In 2014, 217,547 tonnes of oil products were consumed in the Faroe Islands. Of these, 31.58% was consumed by fishing vessels, 14.73% was used by SEV for electricity production, 23.23% was consumed in air, sea or land transport, 9.6% was used in the industry, and the rest was used by public or private buildings. Oil and gas exploration has been taking place around the Faroe Islands since 2001, with the expectation that significant oil reserves will be found. There are coal reserves on Suðuroy, which were considered for energy production. The reserves are between 10 and 15 million tonnes and they could replace oil in the Sund power-station for 100 years. Government energy policy The Faroe Islands have set a goal of producing their entire electrical energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2030. Since energy consumption has been rising steadily during the last few decades, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has conducted a study for the future development of electricity production projects. Apart from the development of new hydropower plants and wind farms, the study proposes the investigation of the possibility to produce electricity from LNG and biogas. The University of the Faroe Islands has undertaken research into the feasibility of tidal power at several sites which have a high energy potential, leading the Ministry of Trade and Industry to consider tidal power as a possibility. The privatisation of electricity production was not promoted, although consideration was given to introducing competition and transparency into electricity production.

On December 6, 2012, Washington became the first U.S. state to legalize recreational use of marijuana, second in recreational marijuana sales. The state had previously legalized medical marijuana in 1998. Under state law, cannabis is legal for medical purposes and for any purpose by adults over 21. Legal history=Prohibition Washington was among many states to criminalize cannabis in the 1920s. The Washington State Legislature passed House Bill 3 in 1923, which defined \\"cannabis americana\\" and \\"cannabis indica\\" as narcotic drugs. Possession was punishable by one to 10 years in prison. Nevertheless, enforcement of the law was rare, as cannabis use was not common in the state. In western states such as Washington, cannabis prohibition was largely motivated by the drug's association with the growing number of Mexican American immigrants. As racial and anti-immigrant tensions rose, newspapers published sensationalized stories of the drug causing Mexicans to go insane and commit violent crimes. After cannabis use became more common during the 1960s, the state began to relax its marijuana laws. In 1971, the state legislature reduced the crime of possession of 40 grams or less to a misdemeanor, and no longer considered the drug to be an \\"opiate\\" or \\"narcotic.\\" However, marijuana remained a Schedule I drug under both the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and Washington's own Controlled Substance Act of 1971, which deem the drug to have a \\"high potential for abuse\\" and \\"no currently accepted medical use.\\" Medical marijuana Despite its Schedule I status, in 1979, the Washington Court of Appeals recognized there was a medical necessity defense for cannabis possession. In the case of State v. Diana, a Spokane man with multiple sclerosis appealed his conviction of possession of a controlled substance on the grounds that the drug was necessary to treat his medical condition. The court held that the medical defense exists, but only in very specific circumstances. Medical marijuana patients, however, had no legal way of obtaining the drug. In the 1990s, cannabis buyers clubs and cooperatives began providing the drug to patients in several cities across the US. These dispensaries operated in defiance of state and federal law, but were rarely targeted by law enforcement. In 1995, the Green Cross Patient Co-op of Bainbridge Island became the first buyers club in the country to be raided by law enforcement. The cooperative, run by Joanna McKee and Ronald L. (Stich) Miller, provided cannabis at little or no cost to over 70 patients with diseases such as AIDS, cancer, and multiple sclerosis. Both McKee and Miller were arrested, and around 130 cannabis plants were seized. The case was later dismissed when a Kitsap County judge ruled that the search warrant used to execute the raid was invalid. McKee and Miller moved the co-op to Seattle and resumed operations. In reaction to the raid against the Green Cross Patient Co-op, an attorney from Tacoma named Ralph Seeley sued the state of Washington, seeking to have cannabis rescheduled as a Schedule II drug. This would have allowed doctors to write prescriptions for medical marijuana. Seeley, who had been diagnosed with a rare bone cancer in 1986, used cannabis obtained from the co-op to treat the side effects of his chemotherapy. A Pierce County Superior Court judge ruled in Seeley's favor, but the decision was overturned by the Washington Supreme Court by an 8-1 margin. Initiative 692 results by county, with number of votes shown by size, yes in green and no in orange. Following the ruling, two separate ballot initiatives were filed to decriminalize medical marijuana in the state. Both were sponsored by physician Rob Killian. Initiative 685, which appeared on the 1997 general ballot, would have allowed doctors to prescribe any Schedule I drug, if scientific research supported medical use. It would have also paroled drug prisoners. The initiative failed, with 60.4% of voters rejecting it. The following year, Initiative 692 was filed, which was limited only to decriminalizing medical marijuana. The initiative was endorsed by The Seattle Times, marking one of the first times a major newspaper in the U.S. backed a medical marijuana initiative. I-692 was approved by a margin of 59.0% to 41.0%. The passage of I-692 allowed physicians to recommend medical marijuana to patients with terminal or debilitating illnesses including: \\"chemotherapy- related nausea and vomiting in cancer patients; AIDS wasting syndrome; severe muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and other spasticity disorders; epilepsy; acute or chronic glaucoma; and some forms of intractable pain.\\" The initiative also allowed the state to add new illnesses to the list as necessary. Qualifying patients with a note from their doctor were permitted to possess a sixty-day supply of cannabis, which was later defined to be \\"twenty-four ounces of usable marijuana and no more than fifteen plants.\\" Although the law did not explicitly allow dispensaries, many were established and often went ignored by law enforcement. By 2011, there were around 75 storefront dispensaries open in Seattle and 55 in Spokane. That same year, the state legislature passed an overhaul of medical marijuana laws, which would have created a system of state-licensed growers, processors and dispensaries. Governor Christine Gregoire, however, vetoed most of the new legislation, explaining that she would \\"not subject [...] state employees to federal prosecution.\\" In April 2011, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington Michael C. Ormsby ordered all dispensaries operating in Spokane to cease operations. Most complied, but several owners who refused to close their stores were arrested. Later that year, federal raids on medical marijuana dispensaries also occurred in western Washington. 15 dispensaries were targeted in cities including Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Puyallup, Lacey and Rochester. Legalization In spite of federal prohibition, public support in the state for marijuana reform continued to grow. In 2003, Seattle passed an initiative making adult marijuana possession the lowest priority of law enforcement agencies in the city. Tacoma passed a similar initiative in 2011. A 2010 poll by the University of Washington found that 52% of Washington voters supported removing criminal and civil penalties for marijuana possession. In early 2010, the Washington House of Representatives considered two bills regarding cannabis. One would have allowed cannabis sales in state liquor stores, and the other would have decriminalized possession of forty grams or less. Both bills died in committee. Cannabis activists responded by filing Initiative 1068, which would have removed all state-level criminal and civil penalties for cannabis use or possession by adults over the age of 18. Despite an endorsement by the Washington State Democratic Party, the campaign received little fundraising and failed to gather enough signatures to secure a spot on the ballot. thumbupright=1.1Initiative 502 results by county, with number of votes shown by size, yes in green and no in orange. The following year, a separate group of activists filed Initiative 502, which would have legalized the use of cannabis for adults over the age of 21. The bill also allowed the Washington State Liquor Control Board to regulate and tax cannabis production and sales, and set new limits on blood THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) levels for driving under the influence. In December 2011, the initiative received enough signatures to be sent to the state legislature. In April 2012, when the legislature adjourned without acting, the initiative advanced to the 2012 general ballot. Early supporters of the measure included Seattle's The Stranger and Spokane's The Spokesman-Review. I-502 was also endorsed by the Washington State Democratic Party, the mayor and entire city council of Seattle, and the sheriff of King County. National support came from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), the NAACP, Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The initiative faced little organized opposition. The most vocal opponents were medical marijuana advocates, who claimed the new DUI provisions were too strict and that recreational dispensaries would hurt the medical marijuana industry. Police groups such as the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs also opposed the initiative, but did little fundraising or campaigning against it. On November 6, 2012, I-502 was approved by a vote of 55.7% to 44.3% Possession of up to of marijuana by adults became legal under state law on December 6, however cultivation, sale and even gifting remained illegal. Laws regarding medical marijuana remained unchanged. After I-502 went into effect, the Washington State Liquor Control board began establishing regulations for the new recreational cannabis industry, with a deadline of December 1, 2013 set by the initiative. In August 2013, the United States Department of Justice announced that it would not interfere with state- level legalization, as long as distribution and sales were strictly regulated by the state. On November 18, 2013, the state began accepting applications for marijuana businesses including growers, processors and retail outlets. The Liquor Control Board initially planned to allow 334 retail stores and of growing space statewide. The first recreational cannabis stores in Washington opened to the public on July 8, 2014. The possession for cannabis extractions for recreational use is 7 grams in Washington. However, the allowed limit of any hashish for medical use is 21 grams. The concentrated form of cannabis has significantly higher amounts of THC content that can reach a purity of 99%. Hemp legislation In accordance with the Federal 2014 Farm Bill, the state legislature passed ESSB 6206 in 2016, creating the Industrial Hemp Research Pilot (IHRP). The state's first post-Prohibition hemp crop was planted at Moses Lake in 2017, and a total of was planted that year. Production and distribution=Black market Even before the establishment of state-licensed growers and retail stores, cannabis was easily obtainable. Much of the state's supply was grown locally or imported from the neighboring Canadian province of British Columbia or from Mexico. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the state was among the top five producers of indoor-grown cannabis in 1996, the last year the agency published estimated crop sizes by state. About 80% of the cannabis seized in the Seattle area was grown indoors. In 1998, NORML published a report claiming cannabis was Washington's fifth most valuable cash crop. After the increase in security at the United States–Mexico border, due in part to the September 11 attacks of 2001, Mexican cartels increasingly began to grow cannabis within the United States rather than export it from Mexico. The cartels utilized the favorable climate of Eastern Washington to establish large scale outdoor-growing operations in remote areas of national parks and tribal reservations. In 2010, around 82,000 cannabis plants were seized on tribal lands in the state, accounting for almost a quarter of all plants seized by law enforcement that year. These clandestine growers cause significant damage to the environment by diverting streams, clearing trees, using pesticides, poaching animals and leaving behind litter and human waste. Although the state began regulating the cannabis industry in 2014, unlicensed production continued. In 2017, a drug bust organized by multiple counties seized over 33,000 cannabis plants which were suspected to be part of an illegal growing operation run by Chinese nationals. State-licensed businesses Washington's legal cannabis industry is regulated by the state's Liquor and Cannabis Board (formerly known as the Washington State Liquor Control Board). The state offers separate business licenses to cannabis growers, processors and retailers. Grower and processor licenses can be held simultaneously, but retailers cannot obtain either grower or processor licenses. Growers may only legally sell cannabis to licensed processors or retailers—not directly to consumers. Unlike other states that have legalized recreational cannabis, Washington does not allow unlicensed cultivation for personal use. In May 2014, the Liquor and Cannabis Board held a lottery to award licenses to qualified applicants. Retail sales began in July 2014. As retailers only had two months to establish storefronts and acquire inventory, stores experienced supply issues during the summer of 2014. This caused limited availability and inflated prices for consumers. During the first several months of legal sales, prices exceeded US$20 per gram. Due in part to a strong harvest of outdoor-grown cannabis in the fall of 2014, supply levels increased and the state's licensed marijuana industry had stabilized by early 2015. By August 2015, the average price had fallen to a low of $8 per gram. Sales and taxation During the first 11 months of licensed retail sales, total sales amounted to US$260 million. Sales increased to $486 million in 2015, and $1.1 billion in 2016; sales/excise tax revenue has risen in tandem, increasing from $65 million in 2015FY to $315 million in 2017FY. Retail sales are taxed at 37%, which accounts for the majority of the state's marijuana tax revenue. The allocation of tax revenue was dictated by Initiative 502. The majority of the money goes towards public health programs such as Medicaid, community health centers and substance abuse prevention efforts. The remaining funds go towards the Liquor and Cannabis Board, local governments, and the state general fund. Culture=Usage According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as of 2015–2016, 19.5% of Washington adults aged 18 or older have used cannabis within the past year, relative to the national average, which was estimated at 13.9% by the same survey. A 2016 survey by the Washington State Department of Health found that adolescent usage in the state has remained stable over the past decade despite the introduction of retail stores in 2014. According to Monitoring the Future, between 2010–2012 and 2014–2016, marijuana usage by eighth and 10th graders increased by 2.0% and 4.1% respectively. Both surveys found that the perceived harm associated with use has declined among adolescents since legalization. Events Since 1991, Washington has hosted the annual Seattle Hempfest, a protest festival which advocates the reform of cannabis laws. The event is held in Seattle city parks and features speakers (including politicians and activists) as well as live music. Attendance has grown from around 500 people in its first year to 200,000 at the 2003 festival. Following the passage of I-502, the event still draws over 100,000 attendees annually. Olympia has also hosted a similar event beginning in 2004, the Olympia Hempfest.

He joined the Galway senior team the same year in 1981, winning the National Football League in his first season with the county. He played for Galway in the 1983 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, however; they were beaten by Dublin. Coyne won an All- Ireland Junior Football Championship with Galway in 1985. With this, he has played in an All-Ireland football final in every possible grade with his county. College Pádraig Coyne excelled at football from an early age not only in goal but also outfield. Living on the Mayo border of Milltown, he attended St Colman's College, Claremorris. He enjoyed much success there winning Connacht titles at First Year, Juvenile and Junior levels before going on to win at Senior level also, defeating close rivals St. Jarlath's College, Tuam in the 1977 final. Centering the defence at full-back, Coyne played an integral role in helping Colman's to go on to the Hogan Cup final. There they met Carmelite College, Moate. Colman's managed to edge the win 1-11 to 1-10, securing their first and only to date Hogan Cup win. Inter-County=Minor and Under-21 Coyne first appeared on the Galway scene as a sixteen year old minor in 1976. Galway walked their way through the Connacht Minor Final, defeating Sligo 6-16 to 3-3. In the All-Ireland final, Galway met Cork in the final whom they defeated 1-10 to 0-6. His second season with the minor team wasn't as successful however with Galway failing even to reach the Connacht final. His third and final season in 1978 ended in more disappointment with Galway being defeated by Mayo in the Connacht final 2-6 to 0-4 as Coyne played at full-back. Coyne won a Connacht Under-21 Football Championship medal in 1981 when Galway beat Mayo 0-9 to 0-8. Galway would reach the All-Ireland final facing Cork, drawing 0-14 to 2-8. The final would be a memorable one for Coyne however as he became the first goalkeeper to score a goal in an All- Ireland final, converting from the penalty spot. Injuries plagued Galway in the replay however with the Rebels running out winners 2-9 to 1-6. Senior Coyne joined the Galway senior panel at the early age of nineteen. He soon found success picking up a National Football League for the 1980-81 season with Galway overcoming Roscommon in an all-Connacht final. His first Connacht Senior Football Championship win came the following year when Galway beat Mayo 3-17 to 0-10 in the 1982 final. Galway would be beaten by eventual champions Offaly in the All-Ireland Semi-Final. Coyne won his second Connacht Senior medal the following year with Galway beating Mayo again 1-13 to 1-10. Galway would go on to reach the 1983 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final but would go down to Dublin's \\"Dirty Dozen\\" in the infamous \\"Game of Shame\\". Galway had one player sent off while Dublin had three dismissed, a record for an All-Ireland Final. The game was even more forgettable for Coyne as he was famously lobbed by Barney Rock from forty yards out as Dublin won 1-10 to 1-8. It was Coyne's last championship game for Galway. Coyne would later play for the Galway Junior team, winning an All- Ireland Junior Football Championship in 1985, completing a unique record of playing in an All-Ireland final at every grade for his county. Pádraig Coyne has also represented Connacht in the Railway Cup. Club Coyne made his senior championship debut for Milltown in 1977. His biggest success with the club came in 1981 when the North Galway side defeated St. Grellan's of Ballinasloe in the Galway Senior Football Championship final. Coyne played in three other county finals for Milltown in 1978, 1986 and 1987 but ended up on the losing side in each. He made his final championship appearance for Milltown in 1992 making 34 appearances in that time.

Early life Alexander was born in Grant Park, Illinois on July 22, 1914. He played as an outfielder for the Cincinnati Reds' minor league farm team for eight years and was also a professional middleweight boxer. Military service=World War II Alexander attempted to join the United States Army Air Corps but was rejected because he had only received a high school education and at least some college education was required for USAAF service. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in October 1940 to get involved in the war as a pilot as well as to avoid being drafted and sent to serve in the infantry. At the time, he had only 25 hours of flying experience, far below the normal requirements for the Royal Air Force (RAF). He earned his wings by 15 September 1941 and was assigned to the 133 Eagle Squadron in England. Nearly a year later, in August 1942, Alexander participated in Operation Jubilee, which he later called his \\"most memorable day in the RAF\\". In two missions as a part of this operation he shot down two German aircraft and damaged a third. In September 1942, Alexander transferred to the United States Army Air Forces 4th Fighter Group. He joined the 109th Observation Squadron in January 1943 as deputy flight commander. Based near Shrewsbury, England, this squadron was created as the first operation training unit for American pilots. Given their experience after years of flying for the RAF and the relative inexperience of American recruits, instructors like Alexander often found themselves training pilots of higher rank than they were. Around this time was also the introduction of the P-47D Thunderbolt (\\"Jug\\") to US air forces. Alexander became one of the first American pilots to fly the \\"Jug\\" on 10 April 1943. He remained in Europe until April 1943, at which point he joined the 52nd Fighter Group's 2nd Fighter Squadron in North Africa. On 30 May 1944, Alexander was shot down over Austria and taken as a prisoner of war by the Germans after evading capture for five days. He was held at Stalag Luft III in Bavaria until it was liberated in May 1945. In the course of his service in World War II, Alexander was credited with five confirmed kills and one probable kill, qualifying him to be labeled an ace. Cold War Alexander served with the 33rd Fighter Group's 60th Fighter Squadron in Germany until an accident cost him his right arm in January 1947. Following the accident, he was medically retired from the Air Force on 7 February 1948. Honours Alexander was a recipient of a Silver Star, a Distinguished Flying Cross, a Purple Heart, and the Air Medal with 12 oak leaf clusters, among other medals.

This story was not released through Grisham's usual publisher, but instead was published for a free eBook on the website of the Focused Ultrasound Foundation, on whose board Grisham serves. Grisham's purpose in writing this short story was to increase awareness about the promising new medical therapy. The use of focused ultrasound is not yet approved for use on brain tumors, but The Tumor takes place in a time when the therapy is in regular use. Unlike most short stories, the story is as much informational as narrative, and includes medical illustrations and brain scan images. The book's cover includes the subtitle A Non-Legal Thriller. On Grisham's website, in a letter introducing The Tumor, Grisham states \\"It's the most important book I've ever written.\\" Plot Paul is a 35-year-old man with a family, who is in good health. His brain develops a tumor, which causes gradual impaired function of his left side, and eventually a complete blackout. He is diagnosed with glioma, the severity unknown. Paul undergoes the most effective treatment currently available, which involves brain surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Following the surgery his tumor is diagnosed as malignant cancer, a full-on glioblastoma. Paul's doctor informs him that the average life expectancy after this diagnosis is approximately 12 months. Side effects of the cancer treatments prevent Paul from fully resuming his daily life, including his inability to go into work. In 6 months, the tumor reappears, treatments become ineffective, and Paul dies 9 months after the initial diagnosis. Paul's story is then retold, supposing that he had been born 10 years later. At the time of the discovery of his brain tumor, in 2025, medical treatment has advanced such that his glioblastoma is immediately diagnosed, and focused ultrasound treatment is available for treating it. Paul receives the treatment as a non-invasive outpatient procedure. The treatment is so effective, he is able to return to work and resume his normal activities. Three years later, the tumor returns, and Paul gets the focused ultrasound therapy again, with similarly positive results. Four years after that, the tumor regrows again, and Paul receives the treatment a third time. At this point, the narrative ends and Grisham acknowledges that eventually, the cancerous brain tumor will kill Paul. But the extension of Paul's life and greatly reduced medical bills is worth it. Following this, Grisham explains the details of focused ultrasound therapy, including how it works, how far along the research and testing is for its application in various medical diagnoses, and what obstacles remain for its widespread adoption. The book concludes with an introduction to the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and an appeal for support from the reader. Reception Because The Tumor was not released through a traditional publisher, nor a typical novella or short story, few literary reviews of the story are available. However, several reviews from the medical community have been received. Ed Miller, M.D., of Johns Hopkins, stated \\"[Grisham] has pulled an exciting new medical technology out of the labs of academic research and onto the pages of an enlightening book. He paints a great picture of how sound waves may shape the future of medicine.\\" CBS news stated the book is more likely to be found shelved with the medical texts than with mystery novels. Some readers felt misled by the story's subtitle A Non-Legal Thriller, one calling the story \\"a 50 page sales pitch.\\" Grisham's publisher, editor, and agent all advised him not to publish the free short story, fearing it would tarnish his image as a writer of thriller novels. Grisham published it anyway because of his belief that increased awareness could speed up research and approval of focused ultrasound, helping many patients. He has stated \\"If it finds a much bigger market, if it finds people to push our research to get us there, that's the purpose of the book.\\"  References External links *The Tumor official website Category:Books by John Grisham Category:2015 books Category:Free e-books ","title":"The Tumor"},{"id":"52228477","text":"Antiochis of Tlos () was a Roman physician who lived in the 1st century BC or BCE. She was the daughter of Diodotus of Tlos. Through her medical practice, she gained notoriety of citizens and politicians throughout the Lycian region.  Work  Antiochis of Tlos likely began her education working alongside her father, who is likely the same famous Diodotus referenced in the Materia Medica of Dioscorides. An apprenticeship like this was common for individuals who could not attend one of the acclaimed medical schools of the time. While she may have started practicing medicine under the mentorship of her father, Antiochis branched off to an individual practice where she accumulated more skills and knowledge on her own. Her medical skills were referenced as τὴν ὶατρικὴν τέχνην ὲνπειρία, which is indicative that she practiced in the Hippocratic tradition. Unlike many other female physicians, Antiochis was not a midwife that tended mainly to childbirth. Not only did she focus on diseases, she treated illnesses that afflicted patients who were both men and women. This unusual patient pool may have come to be if Antiochis administered house calls, which were more likely to facilitate the treatment of both genders.  Statue and implications  In 1892, an Austrian expedition found a pedestal in Lycia. The statue was gone, but an inscription remained on the ruins, which date back to the time of Antiochis. The inscription reads: > Ἀντιοχὶς Διοδότου̣ Τλωὶς μαρτυρηθεῖσα ὑπὸ τῆς Τλωέων βουλῆς καὶ τοῦ δήμου > ἐπὶ τῇ περὶ τὴν ἰατρικὴν τέχνην ἐνπειρίᾳ ἔστησεν τὸν ἀνδριάντα ἑαυτῆς’ This translates to “Antiochis of Tlos, daughter of Diodotus, commended by the council and the people of Tlos for her experience in the doctor’s art, has set up this statue of herself”. This implies that Antiochis received official commendation from the city council of Tlos–an award granted by council vote. Such popularity corresponds to a city-wide reputation and a large medical practice. The reference to her medical skills is indicative of an extensive knowledge stemming from theoretical and practical experience. The language of the inscription may mean that Antiochis held the official position of city physician (evident by similarities to inscriptions of other city physicians, like Moschus Bellerophonteus). These physicians were hired by city council, granted a salary, and held responsibility for some public duties. The fact that she set the statue up herself means that Antiochis had ample funds and wanted to publicize her accomplishments (possibly as a physical note on the culture change associated with a successful female doctor). Even though the statue is lost (locating an image of the inscription on the ruins is a challenge), the inscription indicates that it was originally an image of Antiochis herself.  References to Antiochis  Not only was Antiochis held with high regard by her city, but her reputation expanded across the world and well past her lifetime. Important medical writers and physicians referenced her as an authority for her work and treatments. The disease authority Asclepiades of Pharkmakion cited some of her remedies. Heraclides of Tarentum dedicated one of his books on preparing and testing drugs to her. Galen credits her with healing mixtures for spleen diseases, dropsy, sciatica, and arthritis. In these last records, there is evidence that Antiochis had people working directly for her.

Early life Van Rensselaer was born on March 29, 1789 in Albany, New York. He was the son of Stephen Van Rensselaer III (1765–1839), and Margarita \\"Peggy\\" Schuyler (1758–1801). His father served as Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1795 to 1801, elected with Governor John Jay. He was one of three children, and the only to live to adulthood, born to his parents before his mother's premature death in 1801. Shortly thereafter in 1802, his father married Cornelia Paterson, daughter of William Paterson, the 2nd Governor of New Jersey, and later, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Through his father's second marriage, Van Rensselaer became a half-brother to Cortlandt Van Rensselaer (1808–1860), and Henry Bell Van Rensselaer (1810–1864), a United States Representative in the House of Representatives and brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Stephen graduated from Princeton University in 1808. Family His paternal grandfather was Stephen Van Rensselaer II (1742–1769), patroon of Rensselaerswyck, a large land grant in upstate New York awarded by the Dutch to his ancestor Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1586–1643). His paternal grandmother was Catharina Livingston (1745–1810), daughter of Philip Livingston, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His grandfather died in 1769 when his father was only five.Bielinski, Stefan. \\"Stephen Van Rensselaer III\\", nysm.nysed.gov; accessed April 15, 2016. His maternal grandfather was Philip Schuyler (1733–1804), a Revolutionary War general. His maternal grandmother was Catherine Van Rensselaer (1734–1803), the daughter of Johannes van Rensselaer (1707/08–1783) and his first wife, Engeltje \\"Angelica\\" Livingston (1698–1746/47). Johannes was the grandson of Hendrick van Rensselaer (1667–1740) Career Van Rensselaer served in the New York Militia, and retired with the title of Major General. Rensselaerswyck manor After his father's death in 1839, he inherited the \\"West Manor\\" of Rensselaerswyck through his father's will. He made many improvements to the Manor House, which was largely reconstructed and refitted from designs by British architect Richard Upjohn, and moved to the home from his residence in New York City on June 3, 1840. His father's will directed him and his brothers to collect and apply the back rents (approximately ) toward the payment of the patroon's debts. Once the rent notices went out, the farmers organized and held public meetings in protest. Van Rensselaer refused to meet with a committee of anti- renters and turned down their written request for a reduction of rents or any other settlement. His refusal infuriated the farmers and on July 4, 1839, a meeting was called at Berne for a declaration of independence from landlord rule. Van Rensselaer and the other heirs secured writs of ejectment in suits against tenants in arrears. There were crowds of angry tenants that turned into a posse of 500 men. Governor William H. Seward was called for military assistance and issued a proclamation calling on the people not to resist the enforcement of the law. While the tenants continued refusing to pay rent, the sheriff evicted some, but was unable to dispossess an entire township. By 1845, the anti-renters succeeded in getting the New York State Legislature to abolish the right of the landlord to seize the goods of a defaulting tenant and taxed the income which landlords derived from their rent. Soon thereafter, the Constitutional Convention of 1846 prohibited any future lease of agricultural land which claimed rent or service for a period longer than twelve years, but did not address existing leases. Between 1846 and 1851, the anti-renters elected sheriffs and local officials who paralyzed the efforts of the landlords to collect rents and threw their weight to the candidates of either major party who would support their cause. Rivalries between and within the Whig and Democratic parties enabled the anti-renters to exert more influence than their numbers warranted. As a result, they had a small but determined bloc of anti-rent champions in the Assembly and the Senate who kept landlords uneasy by threatening to pass laws challenging land titles. The anti-rent endorsement of John Young, the Whig candidate for governor in 1846, proved decisive. Governor Young promptly pardoned several anti-rent prisoners and called for an investigation of titles by the Attorney General. The courts eventually ruled the statute of limitations prevented any questioning of the original titles. Declaring that the holders of perpetual leases were in reality freeholders, the Court of Appeals outlawed the \\"quarter sales,\\" i.e., the requirement in many leases that a tenant who disposed of his farm should pay one-fourth of the money to the landlord. As their position became more tenuous, the landed proprietors gradually sold out their interests. In August 1845, seventeen large landholders announced that they were willing to sell. Later that year, Van Rensselaer agreed to sell his rights in the Helderberg townships. In 1848, his brother, William, who had inherited the \\"East Manor\\" in Rensselaer County, also sold out his rights in over 500 farms. Finally, in the 1850s, two speculators purchased the remaining leases from the van Rensselaers. After his widow's death, the Manor house became part of the general estate. Personal life Van Rensselaer's wife, Harriet Elizabeth BayardHe was married on January 2, 1813 to Harriet Elizabeth Bayard (1799–1875), daughter of William Bayard (1761–1826) of New York City.

He could sculpt and draw, and he was considered a pioneer in the use of graphic art in advertising. In the 1920s, he was called “the blond boy Michelangelo”; in the 1930s, “a new luminary” by Architecture Magazine; in the 1940s, \\"one of the most versatile artists in America.” By the 1950s, he was the go-to guy for the nation's most successful industrial designers.  Early life  Miller's father, James Edgar Miller, was born in 1857 in Michigan’s lumber country. He was related to Joaquin Miller (1837-1913), the well-known essayist, poet and Pony Express rider. He moved to what is now Idaho Falls, Idaho (then called Eagle Rock) in 1878 to open a small jewelry store after he became interested in watchmaking and engraving. Later on in his life he studied optometry and eventually became a beekeeper. His mother, Hester Elizabeth Gibson Martin, was born in 1864 in Missouri. She was a school teacher who taught the Choctaw Indians/People/Native Americans in the Oklahoma Territory; she eventually moved to Idaho to search for work with her brothers and sisters. One of Edgar’s fond memories of her is when Hester took her kids alone to visit the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, the World’s Fair of 1909. Hester and James married in 1895 in Idaho Falls; they had five children: Lucille in 1897, (James) Edgar in 1899, Frank in 1900, Hester in 1903 and Fauntleroy in 1906 (known as Buddy or Eugene). Edgar Miller loved the Great American West. Idaho Falls, a western frontier town of little more than one thousand people, served as a central inspiration for many of Edgar’s motifs and ideas in his art – history, science, and nature. He displayed a strong artistic talent and imagination very early on. Around the age of four, after he saw a painting of Custer’s last stand at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, he decided to fully pursue art: “I could imagine no other existence but to be an artist.” Also, his cousin, Ladd Wright, whom he adored, was a famous rodeo star; later on Edgar named his own son Ladd. When Miller was seven, his father gave him a bay pony. Horses, and animals in general, are prominent and frequently presented in Edgar's art and designs: “The affection for her became a definite part of me.” In a much later interview, Miller said, \\"Animals are representations of life and vitality.” At 9 years old he created complete illustrations of his favorite poems, Tennyson’s “Lady of Shalott” and Longfellow’s “Skeleton in Armor.” Couple years later he became an apprentice at an architectural company as a watercolorist: “My greatest enthusiasm as a boy was for the wildflower.” Jo He (real name Orzo French Eastman 1828-1916) lived at the edge of Idaho Falls around the turn of the Century. He was a bearded patriarch “who looked very much like Walt Whitman in his old age.” Miller wrote often about his visits to see Jo He. The older man taught Edgar about art and also showed him a home which he built and designed – “he carved stone, built his own home, was a tanner, taxidermist, imaginative gardener, inventor, mural painter, saddle- maker and sheet metal worker.” Miller was enthralled with this “handmade home”, and with the two-story workroom within, built above his living quarters. Here, Jo He executed taxidermy, worked on saddles, braided whips and rope et al. Edgar recalled that Jo He told him “’If you want to do anything, go ahead and do it’, all I had to do was try.” In 1913 Edgar, with his father and brother Frank, moved to Australia to help James run his apiary. It was a happy and adventurous time which brought him to a deeper understanding of nature, and the essence of existence. They took the S.S. Tahiti, a twin-screw freighter, for a 28-day voyage across the Pacific. After 12 days they reached Papeete, capital of Tahiti (which was then French Polynesia). Then to New Zealand, Sydney Australia, Melbourne and eventually Maldon. Life raising bees in Australia became difficult after a year or two, and they made their way back to Idaho a few months later.  Education and apprenticeship  Edgar Miller arrived in Chicago in January 1917, enrolled at the Art Institute and took a room in the Jane Addams Hullhouse (the nation’s first settlement house). He took classes with Louis W. Wilson, whose theories about sound and color interested him. Also, he met George Bellows at the SAIC around 1919. Bellows showed Miller some of his ideas on symmetry and space regarding painting and pictures, which made an important impression on him. Already doubtful of academia, Miller wrote, “It was never revealed that the circular pupil of the eye gives us a circular field of vision. This pattern antedates the conventional rectangular forms that surround us when architecture became an established part of human life.” At school he also met Sol Kogen, his future partner for the Carl Street Studios and the Kogen-Miller Studios. In 1919 he won the Frank G. Logan Medal from the Art Institute for his batiks. The same year he was hired as an apprentice in the design studio of Alfonso Iannelli; spent five years working on advertising, design, packaging, ink drawings, mural posters, stained glass and cut stone. Through Iannelli, Miller met important studio clients like Marshall Field & Company and Holabird & Root, and developed a network of future employers.  First successes as a designer and working artist  In his 20s Edgar was already an active and established artist in Chicago's creative world, designing illustrations for books and ads for Marshall Field’s Fashions of the Hour magazine, amongst many other commissions and projects. He also busily promoted other arts and artists; for example, he introduced musical works by composers Stravinsky, Ravel, DeBussy and Prokofiev at his short-lived gallery space, The House at the End of the Street. He ran it for a few years, and afterwards helped run a gallery on the top floor of the Dil Pickle Club, a bohemian hangout in the neighborhood of Tower Town. It was frequented by people like Ben Reitman “The Hobo Doctor”, Dorothy Day, Ben Hecht, Clarence Darrow, Sherwood Anderson and Carl Sandburg. In 1921, he married artist and musician Dorothy Ann Wood. They had three children: Iris Ann in 1921, Gisela in 1923, and David in 1925. Their marriage was a challenge, and according to his brother Frank: “When two people are as implacably incompatible, nothing short of separation can help.” Edgar left his wife and the children in 1929, but Dorothy refused his requests for divorce. He began seriously experimenting with stained-glass during the 1920s as well. In 1923, he won his second Logan Medal, this time for his stained- glass work; Howard Van Doren Shaw was one of the judges of the competition. They became professional contacts afterwards, and Miller designed stained- glass windows for three Shaw buildings. The two were set to collaborate on two Shaw commissioned World War I naval monuments, but unfortunately Shaw passed away in 1926. “In 1927, an opportunity presented itself,” he wrote; “it was to create an environment that could include all the ‘lesser arts.’ Through enjoyment and curiosity, I had gathered most of the ingredients of my idea of an ‘environment.’ I had done work at the terra cotta factory; over-glaze I had done in the school years. Stained-glass and textiles I had investigated. I had a Logan Medal for both stained glass and batiks by 1923. A long apprenticeship had given me experience in sculpture, casting, stone cutting and wood carving, as well as mural painting. All I needed was a project.” Around 1927 Sol Kogen, his friend from the Art Institute, brought his idea – of finding and rehabilitating old houses in an artistic manner – to Miller. It became their greatest project, and also came to define the Old Town neighborhood of Chicago. They began the Carl Street Studios, a multi-unit remodeling of a double-lot Victorian house built in 1874. Miller, as the artistic director and designer, went room by room creating new living spaces; and Kogen, more the contractor than a creative partner, went and found parts, tools and assistants. Both of them embraced salvaging and repurposing discarded building materials for their construction needs. Andrew Rebori, notable architect and future Miller cohort, served as the consulting architect, but he said he was rarely asked for advice. A 1943 article in the New York Times by Paul A. Hochman says about the Carl Street Studios, “In this one structure, there’s a touch of Moderne, Deco, Prairie, Tudor, Mission, a little English Country House, and Arts and Crafts. The whole thing is a poem, but it’s free verse.” Talented and ambitious Mexican artisan Jesus Torres was Miller's main assistant on the Carl Street project. Kogen and Miller begin their second multi-unit, artists’ residence remodeling project in 1928, the Kogen-Miller complex on Wells Street. It would eventually yield nine units. The rear building was leased to Rudolph W. Glasner, businessman and patron of the Art Institute, who commissioned Edgar to design and execute “a party house” for him. Here Miller attempted his first major woodcarvings, his stained-glass ideas are fresh and original, and in general his work across many mediums is regarded as some of his best ever. This handmade home, which is known as the Glasner Studio, is his masterwork “total environment.” Of this Wells Street complex, the Kogen-Miller Studios, Alice McKinstry wrote in the August 1930 issue of Woman Athletic: “homes that you have no right to live in unless you understand, and like, DeBussy’s music, and Roerich’s paintings, and Dudley Poore’s poetry, and Anton Bruehl’s photographs, and the dynamic folly of Adolf Bolm’s ju-ju dance.” Bolm had a studio at Carl Street.  1930s – \\"a new luminary\\"  During the 1930s Miller was one of Chicago's most prominent artists. In ’31, there was a large exhibit at the Art Institute’s Summer Show of a wide variety of his work, including carved chairs, benches, glazed pottery, mosaics and terracotta columns. It was universally applauded. The art critic C.J. Bulliet wrote of it, “In fact, an old Florentine master come to life in this machine age.” Also in ’31, he completed cut lead windows for the executive offices of the Palmolive Building. For the 1933 World’s Fair, A Century of Progress, Edgar (with the help of Andrew Rebori) helped design and execute the Streets of Paris exhibit, and ran the concessions with other artists. The nudity of female performers at some of the concessions almost lead to a scandal when a petition was issued to shut down the exhibit for being “lewd and lascivious.” In court, the judge struck (down) the charge: “it is not the business of this court.” For the Animal Court project at Jane Addams Homes in 1935, Miller was hired by the federal government to design a series of stone animal sculptures ranging from 700lbs to several tons each. In the same year, his mural Love Through the Ages, made its debut. In 1936 Edgar joins Andrew Rebori to design Frank Fisher Apartments. Fisher was a Marshall Field's & Company executive. It was Miller's final handmade home, and the only one he built from scratch. “Miller and Rebori broke the mold when they designed that building”, wrote artist Larry Zgoda. They called it “an opportunity to work toward a conception of human organic modern architecture that can achieve compact, livable, light house-keeping units in minimum workable space, with added factors of comfort and beauty.” This complex was also the first air-conditioned apartment house in Chicago. Also in 1935, Miller completed the plaster plaques at Punch and Judy Theatre, as well as the ornate lead cut grill of various laborers for the Trustees System Service Building.  1940s – \\"one of the most versatile artists in America\\"  Miller finally received a divorce from Dorothy in 1940. He promptly married Dale Holcomb, a textile designer whom he met while she was working at the Streets of Paris exhibit in the 1933 World's Fair. Their first son, Norman, was born in 1941, and their second son, Ladd, in 1943. The 1940s meant bigger jobs for Edgar. For example, in 1941 Miller created bas-relief sculptures for Northwestern University’s Technological Institute and he again worked with Andrew Rebori on the Dr. Philip Weintraub House. He made a history of brewing beer, in fresco, on the walls of the Pabst Brewing Company’s taproom, the Sternewirt, in 1943. Around this time he created the Tower Court Collection of wallpaper designs for Bassett and Vollum. In the middle 40s he was commissioned to create a history of eating mural for New York's Pierre Hotel. In Washington D.C., he designed murals and bas-relief sculptures for the Statler Hotel, now the Capital Hilton.  A fulfilling family life and a darling of the design world  Restaurant mural, circa 1947 The early 50s finds Miller and his family living in an 18-room mansion overlooking Lake Michigan on Chicago’s north side: “That’s where the family of Edgar Miller lives and works in a crazy quilt pattern incomprehensible to ordinary mortals. They are artists, the whole family of them. Edgar and his wife and their two sons and his mother-in-law and their teacher of Chinese. Yes, they all study Chinese together. And Malayan and Bengalese. While the boys hook rugs and the elders print textiles.” - George Murray, in the Chicago American, 1957. Norman Miller, known as Skippy, was a natural artist like his father, and Edgar held exhibits of his art. Jean Sibelius, the Finnish composer, was an admirer of Skippy's work and once wrote him a fan letter. Around that time, Edgar mostly focused on ecclesiastical work, creating many new stained-glass windows for churches, temples and hospitals. In 1950, he was hired by the Container Corporation of America to design a poster for its Great Ideas of Western Man series. Then a series of new commissions: murals depicting Chicago history for the Chicago Title and Trust Company, barbecue scenes for a Fred Harvey restaurant, foyer and bar murals for the Palmer House hotel, a company history of the Hudson Pulp and Paper Corporation, and several sculptural projects for Jo Mead Designs. Notably, in 1954 he was commissioned by the Standard Club to design two sets of glass doors and four murals. The murals were carved onto large black linoleum panels. In 1959, Miller was hired to produce murals for the Marco Polo Club in the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. Back in Chicago, he designed sculptures for the new United States Gypsum Building. The second Love Through the Ages mural was painted at the Tavern Club in 1961; the first one was taken down and cut up into about eighty paintings which were sold to raise money for the club.  End of an era  At the age of 67, in 1967, Miller and his wife Dale sold their mansion on North Sheridan road and moved to Florida. They purchased several pieces of real estate, one being a motel. Edgar became an innkeeper, but still made art. “It was a long time before I knew Edgar Miller as more than the proprietor of the Roxy Motel,” wrote Pamela Peters in a 1975 St. Petersburg Times article. Miller also told Peters about a book he was writing on a structural and proportional organization of art. It connected to the early meeting and discussions with George Bellows at the Art Institute in 1919. Those conversations about perspective and line value lead him, years later, to experiment with the proportions of classic paintings by graphing circles and lines over reproductions. He was convinced he would eventually introduce a universal theory about extending every line found in a painting. “An artist falls in love with a particular pattern of the universe making harmony of it. Love. That’s the basis of it. There’s a kind of love for the work one is doing that one never outgrows. Age doesn’t dim this enthusiasm.” His wife, Dale, died in 1977. In 1978, he traveled back to Chicago for a short spell. He met the new owner of the Glasner Studio, Lucy Montgomery, who was a wealthy civil rights activist and philanthropist. She used Miller's handmade home as a meeting ground and safe house for radicals like Fred Hampton, Angela Davis and Eldridge Cleaver, and for groups like the Black Panthers. Montgomery also commissioned Miller to create more stained- glass windows for her home. Three Chicago admirers, Jannine Aldinger, Mark Mamolen and Fleming Wilson, flew to San Francisco in 1986 to see Edgar and potentially bring him back to Chicago. Although living in questionable circumstances in the Bay Area, and seemingly on the decline, Miller revitalized when he returned to Chicago and began to actively produce art. In 1987 he was declared one of the founders of Old Town when he received an award from two Old Town organizations. And in 1990, Mayor Richard M. Daley inducted Edgar into the Chicago Senior Citizens Hall of Fame.  Death and legacy  Sometime around 1991, Miller took a fall down some stairs at his Carl Street studio. This accident ruined his depth perception and apparently made him blind in one eye. “Really stopped him in his tracks,” Frank Miller wrote. James Edgar Miller died June 1, 1993 from a massive stroke. He was 93 years old.

He is known to have authored some 40,000 pages of manuscripts dealing with an array of topics, including history, psychology, law, grammar, sexology and cooking. Akhbār Miṣr, a contemporary chronicle of Egyptian history and news, was among al- Musabbihi's well-known works. However, like the vast majority of al- Musabbihi's works, only fragments of Akhbār Miṣr survived; most of his writings disappeared not long after his death. Al-Musabbihi was a devout Sunni Muslim born in Fustat, where he lived most of his life and died. He was known to be loyal to the Fatimid government and maintained particularly close ties with Caliph al-Hakim (r. 996–1021). Early in his career, he served in the Fatimid military and was made a provincial governor in Upper Egypt before becoming a leading figure in the Fatimids' central administration in Cairo. Life Al-Musabbihi was born a Sunni Muslim in Fustat, Egypt on 4 March 977.Bianquis 1993, p. 650. His family was originally from Harran in Upper Mesopotamia (al-Jazira). Not common for a locally-born Sunni civilian, al- Musabbihi joined the Fatimid military. He was made governor of al-Qays and Bahnasa (both in Upper Egypt) and held the title of amir (commander). He was later appointed head of the dīwān al-tartīb, a position equivalent to general secretary of the central administration.Bianquis 1993, p. 650–651. He traveled daily from al-Fustat to his government post in Cairo and on most evenings, he stopped by the historic Mosque of Amr ibn al-As and interacted with his and his father's friends, most of whom were Syrian Muslim traditionalists.Bianquis 1993, p. 651. Though he was a devout Sunni Muslim, al-Musabbihi was loyal to the Fatimids' Ismaili Shia state and maintained a particularly close relationship with the eccentric caliph al-Hakim (r. 996–1021). The latter was known to get along with the residents of Fustat. Al-Musabbihi died in Fustat in April/May 1030. Writings Al-Musabbihi was a prolific writer, who authored numerous manuscripts on a variety of subjects, including history, practical psychology, sexology, law, grammar and cooking. The later medieval historians Ibn Khallikan and Ibn Sa'id al-Andalusi documented in detailed lists all of al-Musabbihi's works and the amount of pages for each work; al- Musabbihi's total work amounted to roughly 40,000 pages, with some works alone consisting of over a thousand pages. However, most of his work disappeared not long after he died. History of Egypt Among al-Musabbihi's main works was the roughly 13,000-page chronicle of Egypt's history, known as Akhbār Miṣr. Like al-Musabbihi's other works, much of Akhbār Miṣr was lost early on, with exceptions including quotations of this work that were copied in other historians' compilations. The only known manuscript of Akhbār Miṣr that was preserved is chapter 40, which is located in the Escorial in Spain. This section of al-Musabbihi's work documented events occurring in the caliphate between 1023/24 and 1024/25 and also contained poems and letters by other writers who were well-acquainted with al-Musabbihi. According to Thierry Bianquis, this manuscript \\"provides an insight into the contemporary literary composition, in elegant prose and poetry, of Egypt and Iraq at the beginning of the 11th century\\". The modern Egyptian historian Ayman Fuad Sayyid claims the 15th-century Egyptian historian al-Maqrizi had in his possession chapter 34 of Akhbar Misr, which recorded events for the year 1004/05. Akhbar Misr was a contemporary work in which al-Musabbihi recorded the day-to-day events in the Fatimid Caliphate and at the end of the year, recorded the obituaries of notable individuals. As an administrative official in Cairo, he also documented the often violent struggle for power in the aftermath of al-Hakim's death, centered around various military commanders and civil officials, who utilized informers and forged documents to discredit each other in front of al-Hakim's child successor, az-Zahir (r. 1021–1036). He held suspicions about the intrigues of Sitt al-Mulk's entourage with az-Zahir. According to Bianquis, \\"it is possible that ideological control [following al-Hakim's death] was imposed on official historiography and that a certain number of texts, including the writings of al-Musabbihi, were spontaneously destroyed\\". Al-Musabbihi also included news about the Bedouin uprising against the Fatimids in Syria in 1024/25 that placed the Mirdasids and Jarrahids in power there. Moreover, Akhbār Miṣr recorded regular aspects of life in Fustat, ranging from road accidents and crimes to wholesale and retail prices on goods amid a famine to hippopotami roaming in the Nile River.Bianquis 1993, pp. 651–652.

However, Perry was able to forge a pass and after three weeks himself fled to Windsor, Ontario, Canada.Onofrio, Jan. Tennessee Biographical Dictionary. Somerset Publishers, Inc., Jan 1, 2000 p134-135 In 1854, Perry converted to the Baptist religion and soon after enrolled in the Kalamazoo Seminary in Kalamazoo, Michigan where he graduated in 1861. On or about October 9, 1861 he was ordained pastor of the Second Baptist Church at Ann Arbor, Michigan. He later became a pastor in St. Catherine's, Ontario, and Buffalo, New York. African Civilization Society In 1862, Perry and Rev Henry M. Wilson formed the Colored Orphan Asylum of the African Civilization Society for the education and development of African Americans. The organization promoted schools throughout the country and founded the Asylum at Weeksville, Brooklyn. Other prominent members included Daniel Payne, Henry Highland Garnet, Rev J. Sella Martin, and Amos N. Freeman. In 1869, Perry was general agent, superintendent of schools, and editor of the newspaper, and chairman of the building committee of the Society. The group fractured, and that year three officers, president Amos Freeman, director John Flamer, and Perry brought a lawsuit against corresponding secretary Rev. Henry M. Wilson, which was not successful.Wellman, Judith. Brooklyn's Promised Land: The Free Black Community of Weeksville, New York. NYU Press, 2014. p127-131 The Society closed in 1871, but the orphan asylum, later known as the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum, persisted and Perry served as its president into the 1880s. Journalist and community leader Perry was a prominent member of the Weeksville neighborhood and became a leader in the Baptist church and a well known journalist. In his career, he was editor of the Sunbeam an illustrated children's paper, coordinate editor of the American Baptist, editor of the People's Journal, and publisher of the National Monitor. From about 1877 to 1887 he was corresponding secretary of the Consolidated American Baptist Missionary Convention and in 1887 was corresponding secretary of the American Educational Association and of the American Baptist Free Mission Society. In 1891 he was elected president of the New England Baptist Missionary Convention. In 1883, when the Brooklyn Public Schools Board of Education contemplated closing the schools for African American children, Perry, Charles A. Dorsey, and Rev. William T. Dixon led the fight to keep the schools open.Taylor, Clarence. The black churches of Brooklyn. Columbia University Press, 1994. p19, 26 In 1886, he organized the Messiah Baptist Church in Brooklyn. His congregation included a number of prominent Brooklynites, including Phillip A. White, T. McCants Stewart, Charles A. Dorsey, John Q. Allen, Charles H. Lansing Jr. and W. H. Johnson. He was also a scholar of classical ethnology and read Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. In 1887 he wrote a text, The Cushite, or the Children of Ham as seen by the Ancient Historians and Poets, which he published as a book in 1893 under the title, The Cushite, Or, The Descendants of Ham: As Found in the Sacred Scriptures and in the Writings of Ancient Historians and Poets from Noah to the Christian Era. This work traces the history of black people to a \\"glorious past\\". In that way, his work fits in a literature which attempts to disassociate nobility or goodness with whiteness.Sadler, Rodney S. Jr. Exegesis in Black and White, in Lange, Armin, Eric M. Meyers, and Randall Styers, eds. Light against darkness: dualism in ancient Mediterranean religion and the contemporary world. Vol. 2. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2010. p288-289 The introduction for the book was written by T. McCants Stewart. In 1888, Perry was elected president of a national meeting of Baptists, which came to be a union meeting of the General Association of Western States and Territories, the Foreign Mission Convention of the United States and the American Baptist Missionary Union, with Charles H. Parrish Secretary. A major theme of the conventions was unity of African American Baptists and the consolidation of a number of bodies such as the Colored Missionary Associations and the Co- operation of the American Baptist Missionary Union. In 1892, Perry was among a delegation of African Americans to visit president Benjamin Harrison, who was campaigning for reelection against Grover Cleveland (Cleveland would win the election). After the meeting, Perry declared himself unsatisfied with Harrison, who was a fellow Republican, because Harrison was not satisfactorily active in putting an end to violence against blacks in the South. Perry noted he was a lifelong Republican and would support other Republicans on the ticket. Educational honors Perry was awarded a PhD in theology from Kalamazoo Seminary, and received two honorary degrees. He was granted an honorary Doctor of Philosophy on May 17, 1887 by Simmons College of Kentucky, the day after delivering a commencement lecture and a doctorate of divinity by Wilberforce University in 1888. Family Perry married Charlott Perry. They had eight children, Edity, Rufus L. Jr, Arthur, Latha, Eudha, Minnie, David, and Hattie B. Perry's son, Rufus Perry, was legal partner of J. Douglas Wetmore.Sandweiss, Martha A. Passing strange: A gilded age tale of love and deception across the color line.

It adjoins the southeast corner of the Iguazú National Park. It has an area of . This makes it the third largest protected area of the Alto Paraná Atlantic forests after Argentina's Iguazú National Park and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park. The Sierra de la Victoria crosses part of the park. The Urugua-í River flows through the southern part of the park in a southeast – northwest direction and is impounded by the Urugua-í Dam to the west of the park. History A nature reserve was created in the area of the present park by decree 1.539 on 1982 with an area of . It was Argentina's first nature reserve. In 1988 provincial decree 339 annexed an additional . The present Urugua-í Provincial Park was created by provincial law 2.794 of 5 October 1990 to protect the ecosystem of the Urugua-í River basin. It compensates for the flooding of of the lower Urugua-í River basin caused by construction of the Urugua-í Dam. The park would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paraná ecoregion. Environment The terrain is gently rolling in the west, with more mountainous land in the north and east where it approaches the Sierra de la Victoria, which crosses the north-southeast part of the park and forms a watershed between the Iguazu and Urugua-í rivers. The climate is subtropical rainy, with no dry season. There are five months when frosts occur. Average annual precipitation along the Urugua-í varies from at its mouth to near the town of Bernardo de Irigoyen. The park has a wide range of vegetation types in the valleys and mountains, including some remnants of Araucaria angustifolia in the southwest. 44 species of fish have been recorded, of which 6 are endemic to one of the two river basins. There are 32 species of amphibians and 29 species of reptiles. Mammals total 77 species in 26 families. These include giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella), jaguar (Panthera onca), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu).

This disorder is one that affects bone growth and is characterized by skeletal, brain, and skin abnormalities. Those affected by the disorder are severely short in height and commonly possess shorter arms and legs. In addition, the bones of the legs are often bowed and the affected have smaller chests with shorter rib bones, along with curved collarbones. Other symptoms of the disorder include broad fingers and extra folds of skin on the arms and legs. Developmentally, many individuals who suffer from the disorder show a higher level in delays and disability. Seizures are also common due to structural abnormalities of the brain. Those affected may also suffer with apnea, the slowing or loss of breath for short periods of time. Many of the features of SADDAN are similar to those seen in other skeletal disorders, specifically achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia. Achondroplasia is a form of short-limbed dwarfism. This type of dwarfism is caused by the inability of the cartilage of the skeleton to ossify and turn to bone. Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition in which areas of the skin is of a dark and velvety discoloration, often seen in the body folds and creases such as the armpits, groin, and neck. Within those affected by SADDAN, acanthosis nigricans develops early on, usually in infancy or early childhood. Genetic The mutated gene responsible for the disorder is the FGFR3 gene, more specifically; a Lys650Met missense mutation of the FGFR3 gene is what causes SADDAN. This gene codes for the instructions of a protein that is integral in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Mutations of this gene cause the protein to be overly active, causing many characteristics of this disorder. SADDAN is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. Autosomal means that the gene responsible for the mutation and disorder is found on a non-sex chromosome and that either the mother or father can pass on the gene, while dominant means that only one copy of the gene is required for the individual to have the disorder. Fortunately the disorder is very rare and has only been described in a few number of cases worldwide. While the disorder can be genetically inherited, no instances of inheritance have been recorded as of yet. Rather, of the few cases documented, the individual affected by the disorder is affected as a product of a random mutation, also called a de novo mutation, of the FGFR3 gene only, not by inheritance of the mutated gene. Diagnosis Medical diagnosis is required. Clinical tests can be performed, as well as molecular genetic testing. The available tests include: Sequence analysis of the entire coding region * Severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN) - Sanger Sequencing: Diagnosis, Mutation Confirmation, Pre- symptomatic, Risk Assessment, Screening * Craniosynostosis: Diagnosis * Invitae FGFR3-Related Disorders Test: Pre-symptomatic, Diagnosis, Therapeutic management Mutation scanning of select exons * Skeletal Dysplasia Panel: Diagnosis, Prognostic Sequence analysis of select exons * Severe Achondroplasia with Developmental Delay and Acanthosis Nigricans (SADDAN, FGFR3): Diagnosis, Mutation Confirmation, Risk Assessment * Severe Achondroplasia, Developmental Delay, Acanthosis Nigricans: Diagnosis, Mutation Confirmation Deletion/duplication analysis * Invitae FGFR3-Related Disorders Test: Pre-symptomatic, Diagnosis, Therapeutic management Management Life with SADDAN is manageable, although therapy, surgery, and lifelong doctor surveillance may be required.

Biography  He was the son of Joaquim Gomes de Farias Veras and Ana de Campos Veras of modest origins. He was born in what was then the municipality of Miritiba in Maranhão and which is today named after him. After the death of his father, at age six, he moved to São Luís where he started to work in a local business to support his family. At age 17 he moved again, this time to Pará, where he started his journalistic activity at the Folha do Norte and A Província do Pará. He published his first book of verses, titled \\"Poeira\\" (1st series) in 1910, when he was 24 years old, which earned him some recognition. Two years later he moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he continued his journalistic career and became known in the literary circles of the federal capital, attracting the friendship of writers such as Coelho Neto, Emílio de Menezes and Olavo Bilac. He starts to work at the newspaper \\"O Imparcial\\", next to illustrious figures such as Rui Barbosa, José Veríssimo, Vicente de Carvalho and João Ribeiro. He becomes more and more known nationally for his chronicles published in various newspapers in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and other Brazilian capitals, sometimes under his pseudonym \\"Conselheiro XX\\". In 1919 he enters the Academia Brasileira de Letras, succeeding Emílio de Menezes in chair number 20. One year later he enters politics, elected as federal deputy in his home state, and keeping his mandate active until the sudden arrival of the Revolution of 1930. After going through a period of financial difficulties and owing to the admiration of high ranking members of the provisional government he is first appointed educational inspector in Rio de Janeiro and later director of the Fundação Casa de Rui Barbosa. In 1933, with his health already deteriorating, Humberto de Campos publishes Memórias (1886–1900), in which he describes his childhood and youth. The work is an immediate success with public and critics alike and accompanied by further editions in the following decades. A second part of the work written by Humberto de Campos just before his death came only to light posthumously under the title of Memórias Inacabadas (Unfinished Memoirs). After several years of illness, causing the almost complete loss of his eyesight and serious problems in the urinal tract, Humberto de Campos dies in Rio de Janeiro, on December 5, 1934, at age 48, as a result of a complication of a chirurgical surgery. Given that Humberto de Campos died at the height of his popularity, many of his chronicles, anecdotes, stories and recollections were published in the years following his death. At that time several books were supposedly written by his ghost through the automatic writing of a medium, Chico Xavier. Family members of Humberto de Campos sued, citing the lack of payments for authors' rights. The demand, which caused a great polemic at the time, was deemed groundless. Then in 1950, a new controversy: the secret diary kept periodically by the author in the 1910s and more regularly from 1928 until his death is first published in the magazine “O Cruzeiro” and then as a book in 1954 by the same editors. The publication caused a scandal at the time because of personal observations made by Humberto de Campos about famous figures in literature, politics and society, amongst others Machado de Assis, Getúlio Vargas and Olavo Bilac. Further editions of the complete works of Humberto de Campos were released by various publishers (José Olympio, Mérito, W. M. Jackson, Opus) until 1983. The constant financial worries, which required him to publish daily chronicles, stories and literary reviews to sustain himself, as well as his ongoing health problems resulting in a premature death, hindered Humberto de Campos from dedicating himself to bigger literary projects. This is the reason why a substantial part of his bibliography is made up of collections of his writings, which represent a useful instrument to analyze the daily and literary life of the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s in Brazil. The temporality which characterizes a major part of his writing seem to be the main reason why there is currently little interest from readers and academics.  Academia Brasileira de Letras  Elected as third occupant to chair number 20 of the Academia Brasileira de Letras, the seat of Patron Joaquim Manuel de Macedo. He was awarded the position on May 8, 1920 by Luís Murat.  Works  A collection of works by Humberto de Campos in a municipal library. Apart from Conselheiro XX, Campos also used the pseudonyms Almirante Justino Ribas, Luís Phoca, João Caetano, Giovani Morelli, Batu-Allah, Micromegas e Hélios. Humberto de Campos left a secret diary, published posthumously as book and partially reproduced in some editions of O Cruzeiro. The author's scathing reviews and commentaries about his contemporaries caused an enormous controversy.

Denny, who was the first baby boy born to the settlers of Seattle, became a vice-president of the company and president in 1899 when Arthur died.

It was the second referendum on statehood to be held in the district. The District of Columbia was created following the passage of the Residence Act on July 9, 1790, which approved the creation of a national capital, the City of Washington on the Potomac River. District of Columbia voters were asked to advise the Council to approve or reject a proposal, which included advising the council to petition Congress to admit the District as the 51st State and to approve a constitution and boundaries for the new state. The voters of the District of Columbia voted overwhelmingly to advise the Council to approve the proposal, with 86% of voters voting to advise approving the proposal. Background=Formation On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring on each side, totaling . Congress passed the Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west. After the passage of this Act, citizens living in the District were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which therefore ended their representation in Congress. The Virginia General Assembly voted in February 1846 to accept the return of Alexandria and on July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by Virginia. Therefore, the District's current area consists only of the portion originally donated by Maryland. Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the District, although not slavery itself. Voting rights and home rule In 1961, the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, granting the District three votes in the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president, but still no voting representation in Congress. In 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the District. Earlier attempts at statehood Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution gives the Congress power to grant statehood. If the District were to become a state, congressional authority over the District would be terminated and residents would have full voting representation in both houses of the Congress. However, there are a number of constitutional considerations with any such statehood proposal. In 1980, local citizens passed an initiative calling for a constitutional convention for a new state. In 1982, voters ratified the constitution of a new state to be called \\"New Columbia\\". This campaign for statehood stalled. After the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment expired in 1985, another constitution for the state of New Columbia was drafted in 1987. The House of Representatives last voted on D.C. statehood in November 1993 and the proposal was defeated by a vote of 277 to 153. Like retrocession, it has been argued that D.C. statehood would erode the principle of a separate federal territory as the seat of the federal government and that a constitutional amendment would be needed to avoid a violation of the Constitution's District Clause. In July 2014, President Barack Obama became the second sitting President, after Bill Clinton in 1993, to endorse statehood for the District of Columbia. In a town-hall event, he said \\"I'm for it.\\" He added that \\"folks in D.C. pay taxes like everybody else, they contribute to the overall well being of the country like everybody else, they should be treated like everybody else,\\" Obama said in response to a question. \\"There has been a long movement to get D.C. statehood and I've been for it for quite some time. The politics of it end up being difficult to get through Congress, but I think it's absolutely the right thing to do.\\" D.C. residents now pay more in taxes than 22 states. For more than 20 years following the 1993 floor vote, there were no congressional hearings on D.C. Statehood. But on September 15, 2014, the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs held a hearing on bill S. 132, which would have created a new state out of the current District of Columbia, similar to the 1993 bill. Modern statehood movement On April 15, 2016, District Mayor Muriel Bowser called for a citywide vote on whether the District should become the 51st state. This was followed by the release of a proposed state constitution. This constitution would make the Mayor of the District of Columbia the governor of the proposed state, while the members of the City Council would make up the proposed House of Delegates. On July 10, 2016, the DC council unanimously approved the referendum. If the proposal is approved by the people, the DC council will take a vote to approve the measure. Ballot The District of Columbia voters were asked whether to advise the District Council approve or reject a four- part proposal, where advising the council to approve the proposal would establish that the citizens of the District of Columbia (1) agree that the District should be admitted to the Union as the State of New Columbia; (2) approve of a Constitution of the State of New Columbia to be adopted by the Council; (3) approve the State of New Columbia's boundaries, as adopted by the New Columbia Statehood Commission on June 28, 2016; and (4) agree that the State of New Columbia shall guarantee an elected representative form of government. However, while “New Columbia” appeared on voting ballots, the Council of the District of Columbia passed legislation changing the name of the proposed state to the \\"State of Washington, D.C.\\" Under this proposed name \\"D.C.\\" stands for \\"Douglass Commonwealth,\\" a reference to the historic abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Proposed ConstitutionBoundaries= Proposed boundaries The boundaries of the proposed state would be about the same as the boundaries of the District, except for a small area around the National Mall and the White House, which would allow for the federal government to maintain control over a much smaller district. =Government structure= The legislative branch of the proposed state government would consist of a unicameral 21-member Legislative Assembly. Each representative to this legislature would serve four year terms. The Governor of the proposed state would serve 4-year terms and be elected in even years where there is no federal presidential election. When a vacancy occurs in the office, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly would be the acting Governor until a special election occurs, which would occur at least 70 days, but no more than 174 days after the office becomes vacant. The proposed state would also become responsible for their own judicial system, which is currently funded by the federal government. The Attorney General would remain an independently elected office, while DC would no longer have to submit laws or budgets to Congress for approval. Two years after the proposed state is admitted to the union, a constitutional convention would be called to make changes to the state constitution, and any changes would be voted on for approval or rejection by the voters of the proposed state. Results In this election, when asked the referendum question, \\"Shall the voters of the District of Columbia advise the Council to approve or reject this proposal,\\" this was the tally of the final vote: Challenges ahead While the people voted in favor of statehood, numerous challenges still exist that might hamper creation of the state, including lack of Congressional support: DC currently does not have voting-level congressional representation, and the national Republican Party is against the idea of statehood, due in part to political concerns that DC statehood would be detrimental to the Republican Party since the new state would likely send an entirely Democratic delegation to Congress.https://thehill.com/homenews/house/462419-dc-statehood-push-faces- long-odds-despite-record-support See also * Puerto Rican status referendum, 2017 * Statehood movement in Puerto Rico *Statehood movement in the District of Columbia * 51st state References External links  * DC Statehood Category:Politics of Washington, D.C.

The packaging won the National Restaurant Association Food and Beverage Product Innovations Award in 2011. It won the 23rd DuPont Awards for Packaging Innovation silver award in 2011. A laser-scored tip and plastic seal over a thermoformed tub allow a consumer to either pinch off the top and squeeze out the contents, or to rip off the seal and dip into the ketchup. It was designed to be easier to use one-handed inside a car. Product developers watched consumers operate the traditional ketchup packet through one-way mirrors to evaluate new ketchup packaging designs. Heinz's vice president in charge of the packaging division himself bought a used minivan and tested the company's products delivered at fast food drive-up windows. A Chick-Fil-A executive said that some consumers at the chain were hoarding the packets after they were introduced. Lawsuits The packaging was the subject of a patent lawsuit brought by David Wawrzynski, a Detroit businessperson who claims to have shown a similar prototype to Heinz executives in 2008. A 2012 judgment in favor of Heinz was vacated in 2014, and a jury finally found that Heinz did not owe Wawrzynski damages in April 2015.

Film financing  At the time of its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2016, the financing for Betting on Zero had not been publicly disclosed. However, subsequent to the FTC formally charging Herbalife in July, 2016, John Fichthorn, co-founder of Dialectic Capital Management, revealed that he had financed Betting on Zero. Fichthorn previously held a short position in Herbalife, and when asked on CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report if he would consider shorting the stock again he said he \\"absolutely\\" would. But since early 2014, when Betting On Zero went into production, he's had no position in Herbalife. An open critic of multi-level marketing companies, Fichthorn's firm, Dialectic Capital, held short positions in Nu Skin and Primerica as of August 2016. Bill Ackman, however, had no part in funding the film. Fichthorn financed Betting on Zero through Biltmore Films, a company he co-founded along with Burke Koonce to finance and produce business and financial films. Controversy It was reported that Podesta and Partners, a lobbying firm run by Heather Podesta and retained by Herbalife bought 173 tickets to an October 2016 screening of Betting On Zero at the Washington D.C. Double Exposure Investigative Film Festival in an attempt to keep the theater empty. This attempt by Podesta to subvert the screening was later lampooned by comedian John Oliver on the November 6, 2016, episode of Last Week Tonight. Herbalife and others have openly criticized the film, arguing that the film ignores Ackman's questionable tactics, including his requests that government regulators shut down Herbalife. Herbalife also registered the movie's title as a domain (bettingonzero.com) and bought placement on Google's search engine for an ad (Betting on Zero Movie  A Misleading Infomercial  bettingonzero.com Paid For By A Billionaire Hedge Fund Manager), leading searchers to a web page with their rebuttal of the criticisms of the movie.  Release  After premiering at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival, Gunpowder & Sky Distribution, formerly FilmBuff, secured distribution rights and planned a theatrical release in early 2017.  Reception  The film has been widely acclaimed, holding a 100% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Fionnuala Halligan of Screen Daily wrote, \\"Even if it tells the age-old story of the filthy rich getting richer and the poor going nowhere, Betting on Zero is still rather shocking.\\" Kimber Myers of IndieWire rated it a letter grade of \\"B\\" and wrote, \\"Betting on Zero takes a matter-of-fact approach to its material, but it makes a convincing and sometimes emotional argument against Herbalife.\\" John Fink of The Film Stage commented, “The film evangelizes Ackman’s position and, in a certain context, can be seen as another prong in his attack on global nutritional multi-level marketing firm Herbalife. This, of course, is only a danger if you ignore the evidence presented by the film and your own gut instinct.” The film was nominated for Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America.

It came into effect on 1 January 1901 when the founding states federated into the Commonwealth of Australia, and was repealed effective 10 August 1967 following the 1967 referendum.  Text  Section 127 was included in the Constitution of Australia when it was ratified, and stated that: :In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth, aboriginal natives shall not be counted. The interpretation of section 127 depends on the language used in other parts of the Constitution. Section 24 mandates that each state is entitled to members in the House of Representatives based on a population quota determined from the \\"latest statistics of the Commonwealth.\\" These statistics arise from the census conducted under the auspices of section 51(xi). The purpose of section 127 was to prevent the inclusion of Aboriginal people in section 24 determinations, and thus to prevent the Indigenous populace from influencing the determination of electoral boundaries by the Australian Electoral Commission. Including Indigenous people in these calculations would alter the distribution of seats between the states to the benefit of states with larger Aboriginal populations (though not to the benefit of the Aboriginal people). Concerns were expressed at the 1897–98 Federation Convention about the distribution of seats and also the possibility of states receiving reduced monies from Commonwealth grants if section 127 were not included. The language of section 127 does not include the words statistic or census, and consequently the Commonwealth had the power to collect data on the Aboriginal populace, though what was collected lacked quality and comprehensiveness. Its purpose was not to deny information to the government but to give effect to a belief that the indigenous peoples of Australia were separate from the colonists joining together to form a nation. From the arrival of the First Fleet, the Aboriginal peoples were considered British subjects but not citizens, and when Federation occurred, the \\"Australian governments and the people had no use for the Aborigines.\\" Consideration of the indigenous population was limited to the \\"problem\\" of the potential for their number to influence the composition of the House of Representatives, and that was \\"solved\\" with section 127. Actual responsibility for the Aboriginal people was left to the individual states (explaining their exclusion from race power); this contributed to the mistaken belief that Aboriginal Australians were considered as 'flora and fauna' until the 1967 referendum on the status of Aboriginals, which was originally the metaphor of pioneer Aboriginal filmmaker Lester Bostock to describe the status of Indigenous Australians, not a statement of fact. Constitutional scholar George Williams has described the race power and section 127 as part of the racism in Australia's constitutional DNA. In the 1960s in the lead-up to the repeal of section 127, racist attitudes towards Aborigines were openly expressed. For example, the Sydney Morning Herald characterised the idea of trying to count the indigenous population as part of the census as both \\"a mildly entertaining historical oddity\\" and as \\"more difficult than rounding up a mob of wild brumbies\\".  Repeal  The Holt Government held two constitutional referenda on 27 May 1967, and amendments relating to Indigenous Australians were carried overwhelmingly with 90.8% of votes cast in favour. Technically, the referendum passed the bill titled the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginals) 1967 and it became law on 10 August 1967. The referendum was intended to alter section 51(xxvi) to allow the Federal Parliament to legislate in states for the benefit of the Aboriginal people (they were already so-empowered in the territories by section 122), though the High Court decision in Kartinyeri v Commonwealth has since clarified that legislating to the detriment of Aborigines was also authorised. Section 127 was repealed in its entirety, having the immediate effect of including Aboriginal Australians in determinations of population, and Indigenous Australians have been fully included in the census since 1971 (the first census conducted after the passage of the referendum). The other question put in the referendum, to allow the number of seats in the House of Representatives to be increased without increasing the number of senators, was rejected. Other racially discriminatory parts of the Constitution were left in place.  Consequences  One immediate consequence of the repeal of section 127 was that full inclusion of Indigenous people in the census became mandatory and the Aboriginal populace was reflected in the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives between the states. Collection of sound and systematic data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) replaced the previous inadequate data collections. The availability of these demographic data following the 1971 census enabled the systematic determination and monitoring of key health indicators such as infant mortality rates and life expectancy. Aboriginal life expectancy remains significantly lower than the average population, though the situation has been improving. ABS data from the early 1990s showed life expectancy at birth for Indigenous men to be 18 years shorter than for their non-Indigenous counterparts, and 17 years shorter for women. By 2010–2012, the life expectancy at birth for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders has risen to 69.1 years for males and 73.7 years for females, which still lagged around 10 years behind the expectancies for the non-Indigenous population. Infant mortality rates in the early 1970s were among the highest in the world. Substantial improvements had occurred by the early 1990s but Aboriginal health indicators still lag behind those of the total population, especially for those living in remote areas, and closing the gap policies remain an ongoing part of governance in Australia.  Other constitutional treatment of Aboriginals  The right to vote may be limited under section 25 on racial grounds as anyone disqualified from voting on racial grounds at a State level was automatically excluded at the Federal level. It was intended as a penalty against any state which excluded voters on the basis of race as it would consequently have its federal representation reduced. However, as George Williams has argued, it recognises that race-based disqualification is possible, which is antithetical to true equality between Indigenous and non- Indigenous Australians. The removal of this section is one of the changes needed to prevent lawful race-based discrimination against the Aboriginal peoples, and is one of the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution. They also recommended deletion of the race power (section 51(xxvi)) and the addition of new provisions prohibiting any race-based discrimination, suggestions that have found support in the legal fraternity.

The episode was written by Tze Chun and directed by Rob Bailey. It was first broadcast on November 7, 2016. In the episode, Barnes (Michael Chiklis) loses control of the effects of Alice Tetch's blood and begins to use his powers to target a killer, no matter the cost of those who stand in his way. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) is reinstated as detective and investigates along with Bullock (Donal Logue) the killer, who uses plastic surgery to fake identities. Meanwhile, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) tries to stop Isabella from continuing to see Nygma (Cory Michael Smith). The episode received mixed reviews; while critics praised Chiklis' performance, they criticized that Barnes acting out of character was not compelling, the subplots felt weak and that the overall episode was reminiscent of the first season. Plot A man is hiding a corpse in his car near a store. Barnes (Michael Chiklis) passes by and notices blood on the man's face. Barnes follows him to an abandoned building where he sees him melt the corpse, stating he is just a cleaner and was just destroying the corpse for the real killer, someone known as \\"The Toad\\". Upon seeing the blood, Barnes begins losing control and, as he realizes that the man would just get a few years in prison, he kills him with his strength. Before their engagement party, Lee (Morena Baccarin) informs Mario (James Carpinello) that Gordon (Ben McKenzie) is back in the GCPD, but that she is fine with it. Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) and Isabella (Chelsea Spack) are eating breakfast when she uses her glasses, reminding Nygma strongly of Kringle. He goes to the bathroom and sees Kringle in the mirror, teasing him that he is still a killer and it is just a matter of time before he kills Isabella as well. Gordon and Bullock (Donal Logue) are investigating the cleaner's scene, getting shocked after seeing his mutilated corpse. Barnes visits Tetch (Benedict Samuel) in Arkham Asylum, demanding to know about the virus. Tetch wants to know \\"the darkness that Alice brought back to life\\" and he will tell him about the virus. Barnes explains that he expresses rage at the guilty criminals. Tetch instead teases him, stating that he could hear voices from within. Nygma talks with Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) about Isabella, and after some \\"talk\\", he decides to break up with her but he asks Cobblepot to do it for him. Barnes tracks The Toad (Gerald Bunsen) to a bar and uses his strength to make him confess to having hired the cleaner but that he was contracted by a person named Dr. Symon, a plastic surgeon who gives new identities to the criminals. Barnes nearly kills him but he takes the Toad with him to find Symon. Cobblepot arrives at Isabella's, telling her to never see Nygma again. Isabella deduces that he is in love with Nygma too but states that she will not let him go. Barnes arrives at Dr. Symon's (William Abadie) office just as he is beginning surgery on a woman. Symon surrenders but Barnes still attacks him just as voices inside him repeat \\"Guilty\\". He takes Symon to the precinct and then leaves his badge and gun on his desk. The engagement party begins, just as Mario says a few words with Falcone (John Doman). Barbara (Erin Richards) is revealed to have gotten inside the party and asks Lee how it feels to be with a man who is having a war with himself. While Fox (Chris Chalk) shows Gordon the toxicology reports on the case of the victim, Bullock informs them that the woman refused to press charges against Symon, seemingly being paid off, and a judge ordered his release. Attending the party, Barnes talks with Falcone, seeing that even if he did good things, he still ruled the mob and he is not above the law. Symon shows up at the party and the GCPD has arrived to try to imprison him again. Mario talks with Gordon in private and he confronts him that he preferred to save Lee rather than Valerie in the tea party. Gordon calls him weak and Mario punches him in the face but Gordon decides to let it pass just for Lee. Barnes then sees Symon and the voices finally persuade him to say \\"Guilty\\". He corners Symon in the bathroom and brutally attacks him, declaring that the law could not let him do what was right, claiming he is the \\"judge, jury and executioner\\". He then slams Symon to the wall, causing him to fall off the building. Nygma visits Isabella, discovering to his shock that she dressed like Kringle, trying to persuade him that he can live without fear of hurting her. She puts his hand on her throat to show him that he won't strangle her and they end up making out. Nygma tells Cobblepot about this and after leaving, Cobblepot has Gabriel cut the brakes of Isabella's car, causing her to crash just as a train is crossing. Gordon leaves the party after talking with Barnes and discovers Symon, who is nearing death. Gordon asks who threw him off, and Symon responds, \\"Barnes\\". Production=Development In September 2016, it was announced that the eighth episode of the season will be titled \\"Blood Rush\\" and was to be written by Tze Chun and directed by Rob Bailey. Casting David Mazouz, Sean Pertwee, Camren Bicondova, Jessica Lucas, Drew Powell and Maggie Geha don't appear in the episode as their respective characters. In October 2016, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include James Carpinello as Mario Calvi, Chelsea Spack as Isabella, John Doman as Carmine Falcone, William Abadie as Dr. Maxwell Symon and Gerald Bunsen as The Toad. Reception=Viewers The episode was watched by 3.52 million viewers with a 1.2/4 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was an 11% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.16 million viewers with a 1.0/3 in the 18-49 demographics. With this rating, Gotham ranked second for FOX, behind Lucifer but beating Lucifer in 18-49 demographics, fourth on its timeslot and seventh for the night behind 2 Broke Girls, Man with a Plan, Dancing with the Stars, Kevin Can Wait, the 2016 SNL Election Special, and The Voice. The episode ranked as the 65th most watched show on the week. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode was watched by 5.46 million viewers and had an overall rating of 2.0 in the 18–49 demographic. Critical reviews \\"Mad City: Blood Rush\\" received mixed reviews from critics. The episode received a rating of 57% based on reviews from 12 critics, with an average score of 5.2 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.2 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"'Blood Rush' shined a bright spotlight on Barnes for the first time since his introduction (and the insta- failure that was Strike Force). I like that he's been spun into the show's new villain, and how it also feels like a natural \\"Mad City\\" extension of the Hatter arc, though it's still hard to buy that a guy like Barnes would have let his condition get so out of control. Meanwhile, the Isabella storyline offered up nothing new this week other than Penguin's desire to get rid of her, no matter the method.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the series a star rating of 4.5 out of 5, writing \\"With the possibility that Nygma will be part of repetitive history taken into account, this was still an excellent episode. Embracing the insanity of Gotham and its occupants has been a real strong point for the show, and I'm excited to see it continue.\\" Sage Young of EW gave the episode a \\"B\\" and stated: \\"Thanks to his Red Queen trip, James Gordon has reconnected with his family's motto of service: 'While we breathe, we shall defend.' When he walks through the door of the precinct — hair slicked back and tie in place — Gordon is greeted with a familiar sight: the GCPD juggling a parade of lowlifes and career criminals. But his perspective on the job has changed. Instead of seeing himself as one man standing against a hurricane of death and crime, he sees himself as his dad: coming home from work every day satisfied that he's at least done his part as a good man in a troubled city. Jim Gordon is a cop again, and something tells me this time, it'll stick. (Canon. Canon tells me that.)\\" Lisa Babick from TV Fanatic, gave a 2.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Other than Barnes going dark, the rest of the hour made no sense. It's disappointing that once again. Gotham started the season out strong, but then took a nosedive not even half way through. Why can't we have any consistency on this show? Why couldn't we just have had an hour focused on Barnes and nothing else? It would have been much more entertaining.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of The New York Observer wrote, \\"That's right, 'Blood Rush' centered around Gothams resident Humpty Dumpty, Captain Nathaniel Barnes, who all the king's horses and all the king's men can't stop from becoming a veiny rage-monster because some girl's poison blood fell into his eyeball. Just like the nursery rhyme says. Look it up. I'm nailing this.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote, \\"Penguin and Nygma's complex and deliciously tragic relationship could have been a high point in a season that sorely needs one, but that would have required nuance and after three seasons, I can't make excuses anymore -- Gotham just can't do it.\\" Robert Yanis, Jr. of Screenrant wrote, \\"Gotham may have temporarily put a pin in its Mad Hatter storyline last week, but the 'Mad City' still has plenty of wild cards still in play.\\" Kayti Burt of Den of Geek gave a 2 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"On a show that once saw someone bazooka someone else, it's hard to sit through an entire episode semi-dedicated to an awkward engagement party.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 3) episodes Category:2016 American television episodes ","title":"Blood Rush"},{"id":"52230086","text":"The Carnegie-Ellsworth Public Library is a historic building located in Iowa Falls, Iowa, United States.

He is notable for his contribution as officer in charge of native labour supporting Australian forces fighting along the Kokoda Track. He identified and named the dry lake beds, Myola, that were to become an important supply dropping area and staging point during the Kokoda Track campaign. In later life, he was recognised for his contribution to the development of Papua New Guinea. Early life Herbert Thomson \\"Bert\\" Kienzle was born on 15 May 1905 at Levuka on the island of Ovalau, Fiji. He was the eldest of four children born to Alfred Kienzle, a German national and Mary (née Wilson). Mary was the daughter of an English father and a Samoan mother. She died in 1914 after giving birth to a son. The following year, Alfred was remarried to an Australian, Mena Hallet \\"Hally\\" Pearse. In 1916, Alfred was interned as an enemy alien, despite being a naturalised British subject at the time. In late 1917, the family was sent to Bourke, Australia, where they joined Alfred, before being sent on to Molonglo. Despite these experiences, Kienzle was patriotically Australian. In 1920, aged 14, Bert was sent to Germany to live with relatives. He returned to Australia in 1925. In 1927, Kienzle took up a position with Papuan Rubber Plantations Pty Ltd, as an overseer on one of their plantations in Papua New Guinea. Advancing to plantation manager, Kienzle took up a position, in 1933, as an assistant manager with a gold mining company operating in the Yodda Valley – a tributary of the Mambare River near the outpost of Kokoda, which was about to the south-east of the valley. On 4 June 1936, Kienzle was wed to Meryl Holliday, a former opera singer and nurse he had courted while on leave in Sydney the previous year. In 1937, Kienzle took up an agricultural lease in the vicinity of the goldfield, which he planted to rubber, while continuing as manager of the gold mine. Kienzle was an adept manager but his success derives from what appears to be a gift with language, cultural awareness and an empathy for his workers by which he was able to obtain much greater productivity from his labour force than many of his contemporaries. World War II alt=A map, orientated to the north-east, depicting the Kokoda Track as it stretches from the southern coast to the northern. With the outbreak of war with Japan in December 1941, Kienzle evacuated his family and reported to Brigadier Basil Morris but was advised to \\"return to Yodda and carry on operations awaiting further orders.\\" On 25 January, an order was issued \\"calling up\\" all \\"able-bodied white men\\". Withstanding this, Kienzle was directed to continue operating the mine until the end of March, when he was ordered to wind up operations and report to Port Moresby, enlisting on his arrival, with the rank of warrant officer. New Guinea Force Instruction No 13 assigned to Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) the task of, \\"the construction of a road from McDonald's [Corner (just beyond Ilolo)] to Kokoda and the maintenance of supplies to the forces of the Kokoda District. ... The road was to be commenced no later than 29 June [1942].\\" ANGAU was responsible for the recruitment and management of Papuan labour in support of the Allied war effort. Newly promoted to lieutenant, Kienzle was assigned this task. Of the plan to build a road, Bert Kienzle later said, \\"Some twit at headquarters had looked at a map and said 'We'll put a road there'.\\" It has been described as a \\"pipe dream\\". Historian, Peter Brune describes it as \\"one of the most ludicrous\\" orders ever given. Author, Peter Fitzsimons, reports that Morris, now Major General, commander of New Guinea Force, \\"just didn't want to hear\\" that the task exceeded reasonable expectations, \\"So after a little argy-bargy the senior man had pulled rank and ordered Kienzle, as a bare minimum, to evaluate it.\\" Lieutenant Noel Owers, a surveyor with New Guinea Force, had been given the task of surveying a route to Kokoda. Owers prepared a report outlining a route to Kagi (about halfway to Kokoda). Kienzle arrived at Illolo, to take charge of the 600 or so natives that had been conscripted for the task from indentured plantation labour in the local area. Captain \\"Doc\\" Vernon handed him a letter he had already passed through the chain of command expressing deep concern for health and hygiene at the camp. Kienzle was faced with a force that was sullen and unhappy. There was a high rate of desertion and intertribal violence threatened to flare. His first actions were to explain the task before them in their own language and then address the issues of accommodation and hygiene, after which morale of the force was greatly improved. Work then commenced on clearing the track forward towards Uberi (Owers' Corner). With recent knowledge of the track, Kienzle was to guide B Company of the 39th Battalion, under Captain Sam Templeton, to Kokoda. This was in compliance with orders for the forward defence of Port Moresby centred on the Kokoda area under the code name \\"Maroubra\\". The company departed Illolo on 8 July 1942 and arrived at Kokoda on 15 July. In the course of this journey, Kienzle identified staging points along the trail and began to establish supply dumps. Events quickly overtook the planned deployment, with the Japanese landing at Buna–Gona from 21 July 1942. Additional deployments were made to meet the threat of the advancing Japanese force and with this, the supply situation became increasingly critical. The carrier force was insufficient for the task. Attempts were made to supplement what could be carried forward by air drops. Unreliable maps or poor visibility in the drop zone meant that supplies were often misdropped. In heavily jungled areas, many supplies were lost. Parachutes were in limited supply. As a result, only essential equipment, ammunition and medical supplies were dropped with parachutes. Rations and other supplies were \\"free dropped\\". Packaging was primitive and inadequate. The rate of recovery was low and the rate of breakage high – on average, 50 percent. Kienzle recognised that a better drop zone was needed than what was afforded at either Efogi or Kagi. From pre-war flights across the Owen Stanleys, Kienzle recalled seeing an open area near the crest of the range. On 1 August, he set out from Isurava to find it. On 3 August, he identified the smaller of two dry lake beds, which he called Myola. Kienzle immediately requested that dropping begin at Myola and set about establishing it as a supply camp. Author, Raymond Paull credits the discovery as being \\"the key to the conduct of the Kokoda campaign\\", while Peter Brune describes it as the \\"logistical turning point of the campaign\\". In late September, he was appointed commanding officer, line-of-communication Kokoda and attached to Headquarters 7th Division. During the Australian advance, Kienzle worked to improve the supply situation by developing an air strip at Myola 2. In recognition of his contributions, Kienzle was mentioned in dispatches, and awarded the MBE (Military Division) for his work in this capacity. Analysing the campaign, historian, Karl James, states, \\"The Australians also had the benefit of a better organised carrier and supply system. This was largely due to the efforts of one man, Lieutenant Bert Kienzle.\\" He continued to serve along the Kokoda Track and at Buna–Gona, until he was evacuated sick on 22 December. He was promoted to Captain effective 16 January 1943. After leave in Australia, Kienzle was posted to Soputa as OC ANGAU Labour Mambare District. Kienzle applied to join the AIF for deployment overseas with the 7th Division. His application was declined in a reply dated 7 April 1944, which, ironically observed that he was too old to face the rigors of tropical warfare. He was, however, granted leave to be identified as a member of the AIF, in recognition of his service. He was discharged in December 1945. Kienzle is credited with naming \\"Templeton's Crossing\\" in memory of Templeton, who was killed during the fighting around Kokoda. In a contemporaneous newspaper article, he was described as \\"the man who blazed the Kokoda Trail\\". In an article appearing at the time of the 25th anniversary commemorations, he was described as: \\"a key man in the jungle campaign\\". Author, Peter Fitzsimons observed that: \\"Kienzle's facility with the natives was crucial because they were indeed particular and they would provide the key manpower\\" for the campaign. Author, Peter Brune, having already made a dedication to the contribution of Kienzle in naming a chapter of his book \\"Bert and the Doc\\", went on to say: \\"We have seen the enormous contribution of Bert Kienzle. It is all too easy to isolate his effort in one chapter. His contribution was ongoing and insistent\\". Karl James said of Kienzle: \\"[He] was one of the outstanding Australian personalities of the campaign.\\" He goes on to reiterate the sentiment of fellow historian, Alan Powell, who considered that, \\"no man on the Kokoda Track did more to ensure the Australian victory than Kienzle.\\" Later life Following the war, Kienzle rebuilt his home and worked to re-establish his agricultural holdings, introducing Angus cattle, in 1952, to diversify his operation. At one time, he owned Papuan Airlines and served as a director of the Papua New Guinea Development Bank. He sought to have the wartime contributions of the indigenous population more fully recognised. He was instrumental in having a monument commemorating the contribution of the native carriers erected at Kokoda. It was officially unveiled on 2 November 1959, 17 years after the retaking of Kokoda by Australian forces. He worked closely with Brigadier Sir Donald Cleland and Lady Rachel Cleland to have a monument erected to honour those Papuan and New Guinea servicemen, police and carriers who served during the campaign in Papua New Guinea. It was unveiled at Three-Mile Hill, Port Moresby, on 3 November 1967, as part of the 25th Kokoda anniversary commemorations. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1969 for services to private enterprise and the country. In early 1973, he instigated and sponsored the Annual Kokoda Trail Race. As a result of reforms following independence in 1975, his plantation estate was compulsorily acquired in 1979. He retired to properties at Tweed Heads, New South Wales and Allora (near Warwick, Queensland), Australia. He died on 7 January 1988 while on a visit to Sydney. He was cremated and his ashes interred at Allambe Gardens on the Gold Coast. He was survived by his wife and four of their five children: Katherine \\"Mary\\" Hardy, Diane Moloney, Jokn (\\"JK\\"), and Wallace (\\"Soc\\"). Their eldest son, Carl had died as a result of burns in 1947. In 1995, Australian Prime Minister, Paul Keating, opened the Herbert Kienzle Memorial Museum at Kokoda, as part of a set of facilities jointly funded by the government and Rotary International.

Political career Within 23 months of being sworn in, Gatti visited every school in his district delivering a Louisiana Flag to each school. Gatti has held over 50 town hall meetings from Plain Dealing and Castor to Springhill and Haughton. Gatti tells the story of the Mama Pelican on the Louisiana Flag. In 2003, Gatti ran unsuccessfully for the District 8 seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives against fellow Republican Jane H. Smith, a former school superintendent for Bossier Parish. He received 3,456 votes (33.1 percent) to Smith's 6,999 (66.9 percent). Twelve years later, Gatti narrowly defeated fellow Republican Henry Burns, a businessman and retired military officer originally from Webster Parish, who left the state House after two terms to seek the Senate seat vacated by the term-limited Republican Robert Adley. Gatti polled 14,023 votes (50.6 percent); Burns amassed 13,698 (49.4 percent). Gatti ran for state senator as an intra-party critic of the term-limited Bobby Jindal, who as the departing governor launched a brief unsuccessful bid in the 2016 presidential campaign. Gatti is a close friend and supporter of Jindal's gubernatorial successor, Democrat John Bel Edwards of Tangipahoa Parish, whom Gatti met while attending LSU Law School. In 2014, Edwards delivered a campaign speech at Gatti's law office. Gatti was a large donor to Edwards as well despite his position as the vice president of the Bossier Parish Republican Party. U.S. Senator David Vitter, the Republican choice, lost the race for governor in 2015 to Edwards. Upon his election, Gatti promised to work to halt Planned Parenthood from harvesting and selling organs from aborted children. He pledged to support higher education, to return local control to school boards, to eliminate the Common Core State Standards Initiative, to address state budgetary shortfalls, and to support policies to enhance Louisiana's energy industries. In March 2016, Gatti joined the Senate majority, 29–10, to increase the state sales tax for five years, as proposed by Governor John Bel Edwards. A House and Senate conference committee subsequently trimmed the five years to twenty-seven months, from April 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018. Gatti voted against renewal of the sales tax in 2018 keeping a promise to his constituents. In April 2018, upon the urging of Christian groups, Gatti voted against a bill which would have made it illegal to have sex with animals stating that the bill was simply a \\"Trojan horse\\" and that \\"the real purpose of the bill had nothing to do with bestiality.\\" Several laws are already in place in Louisiana clearly making it illegal to commit this crime against the law this law was unnecessary. This bill was eventually passed only after it was not amended to change the remaining parts of the statute it was amending. Personal life In 1992, Gatti graduated co- valedictorian of Airline High School in Bossier City. He then procured his undergraduate education in three years from Louisiana State University in the capital city of Baton Rouge, at which he was president of the fraternity, Kappa Sigma.

At the Second Party Congress, the party line shifted dramatically under the new General Secretary B.T. Ranadive and subsequently the party engaged in revolutionary insurrections across the country. Background The party had seen a rapid growth in membership in the years preceding the Second Party Congress, reaching around 89,000. In 1935 there had been only around 1,000 CPI members, and by 1943 the number had increased to around 16,000. Whilst the CPI constitution stipulated that an All India Party Conference be held yearly under normal conditions, the last one had been held in 1943. By the time the Second Party Congress finally convened, P.C. Joshi had served a 13-year term as Party General Secretary. When the Second Party Congress convened, CPI stood at a crossroads. Either they would work within the constitutional framework of the newly independent Indian state or it would engage in insurrectional revolutionary struggles. The incumbent CPI General Secretary, P.C. Joshi, represented the former position, B.T. Ranadive (BTR) the latter. At the time of independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 CPI adhered to a moderate line of 'responsive cooperation' with the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League. But as of December 1947 the leftist group around BTR had won control over the Central Committee of the party. A key factor in the ascent of BTR and the defeat of the incumbent P. C. Joshi clique was post-Partition dissatisfaction with the past policy of alliance with the Muslim League. The group around BTR began to purge the followers of P.C. Joshi. The December meeting of the Central Committee sent out instruction to party branches to hastily elect delegates to the Second Party Congress. Delegates 919 delegates were elected by the party branches, but only 632 were able to attend. For example, only a handful of the 75 delegates elected from Telangana were able to reach Calcutta. Out of the 632, 565 were party whole-timers. Three delegates represented party branches in West Pakistan: Eric Cyprian from Punjab, Jamaluddin Bokhari from Sind and Mohammad Hussein Ata from the North-West Frontier Province. Estimates on the number of delegates from East Pakistan vary, party documents suggested that 60 delegates participated, an intelligence estimate put the figure at 32. Delegates from East Pakistan included Kalpana Datta (P.C. Joshi's wife) and Khokar Roy. Moni Singh claimed that there had been 125 delegates from East Pakistan, representing 12,000 party members, as well as five delegates from West Pakistan. From French India, the local Communist Party leader and member of the French Senate V. Subbiah participated in the Second Party Congress. On 24 February 1948 he had made a visit to the French colony of Chandernagore together with the French delegate to the Calcutta Youth Conference (see below). Proceedings The congress was held under a big tarpaulin in Mohammad Ali Park. BTR held the opening speech of the conference, outlining the new party line. His speech lasted four and a half hours, and presented detailed criticism on the performance of the party leadership. > So far we have been taking a reformist path. We dovetailed with bourgeois > interests. We could not take an independent stance in the movement on the > issue of freedom. As a result, the reactionary forces of Congress and Muslim > League through a forged alliance ushered in a so-called Independence. This > is not real independence, it is false! Just as in a postwar situation, there > is still grounds for revolution. That is why we must continue our struggle > against the bourgeoisie. Strikes, mass rallies, demonstrations, and armed > struggles must be used to challenge this false sense of freedom. BTR echoed the notion that the world was divided in two camps, and in the struggle between the Anglo-American imperialist camp and the Soviet-led democratic camp the Indian state had aligned itself with the imperialists. The second speech was held by Bhowani Sen who presented an overview of tactical questions. Sen presented criticism of the performance of the party 1942–1948, including the support to Sheikh Abdullah's movement in Jammu and Kashmir. The Telangana struggle was presented as the model to be replicated throughout the subcontinent. BTR and Bhowani's speeches were followed by a long presentation by the now isolated P.C. Joshi. P.C. Joshi expressed self-criticism, stating that he had 'confused and corrupted' the party during his tenure as General Secretary. The main document debated by the Second Party Congress was its Political Thesis. Many amendments to the document were suggested by delegates, and the Central Committee was tasked with amending it later. The party constitution was amended at the Second Party Congress. CC election BTR was elected as new General Secretary of the party.Chandra, Bipan & others (2000). India after Independence 1947–2000, New Delhi:Penguin, , p.204 In the election to the new Central Committee all of the candidates proposed by the outgoing leadership were elected, with the exception of P.C. Joshi, who was left out of the new Central Committee. New party line The line adopted at the Second Party Congress became popularly known as the 'Ranadive thesis', the 'Ranadive line' or 'Calcutta thesis'. The Second Party Congress raised the slogan that the independence achieved in 1947 was 'sham independence'. The Indian National Congress was denounced as a party of the bourgeoisie. The People's Democratic Revolution was outlined as a one-stage revolution, to be achieved through a united front of workers, peasants and revolutionary intellectuals. Thus the Second Party Congress implied a drastic shift in CPI policy, gearing towards armed insurrection against the nascent Indian state. The new line found inspiration in the Zhdanov Doctrine of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), which saw the world divided in an imperialist camp and a camp of people's democracies. It also drew upon the experiences of Bengali communists in the post-Partition chaos in Calcutta and the resistance against the Nizam regime in the Hyderabad State. Another meeting held in the city around just a few days before the Second Party Congress was the Conference of Youth and Students of Southeast Asia Fighting for Freedom and Independence, which has been credited with disseminating the Zhdanov insurrectional line throughout the continent.Low, Francis. Struggle for Asia. Essay index reprint series. Freeport, N.Y.: Books for Libraries Press, 1972. pp. 96–97 Founding of the Communist Party of Pakistan Bhowani Sen presented a 'Report on Pakistan' to the Second Party Congress. He argued that both India and Pakistan were dominated by similar reactionary elites in alliance with imperialist forces. Thus the task of communists in both countries would be the same, to struggle for people's democratic revolution. The Second Party Congress deliberated on the Pakistan question for some time, and eventually agreed that a separate Communist Party should be built in Pakistan. Sen's 'Report on Pakistan' was adopted with some amendments. After the vote the delegates from West Pakistan held a separate meeting at the sidelines of the CPI congress on 6 March 1948 and constituted the Communist Party of Pakistan. Sajjad Zaheer, founder of the All India Progressive Writers Association and a CPI Central Committee member, was named general secretary of the Communist Party of Pakistan. The other eight Central Committee members were Mohammad Hussain Ata, Jamaluddin Bokhari, Ibrahim (a labour leader), Khoka Roy, Nepal Nag, Krishna Binod Roy, Syed Abul Mansur Habibullah (from West Bengal, but moved to East Pakistan after the foundation of CPP) and Moni Singh. After the congress Zaheer travelled to West Pakistan to build the party there. He was no longer considered a CPI Central Committee member. Notably, the party structure in East Pakistan would remain under the supervision of the West Bengal committee of CPI for some time afterwards. Foreign delegations Four foreign delegations attend the Second Party Congress: the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (Vladimir Dedijer and Radovan Zogović), the Communist Party of Australia (Lance Sharkey), the Communist Party of Burma (Thakin Than Tun, Thakin Ba Thein Tin, yebaw Aung Gyi, Bo Yan Aung, Khin Kyi and Hla Myaing) and the Communist Party of Ceylon. Dedijer's speech detailed the struggle of Yugoslav Partisans and was met with heavy applause from the assembled delegates.Miskovic, N. The pre-history of the non-aligned movement: India's first contacts with the communist Yugoslavia, 1948–1950 Acting as de facto representatives of Cominform, the Yugoslav delegates provided important symbolic support to legitimize B.T. Ranadive's coming to power in the party. The Burmese communist leader Thakin Than Tun also aroused the revolutionary fervour in his speech, highlighting that armed struggle alone would provide a path towards liberation. Along with the Asian Youth Conference, the CPI Calcutta Congress is credited to have influenced the Burmese communists to initiate armed rebellion at home. Nevertheless, Bertil Lintner argues that the impact of the Calcutta meetings on CPB line is a myth, and that H.N. Goshal (who is credited with the 'Goshal thesis' of armed insurrection in Burma) never attended neither of the two Calcutta conferences. Aftermath Following the Second Party Congress and under the leadership of BTR, the party embarked on an 18-month campaign of armed uprisings in Telangana, West Bengal (Kakdwip), Tripura and Travancore- Cochin between October 1948 and March 1950. In Malabar, the party raised the slogan \\"Telangana's way is our way\\" and \\"Land to the tiller and Power to the People\\" in a campaign April–May 1948. Paddy crops were seized by the party and sold at fair prices. The Malabar revolt was crushed by police forces. After the Second Party Congress CPI suffered a number of set-backs and repression, and party membership dropped to around 25,000 in early 1950. Likewise the membership of the communist-led All India Trade Union Congress dropped from 700,000 to a mere 100,000. On 26 March 1950 CPI was banned by the West Bengal state government. The West Bengal ban would later be followed by prohibitions of the party in Amritsar, Malabar (1949–1951), Madras, Manipur, Ahmednagar, Hyderabad, Travancore-Cochin, Indore and Bhopal. On 2 April 1948 S.A. Dange and other key party leaders in Bombay were jailed. By 1949 2,500 party members were imprisoned across the country. In January 1950 the Cominform instructed the party to abandon the insurrectional line, through an article in its newspaper For a Lasting Peace, for a Peoples Democracy!. BTR was demoted in June 1950, denounced as a 'left adventurist' and replaced by C. Rajeshwar Rao as General Secretary. In April 1951 Ajoy Ghosh became the new General Secretary and the Chinese-inspired guerrilla warfare line was condemned by the new CPI leadership. The Telangana rebellion did however, in spite of Cominform instructions, continue until late 1951. In 1951 CPI contested the first parliamentary elections and emerged as the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha. The Madurai Party Congress, held in 1954, and the Palghat Party Congress of 1956 marked the definitive break with the 1948 line and fully embraced parliamentarian orientation of the party.

He was known for his studies on the chemical theory of indicators, alkoxides and carboxylates of many elements. He was an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, Indian Chemical Society, Chemical Society of London, Royal Institute of Chemistry, National Academy of Sciences, India and Indian Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1965, for his contributions to chemical sciences.  Biography  Allahabad University - Faculty of Science Rajasthan University. Ram Charan Mehrotra was born in a middle-class family on 16 February 1922 in Kanpur in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to Ram Bharose Mehrotra, a small-time cloth merchant and his homemaker wife, Chameli Devi. He lost both his parents before he turned 10 and had to continue his studies depending on merit scholarships and part-time jobs like private tuition. His primary schooling was at Municipal School, Kanpur and later he joined Christ Church School (present-day Christ Church College, Kanpur) from where he passed the intermediate course, standing first in the state. Joining the University of Allahabad in 1939 for his graduate studies, he completed the course on the strength of three scholarships and passed BSc with Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry as optional subjects. He continued at the university for MSc in chemistry which he passed with first rank in 1943. During this period, he was also involved in student politics in connection with the Quit India Movement of 1942 and had to stay away from studies for four months. Before starting his formal academic career by joining Allahabad University in 1944 as a member of faculty of inorganic chemistry, Mehrotra worked at Vigyan Kala Bhawan, Daurala, a local learning centre involved in teaching science to prospective young entrepreneurs, for ten months during 1943–44 and was also associated with Vigyan Pragati, a science magazine published by National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR) of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. He served the university till 1954; in between, he had a short stint of two years at Birkbeck College from 1950 to 1952 as a British Council Fellow and part- time faculty, working with Donald Charlton Bradley; he utilised this period to secure a PhD from the University of London in 1952. He returned to India the same year and resumed his service at Allahabad University when he was offered the position of a reader at Lucknow University in 1954. After serving four years there, he moved to Gorakhpur University in 1958 as a professor where, a year later, he was promoted as the dean of the faculty of science. It was during this time, he served as a member of the Review Committee in Chemistry of the University Grants Commission of India under the chairmanship of T. R. Seshadri, where his colleagues included Asima Chatterjee, a noted chemist. In 1962, on invitation of Mohan Sinha Mehta, the then vice chancellor of the University of Rajasthan, he took up the post of a professor and head of the newly formed chemistry department and served the institution for two decades. In between, he had a five-year stint as the vice chancellor of Delhi University (from 1974 to 1979) and a short assignment as a UGC National Fellow in December 1979 but on completion of those assignments, he returned to Rajasthan University, where he stayed till 1982; on his move from the university, he was made an emeritus professor. That year, he became associated with the activities of the University Grants Commission, first as the chairman of the Commission on Revision of Pay Scales to Teachers which submitted its report to UGC in 1986. Simultaneously, when the National Commission on Teachers was constituted by the Government of India in 1983 under the chairmanship of D. P. Chattopadhyaya, he was appointed as a member of the Research Advisory Committee. After his assignment with the committee, he took up the chair of the Book Writing Project of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and in 1991, he was appointed as the vice chancellor of the University of Allahabad, a position he held in 1993. Mehrotra was married to Suman, a Hindi scholar, whom he married in 1944 around the same time when he joined Allahabad University. The couple had two daughters, Rashmi and Shalini and one son, Piyush Mehrotra, in between. He died on 11 July 2004, reportedly due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, at the age of 82.  Legacy = Researches  Mehrotra, during his early years in research, made notable contributions in analytical chemistry which included studies on tin, gold and hydrated copper oxide. Through his researches on the chemical theory of indicators, he elucidated the applicability of universal type of indicators, ceramic salts and of hypobromites and widened the understanding of alkoxides and carboxylates of many elements. His work covered the synthesis of several metallic compounds such as polymetaphosphates, alkoxides, beta-diketonates, carboxylates, thiolates and dialky 1 dithiophosphates.  Academics  While serving Rajasthan University as a professor, Mehrotra was known to have contributed in organizing a research school there and successfully tried to obtain Special Assistance Program as well as University Leadership Program from UGC. The research school has since published several original research papers in international journals. Similarly, he established research schools on inorganic and organometallic chemistry at the universities of Allahabad, Lucknow, and Delhi. During 1971–72, as a UGC National Professor, he delivered lectures at many Indian universities and he was a pioneer in popularizing science through Hindi medium for which he was awarded a cash prize by the Government of India in 1985. Besides over 800 articles published in peer reviewed international journals, he authored five books viz. Metal alkoxides, Metal [beta][beta]-diketonates and Allied Derivatives, Metal Carboxylates, Alkoxo and Aryloxo Derivatives of Metals and Organometallic Chemistry. He has also prepared texts for Indira Gandhi National Open University as a member of the Block Preparation Team.  Administration  Mehrotra was involved in policy-making bodies from early stages of his career when he sat in the Review Committee in Chemistry in 1960 and the committee made a number of recommendations on improvement of curriculum, research environment, and examination procedures of chemistry education in India. During 1963–67, he sat in the Chemical Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission of India. The Commission on Revision of Pay Scales to Teachers which he chaired in 1983 recommended that the procedure for selection of teachers should also include an assessment of the physical and mental abilities of the candidates. The commission also recommended for pay scale revision of the teaching staff ranging from over 200 to more than 300 per cent which was subsequently accepted by the Government of India and the revision was implemented in 1987 with retrospective effective from 1 January 1986. Mehrotra served as the president of the chemistry section of the Indian Science Congress Association in 1967, he would also serve as its national president in 1979. Besides participating in the UGC ad-hoc commissions, he was also associated with the body as a convener of its chemistry panel and his association with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) included the chair of the Chemical Research Committee (1975) and membership in CSIR Society and CSIR Governing Body (1963–66 and 1976–80). He served as the president of the Indian Chemical Society (1976–77) and Vigyan Parishad, Allahabad, as the vice president of the Indian National Science Academy - INSA (1977–78) and as a member of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (1977–81). He was also a member of the INSA council from 1979 to 1981.  Awards and honors  During his early years at Allahabad University, Basu received the E. G. Hill Memorial Prize of the University in 1949 for the best research work by a member of the science faculty. The Indian National Science Academy elected Basu as a fellow in 1964 and the University of London honored him with the degree of Doctor of Science in 1965. The ensuing years would see him receive several honoris causa doctorates from Indian universities viz. Meerut University (1976), Kanpur University (1996), Jhansi University (2000) and Banares Hindu University (2000). The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1965. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry awarded him the FICCI Award for Science and Technology in 1975 and he received the Professor T. R. Seshadri Seventieth Birthday Commemoration Medal of the Indian National Science Academy in 1976 and the P. C. Ray Award of the Indian Chemical Society in 1977. He was awarded the National Fellowship by the University Grants Commission in 1980 and the Golden Jubilee Medal by the Institute of Science, Mumbai in 1984. The J. C. Ghosh Medal of the Indian Chemical Society reached Mehrotra in 1986, followed by the Academic Achievements Award of the Sōka University in 1987. The Indian Science Congress Association honored him with four awards; starting with the Platinum Jubilee Distinguished Service Award in 1988; followed by G. P. Chatterjee Award in 1991, Acharya Narendra Dev Award in 1992 and Ashutosh Mukherjee Award in 1993. In between, he received the inaugural Atmaram Award of the Central Institute of Hindi. The Chemical Research Society of India awarded him Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999 and the Indian Chemical Society awarded him the Platinum Jubilee Award in 2000. He was an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy and National Academy of Sciences, India and a fellow of the Chemical Society of London, Royal Institute of Chemistry and the Indian Chemical Society. He also delivered several award orations and featured lectures; Special lecture at the XVII International Conference on Coordination Chemistry (1977), Plenary lecture at the XIX International Conference on Coordination Chemistry (1978), Plenary lecture at the IV International Conference on Solute-Solvent Interaction (1978), Clarence Karcher Memorial Lecture of University of Oklahoma (1982), the inaugural Foundation Lecture of the Federation of Asian Chemical Societies (1987) and N.

His own Slovo albums also explore themes of social justice and political struggle. Randall has given talks about music and politics at a number of universities and festivals and has written a book on the subject, Sound System – The Political Power of Music (Pluto Press 2017). Tom Robinson's (BBC Radio 6 Music) endorsement of the book describes it as: \\"A passionate first-hand exploration of the propaganda value of culture - and the ways in which music and politics have always been inextricably linked. Dave Randall traces that link across continents, cultures and centuries since the dawn of recorded time. His broad sweep encompasses everything from the world of today's touring musician to the struggles of Billie Holiday and Fela Kuti, the skewering of Shostakovich by the CIA and the political origins of the Caribbean steel pan. This engaging, hugely readable book describes aspects of the musical world I recognise - alongside other, deeply shocking aspects of which I'd never been remotely aware. It should be compulsory reading for anyone interested in the state of the world - and in the essential, life- affirming role music can play in changing it for the better.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:British writers Category:British male musicians Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Dave Randall (musician)"},{"id":"52230766","text":"George R.

His relics were removed to Quanzhou, China, and Tolentino, Italy, by Odoric of Pordenone. He is now venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, with his feast day on April 9. Life Thomas was born in Tolentino. in the March of Ancona within the Papal States around 1250 to 1260.. Becoming a Franciscan early in life, he developed a reputation for his strict adherence to its rule, particularly concerning his vow of poverty. A fellow of StNicholas of Tolentino and one of Angelo da Clareno's Spiritual Franciscans, Thomas was jailed twice for his excessive condemnation of luxury. After being released through the intervention of Raymond Godefroy, a new minister general who sympathized with the Spiritualists, Thomas traveled with Angelo da Clareno, Marco da Montelupone, Pietro da Macerata, and Angelo da Tolentino to mission in Lesser Armenia in 1289. In 1291, its King Haython II directed him to return to the courts of Rome, Paris, and London to seek help against his Muslim foes. His efforts to raise a new crusade were unsuccessful and he returned east, departing a second time to gather more missionaries. Returning with twelve companions in 1302, he worked in Armenia and Persia. He debated Armenian Christians he considered heretics at Sis in 1305 and participated in the Council of Sis that notionally reunited the Armenian and Roman Catholic churches in 1307. While in Persia, two letters dated 1305 and 1306 arrived from John of Montecorvino, the Franciscan missionary to China, and Thomas again traveled to Europe, delivering the correspondence to Rome in 1307. While there, he addressed a public consistory of the pope and cardinals, praising John's work in China and asking for assistance in developing his mission. He also discussed the matter with Clement V at Poitiers in 1308, after which an ecclesiastical hierarchy was established for the Roman Catholics in China. The pontiff named John archbishop of Khanbaliq (now within modern Beijing) and seven Franciscan bishops and many friars were sent to join him. Only three of the bishops and a few friars, however, successfully completed the journey. Thomas seems to have then travelled a fourth time to Armenia and Persia. There is a gap until 1320, during which Thomas may have labored in India or China. In 1320, Thomas left from Hormuz with his fellow Franciscans Bl. James of Padua and Peter of Siena, the Dominican Jordan of Severac, and the layman Demetrio da Tifliz. A Georgian or Armenian, Demetrius was proficient at languages and served as the group's interpreter. A storm forced the party to land at Thane on the island of Salsette Island near Mumbai in India, en route and were greeted by local Christians of the Church of the East. Jordan left them to preach at Bharuch, reaching Sopara (see Sopara in history) before he heard Demetrius and the Franciscans had been arrested.. The family with whom they were staying had fallen into a quarrel and the husband had beaten his wife. When she went to the qadi to report this abuse, she had mentioned the four clerics as witnesses and they were called before him. Thomas, James, and Demetrius had gone to the court while Peter remained behind to look after their things. Having begun a discussion of religion, the qadi had asked them their opinion of Muhammad and Thomas replied bluntly that he was \\"the son of perdition and had his place in Hell with the Devil his father\\". At this, the Muslims around the court called for their death for blasphemy.. Some accounts claim they were scourged and tortured before their execution by beheading on April 8, 1321. Peter was killed three days later. Legacy The local Christians may have buried Thomas and his companions but Jordanus Catalani, arriving too late to save them, removed their bodies to the church at Supera with the help of a Genovese youth. In 1323 or 1326, Odoric of Pordenone passed through the region. Having learned about Thomas and his companions, he took their relics with him to Quanzhou in Fujian. Thomas's skull he took with him to Khanbaliq and thence back to Europe, where he bestowed it on the Franciscan chapter in Tolentino in 1330. It was later moved to the town's cathedral by a Pisan merchant in the late 14th century, who erected a chapel there in the martyr's honor with the approval of Boniface IX. It is now kept in the central cathedral in a silver bust. Thomas and his companions have been unofficially reckoned beatified since the 14th century. Jordan claimed to have miraculously healed the dysentery of his Genovese companion with one of Thomas's teeth. Thomas's cult was approved by Pius VII in 1809 and again by Leo XIII in 1894..

Its fruit bodies have brownish caps with tinges of purple or red. The cap underside has a pore surface the same colour as the cap, and minute pores. Nigroporus vinosus has a pantropical distribution. It has been recorded from Africa, North America, Central America, South America, Asia, and Oceania. It is a wood-decay fungus that causes a white rot. Taxonomy The fungus was first described scientifically by Miles Joseph Berkeley as Polyporus vinosus in 1852. The type was collected in Saint-Domingue by Augustus Sallé. Berkeley called the fungus \\"a very remarkable species, to which I can point out nothing closely allied.\\" William Alphonso Murrill made it the type species of his newly created genus Nigroporus in 1905. He noted that the fungus was \\"easily recognized by its wine-coloured context.\\" In the interim between Berkeley and Murrill's nomenclatural changes, the species was shuffled between several genera: Polystictus (Saccardo, 1888); Microporus (Kuntze, 1898); and Coriolus (Patouillard, 1900). In 1952, Rokuya Imazeki proposed a transfer to Fomitopsis. Description The fruit bodies of Nigroporus vinosus are annual to perennial. Their caps are leathery to smooth, and sometimes has concentric zones. The colour is reddish-brown to purplish-brown to dark violet. Pores on the cap underside any minute, numbering seven or eight per millimetre; the tubes are up to long. The pore surface has the same colours as the cap. The tough context, coloured dark brown to reddish brown, is pliable when fresh but become brittle when dry. The spore print is white. The odour and taste of the context are indistinct. The hyphal system of Nigroporus vinosus is variable. According to E.J.H. Corner, \\"Some collections appear to be almost trimitic; others are dimitic and, yet, others are almost monomitic with elongate intercalary skeletal cells.\\" There are no cystidia in the hymenium. The spores are small, measuring 3–4.5 by 1–1.5 µm. They are smooth and thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), with an allantoid (long with rounded ends) to broadly ellipsoid shape. They are unreactive with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are thin walled and club shaped, measuring 6–10 by 3–4 µm. Similar species Nigrofomes melanoporus is somewhat similar in appearance to Nigroporus vinosus. Known from tropical regions and from Florida, this fungus has a larger cap that is up to wide, a hard dark brown to purplish black cap surface, a dark brown to blackish pore surface with pores arranged in a honeycomb, and ellipsoid spores measuring 4–5 by 3–3.5 µm. Habitat and distribution Nigroporus vinosus is a white rot fungus that typically grows on the decaying wood of hardwood trees, although it has also been recorded growing on pine. Fruit bodies occur singly, in groups, or in overlapping clusters. The fungus has been recorded from Central America, South America, Cuba, Papua New Guinea, China, India, the Philippines, Peninsular Malaysia, and Micronesia. In Africa, it is widespread but not common. It is the only species of Nigroporus found in North America.

It combines strength, agility, flexibility, and balance. For it to be considered hand to hand acrobatics, the top performer must be making physical contact only with the base's hands, with her own hands keeping her balanced. Positions the top can perform in this style of acrobatics are straddles, handstands, pikes, press to handstand, one arm handstands, planches, flags, and many others. Hand to hand acrobatics can also include dynamic catches and throws that either begin with a throw from a hand to hand position or end in a catch in the hand to hand position. Hand to hand acrobatics has been used in a variety of contexts throughout history. These include circus acrobatics, acrobatic gymnastics, muscle beaches, acroyoga, and strongman competitions.  Circus acrobatics  In circus shows such as Le Rêve or Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away, hand to hand acrobatics have featured as an important part of the show. Often the circus will recruit gymnasts from sports such as acrobatic gymnastics because hand to hand acrobatics is such a big part of that sport. Hand to hand acrobatics also appears within other disciplines in the circus arts. Aerialists, trapeze flyers, and contortionists often use hand to hand acrobatics. There are times when aerialists and contortionists perform alone, but when performing in pairs or groups, simple hand to hand acrobatics is often incorporated. For example, this may involve one person hanging from a hoop or curtain while holding another person in the air below them. In the case of trapeze artists, many of the throws and catches are hand to hand grabs, and handstands are often performed between throws to not only show strength but to give the flyer a short amount of time to collect themselves before being thrown across the stage again. Acrobatic gymnastics According to Chrissy Antoniades, an acrobat who represented Team USA and is now working at The House of Dancing Water in Macau, China, acrobatic gymnastics is not a well-known sport. The routines are performed on the same spring floor gymnasts use for floor exercise competitions. Partner balances, tosses, catches, dance, and tumbling elements are all choreographed and performed to music. Working in groups or pairs, hand to hand acrobatics is especially stressed in the sport. While you are allowed to perform skills on other body parts, it is very common to see skills performed in the hand to hand fashion. This is true especially in the case of pairs—two athletes working together in a routine. The first use of acrobatics as a specific sport was in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, and the first acrobatic world championships were in 1974. At this time many acrobats were not performing the same types of routines one would see today. Instead, for groups of four boys, they would have only one balance skill where all four of them are stacked on top of each other, and hand to hand acrobatic moves of the competitors choice were performed. Acroyoga Acroyoga is a recent practice stemming from acrobatic gymnastics. It features hand to hand acrobatics in a similar way, but routines are not performed as in the sport. Jason Nemer, the creator of acroyoga, made it a combination of hand to hand acrobatics, yoga, fitness, and healing within balance. While hand to hand acrobatics is a small part in acroyoga, it is more common to do many different types of balancing positions.  College campuses  A small group of college students perform hand to hand acrobatics in their own acrobatic competitions. Currently, only girls are allowed to compete in the sport. The sport resembles cheerleading more than it does acrobatics. Teams that compete come from Baylor University, West Liberty University, East Texas Baptist University, Quinnipiac University, University of Oregon, Hawaii Pacific University, Converse College, and Arizona Christian University.  Strongman  In strongman culture, handstands are often an impressive feat due to the massive size of these men. While their form is far different from those in gymnastics, their hand to hand acrobatics resemble acts closer to what one would find in places such as muscle beach. California is a huge breeding ground for those types of athletes. Instructions from strongmen on how to perform handstands vary from what one would find in gymnastics, but they fall under the same category.

Description The Spina Hotel is a two-story brick building with a footprint of . The northeast and southeast corners are cut off at an angle, and contain the principal doors. Cast iron columns decorate the eastern façade of the first floor and both angled corners. The building's National Register nomination describes the overall style as \\"mild commercial classicism.\\" The second story has a deep indentation at the rear, giving it a U-shape. The two angled corners sport false balconies flanked by wooden columns. All along the second story, paired one-over-one sash windows are topped by arches filled with decorative iron panels. At the time of the building's nomination to the National Register in 1980, the first floor interior contained the hotel lobby, a bar, a barbershop, another commercial storefront, and a post office, while the hotel rooms were all on the second floor. At that time some of the original interior details, such as wood trim, pressed metal ceilings, and light fixtures, were still extant. History The Spina Hotel was built in 1913 as the local economy was developing rapidly from iron mining on the Cuyuna Range. The hotel's design anticipated an era of grandiosity. However the economic boom never fully materialized, and Ironton's population began to decline after 1920. The Spina Hotel remains a largely intact vestige of a deliriously optimistic period in local history.

Overview  Victim caching is a hardware technique to improve performance of caches proposed by Norman Jouppi. As mentioned in his paper: A victim cache is a hardware cache designed to decrease conflict misses and improve hit latency for direct-mapped caches. It is employed at the refill path of a Level 1 cache, such that any cache-line which gets evicted from the cache is cached in the victim cache. Thus, the victim cache gets populated only when data is thrown out of Level 1 cache. In case of a miss in Level 1, the missed entry is looked up in the victim cache. If the resulting access is a hit, the contents of the Level 1 cache-line and the matching victim cache line are swapped. Though initially proposed by Jouppi to improve cache performance of a direct-mapped cache Level 1, modern day microprocessors with multi-level cache hierarchy employ Level 3/ Level 4 cache to act as victim cache for the cache lying above it in the memory hierarchy. Intel's Crystal Well of its Haswell processors introduced an on-package Level 4 cache which serves as a victim cache to processor's Level 3 cache. A 4–12 MB Level 3 cache is used as a victim cache in POWER5 (IBM) microprocessors.  Background  As hardware architecture and technology advanced, processor performance and frequency grew much faster than memory cycle times, leading to a large gap in performance. The problem of increasing memory latency, relative to processor speed, has been dealt with by adding high speed cache memory. Direct-mapped caches have faster access time than set-associative caches. However; when multiple cache blocks in memory map to the same cache-line in a direct-mapped cache, they end up evicting each other when anyone of them is accessed. This is known as the cache-conflict problem. This problem is resolved by increasing the associativity of the cache. But there is a limit to which associativity can be increased owing to the complexity in its implementation. Thus, for solving the cache conflict problem for a cache with limited associativity victim cache is employed.  Implementation  The behavior of a victim cache in its respective interaction with the corresponding level cache is given below: Cache Hit: No action Cache Miss, Victim Hit: The block is in the victim cache and the one in the cache are replaced with each other. This new entry in victim cache becomes the most recently used block.Implementation Example Cache Miss, Victim Miss: The block is brought to cache from next level. The block evicted from the cache gets stored in Victim cache. Example: Suppose a direct- mapped L1 cache with blocks A, B pointing to the same set. It is linked to a 2 entry fully associative victim cache with blocks C, D in it. The trace to be followed: A, B, A, B… From the diagram, we can see that, in case of victim cache (VC) hit, blocks A and B are swapped. The least recently used block of VC remains as it is. Hence, it gives an illusion of associativity to the direct-mapped L1 cache, in turn reducing the conflict misses. In case of two caches, L1 and L2 with exclusive cache policy (L2 does not cache same the memory locations as L1), L2 acts as the victim cache for L1.  Performance implication  While measuring performance improvement by using victim cache, Jouppi assumed a Level-1 direct-mapped cache augmented with a fully associative cache. For the test suite used by him, on an average 39% of the Level-1 data cache misses are found to be conflict misses, while on an average 29% of the Level-1 instruction misses are found to be conflict misses. Since conflict misses amount to large percentage of total misses, therefore providing additional associativity by augmenting the Level 1 cache with a victim cache is bound to improve total miss rate significantly. Experimental results are deduced by considering a 32-Kb Direct-Mapped, 2-way and fully associative cache augmented with a 256 block (8 KB) victim cache and running on it 8 randomly selected SPEC95 Benchmarks. While the results cannot be generalized for all benchmarks, adding a victim cache provides a miss rate reduction ranging from 10% to 100% for all the cache configuration. The returns although seem to level off beyond victim cache size of 50 blocks, thus proving Jouppi's observation that victim cache benefits reach a plateau after the first few victim blocks. Miss rate reduction for a 64 KB cache size are found to be significantly lower, proving that victim caching is not indefinitely scalable. While comparing various cache configuration it was found that in certain cases adding a small victim cache can give performance benefit equivalent to that observed by multiplying the cache size by 2.

The greenfield airport will be located near the villages of Ambodi, Sonori, Kumbharvalan, Ekhatpur-Munjawadi, Khanwadi, Pargaon Memane, Rajewadi, Aamble, Tekwadi, Vanpuri, Udachiwadi, Singapur near Saswad and Jejuri in Purandar taluka of Pune District in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The CIDCO will hold 51 per cent stake in the SPV, while MADC's stake will be around 19 per cent. The remaining 30 per cent will be divided between the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). The Government of Maharashtra has declared that the first flight from this airport is expected to take off by 2019 and the airport will be named after the King of Maratha Empire, Sambhaji Maharaj who was born at Purandar fort. The Airports Authority of India conducted surveys on various areas near Pune for a new airport for the city. Initially a site near Chakan was fixed for the airport. But due to opposition from local farmers and the mountainous terrain, the government decided to set the new airport in Purandar taluka as it was a flatter region compared to Chakan. The proposed airport in Purandar will be spread over 2,400 hectares. This airport will also boost trade from Pune and neighbouring districts as it will have its own dedicated cargo terminal.  Background  Lohagaon air force station serves as an international airport for the city. Due to restricted traffic, only two to four international flights can operate from the airport. Moreover, it is an Air Force base and has a single civil terminal which operates both international as well as domestic traffic. Almost 65 to 70 flights operate connecting major domestic destinations. This is crowding the existing airport and leading to delay of flights as the airport has only eight parking bays out of which one is used for VIP's and other is used for charter operations and the remaining carry the load of international as well as domestic flights. Hence, this led to the need for a dedicated international airport for the city as the city is one of the fastest growing cities in India and is included in the Smart City program of the Indian government. However, until completion of the new airport, the existing airport will be expanded. Connection Rajewadi railway station on the Pune–Miraj–Londa line is nearest to the site. The proposed airport will be connected with six different routes including national highways 48 and 65. There will also be a special ring-road connecting major industrial establishments with the proposed airport from Hadapsar.  Land acquisition protests  The farmers in these villages are against the project due to concerns of land loss. Since it was announced that the proposed Pune international airport would come up in Purandar Taluka, local villagers and landowners have been up in arms in protest. Several attempts made by the government and district administration have failed to pacify the agitated landowners. On 26 December 2016, after a lull, thousands of villagers from six villages in Purandar blocked the Pune-Pandharpur Road for nearly two hours, in protest against the new airport.

Her 1941 PhD from the University of Edinburgh, completed under the supervision of Max Born in just two years, is believed to make her the first Irish-born and -raised woman to receive a doctorate in the mathematical sciences.  Life  Sheila Tinney, Paul Dirac, and other physicists and mathematicians at DIAS in 1942 Sheila Christina Power was the fourth of six children born in Galway city to Michael Power [a.k.a. Mícheál de Paor, originally from rural Kilkenny, Chair of Mathematics at University College Galway (UCG) from 1912–1955] and Christina Cunniffe (who died in childbirth when Sheila was 12). She was educated by the Dominican nuns, both in Galway and in Dublin, and was awarded Honours in Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate Examination (the nation's secondary school exit exam), one of only 8 girls to do so in the whole country. After one year attending UCG, she switched to University College Dublin (UCD), from which she graduated with a BSc in 1938, with First Class Honours in Mathematics, and ranked at the top of her class. She did her Master's at UCD in 1939, and was subsequently awarded a National University of Ireland travelling studentship, which enabled her to undertake research at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Two years later, in 1941, she earned her doctorate under the supervision of the celebrated physicist Max Born on the stability of crystal lattices. Returning to Dublin, she became an assistant lecturer at University College Dublin, and was also one of the first three scholars appointed to the brand new Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS), in October 1941. While at the DIAS she worked with Paul Dirac, Arthur Eddington and Erwin Schrödinger. She developed a great interest in quantum physics, and wrote papers with Schrödinger, Hideki Yukawa, and Walter Heitler. From September 1948 to June 1949 she took a leave of absence from UCD and was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton where worked in an environment that included Freeman Dyson, Hermann Weyl, Harish-Chandra, and Albert Einstein. She developed the first mathematical courses on quantum mechanics at UCD and taught the subject to generations of students there, until her early retirement in 1979. In 1952, she married Seán Tinney, a former engineering student she had lectured, and the couple's three children include classical pianist Hugh Tinney.  Pioneer and role model for women in academia  By 1900 the campaign for the acceptance of women in academia was largely successful, and even Trinity College Dublin began admitting women in 1904. But the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) threw up legal obstacles and did not bow to the inevitable until 1949 when it finally admitted four women–one of them Sheila Tinney. In 2016 the RIA honoured Tinney by hanging her portrait along with 11 other female academic leaders on its walls. Even at University College Dublin, Tinney faced the entrenched prejudice against women. One professor emeritus recalls the sympathy she received when, early in her career, she was passed over for promotion in favour of a younger, and demonstrably less academically qualified, male colleague. During her time at UCD she gained a reputation for helping younger female colleagues who were trying to develop their careers.  Legacy  The special medal cast for the 25 Global Winners of The Undergraduate Awards in 2016 (presented 10 November in Dublin) honoured Sheila Tinney, \\"trail-blazing and brilliant academic, who achieved astounding success through self-belief and determination.\\" In 2016, the RIA unveiled a portrait of Tinney by Vera Klute as part of the Women on Walls exhibition. In August 2018, a plaque was unveiled in UCD in honour of Tinney.

It has 417 members (2018). Since 2008 it uses sport and games to improve education, health and equal opportunity for children and adolescents in Tanzania.  Activities  Jambo Bukoba promotes education, health (through age-appropriate HIV/AIDS and hygiene education) and gender equality between the sexes. The organization’s concept was developed by the German Sport University CologneJambo Bukoba: Sport und Entwicklung in Tansania. Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln.

The aim is to support and empower children and young adolescents in their day-to-day school environment so that they have a better start in life and brighter prospects for the shaping and improvement of their own futures.  Approach  From the office in Bukoba, the Tanzanian subsidiary carries out projects throughout the Kagera region in the north-west of the country. These projects are built on three pillars: teacher development, sports competitions and school building projects. * Jambo Bukoba e.V. staff organizes teacher workshops in Tanzania. Attendees are trained in the Jambo Bukoba concept and the games specially developed by the German Sport University Cologne. Medical professionals are brought in to provide HIV/AIDS education. Furthermore, teachers are developed as multipliers * Open sports competitions featuring Jambo Bukoba games are run. Known as Bonanzas, the focus of these competitions is not on sporting performance but on gender parity, fair play and good team work. Four schools vie with each other in each district. A regional bonanza final is held once a year during which winning district schools compete. This is a major event for all participants with a fun and festive spirit of music and dance. * The school that triumphs in the regional Bonanza wins the opportunity to realize a school building project. The school decides on its most urgent construction requirements. Jambo Bukoba then contributes 75% to the overall project costs and the school provides the remaining 25% in the form of cash, work time or materials * Within the scope pf the project \\"WASH\\" (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) water tanks for catching rainwater and hand-washing facilities including soap were built at 8 schools. Furthermore, sanitation workshops for teachers were conducted to improve the knowledge about hygiene in general. In 2018, 8 water filters were installed, to ensure drinking water quality.

The union had its headquarters in Geneva. The UIR aimed to resolve international problems of broadcasting.  History  Since its establishment in 1865, the International Telegraph Union (ITU) focused on wireless point-to-point communications. After the end of World War I, the ITU did not take up the new development of radio broadcasting. The League of Nations and ITU decided not to create international broadcasting regulations as the technology was too \\"young\\" and changing too quickly. The decision left room for international efforts that were not driven by governments. European broadcasters took the initiative, discussing how to deal with national and international problems of broadcasting, and whether the private companies should seek government regulation or establish their own international organization of broadcasters working outside governments. Lengthy negotiations between the various private broadcasters and the British BBC culminated in establishing of the non-governmental International Broadcasting Union. The diverse and complex problems of a growing number of broadcasting stations in Europe required expert knowledge in law, finance, engineering, journalism, and musicology. The experts argued that their efforts would improve the quality of broadcasting to such a degree that the medium would attract a wider radio audience. Their reasoning proved correct. In 1920, only a few thousand homes in Europe had radio receivers, in 1926 this number grew to 5.8 million and in 1931 to 16 million receivers. In 1940, the UIR equipment was evacuated from Brussels to Switzerland, but in 1941 was returned after German request, and was later used by the Wehrmacht to monitor radio activity of Allied forces. Thirteen member countries stopped cooperating with the UIR after it went under German control. After the end of World War II the UIR was discredited as \\"German-friendly\\" in the eyes of many former member states. In March 1946, the Soviet Union demanded dissolution of UIR and establishment of a new international broadcasting organization, where all the satellite states of the USSR would be represented with voting rights. 26 members of UIR founded the alternative International Broadcasting Organisation commonly known as OIR on 28 June 1946. The dispute escalated when the ITU world radio conference was held in 1947 in Atlantic City. Both organizations, the OIR and the UIR, demanded to participate at this meeting as \\"technical experts\\". Both organizations were denied this status, instead being allowed only to participate as observers without voting rights. The European follow-up conference in Copenhagen in 1948 had similar outcome. This situation did not satisfy either party. The BBC was not eager to join a new association which was likely to be dominated by the Soviet Union. Moreover, the USSR enrolled some of its member republics as independent states, giving the USSR eight votes in the new organization. France intended to do the same for its North African colonies, which would give it four votes. Great Britain would have had only one. In 1949, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Belgium declared their intention to resign from the OIR. Many Western European countries decided to form a completely new organization despite a mistrust of the United Kingdom – in the opinion of some, the BBC wanted to dominate the new organization. UIR was officially dissolved in 1950, and its remaining assets were transferred to a newly established European Broadcasting Union (EBU). On 1 January 1993, OIR, at that time renamed to OIRT, merged with the EBU.

Though the drug was fully legalized in the District following a 2014 ballot referendum, the United States Congress exercises oversight over the government of the District of Columbia, preventing the local government from regulating cannabis sales like other jurisdictions with authority derived from a U.S. state. Although marijuana is legal under District law, the possession of marijuana is still illegal under federal law. Marijuana prohibition is enforced on federal lands, including national parks and military property. The federal government controls about 29% of the District's total land area (about 18 square miles), including the National Mall, West Potomac Park, Rock Creek Park, and Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling.Ted Mellnik & Denise Lu, Graphic: Marijuana still illegal on federal land, Washington Post (February 24, 2015).Martin Austermuhle, Here's Just About Everything You Need To Know About Pot Legalization In D.C., WAMU (February 25, 2015). Restricted to prescription (1906) In 1906, Congress introduced An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes, requiring that certain medicines, including cannabis, be limited to licensed pharmacists and prescribed. Medical cannabis Initiative 59 was a 1998 Washington, D.C. voter-approved ballot initiative that sought to legalize medical cannabis. The short title of the initiative was \\"Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998\\". Though the initiative passed with 69% of the vote in November 1998, its implementation was delayed by Congress's passage of the Barr Amendment, which prohibited DC from using its funds in support of the program. This Amendment delayed the start of the medical marijuana program until it was effectively overturned in 2009, with the first DC customer legally purchasing medical cannabis at a dispensary in the District in 2013. In May 2010, the Council of the District of Columbia passed a bill legalizing medical marijuana. The Congress did not overrule the measure within the 30-legislative-day period, and as a result medical cannabis became legal on January 1, 2011. Though carefully regulated through a lengthy permitting process, dispensaries began opening and cultivation centers were allowed.  Decriminalization (2014)  In a January 2014 poll by The Washington Post, roughly eight in 10 city residents supported legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana. On March 4, 2014, the Council of the District of Columbia decriminalized possession of cannabis. The new law went into effect in July, following the mandatory 30-day congressional review period. Congress sought to block D.C.'s decriminalization through another rider. On June 25, 2014, House Republicans, led by Maryland representative Andy Harris blocked funding for the D.C. law. The Harris amendment bans the D.C. government from spending any funds on efforts to lessen penalties for Schedule I federal drug crimes. Harris argued that the D.C. law was \\"bad policy\\" assessing a fine of $25—a fraction of the $100 fine in Maryland. In response, activists launched the Boycott of Maryland's 1st District, Harris' constituency. Legalization Initiative 71 was a Washington, D.C. voter-approved ballot initiative that legalized the recreational use of cannabis. The short title of the initiative was Legalization of Possession of Minimal Amounts of Marijuana for Personal Use Act of 2014. The measure was approved by 64.87% of voters on November 4, 2014 and went into full effect February 26, 2015. Under the legalization measure that went into effect in 2015, persons over the age of 21 in D.C. may possess up to two ounces of marijuana, grow up to three mature and three immature marijuana plants in their homes, and transfer up to one ounce of marijuana to another individual. Drug paraphernalia, such as bongs, were also legalized. The sale, purchase, and public consumption of marijuana remains illegal.  Opposition in Congress  In mid-December 2014, Congress passed an omnibus spending bill (nicknamed the \\"CRomnibus\\"--a portmanteau of omnibus and continuing resolution) that ended the federal ban on medical marijuana, but that also included a legislative rider targeted at D.C.'s Initiative 71. The rider's final language barred the use of funds to \\"enact any law, rule, or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution of any schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) or any tetrahydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes.\\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr83enr/pdf/BILLS-113hr83enr.pdf The final language notably solely used the phrase \\"enact\\" rather than \\"enact or carry out.\\" Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said that \\"she was told by Democratic budget negotiators that the omission was made on purpose to give city leaders a chance to argue that in moving forward, the District is only carrying out, and not enacting, the measure.\\" Norton reiterated this point in an Initiative 71 questions and answers section on her House Web site. Both D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and the Council of the District of Columbia took the position that the voter-approved initiative became self-enacting. On January 13, 2015, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson sent the measure to Congress for a mandatory 30-day review period, in accordance with the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. On February 24, 2015, Representatives Jason Chaffetz and Mark Meadows sent a letter to Bowser urging her to not move forward with Initiative 71. Congressional Republicans, including the omnibus rider author's Andy Harris, threatened prison time for the D.C. mayor and others involved, suggesting that they could be prosecuted by the Justice Department under the Antideficiency Act, which \\"imposes criminal penalties on government employees who knowingly spend public funds in excess of their appropriated budgets.\\" Marijuana arrest patterns Between 2010 and 2015, the total number of marijuana-distribution arrests made by all police agencies in DC (the Metropolitan Police Department, Metro Transit Police Department, and federal agencies such as the U.S. Park Police and U.S. Capitol Police), declined by 80%. The number of arrests for marijuana distribution and marijuana possession with intent to distribute was 1,378 in 2010, and 234 in 2015.Andrew Giambrone, Marijuana-Distribution Arrests in D.C. Decreased More Than 80 Percent Between 2010 and 2015, Washington City Paper (January 13, 2016). In 2016, however, more than 400 people were arrested in D.C. for public consumption of marijuana, and numbers remained high in 2017. Arrests for marijuana distribution also sharply increased from 80 in 2015 to 220 in 2016.Justin Wm. Moyer, D.C. arrests for public use of marijuana nearly tripled last year, Washington Post (July 11, 2017). Protests and events On 20 April 2017, local activist Adam Eidinger and six other activists were arrested by U.S. Capitol Police, during a public event where they handed out free cannabis cigarettes to anyone with a Congressional ID badge. Economy Although D.C. law prohibits the selling of cannabis, a number of entrepreneurs have sought to exploit the legal gray area around the drug. Kush Gods is a local company which accepts donations and distributes cannabis, with a fleet of cars decorated with vinyl wraps of cannabis leaves, while stating that they are not selling cannabis. The owner of Kush Gods pleaded guilty in 2016 to two counts of distributing cannabis. A number of cannabis \\"pop-ups\\" have appeared in D.C., hosting events in which donations are accepted and cannabis distributed. In 2018 D.C. police raided the XO Lounge, where a number of vendors were distributing cannabis, and selling items such as stickers or football cards, with the cannabis being given out as a \\"gift\\" along with purchase. Twenty-two vendors were arrested and charged with possession with intent to distribute (a misdemeanor), but the charges were later dropped.

Works Victimless Leather – a prototype of a stitch-less jacket, grown from cell cultures into a layer of tissue supported by a coat shaped polymer layer. This is a sub-project of the Tissue Culture & Art Project where the artists are growing a leather jacket without killing any animals. Growing the victimless leather problematizes the concept of garment by making it semi- living. This artistic grown garment is intended to confront people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems. Pig Wings Project with Ionat Zurr and Guy Ben-Ary was developed in 2000-2001 during a residency in the Tissue Engineering and Organ Fabrication Laboratory in Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School. The work used tissue engineering and stem cell technologies in order to grow pig bone tissue in the shape of these three sets of wings. The Pig Wings Project presents the first ever wing-shaped objects grown using living pig tissue. This absurd work presents ethical questions regarding a near future where semi-living objects (objects which are partly alive and partly constructed) exist together with philosophical concepts around inter-species organ transplantation.

Early life and education Born to Narayan Chandra Bashak, a prominent makeup artist in Mymensingh, a city in Mymensingh District in the central region of Bangladesh, Shyamal was instructed in the arts from a young age. He would go on to receive his Masters of Fine Arts in Printmaking from the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka where he would attract attention by receiving the Dhaka University Central Student's Union's Ekushey Padak for his design work commemorating the Language Movement. Career After completing his Masters, Bashak would participate in both group and solo exhibitions including \\"Life Line & Light\\" a three-man exhibition at the Bangladesh National Museum, and \\"Save Human\\" a set of 4 exhibitions to raise funds for flood relief in Bangladesh. He would later be recruited by Bhorer Kagoj to serve as chief artist, until he joined Bangladesh's National Museum of Science and Technology as their senior artist cum audio-visual officer where he would spend two decades making significant improvements to the galleries and various displays, carrying out the design and implementation of \\"Science Park\\" while still working on independent exhibitions throughout Bangladesh and internationally. Attacks It was reported that on May 29, 2013 Bashak was assaulted by Islamic fundamentalist co-workers in attempt to purge prominent Hindus from the National Science Museum. The severity of the assault and his prominence led to the attack being covered across Bangladesh, which led to further attempts on his life including a shooting in December 2013 which, while not killing Bashak resulted in him crashing his motorcycle and receiving serious injuries, and a firebombing of his home a year later.

It stars Shay Mitchell, Kirby Johnson, Stana Katic, Grey Damon and Nick Thune, and follows a former policewoman who encounters the supernatural while working in a morgue. The film was released in the United States on November 30, 2018, by Screen Gems. It received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $43 million worldwide.  Plot  During an exorcism ritual, the possessed Hannah Grace kills the pastor. Her father Grainger then suffocates her to death using a pillow. Three months later, Megan Reed, an ex-cop with the Boston Police Department struggles with depression and an addiction to pills after her patrol partner was shot dead by a criminal whom she failed to subdue. Megan's friend Lisa Roberts finds her a nightshíft job in the Boston Metro Hospital's morgue, located in an intimidating brutalist architecture building (portrayed by Boston City Hall). During Megan's first shift, a man (later identified as Grainger) aggressively tries to convince her to let him into the building, but she denies and informs the two security guards Ernie Gainor and Dave. However, shortly after, Megan helps EMT Randy to move the corpse of a brutally murdered young woman (later identified as the one of Hannah Grace) into the building and the man secretly enters the building. Randy tells Megan a man stabbed Hannah to death and was then caught in the act trying to burn her body in an alleyway. When Megan tries to fingerprint and photograph Hannah's corpse, the camera explodes and the fingerprints return as illegible by the computer. Other strange things occur and Megan becomes more suspicious of the corpse. Megan subsequently researches on the internet only to find out that Hannah had died during an exorcism. She also notices that Hannah's bright blue eye color does not match the one listed on her driver's license. Megan soon encounters Grainger who had invaded the building trying to drag Hannah's corpse through the building. Alongside with the two security guards Ernie and Dave, Megan manages to subdue Grainger. The latter screams Hannah's corpse must be burnt because she isn't really dead, but they do not listen to him and have him arrested by the police. Megan's ex-boyfriend, Andrew Kurtz, is still employed as an officer and responds to the scene. He agrees to help Megan identify the corpse after she tells him about the color of Hannah's eyes. Soon after, Andrew tells Megan that Hannah Grace had died three months earlier and asked Megan whether the given finger prints was Hannah's. Megan confirmed it and Andrew thought maybe there is some error in the computer data. Meanwhile, Hannah kills Dave by telekinetically lifting his body across the ceiling and into her refrigerated drawer in the morgue where she breaks his body. Soon after, Megan notice that some of the wound on Hannah is missing, as if it had healed by itself. Investigating the security footage, Megan sees a glimpse of Hannah's corpse crawling around in the building. She shows the footage to Lisa who does not believe her and accuses her of having a relapse on her addiction to pills. Lisa is killed by Hannah soon after. When Randy returns to the morgue to deliver another corpse, Megan shows Randy the healing body of Hannah. After Randy went out from the Montague, Megan notice that the lift closes by itself and is going down. Megan investigate the security footage and see a glimpse of Hannah's body crawling inside the lift. She rushes down to the access bay to warn Randy, but Hannah has already killed him. Suddenly, Andrew calls Megan to warn her that Grainger has escaped police custody after killing the two officers transporting him. Moments later, Grainger forces Megan to take him to Hannah's body at gunpoint. Grainger explains to Megan that he is Hannah's father. He tells her that numerous exorcisms failed because the demon possessing her was too strong. So strong, in fact, that it is even able to possess Hannah's body after her death by killing people to heal itself, then resting. He tell her that Hannah had depression and it worsened until the demon was able to enter Hannah's body. The blue eye color is the sign of the demon possessing Hannah. Grainger wonders why Hannah killed Dave and Lisa, but did not kill Megan. Megan agrees to help Grainger cremate Hannah, but she reanimates and pushes Grainger into the fire. Then she locks Megan inside her refrigerated drawer. Andrew and Ernie come to Megan's help. Hannah kills Ernie and then tries to kill Andrew, but Megan forces herself to be calm. She picks up Andrew's firearm and shoots Hannah, then drags her to the crematorium while Andrew calls for backup. After a brief struggle before the incinerator, Megan pushes Hannah into the fire, eventually killing the demon. As the movie comes to a close, Megan recounts how she has managed to stay clean for over two months. As she looks into the mirror at her reflection, a single fly-similar to the ones shown in several scenes involving Hannah's corpse earlier in the film-lands on the mirror's surface. Megan promptly smashes it with her hand as the movie ends, leading the audience to wonder whether the fly's appearance is simple coincidence, if Hannah's demon has somehow transferred her essence, in whole or in part, into Megan herself, or simply symbolic that Megan is strong enough to fight her depression, thus not letting any possessive demon to enter her body.

It made $2.6 million on its first day, including $625,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $6.5 million, finishing seventh. Due to it being a \\"low-budget cash grab in the current slow marketplace,\\" anything over $5.5 million would have been considered a success by Sony.

Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 19% based on 53 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.09/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Possession of Hannah Grace feints at real horror just often enough to offer hints of the movie it should have been -- and further frustrate viewers seeking a good scare.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

The tower was built in the 1920s in close proximity to mine Ada, intended to be used in the processing of brown coal. The remains of the plant now stand under conservation, along with other industrial buildings from the nearby brown coal mine. The 35-meter high industrial monument is visible from afar in the lowlands of the Schwarze Elster area.  History  thumbnail thumbnail thumbnail View of the tower from the rear  Historical Background  German industrialization in the mid 19th century began with the discovery of brown coal deposits (also known as lignite) and the construction of the first railway tracks in the Elbe-Elster region. Lieutenant Colonel Hermann von Ploetz, a Prussian aristocrat who had resided on an estate in Doellingen near Elsterwerda since 1856, ordered his servants to drill for lignite on his property. The drilling was successful and thus, on April 1, 1857, lignite was extracted from a shaft known as EmiliaLutz Heydick, Günther Hoppe, Jürgen John (Hrsg.): . Urania Verlag, Leipzig 1982, S. 317. a little east of Doellingen, which was the first time underground mining was carried out in the vicinity.Autorenkollektiv: Hrsg.: Traditionsverein Braunkohle Lauchhammer e. V. Lauchhammer 2003, S. 8. However, the mine did not exist very long. Shortly afterwards, various additional mines were begun, but many of those (for example mine Robert, which was located just a few kilometers west of mine Emilia, did not last long.Jürgen Bartholomäus, Andreas Pöschl (Red.): . In: Kulturamt des Landkreises Elbe-Elster (Hrsg.): . Herzberg/Elster 2001, , S. 147–158.  Mine Ada  In 1911 the second lignite mine in this region was opened. It was an underground mine known as Ada run by the Doellinger Bergbaugesellschaft (Doellingen mining corporation) located north of the Falkenberg-Kohlfurt railway line and on the border between the two districts of Kahla and Doellingen. The coal field was about 4 meters thick and was covered by 30 meters of rock mass. The coal was extracted using the room and pillar system and was hauled up a ramp using a winch and an electric motor. Above ground, there were some drying plants and two briquette presses. The unprocessed coal, which was cut into pieces, sold well to mainly local customers. The majority of the low-quality coal was used to supply the mine with power and steam. In the mine, which occupied 118,000 square meters of space in the early 1920s, up to 170 workers were employed. In 1914 58,000 tons of lignite were produced. This amount of coal could not be produced again until the first year after World War I.  Bertzit Tower  In September 1915 the mining company applied to the mining authorities in Senftenberg for the construction of a Bertzit unit (named after the Bertzit procedure described below). The Bertzit tower was built in 1920 on the initiative of the management of the company running the mine Ada. It is 35 meters high and situated in close proximity to the mine. The tower has a square floor plan with a skeleton construction made of reinforced concrete. It was intended to be part of a coal drying plant, which would use the Bertzit procedure invented by Camillo Mahnhardt from Munich, to dry the lignite. This procedure was developed for the drying of inferior and moister fuels such as peat. The procedure was tested in Pasing near Munich and seemed to be more appealing financially. It promised a cost efficient product enhancement through the doubling of the fuel value. Furthermore, the mine had high lignite deposits, which were ideal for this procedure. It was intended to extract a high quality, anthracite coal-like product using an air-sealed reaction between 250 °C and 300 °C. The majority shareholders of the project were the Bertzit- Aktiengesellschaft in Berlin-Charlottenburg and the Bertzit-Gesellschaft mbH in Munich. The Döllinger mining company was probably just a minority shareholder, but was still a board member. In later years the headquarters of the young company moved to Munich. It is largely unknown why the construction of this facility was not finished ultimately. Local historians assume the reason to be the technological immaturity of the project, which had never been industrially proven before, and therefore the Bertzit-Tower remained an investment ruin. Brown coal extraction in Kahla was stopped in 1929 due to its unprofitability and the last underground mine in the district of Liebenwerda, the mine Ada, was shut down the following year. By then brown coal was already being extracted from open-cast mines in Lauchhammer, to which the mine Ada belonged. In 1942 the mining director Friedrich von Delius had the world's first overburden conveyor bridge built. The bridge was built according to the director's own plans and was set in the mine Agnes in Plessa, near the mine Ada. It revolutionized the mining process, making it much easier. According to the regional historian Jürgen Bartholomäus, the mining ledger of the mine Ada had been stored at the mining authorities in Senftenberg until the 1990s.  Current Condition and Tourism  The Bertzit Tower ruin is 35 meters high and located in the lowlands, so it is visible from afar. Today it is considered the oldest investment ruin in the region.Luise Grundmann, Dietrich Hanspach: . Hrsg.: Institut für Länderkunde Leipzig und der Sächsischen Akad. der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig. Böhlau Verlag, Köln, Weimar, Wien 2005, , S. 80–81. The striking shape and resemblance of this building with a Bavarian church tower, and indeed the Lighthouse of Alexandria, was intended and can be understood as a consequence of industrial heritage. At the turn of the millennium the complex was in danger of being demolished, but instead it was actually placed under conservation. Meanwhile, the complex has been neglected. Many remains of the former brown coal mining industry are located in the region, for example, the Plessa power plant, the Lauchhammer Biotowers (remains of a huge coke oven plant), the briquet company Louise in Domsdorf and the Conveyor Bridge F60. The district of Kahla is located close to highway B169 and the Ruhland-Falkenberg/Elster railway line. Several cycleways connect the village and Bertzit Tower with various tourist attractions in the area, such as the Niederlausitz moorland and nearby Schradenland. Germany's longest bikeway (1111 km ), Tour Brandenbourg, was launched in 2007 and passes by the village. Other routes include the Fürst Pückler Way, the 108 kilometer Schwarze Elster cycle path and the Coal, Wind and Water route, a 250 kilometer journey into the history of energy, which was launched in 2007 and consists of 14 stations throughout the Elbe-Elster district.Broschüre Radtour Kohle-Wind & Wasser-Ein energiehistorischer Streifzug, herausg.: Landkreis Elbe-Elster, 2006  Bibliography    External links  * Der Ortsteil Kahla auf der Homepage des Amtes Plessa.
