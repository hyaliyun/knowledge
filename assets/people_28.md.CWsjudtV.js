Located at 100 Breezehill Avenue North, the school provides single-track Early French Immersion (EFI) programming for the surrounding Hintonburg, Mechanicsville, Centretown, Lebreton Flats and Civic Hospital neighbourhoods. As of 2011, there are currently 380 students enrolled in classes from junior kindergarten to grade six. Architecture Devonshire Community Public School was built in 1910. Its Collegiate Gothic style is typical of Ottawa schools of this era. It features a Tudor arch entranceway, stone and brick details and stone foundation common to these structures. Its large windows and plan reflect its use as a school and the emphasis placed on providing adequate light and air circulation. For instance, the windows were designed specifically to allow sunshine to reach the interior wall of each classroom, thereby maximizing natural light and creating a healthy learning environment for its children. History Soon after the rapidly expanding village of Hintonburg was annexed by the City of Ottawa in 1907, the City secured the Slater Estate on the west side of Breezehill Avenue for the location of a new public school. A year later, the City of Ottawa designated funding for two schools on Breezehill Avenue: one public and one Catholic. Located at the eastern edge of the Hintonburg neighbourhood, the school was sited on a generous parcel of land with a girl‚Äôs play yard on the south, a boy‚Äôs play yard on the north and a front lawn between the building and street. At the time of its opening in 1910, the school was called Breezehill Avenue Public School. The original eight-room school was designed in the popular Collegiate Gothic style by Ottawa Board of Education architect William B. Garvock. Hintonburg and surrounding areas expanded rapidly after the opening of the new school. The school was soon at capacity. As a result, substantial additions were made to each end of the building to accommodate eight more classrooms in 1920. The design was the work of Garvock‚Äôs successor, W.C. Beattie, who also developed the decorative panel treatment on the blank walls of the additions. In 1921, the Duke of Devonshire, Canada‚Äôs Governor General, attended the reopening of the school. The school was renamed \\"Devonshire\\" in his honour. Devonshire housed the Sunshine Class for Crippled Children under the direction of Winnifred Hunt. At the time, similar classes, sponsored by the Rotarian Club, could be found throughout North America. The Sunshine Class moved to another location in 1931, when Devonshire became an intermediate school. W.K. Jeffery designed a gymnasium and further additions to the school in 1931. In 1974, Devonshire underwent another major renovation, which replaced the original gymnasium with a larger structure and change rooms. In 2003, Devonshire was slated to be closed by the Ottawa Carleton District School Board. The local community rallied to ensure that Devonshire stayed open; the school was removed from the closure list in 2005, and enrolment has been growing steadily ever since. In 2008, the City of Ottawa granted a heritage designation to Devonshire Community Public School, thereby recognizing its cultural heritage value, history and importance to the surrounding community. The Hintonburg Community Association has been particularly supportive of the school and its role as a community school. Devonshire celebrated its centennial in 2010, opening a 25-year-old time capsule created by students in 1985, holding a public celebration, and sealing a new time capsule for future students, staff and families, to be opened in 2035. Volunteers took the opportunity to collect memorabilia and stories about the school; these valuable archives and recorded history will be made available to the public. One hundred years after it was built, Devonshire‚Äôs community has continued to grow, both in number and diversity. A survey completed by volunteers in 2010 estimates over 23 languages spoken at the school. In addition, Devonshire achieved Silver EcoSchool certification in 2010, the first OCDSB school to be recognized for its school-wide achievement in energy conservation, waste minimization, ecological literacy and school ground greening.

The scientific name Yersinella comes from the name of the entomologist who has described the species in 1860. Distribution This quite common cricket is mainly present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, France, Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland.Fauna EuropaeaHochkirch, A., Massa, B., Monnerat, C., Skejo, J. Skejo, Gomboc, S., Willemse, L.P.M., Rutschmann, F., Chobanov, D.P., Kleukers, R., Kristin, A., Presa, J.J. & Szovenyi, G. 2016 The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Habitat These \\"katydids crickets\\" mainly inhabit forest edges, open forests and Mediterranean shrubland, at an elevation up to above sea level. They prefer shrubs and low herbaceous plants or soil, rather than in tall grasses. As a matter of fact they live in hilly and mountainous areas, in the margins of forests and woodlands, as well in open areas with plenty of vegetation. Description Female Yersinella raymondi is rather small species, the adults grow up to about long, while females reach a maximum of , including the relatively conspicuous, slightly and evenly bent upwards ovipositor (about ).Orthoptera The basic coloration of the body usually varies from gray to chestnut to reddish brown. The females are often brighter and less contrasted than the males. On the sides of the body runs a broad, longitudinal, dark gray or dark brown band, while the top of the body is light gray-colored or light brown, with two longitudinal brown lines. The compound eyes are dark brown. Antennae are longer than the body. The pronotum is flattened and extended to the rear and at the lower edge of its lateral margins there are whitish or yellowish bands. In the females the wings are reduced, protruding only just below the pronotum, where as in the male they are larger, but protrude beyond the neck shield at most by half its length. The abdomen is long and thick. The legs are brown, have darker areas on their knees and short thin spines on the lower parts of all pairs. The cerci of the males are slightly flattened and have no inner tooth. Because of their small size and the barely visible wings often Yersinella raymondi is wrongly confused with a nymph of other grasshoppers, as well with Rhacocleis germanica, but it can be easily distinguished by the mentioned flat ends of the cerci typical of males and by the clear stripe on its back, contrasting with the sides of the body. Biology Adults can be encountered from July through November. These crickets mainly feed on small invertebrates and on vegetable foods. Their nymphs are easily found in the litter. This species is a good index of the state of the forests, being quite sensitive to the environmental modifications.

Although he was British-born, his comedic style centred on his pseudo-European, Yiddish accent and in his straight-faced mispronunciation of words. Biography Bacon's father came from a leather-working family to London from Katowice, then in Galicia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In London, his father worked as a basket-weaver. Before becoming a character actor, Bacon was a drummer in Britain during the 1920s and 1930s. He was taught by the vocalist and drummer Harry Bentley. After a couple of years at the Florida Club with Ronnie Munro's band he began a long association with Ambrose's Orchestra, with whom he recorded as drummer and occasionally as Yiddish vocalist. In the late 1930s he had become well known enough to tour the halls in his own right and as part of a touring unit known as the Ambrose Octet with Evelyn Dall, among others. He lived in his later years at The White House, a hotel near Great Portland Street, London, now known as the Melia White House, in Albany Street. He never married.

History Movement Strategies Limited was formerly Evacuation Strategies Limited. Evacuation Strategies was founded in 2005 by Simon Ancliffe, its current Managing Director, after spinning it out from Crowd Dynamics Limited, where Simon was a Director. The original focus of the business was on helping businesses, events, and cities plan for evacuation or invacuation (internal shelter) in the event of an emergency, based on the insights developed by Simon Ancliffe while developing the mass evacuation plans for the Canary Wharf business district after 9/11 and other clients. However, the majority of its clients were derived from planning for major new infrastructure projects most notably design for all stations on the new Dubai Metro, and for the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park for the 2012 Games. This led to a change of emphasis and the company was rebranded Movement Strategies in 2008.

It was Peake, not Shelley, who wrote the famous line, \\"It lives!\\"http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Peake/pres13.html Early life Richard Brinsley Peake was born in Gerard Street in Soho, London, the son of Richard Peake, who for forty years worked in the Treasury Office of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London. He was named after the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was a friend of his father.John Russell Stephens, ‚ÄòPeake, Richard Brinsley (1792‚Äì1847)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 28 April 2011 From 1809 to 1817 Peake was an apprentice with the engraver James Heath. On leaving Heath's employ in 1817 Peake began to write for the theatre; his first play was The Bridge that Carries Us Safe Over, produced at the English Opera House in 1817, and which was quickly followed by a farce, Wanted, a Governess. Writing career For the next forty years Peake wrote burlesques, farces, comedies, melodramatic and musical romances, and an \\"operatic romance\\". His play The Meltonians was described as \\"a perfectly illegitimate drama and extravaganza.\\" His 1823 play Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein, was seen by Mary Shelley and her father William Godwin on 29 August 1823 at the English Opera House, shortly after her return to England. Shelley approved of the way the Creature, played by T.P. Cooke, was represented by a series of dashes in the advertising.Playbill for Presumption: or, The Fate of Frankenstein - Bodleian Library, Oxford To capitalise on the success of the play, Godwin arranged for his daughter's novel Frankenstein to be reprinted in two volumes with emendations by himself.Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Frankenstein Bedford Publishing (2000) pg 3 Google Books In the play the character 'Fritz' was originated by Robert Keeley. In about 1825 Peake married Susannah Snell, and they had at least six children together.'Richard Brinsley Peake' on the University of Maryland website Later years From November 1839 and into the 1840s Peake wrote numerous articles for the periodicals; with a few exceptions all of his articles were published in Bentley's Miscellany. Peake wrote the accompanying text for the picture-book French Characteristic Costumes (1816); a comedic book of Cockney sports entitled Snobson's 'Seasons' (1838); Cartouche, the Celebrated French Robber (1844) in three-volumes; and a two- volume biography of a theatrical family, Memoirs of the Colman Family (1841). His comedy The Title Deeds, produced in June 1847 at the Adelphi Theatre, was probably his last play. From 1832 until his death Peake was the Treasurer at the Lyceum Theatre in London.

History The Academia was first founded in 2003 and ran through to 2006. In July 2008 it was reopened and continues to function today. Since 2009 the Academia has been part of CHOI (Chimbote Opportunities Limited) and works alongside the Rotary Club's student grant program \\"Dolares para Escolares\\" (Grants for Students). Like other similar institutes, the Academia is attended by students who have completed secondary school and wish to go on to further or higher education. Since secondary school students in Peru do not take standardised national examinations, students are required to take a very difficult entrance exam for universities, colleges and technical institutes. Pre University Academies prepare young people for these exams and for student life in general. The \\"Perpetuo Socorro\\" Academia differs from other similar institutes in that it is a non-profit organisation created to help a specific group of underprivileged young people. The Academia is located in an area where people live in extreme poverty. It gives young people from the locality the opportunity to study. Without the support and low-cost or free classes provided by Academia, these young people could not continue their education. Since 2003, students from the Academia have successfully gone on to study in national and private universities, and further education or technical institutes. Since 2009, the Academia has worked alongside the Rotary Club's \\"Dolares para Escolares\\" (Grants for Students) program. This gives students at the Academia the further benefit of applying for continued economic and personal support throughout their time at university or at technical institutes. Students receive help with matriculation fees, tuition fees, charges for study materials and books, travel expenses and receive continued emotional and personal support throughout their education. Subjects Students at the Academia study and review a range of subjects to help them with entrance exams: \\\\- Mathematical Reasoning \\\\- Spanish Language and Textual Analysis \\\\- Algebra \\\\- Arithmetic \\\\- Spanish Language and Literature \\\\- Biology and Anatomy \\\\- History \\\\- Geography \\\\- Chemistry \\\\- Psychology \\\\- Philosophy \\\\- Economics \\\\- English as a Foreign Language  References  External links  * https://web.archive.org/web/20110813131233/http://chimbote.olx.com.pe/academia- preuniversitaria-perpetuo-socorro-chimbote-la-victoria-antenor-orrego- iid-17338185 * http://www.facebook.com/pages/Preuniversity-Academy-Perpetuo- Socorro/190371407641430 * http://choichimbote.blogspot.com/ * http://choichimbote.blogspot.com/2011/04/trying-to-break-cycle.html Category:University-preparatory schools Category:Catholic schools in Peru Category:Educational institutions established in 2003 ","title":"Academia Preuniversitaria &quot;Perpetuo Socorro&quot;"},{"id":"31618682","text":"Jos√© Mar√≠a Izuzquiza Herranz (November 22, 1925 - April 26, 2011) was the Roman Catholic bishop of the Apostolic Vicariate of Ja√©n en Peru, Peru.

It provided cable infrastructure in the UK as part of the Cambridge Digital Interactive Television Trial (Cambridge iTV trial/Cambridge Cable Project).  History  Cambridge Cable Limited was founded in 1988, by three Cambridge businessmen, as a cable television and communications company. In June 1989 the company was awarded the cable television franchise for the city of Cambridge and the surrounding area, and in July 1990 was granted licence by the DTI to operate a public telecommunications service and distribute television channels via its underground cable network. Cambridge Cable's inaugural service commenced in July 1991 with a cable television service; the company's public telephone service launched in September 1992. The company gained financial and operational backing from Comcast Corporation, a major cable television network operator in the United States, and Singapore Telecom, the public telecommunications operator in Singapore; by 1996 was fully owned by Comcast. The company, with its backing from Comcast, purchased Stort Valley Cable Limited and was awarded the franchise for Harlow, Bishop's Stortford and Sawbridgeworth in November 1992; services were provided under the name of Anglia Cable Communications. Late 1993 saw services started in the company's East Coast Cable franchise with subscribers in Colchester added first; network build throughout Colchester, then Ipswich and, later, Felixstowe followed. Franchise map (dated 1997) On June 2, 1999, the Cambridge Cable Group, as it by then had become known, became part of NTL's growing portfolio, having operated franchises under the names Cambridge Cable, Anglia Cable, East Coast Cable and Southern East Anglia Cable. The company and its network is now part of Virgin Media.

History The Manchester Bridge became Pittsburgh's second bridge to span from the Point to the North Side. Its predecessor, the wooden covered Union Bridge,http://pghbridges.com/pittsburghW/0584-4477/union.htm opened in 1874 and was demolished in 1907 after suffering extensive damage from a major flood that same year.http://www.brooklineconnection.com/history/Facts/UnionBridge.html The new bridge was constructed from 1911‚Äì1915. and was opened by Mayor Joseph G. Armstrong on August 8, 1915. It carried motorists across the Allegheny River for the next 54 years. The bridge closed on October 17, 1969 when its successor, the Fort Duquesne Bridge (located closer to the Roberto Clemente Bridge) opened that same day as part of the city's Renaissance I redevelopment project. Efforts were made to save the old Manchester Bridge, but it was determined that it had to be removed (along with the adjoining Point Bridge, defunct since 1959 after the opening of the Fort Pitt Bridge) to complete the construction of the new Point State Park. Explosives were used to drop the south span into the Allegheny River at 18:42 on September 29, 1970. The original attempt 11 hours earlier had been unsuccessful when five of the eight charges failed to detonate. Demolition was subcontracted to Controlled Demolition by Dravo Corporation and was overseen by John. D Loizeaux. Less than a month later on October 28, the north span was brought down the same way, this time with no problems. Sculptor Charles Keck designed four figures for the bridge, representing the historical figures of Native American Guyasuta and pioneer Christopher Gist, and the legendary ironworker Joe Magarac and coal miner Jan Volkanik. These reliefs were removed in 1970 and for a time were displayed on the grounds of the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. The reliefs were moved to a display on Pittsburgh's North Shore in July 2016 and are now placed in a location near to their original site.

The company was founded in 1990 by Alistair McAuley and Paul Simmons, who met while studying at the Glasgow School of Art. Winners of the Walpole Award for 'Best Emerging British Luxury Brand' in 2007 and 'British Luxury Design Talent' in 2010, the company now has two branded showrooms in London and Glasgow, and export their luxury products and design talent worldwide. Company profile Timorous Beasties' work embodies a unique diversity of pattern, ranging from design that echoes a golden age of copperplate engraving (a time-honoured classic the Thistle range; or Merian Palm Superwide Wallpaper) two examples of a distinctly edgy nature. Yet, the studio fully engages a design discourse with textile history by lending an aesthetic evolution to time-honoured motifs. In 2004 Timorous Beasties unveiled their critically acclaimed Glasgow Toile: by reversing the pastoral context of Toile de Jouy, they transformed the traditional toile device to create an exclusively modern urban genre. The Hotch Blotch fabric series challenges a 1000-year old aesthetic mode by placing disorder within the structure of damask pattern to reveal the inherent beauty of splatters, drips and blotches. Hunting Toile and Urban wallpapers mark a synthesis of 18th-century chinoiserie groupings, Rococo swirls, and Victorian silhouette paper cuts to create a uniquely contemporary ornamental textiles pattern repeat. As well as their own product range, Timorous Beasties have worked on a number of commissions and collaborations with high-profile clients such as Nike, Famous Grouse, Ercol, Brintons Carpets and Penguin Books, across a diverse range of applications including print, packaging, furnishing, interiors and exteriors. Some of their more recent projects include: * Fortnum & Mason (November 2014) - Working in collaboration with brand design agency Design Bridge, Timorous Beasties created a range of confectionary box designs for the luxury department store Fortnum & Mason. * Netjets (June 2015) - Timorous Beasties were commissioned to create a tail-wrap for Netjets' signature series, the Challenger 350 jet, making its debut at ArtBasel, Switzerland. * Kate Bush (July 2015) - Timorous Beasties were invited to produce the artwork used on the programme and tickets for Kate Bush's first live shows in several decades: a 22-night residency at Hammersmith Apollo entitled 'Before the Dawn'. * Penguin Books (May 2016) ‚Äì Timorous Beasties partnered with Vintage Classics to produce a collection of reissues inspired by nature.

August 1418) was the eldest son of Edward de Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon (d. 5 December 1419). He fought at Agincourt, and was killed in a sea battle in Henry V's continuing campaigns in Normandy. Family Born about 1385,Cokayne dates his birth to 1388. Sir Edward Courtenay was the eldest son and heir of Edward Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon (d. 5 December 1419), and Maud Camoys, the daughter of Sir John de CamoysCokayne misidentifies her as the daughter of Thomas, Lord Camoys. of Gressenhall, Norfolk by his second wife, Elizabeth le Latimer, the daughter of William le Latimer, 3rd Lord Latimer.. Courtenay had two younger brothers, Hugh Courtenay, 12th Earl of Devon, and James Courtenay, and a sister, Elizabeth Courtenay, who had issue by her first marriage to John Harington, 4th Baron Harington (d. 11 February 1418), and no issue by her second marriage to William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville (d. 18 February 1461).; . Before 20 November 1409 Courtenay married Eleanor Mortimer, daughter of Roger de Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, and Eleanor Holland.. Courtenay's sister-in-law, Anne Mortimer, was born at New Forest, Westmeath, one of the Mortimer estates in Ireland,. and it is likely Eleanor Mortimer was born there as well. Besides her sister, Anne, Eleanor Mortimer had two brothers, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, and Roger (born 23 April 1393, died c.1413).; ; . Eleanor Mortimer's mother was the daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, and Alice Arundel, the daughter of Richard de Arundel, 10th Earl of Arundel, and his second wife, Eleanor, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, grandson of King Henry III.; . Eleanor Mortimer was thus a descendant of Henry III through her mother, and more importantly, a descendant of King Edward III through her grandparents, Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, and Philippa Plantagenet, daughter of King Edward III's second surviving son, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence.; Because King Richard II had no issue, Eleanor's father, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, was heir presumptive during his lifetime, and at his death in Ireland on 20 July 1398 his claim to the crown passed to his eldest son, Edmund. On 30 September 1399, the fortunes of Eleanor Mortimer and her brothers and sister changed entirely. Richard II was deposed by the Lancastrians led by Henry Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV and had his own son, the future King Henry V, recognized as heir apparent at his first Parliament. Eleanor's brothers, Edmund and Roger, were kept in custody by the new King at Windsor and Berkhampstead castles, but were treated honourably, and for part of the time brought up with the King's own children, John and Philippa.; . According to Griffiths, Eleanor and her sister, Anne, who were in the care of their mother until her death in 1405, were not well treated by Henry IV, and were described as 'destitute' after her death.. Career Although his family had risen to the heights of power as advisers to King Richard II, after Richard's deposition in 1399 Courtenay threw in his lot with the new King, Henry IV, and was knighted on 13 October 1399 at the King's coronation in Westminster Abbey. However his future with the new Lancastrian monarchy was rendered uncertain because of his affinity with the Mortimers. At Henry IV's death Courtenay was appointed Warden of the King's Forests in Devon and Cornwall,. and was summoned by the new King, Henry V, to attend Parliament. In 1415 he was required to answer charges that he was in league with his brother-in-law, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, in the Southampton Plot to assassinate Henry V as the army awaited embarkation for the invasion of France at Southampton. Implicated by kinship, Courtenay came clean and pledged allegiance by joining the army. He was appointed to the commission which tried the conspirators and condemned them to death. Henry V's campaign in France began with sea battles along the Normandy coast, and Courtenay attacked the entrance to the Seine. Joining the King for the march eastwards across northern France, he fought in the King's guard at Agincourt. He was appointed Keeper of the New Forest. on 20 November 1415. Henry V's continuing campaigns in France required reliable sea captains, and Courtenay was appointed Admiral of the Fleet. briefly from May to August 1418. He was killed during a particularly vicious sea fight. Courtenay died in August 1418 or shortly thereafter. He left no issue.

Anarchist historian Peter Marshall claims, \\"there is a close link between the existentialists' stress on the individual, free choice, and moral responsibility and the main tenets of anarchism\\".Marshall, Peter. Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. pg.580 Background=Max Stirner Anarchism had a proto-existentialist view mainly in the writings of German individualist anarchist Max Stirner. In his book The Ego and Its Own (1845), Stirner advocates concrete individual existence, or egoism, against most commonly accepted social institutions‚Äîincluding the state, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society‚Äîwhich he considers mere phantasms or essences in the mind. Existentialism, according to Herbert Read, \\"is eliminating all systems of idealism, all theories of life or being that subordinate man to an idea, to an abstraction of some sort. It is also eliminating all systems of materialism that subordinate man to the operation of physical and economic laws. It is saying that man is the reality‚Äînot even man in the abstract, but the human person, you and I; and that everything else‚Äîfreedom, love, reason, God‚Äîis a contingency depending on the will of the individual. In this respect, existentialism has much in common with Max Stirner's egoism.\\"Read, Herbert. Existentialism, Marxism, and Anarchism. London: Freedom Press, 1952. Friedrich Nietzsche Friedrich Nietzsche is one of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though the movement did not exist until after his death, which is when his works became better known. While he was alive, however, Nietzsche was frequently associated with anarchist movements and proved influential for many anarchist thinkers, in spite of the fact that, in his writings, he seems to hold a negative view of anarchists.In Beyond Good and Evil (6.2:126) he refers to \\"anarchist dogs\\" This was the result of a popular association during this period between his ideas and those of Max Stirner. (See: Relationship between Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner.) As such, Nietzsche's √úbermensch was representative of the freedom for people to define the nature of their own existence, as well as the desire for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave. Nietzsche's idealized individual invents his or her own values and creates the very terms under which they excel, taking no regard for God, the state, or the social behavior of 'herds'. It was these things that drew Nietzsche to anarchists and existentialists alike, showing the clear commonality between both. Other forerunners Some point to Mikhail Bakunin as possibly following a \\"philosophy of existence\\" against \\"the philosophy of essence\\" as advocated by Hegel, a figure whom many anarchists, in contrast to Marxists, have found authoritarianRocker, Rudolf. Nationalism and Culture. p.191-199See Widukind De Ridder's \\"Max Stirner, Hegel and the Young Hegelians: A reassessment\\" (History of European Ideas, 2008, 285-297), which argues that Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own is a fiercely ironic criticism and parody of Hegel, the Young Hegelians, and Hegelianism as a system of thought. or even totalitarian.Noam Chomsky has referred to the \\"more or less Hegelian roots\\" of fascism and Bolshevism in many interviews. See Class Warfare. Pluto Press, 1996. p. 23. \\"Every individual,\\" Bakunin writes, \\"inherits at birth, in different degrees, not ideas and innate sentiments, as the idealists claim, but only the capacity to feel, to will, to think, and to speak,\\" a set of \\"rudimentary faculties without any content\\" which are filled through concrete experience.Bakunin, Mikhail. Man, Society, and Freedom, 1871. Foundational existentialist thinkers such as S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche also voiced their opposition to Hegel for denying the role of the free individual, glorifying State and Church, and claiming \\"absolute knowledge\\" about human beings. While influenced by Hegel early in his life, Bakunin later was stridently opposed to Hegel around the time he became an anarchist, and would refuse to say he was ever influenced by him.Leier, Mark. Bakunin: The Creative Passion. New York: Seven Stories Press, 2006. p.83, The transcendentalists, particularly Henry David Thoreau, were influential to anarchism and existentialism.Henry Thoreau Once More, SE Hyman. Early and middle 20th century=Kafka and Buber In the first and middle decades of the 20th century, a number of philosophers and literary writers had explored existentialist themes. Before the Second World War, when existentialism was not yet in name, Franz Kafka and Martin Buber were among these thinkers who were also anarchists. Both are today sometimes seen as Jewish existentialists as well as Jewish anarchists. It is agreed that Kafka's work cannot be reduced to either a philosophical or political theory, but this has not necessarily been an obstacle to making links from existentialism and anarchism to his principal writings. As far as politics, Kafka attended meetings of the Klub Mlad√Ωch, a Czech anarchist, anti- militarist, and anti-clerical organization, and in one diary entry, Kafka referenced influential anarchist philosopher Peter Kropotkin: \\"Don't forget Kropotkin!\\"The Cambridge Companion to Kafka - Google Books. One could humorously note that this is a existentialist anarchist statement, since no one has been able to make a \\"true\\" meaning of what Kafka was talking about, to know whether it may be an \\"intellectual or emotional commitment, a special indebtedness, or simply a note on an overdue library book.\\" In his works, Kafka famously wrote about surreal and alienated characters who struggle with hopelessness and absurdity, themes which were important to existentialism, yet simultaneously presented critiques of the authoritarian family (in The Metamorphosis) and bureaucracy (in such works as The Trial) as well, about which he had strong views as institutions. He spoke, for instance, of family life as a battleground: \\"I have always looked upon my parents as persecutors,\\" he wrote in a letter, and that \\"All parents want to do is drag one down to them, back to the old days from which one longs to free oneself and escape.\\"Franz Kafka: The Metamorphosis and Other Stories. Translated by Joyce. Crick, with an Introduction and Notes by Ritchie Robertson. p. xxii. In this regard, he was speaking from experience, but he was also influenced by his friend Otto Gross, an Austrian anarchist and psychoanalyst. Otto Gross himself blended Nietzsche and Stirner with Sigmund Freud in developing his own libertarian form of psychology, feeling that they revealed the human potential frustrated by the authoritarian family: \\"Only now can we realize that the source of authority lies in the family, that the combination of sexuality and authority, shown in the family by the rights still assigned to the father, puts all individuality in fetters.\\"Otto Gross, 'Zur √úberwindung der kulturellen Krise', Die Aktion, 2 Apr. 1913, pp. 385-7 (p.386). Agreeing with Gross and holding fundamental anarchist views, Kafka would also define capitalism as a bureaucracy, \\"a system of relations of dependence\\" where \\"everything is arranged hierarchically and everything is in chains\\", and that in the end \\"the chains of tortured humanity are made of the official papers of ministries\\". Martin Buber is best known for his philosophy of dialogue, a form of religious existentialism centered on the distinction between the I-Thou relationship and the I-It relationship. In his essay Ich und Du published in 1923, he writes how we cannot relate to other people through the \\"I\\" towards an \\"It\\", towards an object that is separate in itself. Instead, he believes human beings should find meaningfulness in human relationships, through \\"I\\" towards \\"Thou\\", towards people as ends-in-themselves which brings us ultimately towards God. This perspective could be seen as anarchist in that it implicitly critiques notions of \\"progress\\" fundamental to authoritarian ideologies which abstract from the personal here-and-now meeting of human beings. Later Martin Buber published a work, Paths in Utopia (1952), in which he explicitly detailed his anarchist views with his theory of the \\"dialogical community\\" founded upon interpersonal \\"dialogical relationships\\". Post-war period Following the Second World War, existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, and at this time undoubtedly influenced many anarchists.Marshall, Peter. Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. pg.579 This was done mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, who wrote best-selling novels, plays, and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts. An influential exponent of atheist existentialism, Sartre throughout his works stressed the expansion of individual freedom in a world without God or a fixed human nature. Just as anarchists have always stressed that deterministic blue-prints for ourselves or the future will never lead to freedom, Sartre believed human beings could choose for themselves their own freedom, a \\"being-for-itself\\" that is not enchained by the social, political, and economic roles imposed on them. This freedom may not always be completely joyous, as \\"man is condemned to be free\\" for Sartre. Anarchists argue likewise that an anarchist society would be desirable, but never inevitable and given to us, and thus we are left with what is the harder demand and responsibility for ourselves alone to create such a society. It was for a brief period between 1939 and 1940 that Sartre was an anarcho-pacifist.Taylor, John, \\"Abandoning Pacifism: The Case of Sartre\\", Journal of European Studies, Vol. 89, 1993 Although best known for his Marxist politics and for aligning with the French Communist Party and the Maoists during 1968, Sartre said after the May rebellion, \\"If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist.\\" Towards the end of his life, Sartre explicitly embraced anarchism.See previous reference.\\"Interview with Jean-Paul Sartre\\" in The Philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre, ed.P.A. Schilpp, p.21. Albert Camus, theorist of absurdism Although rejecting the term \\"existentialism\\", Camus was a friend of Sartre's, and has been considered part of the existentialist movement. As another exponent of atheist existentialism, he concerned his works with facing what he called the absurd, and how we should act to rebel against absurdity by living, by opening up the road to freedom without a transcendent reality. Camus would also be associated with the French anarchist movement. The anarchist Andr√© Prudhommeaux first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the Cercle des √âtudiants Anarchistes (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathizer familiar with anarchist thought. He wrote for anarchist publications such as Le Libertaire, La r√©volution Proletarienne and Solidaridad Obrera (Worker Solidarity, the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist CNT National Confederation of Labor), and stood with the anarchists when they expressed support for the uprising of 1953 in East Germany. He also again allied with the anarchists in 1956, first in support of the workers' uprising in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, and then later in the year with the Hungarian Revolution. One of the most substantial expressions of both his existentialist and anarchist positions appears in his work The Rebel. For Camus, as for Nietzsche, rebellion should not delve into nihilism, and as for Stirner, should be distinct from revolution. It is not a lonely act, and does not destroy human solidarity but affirms the common nature of human beings. In the experience of the absurd, suffering is individual, but when it moves to rebellion, it is aware of being collective. The first step of the alienated individual, Camus argues, is to recognize that he or she shares such alienation with all human beings. Rebellion therefore takes the individual out of isolation: \\"I rebel, therefore we are.\\" At the end of his book, Camus celebrates the anti-authoritarian spirit in history and comes out in favor of anarcho-syndicalism as the only alternative: \\"Trade- unionism, like the commune, is the negation, to the benefit of reality, of abstract and bureaucratic centralism.\\"Camus, Albert. The Rebel. New York: Vintage, 1956. p.298. Compared by critics to Kafka and Camus, Stig Dagerman was the main representative of a group of Swedish writers called \\"Fyrtiotalisterna\\" (\\"the writers of the 1940s\\") who channeled existentialist feelings of fear, alienation, and meaninglessness common in the wake of the horrors of World War II and the looming Cold War.Articles He was also an active anarchist throughout his life, and joined the Syndicalist Youth Federation, the youth organization of a syndicalist union, in 1941. At nineteen, he became the editor of \\"Storm\\", the youth paper, and at age twenty- two, he was appointed the cultural editor of Arbetaren (\\"The Worker\\"), then a daily newspaper of the syndicalist movement. He called \\"Arbetaren\\" his \\"spiritual birthplace\\". Influence of existentialism Italian anarchist Pietro Ferrua became an admirer of Sartre during this period and considered existentialism the logical philosophy for anarchists and \\"had written some papers on that topic\\". Marie Louise Berneri wrote that \\"in France, Jean-Paul Sartre, Andr√© Breton, and Camus... have all fought the battle of the individual against the State\\".Berneri, Marie Louise. Journey Through Utopia. New York: Schocken Books, 1950. p.313. In his essay Existentialism, Marxism, and Anarchism (1949), English anarchist Herbert Read acknowledges the link between anarchism and existentialism. Read takes an interest in the writings of S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre, and juxtaposes existentialism with his own anarchism, considering both to be superior to Marxism. Read was one of the earliest writers outside of continental Europe to take notice of the movement, and was perhaps the closest England came to an existentialist theorist of the European tradition.See Michael Paraskos, The Elephant and the Beetles: the Aesthetic Theories of Herbert Read, PhD, University of Nottingham, 2005 He was also strongly influenced by Max Stirner, noting the closeness between Stirner's egoism and existentialism, and wrote an enthusiastic Preface to the 1953 English translation of Albert Camus's The Rebel. Contemporary era Although throughout the 1940s and 1950s existentialism was the dominant European intellectual movement, in the 1960s it was starting to lose its influence in the face of growing negative response. During the 1960s, there would be little or no existentialist movement to speak of, and what popularity it had would become far more overshadowed by structuralism, post-structuralism, and postmodernism, intellectual approaches which are today still widely used in academia. However, existentialism, particularly existential phenomenology, would still remain a significant influence on post-structuralism and postmodernism; one commentator has argued that post-structuralists might just as accurately be called \\"post-phenomenologists\\".Davis, Colin; \\"Levinas: An Introduction\\"; p8; 2006; Continuum, London. Like existentialism, these approaches reject essentialist or reductionist notions, and are critical of dominant Western philosophy and culture, rejecting previous systems of knowledge based on the human knower. Since the 1980s, therefore, a growing number of anarchist philosophies, represented by the term \\"post-anarchism\\", have used post- structuralist and postmodernist approaches. Saul Newman has utilized prominently Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche along with such thinkers as Jacques Lacan in his post-anarchist works. Newman criticizes classical anarchists for assuming an objective \\"human nature\\" and a natural order, which existentialism also objects to. He argues that from this approach, humans progress and are well-off by nature, with only the Establishment as a limitation that forces behavior otherwise. For Newman, this is a Manichaean worldview, which depicts only the reversal of Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan, in which the \\"good\\" state is subjugated by the \\"evil\\" people. Lewis Call and Michel Onfray have also attempted to develop post-anarchist theory through the work of Friedrich Nietzsche. In The Politics of Individualism (1993), anarcha- feminist L. Susan Brown explicitly argues for the continuing relevance of existentialism and its necessary complement to anarchism. She believes anarchism is a philosophy based on \\"existential individualism\\" that emphasizes the freedom of the individual, and defines \\"existential individualism\\" as the belief in freedom for freedom's sake, as opposed to \\"instrumental individualism\\", which more often exists in liberal works and is defined as freedom to satisfy individual interests without a meaningful belief in freedom. But she argues, like post-anarchists, that classical anarchist theory has asserted human beings as naturally cooperative, and that this fixed human nature presents many problems for anarchism as it contradicts its commitment to free will and the individual. For anarchism to be fundamentally individualist, she argues, it must look to existentialism for a more \\"fluid conceptualization of human nature\\".Brown, L. Susan. The Politics of Individualism. Montreal: Black Rose Books, 2002. p. 153. She looks to the works of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in particular and sees them as being compatible with anarchism. Brown argues that anarchism does not generally take into account feminist ideas of child-raising. For instance, the idea of raising children existentially free from their parents and educated non-hierarchically by a community, is not often considered by anarchists, and yet radical thinkers from the highly Nietzsche-influenced Otto Gross to existentialist psychiatrists such as R.D. Laing and post-structuralists Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari have argued forcefully that the nuclear family is one of the most oppressive, if not the most, institutions in Western society. Contemporary anarchist Simon Critchley sees the existential phenomenologist Emmanuel Levinas's self-defined \\"an-archic\\" ethics, the infinite ethical demand that is beyond measure and \\"an-archic\\" in the sense of having no hierarchical principle or rule to structure it, as important for actual contemporary anarchist social practice. His book Infinitely Demanding: Ethics of Commitment, Politics of Resistance propounds a Levinasian conception of anarchism and an attempt to practice it.Critchley, Simon.

Career B.1720 in Estorf, Freytag rose to prominence during the Seven Years' War, organising & commanding a corps of light infantry, the Freytag J√§gers.Miniature Wargames Issue 83 p.27 At the Battle of Bergen 17 April 1759 he commanding 9 companies of J√§gers & 2 squadrons of Prussian Hussars. Promoted Field Marshal in 1792, he was appointed to raise and command the 3,873 man Hanoverian electoral contingent to the Holy Roman Empire. This force was absorbed into the general army mobilization at the end of 1792. Freytag commanded the Hanoverian troops and the 13‚Äì15,000 man Austro- Hanoverian corps under the Duke of York in the Flanders Campaign in 1793, seeing action at R√ºme (St.Amand) 1 May, Famars 23rd, the siege of Valenciennes 13 June-28 July, and C√¶sar's Camp 7/8 August. In the Siege of Dunkirk he commanded the left wing covering column. On 6 September he was driven back by Houchard at the Battle of Hondschoote, where he was wounded and captured, but rescued the following day by Wallmoden‚Äôs counter-attack.Fortescue p.236 He resigned soon after due to poor relations with the Duke of YorkYork's correspondence, quoted in Burne p.76 & was replaced by Wallmoden. Freytag died on 2 January 1798 in Hanover. Assessment He knew the Duke of York from when the Prince studied in Hanover in the 1780s. Relations between the two were seriously strained right from the beginning of the campaign. At St. Amand 1 May York tried to locate him & Bussche to bring their troops forward, \\"but found neither at home, because they too had ridden out to reconnoitre, which annoyed the Duke very much, because he had expected to find them in their quarters. The Duke then went to R√ºme, but first ordered the Light Dragoons to advance. The Field Marshal, however, forbade their marching, and it was only after fresh orders that they set out, but arrived too late‚Ä¶ The Field Marshal declined to sit by the Duke at his table that day, and left before the joints were served\\".Sicart, quoted in Ompteda p.37-38 Fortescue claims that his 21-mile front in advance of Hondschoote was badly chosen, stamped him as a believer in the cordon system, and that a shorter front around the village would have been better.Fortescue p.228 But Burne persuasively challenges this by citing 5 reasons for the weakness of Hondschoote ‚Äì \\"it is difficult to see on what grounds Fortescue asserts that ‚Äòthe position at Hondschoote would have covered the besiegers quite as efficiently and with less risk‚Äô. In my opinion Freytag occupied the best possible position; his mistake was that he was forgetful of the principal of maintenance of the objective ‚Äì namely, to cover the besieging army ‚Äì till pulled up sharply and rightly by the Duke... The fact that even without the Duke's aid Freytag very nearly held up the French is a clear indication that with it the victory would almost certainly have gone to the Allies\\".Burne p.79 The Duke of York criticised his actions in the battle thus: \\"On the 6th of September, the day of the first attack upon the Field Marshal‚Äôs Corps, He never would believe that the Enemy had forced the post on His left and turned His left flank in spite of repeated reports that were sent to Him, nor was it till six in the evening, that he consented to retreat, which he did in two Columns. Instead however of sending the Artillery and baggage with General Count Walmoden's Column which was the furthest from the Enemy, He chose to take them in the rear of His own Column. I shall not touch upon the subject of His and my brother Adolphus‚Äôs being taken prisoners. I do not imagine there can be two opinions on the subject. I will only say that in consequence of this misfortune, everything would have been lost if it had not been for the presence of mind and coolness of Count Walmoden\\".York's correspondence, quoted in Burne p.76 References * Burne, Alfred, The Noble Duke of York: The Military Life of Frederick Duke of York and Albany, London: Staples Press (1949). * Coutanceau, Michel Henri Marie, La Campagne de 1794 a l'Arm√©e du Nord, (1903‚Äì08 5 Volumes) Paris: Chapelot . * Fortescue, Sir John, British Campaigns in Flanders 1690‚Äì1794 (extracts from Volume 4 of A History of the British Army), London: Macmillan (1918). * Ompteda, CF In the King's German Legion.

The leading disciple of Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin, the Yehudi preached an \\"elitist\\" approach to Hasidism, in which he parred traditional Talmudic learning with the highly spiritual Kavanah of Hasidism. He encouraged individuality of thought, which brought his movement into conflict with the Hasidic establishment. Nevertheless, several of his teachings would go on to influence large percentages of modern Hasidism. Following his death in 1813, he was succeeded by his main disciple Simcha Bunim of Peshischa, who is considered by some to be the father of modern Hasidism. Through his eldest son, Yerachmiel Rabinowicz of Peshischa, the Yehudi is the patriarch of the Biala Hasidic dynasty. Early life Jakub Izaak (Yaakov Yitzchak) Rabinowicz was born in 1766 in Przedb√≥rz, Poland. His father Asher Rabinowicz of Przedb√≥rz was a maggid and the Av Beit Din of Przedb√≥rz. His father was a descendant of Isaac HaLevi Segal, the brother of David HaLevi Segal and great-great-grandson of Naphtali Hirsch Treves who was a descendant of Rashi. In his early years, he studied under David Tevele of Lissa and Aryeh Leib Halperin whom he followed to Opat√≥w, where he was introduced to Hasidism by Moses Leib of Sasov. He spent several years teaching in the local yeshivot and married Braindel Koppel, the daughter of the wealthy innkeeper Jacob Koppel of Opat√≥w. Following this, he became a disciple of David of Lelov who convinced the Yehudi to travel to the Hasidic court of Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz (the Seer) in Lublin. During his time in Lublin, the Yehudi soon becoming the leading disciple of the Seer, who affectionally called him the \\"Yehudi\\" so that he would not be called by his rebbe's name. As the Seer became preoccupied with the responsibilities of mass movement he began directing newly-arrived young scholars visiting Lublin into the care of the Yehudi. However, over time, the Yehudi began to greatly resent the atmosphere in Lublin. In the court of the Seer, the rebbe served as the impetus of God and worked within a mystical and kabbalistic framework. The Yehudi began to detest the all-encompassing role in which the Seer played within his follower's lives, and so he founded his own religious movement based in Przysucha (Peshischa). Several of the Seer's most distinguished disciples followed the Yehudi to Przysucha, such as Simcha Bunim of Peshischa and Menahem Mendel of Kotsk, the respective 1st and *2nd Grand Rabbis of Peshischa. This break from the Seer was dramatically recounted in Martin Buber's \\"Gog Und Magog\\".  Rabbinic position  The Yehudi believed that an individual should always examine his intentions, and if they are corrupt he should cleanse them through a process of understanding. Once famously saying \\"God's seal is 'truth,' it can not be forged, since if it is forged it is true no more\\". It was this fundamental belief in individuality and autonomy of self which resulted in a continuous dispute between the Seer and the Yehudi. The Seer beloved that it was his duty to bring an end to the Napoleonic wars, by using Kabbalah, and asked the Yehudi to join this spiritual endeavour, the latter refused, believing that one finds redemption through a highly personal process of self-cleansing. The Yehudi believed that humility is the core virtue of a person who truly knows himself, recognizing his own imperfection. He also believed that one should not be influenced by the status quo as it can lead to un-pure motives. The Yehudi stated that \\"Each person should have two sides, after showing one to himself he will not be troubled by others and will be able to show the other to the rest of the world\\" In this, the Yehudi expresses the fundamental ideal of authenticity. Believing that if one has faults, they should be open about said faults instead of living in a place of shame. The Yehudi believed that the path to enlightenment required critical judgment of religious routine, stating that \\"all the rules that a person makes for himself to worship God are not rules, and this rule is not a rule either\\". The Yehudi removed himself from earthly desires, such as sex or eating, believing that it was his specific path to self-cleansing. This stood in staunch contrast with the materialistic nature of the Seer, who believed that self-cleansing was done through miracles tied to the rebbe. The Yehudi believed that the main role of the rebbe was to guide his disciples in their struggle for spiritual depth, and not to serve as a miracle-worker. This teaching appealed to the followers of Peshischa, who were an elite and highly educated group of young Hasidim who were willing to sacrifice their material well-being as well as their inner peace in the name of self-cleansing. The Yehudi believed that one of the main paths to self-cleansing was the parring of traditional Talmudic learning with the deeply spiritual Kavanah of Hasidism. Unlike his Hasidic contemporaries, the Yehudi believed that Learning Talmud became central to the worship of God stating that \\"learning Talmud and Tosafot purifies the mind and makes one ready for praying\\" Ultimately the Yehudi believed that critical search for truth was crucial to enlightenment, and that process of enlightenment could only be done by an individual rather than through a rebbe. After his death in 1813, the Yehudi was succeeded by his main disciple Simcha Bunim of Peshischa who brought the movement its highest point and kickstarted a counter-revolutionary movement that challenged the Hasidic norm.  Legacy  Grave of the Yehudi in Przysucha, Poland. During his life, the Yehudi wrote no works of his own, but many of his teachings were transmitted orally and published, much later on after his death.

The Word Nyokum has been derived from the combination of two words - Nyok means land (earth) and Kum means collectiveness or togetherness. Therefore, the Nyokum festival may very well be interpreted as inviting all the Gods and Goddesses of the universe, with the Nyokum Goddess as the principal deity, to a particular venue at a particular time. The festival is commonly celebrated by the people from all class and walk of life for better productivity, prosperity and happiness of all human beings. Significance The festival has a close link with cultivation. The Nyokum goddess, the goddess of prosperity is invoked for her blessings so that there may be more and more production of food-grains in the next harvesting season, that the visit of famine may be warded off, and that drought or flood may not hamper cultivation, nor should any insect or animal destroy plants and crops. The Goddess is invoked so that the human race may be strengthened and regenerated. All should be free from unnatural death due to accident, war and epidemic. A priest during Nyokum puja, Arunachal Pradesh Ui or Oram Nyoko is the place meant for the life after death. It is also believed that there are numerous deities and spirits on earth. These are the deities and spirits of mountains, rivers, forest, animals crops, household and so on and so forth. Some of the spirits are benevolent and others are malevolent. The Nyishi believe that human being's can live a life of peace and prosperity on this earth only when a perfect harmony is maintained between man, God and nature. They also believe that prosperity and happiness can come to a man when God and nature are pleased. Misery, hardship and natural calamities like famine, flood, drought, earthquake, epidemic, warfare, accidental death and such unwanted incidents occur due to the displeasure and wrath of the God and Goddess of nature. It is, therefore, the Nyishi worship to propitiate the benevolent Gods and Goddess to protect and bring prosperity to them and to ward off the malevolent spirits from disturbing the peace and tranquility in their life, Nyokum Yullow is one of such propitiation. Women dancing around the sacrificial altar at Nyokum puja Rituals The main prayer structure of the Nyishi is made of bamboo, called the yugang. Alongside the yugang sacrificial animals are tethered. Like cows, mithuns, and goats. Often one finds small chickens hung from bamboo poles of the yugang. The nyubh or the traditional priest specifies the number and kinds of animals for sacrifice, or any other offering to be made. There are no idols in this worship. Neither is there any permanent structure. Besides the animal sacrifice, beer made from millet seeds and rice paste is used. People turn up wearing their traditional clothes during this time. The men dress in a cotton eri robe draped from the shoulder and reaching the thighs. From their neck hangs a variety of bead jewellery necklaces. Often semi precious stones like turquoise adorn these necklaces. The men's attire is topped by a bamboo woven cap on the head. This cap is decorated with feathers or furs of wild animals. The beak of the hornbill is a favorite ornament for the traditional cap. The women also dress in their finery of par ej, earrings bead necklaces, topped with a headdress made of finely scaped bamboo. There is singing and dancing before the head priest or nyubh comes with his attendants to perform the main ritual. Guests are welcomed with rice paste powder, and opo or millet seed beer which is scooped in dried gourd ladles. The song and dance are performed in a group. Usually men and women hold hands in a circular form and sing and dance these lines Nyokum bo tapa debe. And sometimes men dance mock fights with dao (short sword) and shield made of animal hide.  Rikham Pada the Folk Dance of the Nyishi Tribe  Rikham Pada means giant, handsome, undefeatable and matured man Rinyam Yami means young and handsome looking boy Both Rikham Pada and Rinyam Yami were two brothers. They (Rikham Pada & Rinyam Yami) were attire with beautiful traditional dresses which adding up their handsomeness, the most beautiful girls of the universe were after them. So marriage proposals were impending like shooting star, flowing of pure and milky river water, Rikham Pada was man of principle, therefore he rejected them. So their imagination of marrying to Rikham pada was depicting in the form of song and dances. https://www.termpaperwarehouse.com/essay-on/Synopsis-Of-The-Rikham- Pada-The/77786 References Category:Festivals in Arunachal Pradesh ","title":"Nyokum"},{"id":"31619845","text":"Triisobutylaluminium (TiBA) is an organoaluminium compound with the formula Al(CH2CH(CH3)2)3. This colorless pyrophoric liquid is mainly used to make linear primary alcohols and Œ±-olefins.Michael J. Krause, Frank Orlandi, Alfred T. Saurage, Joseph R. Zietz Jr. \\"Aluminum Compounds, Organic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Structure Triisobutylaluminium was thought to be exclusively monomeric, however, it was discovered to exist in equilibrium with its dimer. To allow for the dimer to form, there is an appreciable increase in the length of the bonds between Al and the bridging alkyl ligand. There is also evidence of restricted rotation of the bridging isobutyl groups in the dimer. The equilibrium constant, KD, is 3.810 at 20 ¬∞C.Martin B. Smith, Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, The Monomer-Dimer Equilibria of Liquid Ammonium Alkyls II Triisobutylaluminum Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, Volume 22, Issue 2, April 1970, Pages 273-281. Synthesis Trialkylaluminium compounds are available industrially through the reactions of aluminium powder, hydrogen gas, and the desired alkenes. The synthesis of TiBA requires two steps; the first step produces diisobutylaluminium hydride by this route. :6 iBu3 \\\\+ 2 Al + 3 H2 ‚Üí 6 iBu2AlH In the second step isobutylene adds to the diisobutylaluminium to give TiBA. :6 iBu2AlH + 6 (C4H8) ‚Üí 6 iBu3Al Reactions Œ±-olefins are readily eliminated from Œ≤-branched trialkylaluminium compounds. Trialkylaluminium compounds are used in the industrial production of polymers. In the most common of these compounds, TIBA, a substantial level of Al ‚Äì H bonds are present at equilibrium. The greater stability of unbranched trialkylaluminium compounds relative to branched trialkylaluminium compounds in TIBA forms the basis for a general synthesis of triethyl- and higher linear trialkylaluminium materials from triisobutylaluminium. :(iC4H9)3Al + 3 RCH=CH2 ‚Üí (RCH2CH3)3Al + 3 iC4H8 Like most organoaluminium compounds, TiBA reacts violently with water and air and must be handled with care.

The critical question is how much, and what type of, capital a bank needs to hold so that it has adequate protection. In the simplest form, capital represents the portion of the bank's liabilities which does not have to be repaid and therefore is available as a buffer in case the value of the bank's assets decline. If banks always made profits, there would be no need for capital. Unfortunately, such an ideal world does not exist, so capital is necessary to act as a cushion when banks are impacted by large losses. In the event that the bank's asset value is lower than its total liabilities, the bank becomes insolvent and equity holders are likely to choose to default on the bank's obligations. Naturally, regulators would hold the view that banks should hold more capital, so as to ensure that insolvency risk and the consequent system disruptions are minimised. On the other hand, banks would wish to hold the minimum level of capital that supplies adequate protection, since capital is an expensive form of funding, and it also dilutes earnings. There are 3 views on what a bank's minimum capital requirement should be. Regulatory view Regulatory capital is the minimum capital requirement as demanded by the regulators; it is the amount a bank must hold in order to operate. A regulator's primary concern is that there is sufficient capital to buffer a bank against large losses so that deposits are not at risk, with the possibility of further disruption in the financial system being minimized. Regulatory capital could be seen as the minimum capital requirement in a ‚Äúliquidation / runoff‚Äù view, whereby, if a bank has to be liquidated, whether all liabilities can be paid off. Regulatory capital is a standardised calculation for all banks, although, there would be differences to various regulatory regimes. The process by which it is calculated is also transparent, this allows meaningful comparisons between banks under Pillar 3 disclosures. Economic view Economic capital is the theoretical view on minimum capital requirement based on the underlying risks of the bank's assets and operations. Economic capital could be seen as the minimum capital requirement in a ‚Äúgoing concern‚Äù view, whereby, a bank is in continual operation, and it is only concerned with holding enough capital to ensure its survival. Economic capital was originally developed by banks as a tool for capital allocation and performance assessment. For these purposes, it did not need to measure risk in an absolute, but only in the relative sense. Over time, with advances in risk quantification methodologies and the supporting technological infrastructure, the use of economic capital has extended to applications that require accuracy in the measurement of risk. This is evident in the ICAAP, whereby banks are required to quantify the absolute level of internal capital. Although, economic capital has evolved sufficiently to be used alongside regulatory initiatives, it should remain a hypothetical measurement, and be used primarily as a basis for risk adjusted performance measurement (RAPM/SVA) and risk-based pricing (RAROC). This is because if economic capital is used to set minimum capital requirement, banks will have a conflict of interest in producing low estimates to minimise its capital holding. And since economic capital modelling is an internal measurement, there is no standardisation across the banking industry, which in turn, makes regulation difficult. Rating agency view Rating agency capital is the minimum capital a bank needs to hold in order to meet a certain credit rating. The amount of capital and the type of capital (Tier 1 & 2) a bank holds in relation to its total risk weighted assets is a crucial input to the mechanism in which rating agencies use to assess a bank's capital adequacy and its subsequent credit rating. And since credit ratings provide important signals to the market on a bank's financial strength, they can have significant downstream impact on a bank's ability to raise funds, and also the cost at which the funds are raised. Therefore, having sufficient capital to meet rating agency requirement becomes an important consideration for senior management. Rating agency capital differs to regulatory and economic capital in that it seeks to neutralize the impacts of different regulatory regimes, Basel II options, and individual banks‚Äô risk assessments. That is, it aims to provide a globally comparable capital measure.

Both of these refer to networks connecting oscillators, where oscillators are nodes that emit a signal with somewhat regular (possibly variable) frequency, and are also capable of receiving a signal. Particularly interesting is the phase transition where the entire network (or a very large percentage) of oscillators begins pulsing at the same frequency, known as synchronization. The synchronization network then becomes the substrate through which synchronization of these oscillators travels. Since there is no central authority organizing nodes, this is a form of self organizing system.  Definition  Generally, oscillators can be biological, electronic, or physical. Some examples are fireflies, crickets, heart cells, lasers, microwave oscillators, and neurons. Further example can be found in many domains. In a particular system, oscillators may be identical or non- identical. That is, either the network is made up of homogeneous or heterogeneous nodes. Properties of oscillators include: frequency, phase and natural frequency. Network edges describe couplings between oscillators. Couplings may be physical attachment, or consist of some proximity measure through a medium such as air or space. Networks have several properties, including: number of nodes (oscillators), network topology, and coupling strength between oscillators.  Kuramoto Model  Kuramoto developed a major analytical framework for coupled dynamical systems, as follows: Steven H. Strogatz (March 2001). \\"Exploring complex networks\\". Nature 410 (6825).Y. Kuramoto AND I. Nishikawa, Statistical macrodynamics of large dynamical systems. Case of a phase transition in oscillator communities, J. Statist. Phys., 49 (1987)Mirollo, R. E., Steven H. Strogatz (December 1990). \\"Synchronization of pulse-coupled biological oscillators\\". SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 50Steven H. Strogatz (September 2000). \\"From Kuramoto to Crawford: exploring the onset of synchronization in populations of coupled oscillators\\". Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 143Strogatz, Steven (2003). Sync : the emerging science of spontaneous order. Hyperion. . OCLC 50511177 A network of oscillators with varied natural frequencies will be incoherent while the coupling strength is weak. Letting \\\\theta_i(t) be the phase of the ith oscillator and \\\\omega_i be its natural frequency, randomly selected from a Cauchy-Lorentz distribution as follows, g(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\pi[\\\\gamma^2 + (\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0)^2)}, having width \\\\gamma and central value \\\\omega_0 , we obtain a description of collective synchronization: \\\\frac{d\\\\theta_i}{dt} = \\\\omega_i + \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum^N_{j = 1} K_{ij} \\\\sin(\\\\theta_j - \\\\theta_i), i = 1, ..., N , where N is the number of nodes (oscillators), and K_{ij} is the coupling strength between nodes i and j. Kuramoto has also developed an \\"order parameter\\", which measures synchronization between nodes: r(t) = \\\\bigg \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum^N_{j = 1} e^{i\\\\theta_j(t)}\\\\bigg This leads to the asymptotic definition of K_c, the critical coupling strength, as N \\\\to \\\\infty and t \\\\to \\\\infty r = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & K < K_c \\\\ \\\\sqrt{1-(K_c/K)}, & K \\\\ge K_c \\\\end{cases} with K_c = 2 \\\\gamma. Note that r = 0 \\\\Rightarrow no synchronization, and r = e^{i\\\\theta}=1\\\\Rightarrow perfect synchronization. Beyond K_c, each oscillator will belong to one of two groups: * a group that is synchronized. * a group that will never synchronize, since their natural frequencies vary too greatly from the synchronization frequency.  Network Topology  Synchronization Networks may have many topologies. Topology may have a great deal of influence over the spread of dynamics.Nature, Vol. 393, No. 6684. (4 June 1998), pp. 440-442 Some major topologies are listed below: *Regular Network This describes networks where every node has the same number of links. Lattices, rings, and fully connected networks are some examples of this topology. *Random Graphs Developed by Erd≈ës and R√©nyi, these graphs are characterized by a constant probability of a link existing between any two nodes. *Small World Networks These networks are the result of rewiring a certain number of edges in regular lattice networks. The resulting networks have much smaller average path length than the original networks. *Scale-Free Networks Found ubiquitously in naturally occurring systems, scale free networks are characterized by a large number of high-degree nodes. In particular, the degree distribution follows a power-law. History Coupled oscillators have been studied for many years, at least since the Wilberforce pendulum in 1896. In particular, pulse coupled oscillators were pioneered by Peskin in 1975 with his study of cardiac cells.Peskin, C. S., Mathematical Aspects of Heart Physiology, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, 1975 Winfree developed a mean-field approach to synchronization in 1967, which was developed further in the Kuramoto model in the 1970s and 1980s to describe large systems of coupled oscillators.Winfree, A. T., Biological rhythms and the behavior of populations of coupled oscillators, J. Theoret. Biol., 16 (1967) Crawford brought the tools of manifold theory and bifurcation theory to bear on the stability of synchronization with his work in the mid-1990s.J.D. Crawford, J. Statist. Phys. 74 (1994) 1047. These works coincided with the development of a more general theory of coupled dynamical systems and popularization by Strogatz et al. in 1990, continuing through the early 2000s.

History In 1809, Henry Thompson constructed a wooden pavilion with a colonnade as part of the wider dvelopment of the \\"Montpellier Spa\\" on land previously known as Trafalgar Field. By 1817 it had been rebuilt in stone as the Montpellier Spa became increasingly popular. Thompson employed the architect George Allen Underwood, who completed the building with a statue of a crouching lion on the parapet. In 1826, Henry Thompson's son Pearson Thompson asked John Buonarotti Papworth to oversee the project and it was during this period that the dome was erected. The dome is inspired by Rome's Pantheon and has almost identical proportions. The building was used as a pumproom, with water from local wells, and ballroom with an additional billiard room and reading room. Concerts were held in the building including Jenny Lind in 1848 and the first performance of Scherzo by Gustav Holst in 1891. The Spa and surrounding gardens were purchased by the Cheltenham Borough Council in 1893. The building was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1955. During the 1960s the council and Lloyds Bank undertook restoration work. The Rotunda building when it housed a branch of Lloyds Bank Since 2017 it has housed a restaurant belonging to the Ivy Collection, a group of UK restaurants, who undertook restoration work. Architecture The building has limestone walls with a copper roof. The front of the building has a colonnade of doric columns, a frieze of alternating square and rectangular panels and a parapet. The central wooden dome in the assembly room is coffered internally and has light entering via the lantern in the centre. The room is high and across.

After changing their name to their current title in 1981, Twice a Man released their first album, Music for Girls, in 1982. The group have consistently used synthesizers and electronic effects to create their theatrical and atmospheric soundscapes, and from 1984 they began to work with samplers. The group has featured a variety of musicians in their line up, including long-time collaborator Jocke S√∂derqvist, who rejoined the group in 2013 for club and festival concerts based around some of their earlier works. They have also written music for theatre (including several works for the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm), television, film and radio. The group also composed the soundtrack to the PlayStation video game, Kula World. In the early 1990s, Twice a Man created a side-project entitled The Butterfly Effect, an experimental electronic project which installed writer Zac O' Yeah as lead vocalist, releasing the album Trip in 1991. They later continued as Twice a Man, but during the decade they decreased their production of studio albums and tours to concentrate on project-based work, often in collaboration with theatre, visual artists or companies. Recent works by Twice a Man include the album, Icicles, released in April 2010, as well as a 50 minute ambient CD, Costume Area, which was released to coincide with the opening of a Charles Koroly exhibition at the Dansmuseet museum in Stockholm, for which they provided music and sound design.

He played in the Football League for Newcastle United and Lincoln City in the Scottish Football League for Rangers, Greenock Morton and Queen of the South, and was player-manager of Scarborough. Early life Albert Franks was born in the mining village of Boldon Colliery, County Durham on 13 April 1936. His mother was a Methodist preacher. He represented the Durham county schools teams at football and cricket, and once scored a century in 25 minutes playing for Boldon Colliery in the Durham Coast Cricket League. He was a police cadet before becoming a professional footballer. Playing career Franks began his football career with Boldon Colliery Welfare, before signing for Newcastle United in December 1953. Although his Newcastle career was interrupted by his National Service, during which he captained the Royal Air Force football team, he went on to make 75 first team appearances and score 4 goals after making his debut against Luton Town in 1957. Having fallen out of favour once Charlie Mitten became Newcastle manager, Franks was sold to Rangers in March 1960 for ¬£6,500, where he was thought to be the first Englishman to join the Scottish club. Franks was named man of the match on his debut, in a 2‚Äì0 home defeat against Motherwell in April 1960, but made only two further first team appearances for Rangers. He joined Morton in September 1961 before another transfer, to Lincoln City, two months later. After a return to Scotland with Queen of the South in 1964, he ended his career as player-manager of Scarborough in the Midland League. After football Franks retired from football aged 29, after a proposed move to become player-manager of Bradford City fell through. He returned to his police career, joining the Durham Constabulary.

Concept Minthis is a resort development in Cyprus, situated within the wine-producing region of Paphos. The resort includes residences, villas and suites.  Climate  Located at 505 metres above sea level, the resort climate is strictly Mediterranean as opposed to the town of Paphos which is Subtropical Mediterranean.  Stavros Tis Minthis Monastery  ‚ÄúStavros tis Minthis‚Äù, a twelfth-century monastery, from which the resort derived its name, is located within the grounds and is soon to undergo extensive restoration. Inhabited by a single monk, the stone built monastery is an excellent example of architecture of the Byzantine era. The chapel got its name when invaders forcibly took the monastery and set it alight but one of the monks had the foresight to take the sacred cross and hide it under some mint bushes in the immediate vicinity thereby ensuring its safety. In the aftermath of the fight, the cross was found and the renaming of the remainder of the monastery and chapel was therefore under the name \\"Stavros Tis Minthis\\" which means \\"Cross of Mint\\". Stavros Tis Minthis monastery falls under the Metropolis Of Pafos which belongs to the Admin and Holy Synod which forms part of the Church of Cyprus.  Environmental issues  A man made reservoir to collect the naturally higher rainfall of the district has been operational within the resort since 2007. The reservoir can contain 130,000 cubic metres of water and a grey water collection system recently installed and feeding back into the reservoir means that no water goes to waste. Plans to enlarge the reservoir are already in the final stages. A programme to reinforce the local flora has been underway for 2 years by seed scattering and replanting of mature trees and shrubs.  Golf  The 18 hole championship golf course was originally designed by Donald Steel in 1994 and recently renovated by Mackenzie & Ebert. The new 13th hole has been transformed into a moat style island green. This signature hole is without bunkers or fairway, just 150 metres from the elevated white tee to the green. The course features two lakes and 35 bunkers. The golf course also includes a clubhouse which is due to open to the public in September 2011, an elevated 16 bay driving range, putting, chipping and pitching greens. Work has already begun on an extension to the golf course and a junior academy is planned.  European Walking Route E4  The European long-distance paths are found throughout Europe and the European Route E4 traverses through Europe encompassing Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Greece. The new section of the E4 which is located in Cyprus was inaugurated in 2005. It starts at Larnaca and passes through the Troodos mountain range, Paphos and the Akamas peninsula and is 539 km long. Nature trails have already been defined in Minthis Hills and will enhance the already popular European walking route E4 which runs through the heart of the resort.

Specifically, participants protest against explaining or excusing rape by referring to any aspect of a woman's appearance. The rallies began on April 3, 2011, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, after a Toronto Police officer suggested that \\"women should avoid dressing like sluts\\" as a precaution against sexual assault. Subsequent rallies have occurred globally. The protest takes the form of a march, mainly by young women, where some dress as \\"sluts\\" in revealing, sexy attire such as short skirts, stockings and scanty tops. In the various Slutwalks around the world, there are usually speaker meetings and workshops, live music, sign- making sessions, leafleting, open microphones, chanting, dances, martial arts, and receptions or after-parties with refreshments. In many of the rallies and online, women speak publicly for the first time about their identity as rape survivors. The movement's ideology has been questioned and its methodology criticized by some. Inception=Constable Michael Sanguinetti On January 24, 2011, Toronto Police Constable Michael Sanguinetti and another officer from 31 Division spoke on crime prevention, addressing the issue of campus rape at a York University safety forum at Osgoode Hall Law School. During the talk, Sanguinetti interrupted the more senior officer and said: \\"I've been told I'm not supposed to say this ‚Äì however, women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.\\" After an article that reported on the situation received international attention, Sanguinetti apologized for the remark saying: > I made a comment which was poorly thought out and did not reflect the > commitment of the Toronto Police Service to the victims of sexual assaults. > Violent crimes such as sexual assaults can have a traumatizing effect on > their victims... My comment was hurtful in this respect. I am embarrassed by > the comment I made and it shall not be repeated. The apology was attached to an email distributed to the Osgoode community by law school dean Lorne Sossin who said they've been told the officer \\"is being disciplined and will be provided with further professional training.\\" Co- founders Sonya Barnett and Heather Jarvis decided to redefine the word \\"slut\\" as someone who is in control of their own sexuality, to reclaim the word slut as a site of power for women. They observe that historically, \\"slut\\" has had negative connotations, and that their goal is to reclaim the term. Their website states: > We are tired of being oppressed by slut-shaming; of being judged by our > sexuality and feeling unsafe as a result. Being in charge of our sexual > lives should not mean that we are opening ourselves to an expectation of > violence, regardless if we participate in sex for pleasure or work. No one > should equate enjoying sex with attracting sexual assault. Barnett considered the apology was not enough, since the officer's stereotypical idea still exists in society. > The comment that was made by Officer Sanguinetti comes from a place where > sexual profiling and victim blaming is inherent and a large trait and we'd > like that changed,\\" Barnett said, \\"It isn't about just one idea or one > police officer who practices victim blaming, it's about changing the system > and doing something constructive with anger and frustration. Toronto Police spokeswoman Meaghan Gray said cautioning women on their state of dress is not part of any police training. \\"In fact, this is completely contradictory to what officers are taught,\\" she said. \\"They are taught that nothing a woman does contributes to a sexual assault.\\" Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair also spoke on the matter: \\"If that type of, frankly, archaic thinking still exists among any of my officers, it highlights for me the need to continue to train my officers and sensitize them to the reality of victimization.\\" Sanguinetti's statement, according to Blair, is meant to \\"place the blame upon victims, and that's not where the blame should ever be placed.\\" Rosemary Gartner, a University of Toronto criminologist, said linking style of dress to sexual assault is \\"ridiculous.\\" \\"If that were the case, there would be no rapes of women who wear veils and we know there are rapes in those countries,\\" she said. Darshika Selvasivam, vice-president of the York Federation of Students, said she found the use of the word \\"extremely alarming.\\" Linking provocative clothing to sexual assault \\"is a huge myth\\" and all it does is \\"blame the survivor of a sexual assault while taking the onus away from the perpetrator,\\" she said. A university spokesperson also said the school was \\"surprised and shocked\\" by the comment, although it does have a good and collaborative relationship with police. Justice Robert Dewar Slutwalk organizer Sonya Barnett named the case of Justice Robert Dewar as one of the main reasons to create the movement, and it became also the main cause of Slutwalk Winnipeg. On February 18, 2011 Justice Robert Dewar convicted Thompson resident Kenneth Rhodes, who worked for the city council, of sexual assault and sentenced him to two years house arrest. Dewar described Rhodes as a \\"clumsy Don Juan\\" who had the mistaken belief \\"sex was in the air\\" and a \\"heightened expectation\\" sex would occur. Dewar said the victim and a friend were dressed in tube tops and high heels when they met Rhodes and another man outside a bar \\"and made it publicly known that they wanted to party.\\" The court in Winnipeg, Manitoba, heard that the victim had willingly gone off with Rhodes and kissed him. But after she rebuffed his further advances three times, he raped her by the side of the road once they were alone. Rhodes admitted telling the woman 'it would only hurt for a little while' during the assault. He pleaded not guilty at his trial saying he thought the woman had consented to sex. Dewar rejected his defence but said aspects of it could be considered in sentencing. Prosecutors had asked for a three-year sentence, but Dewar gave Rhodes a conditional or suspended sentence, and ordered him to write a letter of apology to his victim. Politicians of all stripes joined student and feminist groups and those who work with sexual assault victims in decrying the comments. University of Winnipeg politics professor Shannon Sampert said this is the collateral damage that occurs when you have poorly trained judges in the system. \\"The victim in this case gets to relive her experiences once again in a new trial, hoping that this judge won't require gender sensitivity training,\\" said Sampert. She said surveys repeatedly show one of the primary reasons women do not report being raped is because of a fear of being victimized again by the justice system. On February 25, nearly 100 people gathered to call for Justice Robert Dewar's resignation. \\"These statements by Dewar are reinforcing the myth of implied consent and the myth that a victim of sexual assault is ultimately responsible for their own victimisation,\\" said Alanna Makinson of the Canadian Federation of Students, during the protest. Although this was not a part of Slutwalk, the launch of Slutwalk Toronto on April 3 gave the case national diffusion within Canada. On October 16, Slutwalk Winnipeg took place to reiterate the protest against the judge. On November 9, Justice Dewar formally apologized. According to the judicial council, Dewar said he wished to \\"express my unequivocal apology to the (victim) for the hurt she must have experienced from my comments. Some of the letters of complaint, from persons who have worked directly with past victims, have pointed out that some of my comments were also traumatic for them. I very much regret that as well.\\" Alberta Chief Justice Neil Wittmann, who reviewed the complaints against Dewar, said Dewar's comments \\"showed a clear lack of sensitivity towards victims of sexual assault\\" but do not merit his removal from the bench. According to the judicial council, Dewar has met with a \\"gender equality\\" expert and is \\"pursuing further professional development in this area as part of his commitment to become a better judge.\\" The Manitoba Court of Appeal later overturned Rhodes' conviction and ordered a new trial be set. The appeal court ruled Dewar did not properly assess the credibility of the accused and the alleged victim in reaching his verdict. Rhodes was sentenced to three years in prison in 2013. First march and consequent growth New York City SlutWalkers. Union Square, October 2011 The first Slutwalk was organized in Toronto, Ontario, on April 3, 2011. Although the organizers expected around 200 people to show up, over 3,000 gathered at Queen's Park. \\"We want Police Services to truly get behind the idea that victim-blaming, slut-shaming, and sexual profiling are never acceptable.[...] The idea that a slut is a lesser person and deserving of sexual assault isn't exclusive to the police. Media also has to get behind this idea.\\" Sonya Barnett explained. The day began with speeches before moving to the Toronto Police Headquarters. The invitation in Slutwalk Toronto website also warned: \\"Whether a fellow slut or simply an ally, you don't have to wear your sexual proclivities on your sleeve: we just ask that you come. Singles, couples, parents, sisters, brothers, children, friends.\\" Some women attended the protest wearing jeans and T-shirts, while others turned out in fishnets and stilettos. On May 25, 2012, a new Slutwalk was organized in Toronto. There were fewer participants than the previous occurrence, although the presence of men was more noticeable. Outfits ranged from sneakers and tank tops to bikinis to costumes. Some attendees went topless. A delegation from the Abbey of the Divine Wood, a Toronto mission of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, manifested in their nuns habits and carried signs including one which read: \\"Sisters Are Sluts 2\\". At Queen's Park, several speakers took the stage‚Äîa multi purpose truck‚Äîand delivered speeches, some of them spontaneous testimonies. A few paid tribute to the memory of Toronto sex workers' rights activist Wendy Babcock, who took part in the first Slutwalk and died on August 9, 2011, at the age of 32. There were also multiple shows of support for Cece McDonald, a Minneapolis transgender woman facing a 41-month prison sentence for stabbing and killing a man after being harassed and slashed across the face. \\"I love sluts\\" badge in Denver, July 2011 On April 4, 2011, a Slutwalk in Sackville, New Brunswick was organized through the Sociology Student Association of Mount Allison University, and was coordinated to follow exactly a day after Toronto's SlutWalk. According to Rebecca Cheff, one of the organizer of the SlutWalk, \\"the goal is to walk towards the police station and speak to [the police officers] about victim blaming and to raise awareness as they're the frontline worker in sexual assault scenarios.\\" \\"There is a big misconception that people that dress a certain way ask for sexual assault, and that needs to stop now,\\" said SlutWalk student organizer, Lauren Hutchison. The phrase \\"still not asking for it\\" has become a rally cry behind many of these protests and has also been posterized on the bodies of men and women at these walks worldwide. Dr. Vanessa Oliver, a professor of Sociology and faculty organizer of the SlutWalk, stated, \\"We have had enough of this slut shaming idea [...] owning our sexual selves should not mean that we are opening ourselves to an expectation of violence,\\" she said. \\"No one should equate enjoying sex with attracting sexual assault.\\" The protest contained a visible male presence. Two protesters dressed in morphsuits participating in the protest said, \\"As men we can also create awareness\\". According to SlutWalk London, the rallies aim to end a culture of fear and victimisation: > All over the world, women are constantly made to feel like victims, told > they should not look a certain way, should not go out at night, should not > go into certain areas, should not get drunk, should not wear high heels or > make-up, should not be alone with someone they don't know. Not only does > this divert attention away from the real cause of the crime ‚Äì the > perpetrator ‚Äì but it creates a culture where rape is OK, where it's allowed > to happen. Women mobilise for first British 'SlutWalk' rally Jessica Valenti said: \\"In just a few months, SlutWalks have become the most successful feminist action of the past 20 years. In a feminist movement that is often fighting simply to hold ground, SlutWalks stand out as a reminder of feminism's more grass-roots past and point to what the future could look like.\\" It has been compared to the 1970s movement Take Back the Night (also known as Reclaim the Night), which promoted marches to raise awareness and protest against violence against women; although some tension between the two movements has been noted. As with SlutWalk, it asserted women's right to be on the street at night without it being considered an invitation to rape. To a lesser extent, it has been compared to activist groups like FEMEN, the Ukrainian women's group, and Boobquake, an atheistic and feminist response to Iran's Hojatoleslam Kazem Seddiqi who blamed women who dress immodestly for causing earthquakes. Both integrate nudity and protest.  United States = Amber Rose SlutWalk Festival  Amber Rose Amber Rose is an American socialite famous for her outspokenness concerning feminism and her relationships with other celebrities, such as Kanye West. She notes on her website that she did not start the SlutWalk, though \\"she is bringing more awareness to this matter by educating the public.\\" The Amber Rose SlutWalk Festival is currently held in Pershing Square in Los Angeles. The SlutWalk holds many activities, including: \\"live DJs, sign making, educational booths, photo fun, free breast cancer exams, and HIV testing\\". It is open to volunteers; staff and attendees of the SlutWalk must be at least 18 years of age. The 2016 Amber Rose SlutWalk had sponsors including Subway, T-Mobile, and beats by dre; celebrity attendees included Matt McGorry, Nicki Minaj, and Blac Chyna.  SlutWalk NYC  A slut walk was held in NYC in 2011 that shut down Union Square. Other In 2017 the chairpersons of Chicago SlutWalk wrote, \\"We still stand behind Dyke March Chicago's decision to remove the Zionist contingent from their event, & we won't allow Zionist displays at ours\\", referring to a then-upcoming demonstration of the Chicago SlutWalk. The Chicago SlutWalk declared of the Star of David, \\"its connections to the oppression enacted by Israel is too strong for it to be neutral & IN CONTEXT [at the Dyke March Chicago event] it was used as a Zionist symbol.\\" In 2017 Slutwalk Detroit was held in Palmer Park by Metro-Detroit Political Action Network (MDPAN). The event was also named \\"The March for Consent\\" the event was held in Detroit's \\"Gayboorhood\\" due to the high violence rate against Transgender Women in the area. Key speakers included Transgender Chair for MDPAN Brianna Kingsley and Jennifer Kurland who ran for Michigan Governor 2018 as the Green Party candidate.  Australia  The first SlutWalk in Melbourne took place on May 28, 2011. An estimated 2500 people rallied in front of the Victorian State Library and marched through Melbourne defending how women, men, and children should dress without fear of being sexually assaulted. Protesters held signs that said, \\"Stop Policing Our Wardrobe and Start Policing Our Streets, Stop Victim Blaming, No Victim is To Blame, I Love Sluts, Sluts Pay Taxes and Stop Whorephobia\\", to name a few. Supporters of the SlutWalk dressed in drag, casual and sports attire, as well as other types of clothing celebrating who they are. The organizers advised to wear whatever they chose to convey one message: Who's a slut? We all are. Or none of us are. And who cares? It's a stupid, meaningless concept anyway. SlutWalk Melbourne was organized by Karen Pickering, Lauren Clair, Clementine Bastow, and Natasha Smith. Pickering hosts Cherchez La Femme, talk show of current affairs and pop culture with a feminist flair. Natasha Smith specializes in queer rights and mental health organizations. Clair is a retail sex toy and sexual health consultant. She has run fundraisers in Melbourne for women services. Bastow is a feminist author, music critic, and radio host. Before SlutWalk Melbourne, Clair had second thoughts on redefining the word slut. In an interview with Fairfax newspapers she said, \\"I've spent my entire life being judged for my appearance and sexuality. I'm sexual, I have sex, I enjoy sex. I'm not going to be ashamed.\\" Clair stated the most memorable chant recited by all genders during the protest was, \\"However we dress, wherever we go, yes means yes and no means no.\\" The event included five empowering speeches from five speakers: Dr Leslie Cannold, Monica Dux, Ursula Benstead, Elena Jeffreys and Cody Smith. Feminist writer Dr Cannold started her speech with the greeting, \\"Hey you sluts\\". Throughout her speech, Dr. Cannold described the origin and meaning of the word slut stemming from the Middle Ages and its effect in the twenty-first century. \\"The word slut actually dates back to the middle ages. Those who throw it at us are trying to take us back to the Middle Ages. A time where women were what men said they could be. A slut is used by some boys and some men and even some ecologist women to put women down. When those who use the word slut, what they mean is the same.\\" Cody Smith shared his rape encounter with a transgender man and the effect it had on him. \\"My rape was not my fault!\\" he choked back tears as he described his guilt. \\"I spent so many years blaming myself for my state of intoxication . . . for what I was wearing . . . for not being strong enough to keep the rapist off me.\\" Because of the positive outcome of SlutWalk Melbourne 2011, four SlutWalks in Melbourne have been taken place: SlutWalk Melbourne 2012, Slutfest 2013, SlutWalk Melbourne 2014, SlutTea 2015, and Slutfest 2016. Europe Slutwalk in Munich 2019  Iceland  The first Reykjav√≠k SlutWalk took place on July 23, 2011, only a few months after the very first SlutWalk, which took place in Toronto, Canada, April 3.https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/culture_and_living/2019/07/26/reykjavik_slutwalk_tomorrow/  Switzerland  The Swiss movement was created in August 2012, by women from Geneva and Lausanne. Since then, the collective organised four marches and other events. Swiss SlutWalk, 6 October 2012, 12 October 2013, 13 September 2014, 6 June 2015. The Swiss Slutwalk is an association by law since May 2014.  United Kingdom  Researchers Jessica Ringrose and Emma Renold interviewed members of a self-organized 'girl power' group in a school in Cardiff, Wales. The aims of the group of Year 8 (age 13) and above students had evolved to the delivery of personal social health and economic education (PHSE) lessons to younger students in the school. When asked about the 'SlutWalk', planned for Cardiff in a few weeks time, it led to \\"an uncomfortable silence, uneasy smiles and raised eyebrows from the two women teachers leading the group.\\" Ringrose and Renold concluded that there was a paradox between teachers that \\"were incredibly supportive of the general message of the SlutWalk,\\" but who \\"were simultaneously faced with the ongoing struggle of confronting the sexual regulation experienced by girls in a sanitised school space where 'slut' is a banished and punishable sexual swearword.\\" The teachers went on to say that the girls, \\"probably can't go, we'll go on the march for them\\". On the day of the march (4 June 2011), however, a number of the girls did turn up with their mothers and met up with their teachers. Pdf. Similar marches were also held around this time in a number of UK cities including London, Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne, Bristol and Oxford. As of 2018, SlutWalk Newcastle is the longest running UK satellite event. The first march was held on 4 June 2011, attended by approximately 200 people. After a five-year hiatus the next Newcastle SlutWalk took place on 28 July 2018. Latin America Slutwalks in Latin America were renamed \\"Marcha das Vadias\\" in Brazil and \\"La Marcha de las Putas\\" in most Spanish-speaking countries, sometimes using PUTAS as an acronym for \\"Por una transformaci√≥n Aut√©ntica y Social (For an Authentic Social Transformation)\\" Countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia were known to host simultaneous Slutwalks in different cities. In all countries, Slutwalks were repeated annually at least once, although not always in the same cities. Some protests selected their dates to match significant events such as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the World Youth Day. There were interactions noted between the organizers in different countries. Organizers from Argentina had previously contacted their counterparts in Mexico and Venezuela through social networks, and artist Adriana Minolitti participated in Mexican Slutwalks before becoming an organizer herself at Buenos Aires. They were, in turn, contacted by organizers in Bolivia and Uruguay to get assistance. Also, the organizer of the national Slutwalk at Colombia had some previous interaction with organizers in Peru, and Argentine activist Leonor Silvestri travelled to Chile to help organize La Marcha de las Maracas in Santiago. There was also an active participation of the LGBT community, and there was a common presence of sex workers, or expressions of solidarity with them. There was also a common regional chant: \\"¬°Alerta, alerta, alerta que camina la Marcha de las Putas por Am√©rica Latina!\\" (Alert! Alert! Alert, the sluts are walking down Latin America!). All protests shared the rejection of Sanguinetti's sayings, and some of them were also directed to local state authorities and Catholic church representatives whose public comments reinforced gender stereotypes and violence against women. Costumes representing Catholic characters were also found across different countries, and many protests demanded a secular State and pointed at the Catholic church as the reason for women's rights to be held back. There were some exceptions like Colombia, in which Catholics marched among people of all other religions, under the banner of La Marcha de las Putas, and the Marcha das Vadias against the public spending for the visit of Pope Francis in Copacabana, Brazil, featured dissident Catholic groups marching among the protesters. Some protests evolved into permanent organizations, which kept working throughout the whole year to fight violence against women, and participated or organized events other than the typical Slutwalks to raise awareness on sexual assault. Asia=South Korea The first Slutwalk campaign in Asia was held on July 16, 2011 in Seoul, Korea, under the name Japnyeonhaengjin(Ïû°ÎÖÑÌñâÏßÑ). It was planned to be held on the 9th of July, but due to another important event, Slutwalk Korea postponed the event until the next week. The date of the event is same in India, but because of the time difference, the first slutwalk in Asia was held in Seoul. Slutwalk Korea The second slutwalk in South Korea was held on July 28, 2012. India On July 16, 2011, about 50 people rallied for India's first Slutwalk in Bhopal, called Slutwalk arthaat Besharmi Morcha.Nambissan, Anjali.

Hindustan Times. Retrieved September 28, 2013. Rita Banerji, Indian feminist and author reports that SlutWalk was criticised as irrelevant in the face of female feticide, infanticide, dowry murders and honor killings. She argues: \\"The issue at the crux of the SlutWalk is one and the same as for all the other above mentioned afflictions. It is about the recognition of women as individuals with certain fundamental rights, including that of safety and personal choices, which no one, not even the family, can violate.\\"Banerji, Rita. (September 2, 2011). \\"Slutwalk To Femicide: Making The Connection\\". The WIP (Women's International Perspective). Retrieved September 28, 2013. On July 31, 2011, Besharmi Morcha took place at New Delhi, sometimes referred to as \\"The Rape Capital of India\\" for having the highest numbers of such crime. The estimated number of protesters was around 500. To ensure that no untoward incident took place, police personnel were deployed all around the area. \\"No one can ever be safe in Delhi. When we leave our homes, even we are not sure whether we will return safely or not,\\" said a police constable on the condition of anonymity. Actress and social activist Nafisa Ali was present. \\"Basically, we need to work towards the safety of women on streets. It's an issue of mindset. If a boy can go out at two in the morning, so can a girl,\\" she said. Trishala Singh, one of the organisers, said in reference to the number of participants: \\"I am not at all disappointed with the walk. A good number of people turned up to support the cause and I am happy with it. I know one walk can't change the mindset of people but it will at least be a beginning.\\" Another Slutwalk was held in Kolkata on May 24, 2012, gathering around 300 people. As described by the Times of India, young girls walked in all kinds of dresses right from sari and salwar kameez to jeans and skirts. \\"We want to bring forth the point that one can be sexually harassed even while being clothed from head to toe,\\" stated Film Studies student Sulakshana Biswas, one of the organizers. At the end of the rally, artists from Fourth Bell Theatre group performed short plays and recited poetries on sexual abuse written by famous Urdu poet Saadat Hassan Manto and Bengali writer Mahasweta Devi. A new Slutwalk took place at Kolkata on June 7, 2013. The walk started at Jadavpur University and continued until Triangular Park. Many participants had 'slut' painted on their bodies in bright colors. Sulakshana, Jadavpur University student and organizer over two consecutive years, said that she intended Slutwalks to be an annual affair in the city. Sayan, another of the organizers said, \\"We are under no political banner. This is a gender inclusion movement, catering to all.\\" Singapore Previous to the first Slutwalk, a public exchange between the organisers and the local authorities took place, regarding the particularly strict laws on streets demonstrations. Organizers stated there was no need for a permission to hold the protest, while the police sustained the global nature of the movement and expected presence of foreigners made it necessary. Finally, on November 30, a permit was approved for the Slutwalk to take place at a free-speech park called Speakers' Corner. Social critic and gay rights activist Alex Au commented on the issue: \\"maybe our senior civil servants can't get past the word 'slut' and have begun to hyperventilate\\". The Slutwalk finally took place on December 3, 2011. None of the mostly female crowd attended in revealing clothing, though some did wear skirts above the knee.Others wore T-shirts protesting against blaming rape victims on the grounds of their outfits or because they had been drunk or flirting. A new Slutwalk was held in Singapore on December 15, 2012.

Marsz Puszczalskich w obronie ofiar w Gda≈Ñsku Israel \\"87% of the victims of sexual assault in Israel knew their assailant. But it is our fault because we walk alone at night...\\" - 2012 Tel Aviv SlutWalk \\" 'Slut' is a shitty excuse for rape\\" - 2013 Tel Aviv SlutWalk When taking up the idea of SlutWalk in Israel, the Hebrew name adopted was \\"Tza'adat HaSharmutot\\" (◊¶◊¢◊ì◊™ ◊î◊©◊®◊û◊ï◊ò◊ï◊™), i.e. \\"SharmutaWalk\\". The word \\"sharmuta\\" (ÿπÿßŸáÿ±ÿ©), originally an Arabic word meaning \\"prostitute\\", has entered spoken Israeli Hebrew, carrying connotations similar to \\"slut\\" in English. In 2012 the Jerusalem-based Feminist activist Or Levy was the first to raise the idea of holding a SlutWalk in Israel. The first actual SlutWalk took place in Tel Aviv on March 22, attended by several hundred women and a few sympathizing men. The idea was then taken up by activists in other cities, including Jerusalem, Haifa and Beersheba. In 2013 events took place in the same four cities. The number of both women and men participants has increased greatly, apparently due to increased media coverage, as well as an Internet campaign which went viral via Facebook. The marches were not without obstacles: In Jerusalem, the police initially refused to give a permit for the march, providing it only after an intervention by Knesset Member Tamar Zandberg. The Tel Aviv march was organized by a new group of activists, initiated by Feminist activist Tzipi Eran. That year's march also involved a fierce dispute with the \\"Socialist Struggle\\" movement (Ma'avak Socilisti - ◊û◊ê◊ë◊ß ◊°◊ï◊¶◊ô◊ê◊ú◊ô◊°◊ò◊ô) which organised its own SlutWalk but objected to the term \\"sharmuta\\" on the grounds that it was an originally Arabic word, and thus using it could be considered offensive to women from a minority group. The rival march organizers, conversely, held that avoiding the term would be an act of \\"Slut-shaming\\" - precisely what the march was supposed to oppose - and they also objected to the Socialist Struggle march being led by men who spoke on behalf of women victims of sexual violence. Moreover, though originally an Arabic word, the term as presently used by Hebrew speakers in Israel carries a crude disparaging sexist implication of \\"blaming the victim\\" but no specific ethnic connotation. In the end, although two separate events were publicized on the Internet, in actuality they merged into a single march of over a thousand marchers, and the use of \\"sharmuta\\" no longer disputed. In 2014 the organizers of the marches in various cities united into an umbrella organizational frame. Although each of the cities had a separate organizing group that ran its march in its own way, the joint organization established a comprehensive branding for the march and held campaigns and advertising in collaboration, to consolidate messages and expand distribution. In 2015, a march took place in Jerusalem on May 29 with the participation of about 1,000 women and men, with a conspicuous involvement of teenage girls. A march in Tel Aviv took place on Friday, May 14. In 2016, a march took place in Tel Aviv on July 8 with some 500 participants. Among them was Inbal Bibi, a former X Factor Israel celebrity, who revealed that she had herself been raped in the past. In 2017, a march took place in Tel Aviv on May 12, with some 1500 participants. The march attracted high public attention when well known artists such as Gadi Wilczhersky and Statik promoted it on the social networks. Statik got some negative reactions from fans who objected to his using \\"dirty words\\". He then set to his hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram a detailed explanation of the idea behind the SlutWalk and the effort to confront and reverse the sexist connotations of \\"sharmuta\\". The Tel Aviv 2018 SlutWalk, held on May 4, had more than 2000 participants and got sympathetic coverage in the mainstream media. Taking up themes from the Me Too movement, signs were carried mentioning by name and photo various Israeli men in prominent public positions - including politicians, senior military and police officers, business people, artists and actors as well as rabbis - who were implicated in rape or sexual harassment cases. Responses=Risk management Australian commentator Andrew Bolt observed that guidance on how to dress in any given context is simply risk management, and such advice need not exclude opposition to victim-blaming. Rod Liddle agrees, saying \\"I have a perfect right to leave my windows open when I nip to the shops for some fags, without being burgled. It doesn't lessen the guilt of the burglar that I've left my window open, or even remotely suggest that I was deserving of being burgled. Just that it was more likely to happen.\\" Mike Strobel even suggests that the approach SlutWalk is advocating is dangerous, and he would not advise a daughter to dress \\"provocatively in iffy circumstances.\\" Lindsay Herriot, a women's studies scholar, disagreed with these arguments, stating that risk management can be seen as a direct case of victim-blaming and creates a problematic rhetoric in tackling the issue of sexual violence. As an example, she cited a 2010 Toronto news story covering a series of recent attempted and completed sexual assault cases against teenage girls walking home from school. In the news story, Pearl Rimer, a safety advocate with Boost Child Abuse Prevention, stated: \\"[children and young adults] should be aware of their surroundings while in public by limiting the use of cell phones and music players. Whenever possible, teenagers should walk with at least one friend.\\" Herriot criticized this advice as restricting young people's basic freedoms in public spaces, as opposed to taking an approach targeted at offenders.Herriot, Lindsay. (11/01/2015). SlutWalk: Contextualizing the movement. Women's studies international forum. (53). p.22 - 30. Approach SlutWalk has focused on being able to choose what to wear without being harassed, rather than the larger and broader discussion of consent concerning sexual assault. It has been accused of \\"[fixating] solely around liberal questions of individual choice ‚Äì the palatable 'I can wear what I want' feminism that is intentionally devoid of an analysis of power dynamics.\\" But Jessica Valenti says: \\"The idea that women's clothing has some bearing on whether they will be raped is a dangerous myth feminists have tried to debunk for decades. Despite all the activism and research, however, the cultural misconception prevails.\\" Some popular responses have also questioned the wisdom of using the word \\"slut\\". Sophie Jones wrote on The F-Word regarding this criticism: > This is a clear case of these writers simply misinterpreting the mission of > SlutWalk, which is not a protest for the right to be called 'slut' but a > protest for the right to dress however you want free of the presumption you > are \\"asking for it\\". I have been called a slut while wearing long sleeves > and thick black tights.[...]The assumption that rapists target women who > look sexually available drastically misreads the nature of the crime. I will > be marching in London not for the right to be called a slut, but for the > right to be there. Racial sensitivity In the United States, black feminists have accused the SlutWalk of being exclusionary to women of color. In an open letter to the SlutWalk organizers, the Black Women's Blueprint state that \\"As Black women and girls we find no space in SlutWalk, no space for participation and to unequivocally denounce rape and sexual assault as we have experienced it.\\" They assert that the term \\"slut\\" means something different when it is attached to a black body due to their history of slavery. They further state \\"For us the trivialization of rape and the absence of justice are viciously intertwined with narratives of sexual surveillance, legal access and availability to our personhood. It is tied to institutionalized ideology about our bodies as sexualized objects of property, as spectacles of sexuality and deviant sexual desire.\\" They also find the use of the word to be counterproductive to getting rid of the word \\"ho\\" which has been used to dehumanize them. In their closing remarks, they give the SlutWalk organizers a tip for organizing future movements. They state, \\"Women in the United States are racially and ethnically diverse. Every tactic to gain civil and human rights must not only consult and consider women of color, but it must equally center all our experiences and our communities in the construction, launching, delivery and sustainment of that movement.\\" There is a racial divide between white feminists and black feminists when it comes to the SlutWalk. In \\"An Open Letter from Black Women to SlutWalk Organizers,\\" disagreement was expressed over the somewhat controversial naming of the organisation: \\"Even if only in name, we cannot afford to label ourselves, to claim identity, to chant dehumanizing rhetoric against ourselves in any movement.\\" Furthermore, there was some controversy when a white woman who was participating in a SlutWalk in New York City held a sign that read, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World.\\" History has shown that people of African descent in the Americas have struggled with reclaiming their rights as human beings. Current events have shown that people of color continually struggle with overcoming the racial divide between white and black. Organizers of the Slutwalk have also seen that there is no equality in the movement in which white and black women can come together in solidarity to break down the societal, racial divide. In response to the white woman's sign, in an open apology letter, the organizers of SlutWalkNYC wrote, \\"We apologize that this space was not safer for black women, black people, and their allies.\\" Andrea Plaid, who writes for race blog 'Racialicious', too is skeptical, describing the SlutWalk as \\"...another word-reclamation project that seemed to recenter white cisgender women's sexual agency and bodies. (Sort of the way 'feminist issues' tends to reincarnate a little too often as 'white (cis) women's issues.')\\". Bogado critiques the movement for the \\"privileged position inherent in a political movement whose goal is focused on 'regaining' a trustworthy relationship with the police while immigrant women, black and brown women, poor women, and transgender women whether born in the U.S. or not, are presumed to be sex workers, targeted as 'sex offenders,' and are routinely abused by police with impunity, and their deaths ignored.\\" Bogado continues her critique and states that \\"Despite decades of work from women of color on the margins to assert an equitable space, SlutWalk has grown into an international movement that has effectively silenced the voices of women of color and re-centered the conversation to consist of a topic by, of, and for white women only.\\" Not all black feminist stand against slut walks though. In response to the Black Women's Blueprint letter, the Global Women's Strike retorted \\"Women of colour are among the most likely to be put down as \\"sluts\\", which is why we rejoice at SlutWalk embracing the word \\"slut\\" to remove the stigma; if we're all identified as sluts, that's the end of the insult which can divide us.\\" They further state that the Black Women's Blueprint letter brings division not only between white women and women of color but between women them and the women of color who support this movement. Use of the word \\"slut\\" Young girl protesting sexualization of women and girls in San Francisco SlutWalk, 2011 Others have noted that the use of the word \\"slut\\" raises the hackles of those anxious about the \\"'pornification' of everything and the pressure on young girls to look like Barbie dolls\\". Melinda Tankard Reist, notable for her stance against sexualisation of children in modern pop culture, said: \\"I believe the name will marginalise women and girls who want to be active in violence prevention campaigns but who don't feel comfortable with personally owning the word slut.\\" Feminists Gail Dines and Wendy J Murphy have suggested that the word slut is inherently indivisible from the madonna/whore binary opposition and thus \\"beyond redemption.\\" They say: \\"Women need to find ways to create their own authentic sexuality, outside of male-defined terms like slut.\\" Sophie Jones answered to Dines and Murphy that reclaiming a word does not mean celebrating that word in its current form. \\"Reclaiming \\"slut\\" should not be about celebrating the male-defined word as something 'positive', but celebrating the indeterminacy of the word when detached from its meaning. We want this word in our court, but only so we can keep it in the air and over the heads of everyone who would use it against us.\\" Recently the debate about using the word slut has emerged within the SlutWalk movement itself. Organisers of SlutWalk New York City \\"have made the decision to withdraw from the movement because of the name.\\" In Vancouver, the organisers decided to cancel the march and have a discussion instead, and a debate was held to determine a different name. Of the four names suggested (Slutwalk, End the Shame, Yes Means Yes and Shame Stop), SlutWalk remained the favourite, though half the voters had voted against the old name. SlutWalk Philadelphia renamed the protest \\"A March to End Rape Culture\\" in order to take into account concerns about inclusivity. Promotion of sex culture Former British Conservative MP Louise Mensch has objected to SlutWalk \\"on the grounds that it 'lionises promiscuity', which she says is harmful.\\" She also added \\"promiscuity is not equality.\\" Indeed, the inclusion of \\"Sex Party branding\\" has been criticised in Brisbane, where it was said by a rape survivor \\"they are promoting sex positivity, which I personally have no problem with, but a lot of survivors of rape are at different stages.\\" Guy Rundle has contrasted SlutWalk with Reclaim the Night protests, saying they \\"resisted the deep cultural pull to make women into objects rather than subjects, to be constituted by the male gaze... there was no way to watch Reclaim The Night and feel like, or be, a voyeur.\\" At worst, it has been said that \\"SlutWalkers have internalised their abuse\\" and SlutWalk is \\"the pornification of protest.\\" Legal culture It was noticed that, by taking aim at rape while expressly promoting the virtues of female sexuality, SlutWalk situates itself where anti-rape and pro-sex norms converge. However, the protest targets rape culture alone, leaving law and legal theory outside the specific claims. This omission is seen to underestimate the role of the law, since the crime of rape traditionally constructs female sexuality in ways incompatible with a pro- agency agenda.

It is headquartered at the Baptist World Center in Nashville, Tennessee and affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. History=Origins The root of cooperative efforts among Black Baptists began in the Antebellum period. Both free blacks and slaves were welcomed into the Baptist movement by missionaries in the First Great Awakening and Second Great Awakening.James Barnett Taylor, Virginia Baptist Ministers (1859) pp 57, 60, 71, 83 online edition Independent Black Baptist churches were formed in Petersburg, Virginia and Savannah, Georgia before the American Civil War.Albert J. Raboteau, Slave Religion: The \\"Invisible Institution\\" in the Antebellum South (1979) Under the slave societies of the South, they had to belong to white Baptist associations. Black congregations were required by law to have white ministers and supervision by law, especially after the slave rebellion of Nat Turner in 1831.Raboteau (1979), Slavery is a Religion The first attempts at wider black cooperative efforts began in the North, with Ohio and Illinois leading the way. In 1834 Black Baptists in Ohio formed the Providence Baptist Association. In 1838, following the lead of the Baptists in Ohio, Black Baptists in Illinois formed the Wood River Baptist Association. As early as 1840, Black Baptists sought to develop a cooperative movement beyond state lines. Baptists in New York and the Middle Atlantic states formed the American Baptist Missionary Convention. The spirit of cooperation beyond state lines soon spread westward. In 1864, during the Civil War, the Black Baptists of the West and South organized the Northwestern Baptist Convention and the Southern Baptist Convention. In 1866, following the war, these two conventions met with the American Baptist Convention and formed the Consolidated American Baptist Convention. One of the great successes of the new Consolidated American Baptist Convention was the support given to Black Baptists in the South to form state conventions. Black Baptists in the former Confederacy overwhelmingly left white-dominated churches to form independent congregations and get away from white supervision. After emancipation, Black Baptists in the South, with the support of the Consolidated Convention, formed their own state conventions. Among these were Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas, and Kentucky. Despite the pioneer work of the Consolidated Convention, regionalism continued among Black Baptists. In 1873 the Black Baptists of the West formed the General Association of the Western States and Territories, and in 1874 the East organized the New England Baptist Missionary Convention. This continued regionalism and other factors caused the decline and eventual demise of the Consolidated American Baptist Convention. According to historian Wilson Fallin Jr., black preachers interpreted the Civil War as: Convention founding In 1880, about 150 Baptist pastors met in Montgomery, Alabama, and formed the Baptist Foreign Mission Convention. The formation of the Baptist Foreign Mission Convention was to some degree a result of the demise of the Consolidated American Baptist Convention. The Consolidated Convention's death created a vacuum in mission work, especially for African missions. In response to this void, William W. Colley of Virginia, who had served as missionary to Nigeria under the Southern Baptist Convention during the 1870s, issued a call for Black Baptists to meet in Montgomery, Alabama, in order to organize a national convention to do extensive foreign missionary work. At the initial 1880 meeting, William H. McAlpine of Alabama was elected President of the Foreign Mission Convention; he is considered the first President of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. Two other national Black conventions formed. In 1886, William J. Simmons of Kentucky led the formation of the American National Baptist Convention. Stephen C. Finley, Torin Alexander, African American Religious Cultures, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2009, p. 257 In 1893 W. Bishop Johnson of Washington, D.C. led the formation of the National Baptist Education Convention. The desire to have one convention remained alive and the movement reached its fruition on September 24, 1895 at the Friendship Baptist Church in Atlanta, when these three conventions came together to form the National Baptist Convention of the United States of America. George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 1595 The heart of the new convention was that the three former conventions serve as the three boards of the convention: foreign missions, home missions, and education. Convention splits In 1897, during the E.C. Morris administration, a group of National Baptist pastors left the convention and formed the Lott Carey Foreign Mission Convention. The separation was centered on two issues: the location of the foreign mission board and greater cooperation with White Baptists. The second split, also during Morris's presidency, came in 1915 over ownership and operation of the National Baptist Publishing Board. The Publishing Board was the most successful agency and was led by R. H. Boyd. Leaders and pastors of the convention became suspicious of the actions of the board when they did not receive the reports they thought due them. A debate ensued concerning the ownership. Those who supported Boyd and his view that the board was independent of the convention formed the National Baptist Convention of America. It became known as the Unincorporated Convention (now National Baptist Convention of America International, Inc.). Because of the question of incorporation, leaders who remained in the original convention led a movement to incorporate their organization. The constitution was amended in 1916 and the convention was later incorporated, taking the name of National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. During the Joseph Jackson tenure, a third split occurred in the convention. The two key issues were tenure and the lack of support of the civil rights movement. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, known for increased public activism, demonstrations and protests was highly controversial in many Baptist churches. Often the ministers preached spiritual salvation rather than political activism. Jackson, the convention's autocratic leader, had supported the Montgomery bus boycott of 1956, but by 1960 he told the members they should not become involved in civil rights activism. Based in Chicago, Jackson was a close ally of Mayor Richard J. Daley and the Chicago Democrats. He opposed public activism of Martin Luther King, Jr. and his aide, the young Jesse Jackson Sr., (no relation to Joseph Jackson). Gardner C. Taylor of New York challenged Jackson for the presidency, but lost. After Jackson was re-elected, a group led by L. Venchael Booth formed a new convention at the Zion Baptist Church in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1961. They named themselves as the Progressive National Baptist Convention. These activists supported the extensive activism of the King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In 1992 Paul S. Morton of New Orleans, Louisiana formed a fellowship within the convention. It was named the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship. It explored spiritual gifts, speaking in tongues, prophecy, exclamatory worship, etc. The leadership of this fellowship later separated completely from the convention.Sherry S. DuPree (13 September 2013). African- American Holiness Pentecostal Movement: An Annotated Bibliography. Taylor & Francis. p. 347. . Retrieved 11 September 2020. Statistics According to a denomination census released in 2020, it has 21,145 churches and 8,415,100 baptized members. Baptist World Alliance, Members, baptistworld.org, USA, retrieved October 3, 2020 Governance The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. is a convention of primarily African-American Baptists. The convention is governed similar to a presbytery yet allows its member churches to govern themselves under the congregationalist polity.  Presidency  E. C. Morris was elected president of the National Baptist Convention USA in 1895 and served for 27 years. His tenure was important for laying the foundation of the Convention. In addition to managing growth and organization of new chapters, his presidency founded the National Baptist Publishing House in Nashville, Tennessee; blacks wanted to publish literature written by their own ministers. In 1890, the American Baptist Publication Society had refused to publish writings of Black ministers because of resistance from their White Southern clients. This event, more than any other, inspired Blacks to develop their own convention and publishing arm. One year after the formation of the convention, the National Baptist Publication Board was established under the leadership of Richard Boyd in Nashville, Tennessee. It was given the right to supply National Baptist churches with general ministry and Sunday school supplies. In a short time the publishing house became the largest Black publishing enterprise in the world. In 1902, the Woman's State Convention of Tennessee elected African American Virginia E. Walker Broughton, to serve as the first woman National Corresponding Secretary for the National Baptist Convention. The twenty-seven years of Morris' leadership represented the formative period for the Convention. Upon the death of E. C. Morris, L. K. Williams became president of the Convention in 1924. During his 16 years' tenure, he expanded the publishing board to gain increased support. Williams appointed L. G. Jordan as General Secretary of the Board and laid plans for a new building. The building was opened for inspection in 1925. On the recommendation of Williams, it was named the Morris Building in honor of the legacy of E. C. Morris. The Layman's Department was also established. David V. Jemison succeeded Williams as president of the Convention in 1940. His two major accomplishments during his 13 years were paying off the mortgage on the Morris Memorial Building and the purchase of the Bath House for African-American use in the resort of Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1953, Joseph H. Jackson of Chicago became the NBC USA President, serving until 1982. His 29-year tenure was the longest of any president, and spanned some of the most active years of the Civil Rights Movement. During these years, African Americans gained passage of federal laws protecting and enforcing their rights to public access and voting, especially in the South. Among President Jackson's many contributions were new commissions and restructuring of the convention. He also purchased the National Baptist Freedom Farm and set up an unrestricted scholarship at Roosevelt University. He was noted for low tolerance of dissent. He said that social protests were not enough, but people needed to prove their economic productivity as well.Nick Salvatore, Singing in a Strange Land: C.L. Franklin, the Black Church, and the Transformation of America (2007) In 1983, T. J. Jemison became president of the Convention, serving for 12 years. He completed construction of the Baptist World Center, a headquarters for the convention in Nashville, Tennessee. He spoke out on public issues more than some presidents, and expressed his opposition to the Gulf War. In a controversial statement, he spoke in favor of the noted African-American boxer Mike Tyson, who had been convicted of rape. The uproar caused by Jemison's remarks translated into a deep decline of membership and associated churches in the convention in 1992. Later presidents built up the national convention again. Henry Lyons of Florida was elected president in 1994. The Lyons tenure was characterized by much activity as he established a unified program, reduced the debt on the Baptist World Center, and dissolved the debt on the Sunday School Publishing Board. In addition, many commissions were added to the convention. Legal problems, however, forced Lyons to resign from the presidency. Lyons unsuccessfully ran again for President in 2009 with National Congress President, R.B. Holmes of Tallahassee, Florida, as his Vice-President. Stewart Cleveland Cureton, Vice President-At-Large, took over the leadership of the convention in 1999 and served the remainder of Lyons' tenure. In 1999, William J. Shaw of Philadelphia was elected as president, serving until 2009. His presidency was centered on the motto and theme 'V.I.S.A': \\"Vision, Integrity, Structure and Accountability.\\" He worked hard to reestablish integrity and credibility in the convention. Julius R. Scruggs of Huntsville, Alabama was elected president in 2009 and served one 5-year term. He did not seek re- election. In September 2014, Jerry Young of Mississippi was elected president, with some of its members expecting progressive teaching and administration.  State conventions  The National Baptist Convention's members form voluntary state and territory-wide local conventions. The state conventions are autonomous organizations and separately incorporated; some conventions are dually aligned with other Baptist conventions. Congress of Christian Education The National Baptist Congress of Christian Education is the training arm of the convention. It is an annual event, held in June that draws more than 50,000 attendees from around the United States and the world. The congress includes over 300 classes, lectures and group discussion panels targeted and relevant to every age group and every area of the convention. Sunday School Publishing Board The Sunday School Publishing Board is the official publisher of the Convention and provides all of the educational resources of the convention. The board was founded in 1915 and is one of the largest African American owned publishing companies. The Sunday School Publishing Board supplies books, text books, curriculum and other resources to over 36,000 churches. Laymen's Movement The National Baptist Laymen's Movement of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc. was organized at the Forty-third Session of the National Baptist Convention in Los Angeles, California, in 1923. The new President of the Convention, L. K. Williams presided. The movement came into existence under the leadership of Deacon John L. Webb, a Christian businessman from Hot Springs, Arkansas. John Webb served as the first president of the organization and continued in that position until his death in 1946. Webb in his open letter to national laymen, appearing in the August 30, 1924 issue of the National Baptist Voice stated the long range objectives of the Movement: \\"And wherever the Laymen's Movement is organized, the spirit of it will be to see that the pastor is well paid; and to foster and encourage by words and our money the institutions of learning that have made space for theological departments, so as to have a better educated ministry, better Sunday school superintendents, teachers, and B.Y.P.U. workers throughout our denomination.\\" The first annual session of the Laymen's Movement was held September 10‚Äì15, 1924 in Nashville, Tennessee. The second annual session was held September 10‚Äì11, 1925 at the Econ Baptist church in Baltimore, Maryland. At the end of the second session twenty-five laymen, five ministers and five persons representing other church organizations had been official registrants. His Vice President-at-Large Brother J. C. McClendon of Jackson, Mississippi, succeeded John L. Webb. After serving six years he was succeeded by his Vice President-at-Large, Brother Allen Jordan of Brooklyn, New York. In the annual session of 1971 in Cleveland, Ohio, Jordan turned the reins over to his Vice President-at-Large, Deacon Walter Cade, Jr. of Kansas City, Kansas. During the tenure of Walter Cade, Jr., many laymen ministries and programs were birthed. The regional workshop concept was started in 1971. The Allen Jordan Seminars for laymen was started in 1981 during the annual Congress of Christian Education. The Junior Laymen Basketball Tournament and Bible Bowl were started in 1981. The Junior Laymen's Convention was moved from the September session to the June session in 1981. The national laymen became involved in the Men's Department of the World Baptist Alliance. The laymen made their first work-witness trip to Africa to repair the convention's mission stations in 1976. Following Walter Cade, Jr. was Jerry Gash of Los Angeles, California. Under Jerry Gash's leadership he initiated the process of membership to identify the active laymen in the movement. He started the Male Chorus Sing-off and two mission projects for Africa, 25,000 pairs of shoes and 75,000 school supplies. Jerry Gash started the Southern Region Workshop in 1997. Glen Chelf of New Mexico served on an interim basis in 2000. Harold Simmons of Kansas City, Kansas was appointed president of the Laymen's Movement by William Shaw in 2000 to succeed Glen Chelf. Women's Auxiliary The first president, Sarah Willie Layten, was the daughter of William H. and Mary H. Phillips. She was a graduate of LeMoyne College in Tennessee, honorary member of Zeta Phi Beta sorority, and active member of the Woman's National Republican Committee. Layten helped to establish the National Baptist Missionary Training School at Nashville, Tennessee and helped to maintain missionaries on both the home and foreign fields. Her service expanded almost 50 years (1900-1948). The second president, Nannie Helen Burroughs, first served as Corresponding Secretary to the Woman's Convention over 40 years. She was the only child of parents who were born into slavery. She was a member of numerous civic organizations, a prolific orator and author of several books and publications. Mary Olivia Brooks Ross was the third President of the Woman's Auxiliary, serving from 1961 through 1995. She was born to the parentage of Professor Brookins and Mrs. B (Beatrice Brookins), both educators. She married Solomon David Ross, who was the pastor of the Shiloh Baptist Church of Detroit for 39 years. Ross taught school after earning her B.A. from Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia and doing graduate studies at Michigan and Wayne State Universities. Cynthia Perry Ray, the fourth president who served the convention from 1995 until 2000; she was the former first vice-president to Ross. She was born to Walter and Beatrice Perry of Penllyn, Pennsylvania. She held several leadership positions in the Woman's Auxiliary of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. and also was elected Vice President of the Baptist World Alliance in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1995, serving in that post until the year 2000. Rosa Burrell Cooper served as president from 2001 to 2004. She began her service with the statement, \\"Together we can do it through Mission, Evangelism and Education.\\" She stated: \\"I believe that as President of the Woman's Auxiliary, it is my mission to provide intelligent, articulate and responsive leadership in promoting spiritual growth of Christian women across the United States of America. To that end, I am committed to fostering and promoting group spiritual growth and personal development through programs which interpret, teach and apply the living and life-giving Word of our God.\\" President Hugh Dell Gatewood began her official service in January 2005 and served for 12 years. In January 2017, Cynthia Perkins Smith was appointed as the President of the Women's Auxiliary. Dual alignment Known to occur though infrequently, a state convention, district association or member church of the National Baptist Convention may dually align with another organization. The autonomous make-up of the NBC USA gives local congregations the latitude to govern themselves and contribute to the causes of other religious bodies as it deems necessary. Some members dually align with the Lott Carey Foreign Mission Convention which offers the NBC USA member a convention-wide focus on foreign missions; others may align with the National Baptist Convention of America or Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship. The autonomous nature of the member churches, associations, and state conventions allows the jurisdictions to decide their focus, interpret scripture, and define theology on issues not specified in the foundational truths of the Baptist Articles of Faith as well as dually align with a convention with a mission specialized on a specific issue. Joint Convention The Joint Convention of National Baptists converge in an American city every four years and comprises the four Black Baptist conventions. The other three member conventions all originated from or trace origin to NBC USA and together the four groups represent over 17,000,000 African-American Baptists in the United States. This convention of National Baptists meet to harness the power and influence of their collective bodies for Christian missions and social action. To date, this Joint Convention has only met twice‚Äîonce in Nashville, Tennessee and in Atlanta, Georgia.  Doctrine  The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., has a Baptist confession of faith. National Baptist Convention, What We Believe, nationalbaptist.com, USA, retrieved March 7, 2020 Women pastors, ministers and deacons The convention does not make official positions binding on its member congregations, state conventions, and institutions. There are many women ordained and/or licensed and serving in the convention affiliated congregations. A number of women serve as pastors of congregations, and as trustees to the boards of American Baptist College. Some congregations do not ordain or license women as ministers. Some congregations have women deacons, others as deaconess, some have both. Two Baptist National Baptist Women Pastors have been elected as Presidents of State Conventions. Patricia A. Gould-Champ, senior pastor of Faith Community Baptist Church in Richmond, Virginia and Associate Professor of Practical Theology at Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology at Virginia Union University was elected as the 35th and first female president of the Baptist General Convention of Virginia in 2003. Marylin Monroe Harris, senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of Teaneck in Teaneck, NJ, became President of the United Missionary Baptist Convention State of New Jersey, the 2nd Vice Moderator of the North Jersey District Missionary Baptist Association, the Past President of the Black Clergy Council of Englewood, Teaneck and Vicinity and the Past Moderator of the Essex Association of the American Baptist Churches of New Jersey and the first female African American Chaplain of the Teaneck Fire Department. Many women serve as moderators for district associations affiliated with the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.  Same-sex marriage and LGBT issues  \\"The National Baptist Convention USA Inc. does not have an 'official' position on any issues with regards to homosexuality.\\" The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. released an official position statement in 2012 that defines marriage as the exclusive union of a man and a woman. A subsequent position statement in 2014 prohibited the convention's military chaplains from officiating same-sex marriages or civil unions stating that they \\"are not to participate in any activity that implies or condones same sex marriage or same sex union.\\" In 2006 the organization stated that a majority of their member churches would hold that homosexuality is not a legitimate expression of God's will and would be opposed to ordaining active homosexuals or lesbians for any type of ministry in their church. Nevertheless, given the denomination's diversity, some pastors and congregations affiliated with the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. announced their support for same-sex marriage. \\"The National Baptist Convention, USA, Incorporated does not dictate to its constituent churches what position to take on issues because we believe in the autonomy of the local church.\\" Convention affiliates * Benedict College * Shaw University * Virginia Union University * American Baptist College * Selma University * Florida Memorial University * Virginia University of Lynchburg * Morehouse College * Morehouse School of Religion See also * List of the largest Protestant bodies * Protestantism in the United States * Black church * Religion in Black America * Christianity in the United States  Notes and references = Notes References Position and Policy Statements (primary sources) =Further reading * * * * * * External links * Study on the history and contemporary challenges of the NBCUSA, Inc. https://web.archive.org/web/20070808071006/http://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/faculty/morris/docmorrislee- baptist.pdf * The National Baptist Convention - official Web Site * Sunday School Publishing Board - official Web Site * Foreign Mission Board - official Web Site Category:Baptist denominations in North America Category:Baptist organizations established in the 19th century Category:Baptist Christianity in Tennessee Category:Baptist Christianity in the United States Category:Members of the World Council of Churches Category:Historically African-American Christian denominations Category:Religious organizations established in 1895 Category:Members of the National Council of Churches Category:African-American organizations Category:1895 establishments in the United States ","title":"National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc."},{"id":"31620334","text":"Jimmy J.

The house is managed by The Shuttleworth Trust, established in 1944 by Dorothy Clotilda Shuttleworth in memory of her son Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth (1909‚Äì1940). History The Old Warden estate was bought in the late 17th century by London merchant Sir Samuel Ongley. It passed down in the Ongley family until 1872, when the 3rd Baron Ongley, in financial difficulties, sold it to Joseph Shuttleworth of the Lincoln engineering firm of Clayton & Shuttleworth. It thereafter became better known as the Shuttleworth estate. The house which stands today was built in 1875‚Äì6 for Joseph Shuttleworth by Henry Clutton, the prominent Victorian architect, to rival the 17th-century Shuttleworth mansion at Gawthorpe Hall in Lancashire. Faced with ashlar in the Jacobean style, it is a three-storey rectangular block which replaced an existing house and is a Grade II* listed building. The house has high chimneys and a 100 ft clock tower. Clutton designed many of the interior features such as the carved doors, balustrades, and chimneypieces. Gillows of Lancaster made many of the interior furnishings and there are several examples of 19th- century paintings by prominent artists such as Sir Frank Dicksee, William Leader, George Vicat Cole and Frank Holl. During the Second World War, the house was a Red Cross convalescent home and auxiliary hospital for airmen. It then opened as an agricultural college in 1946. In an adjacent part of the estate, the Swiss Garden is home to 17 listed structures including bridges, the Indian kiosk, and a grotto. The management of The House has now reverted to the Trust.  Today  The house is a venue for weddings, corporate events, product launches, conferences, afternoon tea, and as a filming location for period dramas. It is open to the public on selected event dates, including six Sunday airshows and Flying Proms.

The company is a bioreagents and life sciences services company which commercialises research tools for biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology research, and provides services in these areas to the life sciences community. The company‚Äôs key business activities include research and development of new innovative products and services, commercialization of products in-licensed from academic institutions, distribution of life sciences research products from commercial partners and supply of contract research services to both academic and pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies customers.  History  Dundee Cell Products Ltd was founded in 2006 as a spinout of the internationally renowned School of Life Sciences of the University of Dundee by Dr Paul Ajuh (now with Gemini Biosciences ) and Prof. Angus Lamond (Lamond Lab). Since spinout the company has maintained close interactions with researchers at the institution and a strong relationship with the University. In 2007, the company secured equity investment funding from a syndicate of angel investors to finance and expand its activities with follow up investment secured in 2009 from angel investors and the Scottish Co-investment Fund (SCF). The investment was secured to support the business‚Äôs growth plans. Over the last four years DCP has enjoyed significant growth in its products portfolio and turnover.  Research and innovation  In the past three years, the company has developed and commercialized several new products e.g. SILAC ready to use media and has been involved in proteomics research collaborations with scientists in both academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies. Some of these projects have been designed to investigate the effects of virus infections on cellular proteomes in order to elucidate the mechanisms and cellular pathways involved in virus‚Äìhost factor interactions.Emmott E., Rodgers M.A., Macdonald A., McCrory S., Ajuh P., Hiscox J.A. (2010) Mol. Cell. Proteomics, 9, 1920-1936 DCP has also collaborated in a phosphoproteomics projectWagner W., Ajuh P., L√∂wer J., Wessler S. (2010) Cell. Commun. Signal. 8, 28 designed to study the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion disease. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal diseases associated with the conversion of the cellular prion protein to an abnormal prion protein leading to damage of brain and neural tissue. Examples of prion diseases include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as \\"mad cow disease\\") in cattle and Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease (CJD) in humans. There is currently no treatment for prion diseases, which are usually fatal to the host. Current R&D; projects within the company have been focused on developing applications for SILAC quantitative proteomics in predictive toxicology. These projects are designed to provide data that will be used in developing predictive models for drug toxicity early on during the drug discovery and development process.  Portfolio  DCP initially developed antibodies, mammalian cell fractions for precursor mRNA splicing research and tissue culture media specifically formulated for SILAC quantitative proteomics. The first products commercialized by the company came from the research interests of the founding scientists who saw an opportunity in the market for developing and commercializing high quality research products and services in the research area to other colleagues. The company has subsequently expanded its products and services portfolio into many other areas of life sciences research to better cover the needs of its customers.  Product lines  Dundee Cell Products commercializes a broad range of life sciences research products (many of which have been developed in-house) including cell culture media for quantitative proteomics, mammalian cell fractions e.g. nuclei, nucleoli, mitochondria and cell fractions for quantitative proteomics, antibodies, recombinant proteins, fluorescent cell markers and primary mammalian cells. The company‚Äôs SILAC ready to use media have been specially formulated to facilitate the use of SILAC technology by non-specialists in proteomics and scientists who are interested in the application of unbiased high throughput quantitative proteomics approaches in their R&D; activities.  Research services  As well as offering research products, the company‚Äôs portfolio has grown to include research services designed to accelerate the research activities of scientists in both the academic and biotech/pharmaceutical industry sectors. Some of the research services that DCP offers include gene synthesis, DNA cloning, recombinant protein expression and purification, stable cell line development, custom monoclonal and polyclonal antibody development and various proteomics services i.e. both quantitative (e.g. SILAQ, Tandem Mass Tags, iTRAQ, Isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT), label-free) and qualitative. In collaboration with scientists at the University of Dundee, the company is developing novel and innovative products and services in the areas of proteomics, molecular biology and cell biology focused on the needs of research scientists in academic institutions as well as those in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.

It was written by the show creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Tim Van Patten. Nearly all the action of the episode happens during travel: Eddard Stark and his daughters accompany the king's entourage to King's Landing to occupy the post of Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister joins Jon in his travel to the Wall, and the newly wed Daenerys goes with her husband's khalasar to the city of Vaes Dothrak. Meanwhile, in Winterfell a grieving Catelyn Stark watches over her unconscious son Bran. The title of the episode refers to the long road that snakes throughout Westeros, eventually ending at King's Landing. Viewing figures were unchanged from the premiere, despite the second episode airing on Easter Sunday. Critical reception to the episode was favorable. Filming locations included several notable Northern Ireland locations, and the filming itself was complicated by the difficulty of integrating canine actors into several crucial scenes. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 2.2 million in its initial broadcast. Plot=In the Dothraki Sea En route to Vaes Dothrak with Khal Drogo's khalasar, Jorah Mormont reveals to Viserys Targaryen that he was exiled for selling poachers into slavery. Viserys is impatient for control of Drogo's army. Daenerys Targaryen struggles with her new marriage and the nomadic Dothraki lifestyle, taking comfort in her dragon eggs. Distressed by sex with the Khal, she asks her handmaiden Doreah how to please her husband. Later, she is able to have sex with Drogo while facing him, leading the relationship to become more intimate. In the North Bran Stark has been in a coma for over a month. After slapping his nephew Joffrey Baratheon for refusing to give his condolences to the Starks, Tyrion Lannister informs his siblings that Bran will survive. Ned Stark and his daughters prepare to journey to the capital with King Robert Baratheon, while Jon Snow leaves to join his uncle Benjen in the Night's Watch, accompanied by Tyrion. Jon gives Arya Stark a sword, and Catelyn Stark chastises Ned for leaving her. Ned promises to tell Jon about his mother when they meet again. As they embark for King's Landing, Robert tells Ned of Daenerys Targaryen's marriage to Khal Drogo and the possibility of Viserys raising a Dothraki army to overthrow him. A fire breaks out at Winterfell as an assassin tries to kill Bran, but is held off by Catelyn and killed by Bran's direwolf. A strand of blonde hair in the tower where Bran fell convinces Catelyn that the Lannisters are involved. Confiding with her son Robb, Maester Luwin, Master-at-Arms Ser Rodrik Cassel, and the Starks' ward Theon Greyjoy, Catelyn decides to go to King's Landing to warn Ned. At the Wall Reaching the Wall, Tyrion disabuses Jon of his romantic notions of the once-noble Night's Watch, now a place for criminals, prisoners, and bastards. At the Inn at the Crossroads The king's entourage stops at an inn, where Joffrey's cruelty to Arya's commoner friend Mycah results in Joffrey being bitten by Arya's direwolf Nymeria, whom he accuses of attacking him. Sansa, newly betrothed to Joffrey, claims to remember nothing, and King Robert gives in to Cersei Lannister's demand that the direwolf be killed. With Nymeria having fled, Sansa's direwolf Lady is to be killed instead, which Ned takes responsibility for himself. He encounters Joffrey's bodyguard, Sandor \\"The Hound\\" Clegane, who has killed Mycah for the prince. Ned kills Lady, while in the North, Bran suddenly awakens from his coma. Production=Writing The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. The second episode was written by the show creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on the original book by George R. R. Martin.\\"The Kingsroad\\" includes chapters 10-11, 13-18 and 24. (Tyrion I, Jon II, Eddard II, Tyrion II, Catelyn III, Sansa I, Eddard III, Bran III, Daenerys III.) While the events in this episode mostly follow the book, differences in the screen adaptation include not introducing the council's delegation with Ser Barristan and Lord Renly and the conversation between Robert and Eddard taking place during breakfast instead of on horseback. Some scenes were also created for the series, most notably a conversation between Catelyn and Cersei at Bran's bedside remembering the Queen's first child by Robert that died early of sickness (in the novel, when Ned confronts Cersei about Jaime fathering her children, she hinted that her first pregnancy, which was by Robert, she had aborted), and a confrontation between Jaime and Jon before Jon leaves for the Wall. Casting This episode marks the first appearance of regular guest star Roxanne McKee, best known for her role of Louise Summers in the British Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks. McKee was chosen among a great number of candidates to play the part of Doreah, a slave serving as Daenerys Targaryen's handmaiden. Also introduced in this episode is British musician Wilko Johnson as the executioner Ilyn Payne. The mute headsman of Game of Thrones is Johnson's first acting job. Filming locations The principal shooting for the episode was done at The Paint Hall studio. The scenes at the Inn at the Crossroads were filmed on location at the Redhall Estate, in Ballycarry, during the first days of September 2010. Direwolves \\"The Kingsroad\\" has a significant number of scenes that include direwolves. To stand in for the extinct species, the production team considered using real wolves, but the UK safety laws and close work with child actors made this impractical. Instead, they chose to use Northern Inuit Dogs due to their resemblance to wolves. The dog that portrayed Lady, Zanni, was adopted after the season wrapped by the family of Sophie Turner, the actress playing the direwolf's owner, Sansa Stark. Reception=Ratings The second episode of Game of Thrones attracted the same viewing figures as the premiere, with 2.2 million viewers. The second repeat obtained 0.7 million, which was also similar to the previous week's figure. These ratings have been considered positive, especially considering that it was aired on an Easter Sunday. Critical response Critical reaction was favorable, although some critics felt it was inferior to the first episode. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 17 reviews of the episode and judged 100% of them to be positive with an average score of 7.3 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"'The Kingsroad' brings surprising new developments for characters undergoing change while pushing the various plots forward at an effective pace.\\" Entertainment Weeklys James Hibberd considered the second episode better than the first one, while TV Squad's Maureen Ryan gave \\"The Kingsroad\\" the lowest score from the first six episodes of the series. Matt Fowler, who reviewed the episode for IGN, gave it a score of 8/10, and maintained that it was still a solid effort that focused on shifting all the main characters out of their comfort zones. Tod VanDerWerff, from The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B, saying \\"it was a small step up from the pilot...and is a particularly eventful hour of Game Of Thrones, layering on plot point after plot point in a brisk, fairly economical matter.\\" Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, has described \\"The Kingsroad\\" as a transition episode and therefore \\"not as likely to excite as the premiere or some of the season's later episodes.\\" Maureen Ryan felt that the show lacked a thematic unity, and while it had some effective moments, in some ways \\"lacked emotional spark.\\" At Cultural Learnings, Myles McNutt admitted that having to move all pieces into place made the episode resemble a travelogue, but he considered the lack of cohesion to be very purposeful since it helped to emphasize the splitting of the Stark family and the different motivations and destinies that awaited the protagonists.

The Heian period triad of Amida Nyorai flanked by attendants is a National Treasure. Sanzenin Temple is the main attraction of the rural town of Ohara, which is located about an hour north of central Kyoto. The approach from Ohara bus stop to Sanzenin is lined with shops and restaurants catering to temple visitors, and there are a number of smaller temples in the vicinity. Sanzenin Temple itself has large temple grounds and a variety of buildings, gardens and walking paths. Sanzenin was founded by the monk Saicho who introduced Tendai Buddhism to Japan in 804. Sanzenin is a monzeki temple, one of only a few temples whose head priests used to be members of the imperial family. After entering the temple through the front gate, visitors to Sanzenin pass through a series of connected temple buildings. The first major building is the Kyakuden (guest hall), which displays works of Japanese calligraphy and paintings on sliding doors (fusuma). The building opens up onto the Shuhekien Garden, a traditional Japanese garden that has a small pond and hill. Connected to the Kyakuden by a corridor, the Shinden (main hall) displays statues of three Buddhist deities, the central figure of Amida Buddha being flanked by the attendants Kannon and Fudo Myoo. From the Shinden visitors can enjoy the most famous view of Sanzenin Temple: the Ojo Gokuraku-in Hall seen through maple and cedar trees across a moss garden. After admiring the view from the Shinden, visitors walk through the moss garden. A tranquil atmosphere permeates the garden, and there are a number of amusing stone statues that peek out from the moss. Along with the rest of the temple, the garden is particularly impressive during the autumn colors, which usually take place in mid November, about a week earlier than in central Kyoto. Located in the middle of the moss garden, the Ojo Gokuraku-in Hall is the oldest temple building at Sanzenin. The hall was first built in 985 and most recently rebuilt in 1143. It holds a statue of Amida Buddha, Sanzenin's most valued treasure. The statue of Amida is accompanied by two attendant deities, Kannon on one side and Seishi on the other. From the Ojo Gokuraku-in Hall there is a path that leads to the back of the temple grounds, where there are a few temple buildings of more recent construction. One interesting spot has rows of miniature statues of Kannon that were donated to the temple by visitors. On the way back to the front gate stands a treasure house that displays a few more of Sanzenin's artifacts.

Overview The Sait≈ç clan claimed descent from the Kasai clan, who were local daimy≈ç until the clan was destroyed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi during his conquest of northern Japan. They returned to the land as farmers, amassing considerable territory, and changed their name to Sait≈ç after seven generations. The clan prospered greatly under the Date clan of Sendai Domain by brewing sake, and as pawnbrokers, and rivaled the Honma clan of Tsuruoka Domain as the richest merchants in northern Japan in the Edo period. From the Meiji restoration until the post-World War II land reforms, they were the largest landowners in Miyagi Prefecture and were very influential politically. The gardens were laid out by Sait≈ç Zenemon, who was elected in the 1892 Japanese general election to the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Despite his great wealth, Sait≈ç Zenemon was a noted philanthropist, contribution to the construction of schools and public libraries and for social issues.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site in 1995. Overview During the early to middle J≈çmon period (approximately 4000 to 2500 BC), sea levels were five to six meters higher than at present, and the ambient temperature was also 2 deg C higher. During this period, the T≈çhoku region was inhabited by the J≈çmon people, many of whom lived in coastal settlements. The middens associated with such settlements contain bone, botanical material, mollusc shells, sherds, lithics, and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with the now-vanished inhabitants, and these features, provide a useful source into the diets and habits of J≈çmon society. Most of these middens are found along the Pacific coast of Japan, and the rocky ria coast of Miyagi Prefecture was densely settled from the early through late J≈çmon period. Some 59 shell middens have been found around Matsushima Bay alone, of which the Satohama site is one of the largest. Located on Miyatojima, the largest island in Matsushima Bay, the midden is on a hill extending from east to west, extending 200 meters north-south and 800 meters east-west. It was first excavated by Tohoku Imperial University from 1918-1919. It is especially famous as the first case of stratigraphic excavation in Japan, with clear indication of small settlements in the early J≈çmon period, larger settlements and shell mounds were left in each intermediate portion of the J≈çmon period until the beginning of the Yayoi period, and small settlements continuing until at least the Heian period. The midden was more than six meters thick in places, and a wide variety of relics have been excavated. The many thousands of years of continuous occupation and clear stratification of the midden enabled researchers to develop a pottery chronology which had a great influence on the later J≈çmon research. In addition to vast numbers of shells, the mound included chestnuts, acorns, the bones of large oceanic fish, and the bones of deer, wild boar and numerous species of birds. More than sixty examples of human remains were also found. In addition, there are many examples of fishing gear and ornaments, some made from conch and other materials not native to the area, presuming some form of long distance trade, as well as polished stone axes. In total were 293 manufactured items of bone, 91 of shell, 168 of stone, and 38 of earthenware found during excavations which were designated an Important Cultural Property in 2000. Finds from the site are exhibited at the Historical Museum of Jomon Village OkuMatsushima. Adjacent to the archeological site is the Okumatsushima J≈çmon Village, where most of the excavated items can be seen in the historical museum located inside. It is located about 15 minutes by car from Nobiru Station on the JR East Senseki Line.

Early life Walter West was born in Cookham, Berkshire on 11 September 1885. His early silent films, some of which are in the collection of the BFI National Archive, include The Merchant of Venice (1915). He owned extensive film studios, one of the largest being the glass studios at Walthamstow, London, purchased from Cunard Films. With George Broadbridge (later Lord Broadbridge), he formed the Broadwest Films Company. Films made by Broadwest were not only shown in the UK but exported internationally, including India, New Zealand, Scandinavia and the US. In her book, British Film Studios: An Illustrated History, Patricia Warren writes: \\"In 1916, Broadwest, who ranked alongside film companies of the day such as Hepworth, Barker and British and Colonial, bought the studio and its equipment... By the end of the war in 1918, Broadwest was recognised as one of the UK's most important film-makers, but nevertheless, along with a number of production companies, they ran into financial difficulties after the post-war boom....by 1921 Broadwest had gone into liquidation.\\" During World War II, West was making propaganda films for the war effort, commissioned by the government. He also worked as Chief Inspector of Production for ENSA (the organisation providing entertainment for the Services nationwide). Walter West's love of the turf was evident from the subject matter of many of his early silent films. He directed Kings of the Turf (1949) featuring the jockey Gordon Richards. In the 1950s, he formed his own company again, Walter West Productions, making short films featuring Gordon Richards and also Pat Smyth at White City. His son, Walter Stanley, was also involved in the production of these shorts. Walter West died on 7 March 1958. Broadwest In 1914 West created Broadwest Films after acquiring funding from T.G.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands to the north of the village, in the grounds of Thornton Hall (now a girls' boarding school), to the east of the River Ouse, some northeast of Buckingham. History The first church on the site was built in 1219, but the present building dates from the first half of the 14th century. This originally consisted of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a chancel with a chapel to its north, and a west tower. Under the north chapel was the burial vault of the Tyrell baronets of Thornton. The north aisle was demolished in 1620, and the north arcade was walled up. Between 1780 and 1800 the church was re-ordered, turning it into a \\"rectangular preaching box\\". The north aisle was rebuilt and the arcade re-opened, the chancel arch was walled up and the chancel and north chapel were demolished. A new ceiling was made below the level of the clerestory windows, which were blocked up. A gallery was erected at the west end, and the church was re-floored and re-seated. In 1850 a communion rail was erected at the east end, making the eastern bay into a sanctuary. During the 20th century the church ceased to be a parish church and by the 1990s it was in a neglected condition. The church was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 April 1993. Volunteers from the Wolverton and District Archaeological Society cleaned the church and its monuments. Architecture=Exterior St Michael's is constructed in coursed stone rubble with lead roofs. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave, north and south aisles, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with diagonal buttresses. In the bottom stage is an arched west doorway, above which is a two-light Decorated window. In the middle stage there are lancet windows, and the top stage contains two-light bell openings. On the summit of the tower is a battlemented parapet with gargoyles, and a wrought iron weathervane shaped like a key. The nave parapet is plain, and the clerestory windows are blocked. The north and south walls of the aisles contain three two-light Decorated windows, and at the summits are battlemented parapets. The east window dates from the 19th century; it has three lights and is also in Decorated style. Interior Inside the church are north and south four-bay arcades carried on octagonal piers. The ceiling is flat and plastered. The aisles contain box pews, made in deal but painted to resemble oak. One of these, at the east end of the south aisle, is larger than the others and was occupied by the lord of the manor and his family. At the east of the north aisle is a simple pulpit. At the west end is a gallery that is approached by a narrow stairway. On the front of the gallery is a wooden carving of the royal arms made from three types of wood. There is no seating in the nave, but instead a series of memorials. On each side of the western entry to the nave, under the gallery, is an alabaster effigy; on the left of John Barton, who died in 1437, and on the north side is Isabella, his wife who died in 1457. In the body of the nave is the font, then the alabaster effigy of a 14th-century priest. Beyond these is the re-assembled tomb chest of Robert Ingylton. This had been moved from the church at the beginning of the 19th century and used to form a grotto in the grounds of the house. Its remains were discovered in 1945 and reassembled in the church the following year. The top of the tomb is covered by a large brass inscribed with the figures of a man in armour, three wives, and 14 children, all framed by a canopy with four gables. The sides of the freestone chest are carved with niches containing figures of saints. Around the church are smaller brasses and wall memorials. There is stained glass in the east window and in the south windows. The east window was made possibly by William Wailes in about 1850, and one of the windows in the south was made by Cox and Son and dedicated in 1878.

Schnyder (1935 in Zurich ‚Äì 2011 in Kuala Lumpur) was a Swiss businessman known for his role as the owner and CEO of watchmaker Ulysse Nardin.  Biography =The journey of an adventurer From the beginning a certain duality inhabited Rolf Schnyder's personality. On one side, his strong organizational skills and sharp analytical mind were typical of a Swiss German upbringing. However, there was also something unerringly romantic, a perpetual inquisitiveness and interest in the world beyond his immediate vicinity. In 1956, Schnyder moved to Geneva to improve his French. Working in Jaeger-LeCoultre's advertising department on Geneva's historic Tour de L'Ile, Schnyder noticed that people in his office were easily intimidated by orders and correspondence that arrived in English. Realizing the insularity of the Swiss watch industry, Schnyder became determined to explore the world. He arranged to be posted for six months to his company's subsidiary, ‚ÄòDe Travers' located on Cromwell Road in London. After this attachment he returned to Geneva, but somehow having been exposed to the sprawling universe beyond Switzerland he realized that he had to move again. Like many young men, Schnyder was infected with wanderlust; he wanted to dive into the rich vivid colors of foreign lands, to eat things with flavors he'd never tasted and to experience new cultures with total immediacy. A newspaper clipping aroused his attention. A Swiss company named Diethelm was distributing a vast array of goods in Thailand and they were searching for a Swiss junior manager. Though only 22 years old, Schnyder instantly responded to the ad and his application was accepted. As he boarded in Genoa the ‚ÄúAsia‚Äù, a ship bound for South East Asia, he felt the world opening its infinite golden mysteries to him. The stranger in strange lands Because of his experience in the Swiss watch industry, Schnyder was immediately put in charge of Diethelm's timepiece division. Schnyder and his sales team would embark on weeklong journeys throughout Thailand trumpeting the merits of Swiss watches. Thus, while the foreign nationals gathered together to eat vague approximations of European fare in their hotels, Schnyder was at street-side restaurants learning the culture and language of his Thai friends. Schnyder's ability to remain objective and not cast a Eurocentric sense of judgment on native behavior allowed him to understand and embrace the culture of the Thai people. Lean and rangy with the rawboned good looks of an American cowboy or a professional skier, Schnyder made friends easily. He began to look forward to these sales trips, as each one offered the opportunity to learn something new about the mysterious country he now inhabited. Schnyder also had an inborn sense of business acumen. This, combined with fine managerial skills and boundless energy, soon saw him multi-tasking. When Diethelm diversified its activities with a travel agency, Schnyder ended up running the operation. Eager to share his passion for the incredible sights of South East Asia, he initiated charter flights in a leased DC3 from Bangkok to Siem Riep where the ancient Buddhist city of Angkor Wat stood untouched by time. In 1959 he and his friends took the historic trip down the River Kwai. They made their way through the thick forest from Kanchanaburi, a small town northwest of Bangkok, to the Burmese border. They lashed together a raft from bamboo poles with the help of a local who had plied through the forest to reclaim rails from the death railway built by Allied war prisoners during the Second World War, a task made famous by the movie, ‚ÄúThe Bridge on the River Kwai‚Äù. From the source of the River Kwai they floated down the river on a handmade raft, capsizing at times on unexpected steep rapids. It was supposed to be a seven-day adventure trip. No one had any idea where exactly they were and how many more days were needed to get back to the office. Being late or absent was a serious offense in a tightly run Swiss office. They got finally back five days late and paid the price ‚Äì a cut in holidays and bonuses. An image that Rolf Schnyder took during this adventure appeared on the cover of the Swiss magazine, Schweizer Illustrierte. An account of this trip, penned by Schnyder, could be found within its pages. It was the first of many travel reports published in Swiss and other European papers and magazines. In the next few years, Schnyder continued to explore Thailand, Laos, Bali, Cambodia and South Vietnam, where the war had just started. He also developed a particular fondness for the white beaches around the fishing village of Pattaya which had not yet become part of the tourist track. He invested his first savings in the Nippa Lodge, Pattaya's very first hotel. The industrious force Rolf W. Schnyder on the Cresta Run in St. Moritz Advancing up the chain of command at Diethelm, Schnyder soon found himself in charge of the consumer products division. He was tasked with the distribution of basic goods from companies such as Procter and Gamble and Union Carbide. Ever the keen businessman, he soon realized that it would be more profitable to switch from imports to local manufacture under licence. This time it was his turn to share his culture ‚Äî he imparted to his factory workers a Swiss sense of education, supervision and the institution of quality control. Schnyder recalls: ‚ÄúI was impressed with how fast the Thai people could learn new skills and how enthusiastic they were about their work. I could also see, in the way that they worked, that there was a high level of manual skill.‚Äù Schnyder also played rugby for the Royal Bangkok Sports Club. During this period, Schnyder learned to run large-scale operations. His boundless energy and his ability to be involved in almost every aspect at the factories as well as his uncanny ability with Thai language abetted his success. From 1966 to 1968, Schnyder switched gears. He left Thailand for a six-month voyage through the South Sea, sailing from Fiji to Samoa and around the islands of Tahiti and Bora Bora, visited South America and ended up in the head office of Philip Morris in New York where he got an assignment to develop the lucrative cigarette markets of South East Asia. Schnyder returned to Asia, basing himself in Hong Kong during the height of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He applied for a visa to China to record with camera in hand the historical events that took place in the Empire of the Middle Kingdom. Westerners were not particularly welcome at the time. Having a neutral Swiss passport helped. Schnyder practiced reading verses of the Red Book but still got in trouble. On the last day in Guangzhou he was offered some antique gold carvings which Chinese no longer had the right to possess as they had been declared capitalist merchandise. Since no taxis were available, two hotel waiters offered their help to carry these artifacts to the railway station for the trip back to Hong Kong. On the way, the group was stopped by some Red Guards who were omnipresent in town and countryside. They objected to the fact that a Chinese carried goods for a white foreigner. The two waiters had to drop Schnyder's bags instantly and were sent home. Schnyder had to drop his travel bags as well, was taken to a building occupied by the Red Guards and made to quote verses from the Red Book backward and forward all night long. Only next morning was he released, given some tea and a bowl of rice and sent back to the street corner where the bags had been dropped by the waiters and himself the evening before. Nobody had touched them. It took Schnyder two trips on foot of 30 minutes each to get all his luggage to the railway station. He reached the Lo Wu bridge, the border between China and the then- British colony of Hong Kong, one day behind schedule. Nevertheless, Schnyder was met by a large group of journalists who were eager to buy the many photos which he had shot during the previous five days and which were later published in newspapers around the globe and in the important US magazine, ‚ÄúLife‚Äù. Rolf W. Schnyder waterskiing in 2006. Schnyder's job with Philip Morris took him around the world and also back to the Philip Morris European headquarters in Switzerland, where he met Charles and Marcel Stern, the cousins of Philippe Stern, president of Patek Philippe. The cousins' owned one of the best watch dial factories in Switzerland and they invited Schnyder for a guided tour. As Schnyder watched dials materialize in the skilled hands of factory workers, a blue flash of inspiration blazed through him. He was absolutely certain that Thai workers could learn the trade of dial-making given the opportunity. The vastly lower cost of human labor in the Far East meant that Schnyder could craft watch dials of similar quality at a far lower price per unit which would permit the Swiss watch industry to stay competitive against the lower-priced products emerging from the Japan's Seiko. Charles and Marcel Stern were immediately sold on the idea, but the rigid Swiss syndicate that presided over the Swiss dial manufacturers was more difficult to convince. Finally, in 1968 Schnyder helped forge a joint partnership between Swiss and Asian investors to open the Cosmo dial and watchcase factory in Thailand. Schnyder immediately quit his job with Philip Morris and took the helm of this new enterprise. Business boomed from the onset with Schnyder and the Cosmo team filling big orders from many Swiss watch companies like Mido, Certina, Rado, Tissot, Camy, Fortis and many others. Eventually even the iconic Swiss brand Omega was unable to disregard the tremendous savings offered. However, as business soared a fractured relationship erupted among the investors. Tiring of the politics involved, Schnyder sold his shares in Cosmo and moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1973. The Precima factory, which became a key player in manufacturing watch accessories for Swiss watch companies, opened that same year. Aided by a 10- year tax-exempt grace period that allowed Schnyder to import materials tax free, business literally skyrocketed. Schnyder's trajectory of success soared. Soon he diversified to craft other micro- components, including balance springs and sapphire crystals. Business was growing at such a fast rate that Schnyder had to set up offices in Switzerland. These were located in the ASUAG building in the Seevorstadt neighborhood near Bienne. ASUAG owned several watch companies like Longines, Rado and Eterna, and key movement suppliers including ETA. It was at this location that Schnyder met Pierre Renggli, the general manager of ASUAG, and, through him, Ernst Thomke, who headed ETA. Thomke was fascinated by the opportunities that Schnyder had created in the Far East and assisted in transferring part of the quartz module production to Precima. Taking the path less traveled In the winter of 1983 Schnyder found his calling, to restore one of the greatest names in high-end watchmaking to its former glory. Why buy a manufacture focused on making mechanical watches at a time when everyone told him this industry was dead? The answer to this question comes from the time Schnyder spent in Asia. ‚ÄúIn China and India, quartz watches were not successful,‚Äù relates Schnyder. ‚ÄúThat is because watch repairmen would open the case backs and, for them, it was like looking into the back of a radio. In these cultures, the mechanical watch had residual value. Any competent repairman could open a watch up and service or fix it. They could see where the energy came from, they could identify with the mechanical movement. When I saw that these cultures adamantly refused at that time to embrace quartz watches, I knew that one day mechanical watches would come back. ‚ÄúIt is often said, but it is true, that the watch is a man's only piece of jewelry. This personal relationship becomes even stronger when the watch is mechanical. There is a beautiful symbiosis between a man and his mechanical watch. He gives the watch life by winding it and the watch unerringly serves him by providing him time. An almost fierce loyalty develops between a man and his watch.‚Äù A new era dawns In 1983, at 48 years of age, Schnyder returned to St. Moritz, Switzerland to ski and race his beloved skeleton bobsleds, activities that he continues to enjoy today. (He still occasionally wins a race on the Cresta Run, as he did in February 2006.) ‚ÄúI was on holiday skiing when I read in the papers that Ulysse Nardin had filed for Chapter 11 (deferment of payment) to protect itself from creditors. This was during the Quartz Crisis and many famous companies in Switzerland were folding. Ulysse Nardin had many debts without any real way of paying them off,‚Äù says Schnyder. He, like many watch enthusiasts, knew Ulysse Nardin's name well. ‚ÄúI knew of the brand because of the many medals for accuracy and chronometric competitions that it had won. I was immediately interested in purchasing Ulysse Nardin. It was the opportunity to be involved in one of the truly great names in horology.‚Äù However, when Schnyder visited the manufacture, he discovered nothing more than a beautiful carcass housed in the original factory building that was constructed in 1864. There was only one full-time watchmaker named Leopold Berthoud who occupied himself by creating Ulysse Nardin's marine chronometers and deck watches for collectors looking to own an anachronistic but sublimely made piece of naval history. Another person that Schnyder found at the manufacture was Jean-Jacques Haldimann. ‚ÄúIt was essentially with these one-and-a-half employees (as Haldimann was not actually on company payroll at that time) that I started at Ulysse Nardin. I realized that if I were to undertake this resurrection, I would have to breathe life back into this carcass based on the strength of our products,‚Äù says Schnyder. His plan for Ulysse Nardin's rebirth was to elevate it to the highest position in watchmaking. ‚ÄúTo do this, I knew I had to make a watch that had never been made before,‚Äù he explains. Fortunately for Schnyder, the ever-helpful Haldimann was deeply embedded in the Swiss watch industry. He told Schnyder that an independent watchmaker named J√∂rg Spoering had created a new tourbillon. Rolf was keen to see if Spoering had other ideas for high complications. As soon as he entered Spoering's atelier in Lucerne, a bizarre clock caught his eye. Says Schnyder: ‚ÄúI had only a vague recollection of seeing something like it before, so I asked: ‚ÄòIs this what they call an astrolabium?' Spoering said it was and explained that the clock was made by someone named Ludwig Oechslin. He sighed and added: ‚ÄòHe is supposed to be my apprentice but he is never here.'‚Äù Rolf W. Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin working together. Three weeks later Spoering arranged for Schnyder to meet Oechslin. ‚ÄúI pointed to the Astrolabium clock and asked: ‚ÄòCan you make it in wristwatch size?' He puzzled for a moment and answered, genuinely confused: ‚ÄòI can, but who would want it so small.'‚Äù Rolf Schnyder smiled as he replied: ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù Rolf W. Schnyder posing in front of the Astrolabiumin 1985 Unveiled in 1985, the Astrolabium Galileo Galilei was a major critical and commercial success. Although the Astrolabium went down in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most complex watch made, its significance was far greater than the sum of its parts. The Astrolabium, a machine powered by human kinetic energy that told time through the ancient poetry of celestial positions, was a sign of things to come and marked ‚Äúthe beginning of a beautiful friendship‚Äù between the brilliant leader Schnyder and the poet-philosopher Oechslin. Together, what they would accomplish over the next two-and-a-half decades is, in a word, ‚Äòextraordinary'. During his years at the helm of Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder has created some of the most original and functionally innovative timepieces in horology. Rather than sticking to ‚Äòtried-and-tested', Ulysse Nardin with the help of Ludwig Oechslin has constantly pushed the boundaries and opened up new worlds of manufacturing techniques and materials ahead of the rest of the watch industry. Ludwig's creative mind worked much faster than the small production team at the disposal of Schnyder. Schnyder followed up his awesome Astrolabium watch with the Planetarium Copernicus, a wristwatch that represents time through the shifting position of the planets in our solar system. In 1989 Ulysse Nardin, in cooperation with Christophe Claret, brought the world the first repeating wristwatch with Jaquemarts. Tiny figures carved in gold move on the dial synchronized in time to the repeater's hammer strikes. In 1992 the manufacture completed the ‚ÄòTrilogy of Time' with the Tellurium Johannes Kepler, a watch that tells time using a stunning interpretation of our constantly rotating planet. In 1993 Schnyder unveiled the Hourstriker San Marco, the fruit of his collaboration with technical wunderkind Giulio Papi. In 1994 Ulysse Nardin shifted gears and focused on the creation of the world's most functional GMT watch. The GMT ¬±'s ease of use and pure simple logic has been a revelation to frequent travelers. Then in 1996, on the 150th anniversary of his manufacture, Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin raised the curtain on the world's most purely functional perpetual calendar. This amazing timepiece has all calendar displays synchronized and adjustable through a single crown. Because of its reliance on special epicyclical gearwheels rather than levers, this incredible watch can be quickly adjusted both forwards and backwards! In 1999 the perpetual calendar received the added GMT ¬± indicator. Incredibly, all calendar displays were synchronized to this local time indicator. To this day, Ulysse Nardin's perpetual calendars represent the high reference in watchmaking for this complication, a remarkable benchmark that has never been surpassed. On the first year of the new millennium, Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin created a wristwatch that was irrevocably to change the face of modern horology. Their audacious Freak, a 7-day carrousel tourbillon with no hands or crown, is the world's first example of horological modern art. With its purity of design involving a movement that also gives indications of time, it still stands as the most creative innovation of the 21st century watch world. The Freak single-handedly smashed every convention known to haut de gamme watchmaking and opened the floodgates of creativity. As if this isn't enough, beating within it is the Dual Direct escapement, the first successful implementation of a non- lubricated alternative to the Swiss lever escapement. The Dual Direct escapement's wheels were made in silicium, another historical first in watchmaking history. In 2002, Schnyder launched the Genghis Khan, the world's first carillon Westminster minute repeater tourbillon with Jaquemarts. In the same year, the Freak won the Watch of the Year award. In 2003, Schnyder and Oechslin once again conspired to change the face of watchmaking with their Sonata, the world's first alarm watch that could be set 24 hours in advance and had a dual time function. Ulysse Nardin in cooperation with GFD developed the first hairspring for the balance wheel in polycrystalline diamond. In 2005, Ulysse Nardin created an updated version of the Freak, the Freak 28'800 V/h utilizing an updated and improved version of the Dual Direct escapement called the Dual Ulysse escapement. Schnyder also introduced the word's first watch to use diamond micro-components in its escapement, the Freak Diamond Heart. In 2006, to celebrate the 160th anniversary of the manufacture he has so assuredly led for the last 23 years, Schnyder presents the Caliber 160, Ulysse Nardin's first completely in-house designed and executed automatic caliber. This caliber features the manufacture's Dual Ulysse escapement at its heart. Innovative design allows the plate of the movement to be customized to integrate other signature complications of Ulysse Nardin, creating integrated movements rather than the modular movements that currently dominate the high watchmaking world. When Schnyder first took the reins of Ulysse Nardin, he inherited the original, then-empty factory first built in 1864 and enlarged in 1895. Today, there are 250 inspired workers and staff at Ulysse Nardin. Moreover, each of these men and women exude a palpable sense of pride that is a singular phenomenon in Swiss watchmaking. With each success, Schnyder has focused on selfinvesting in his manufacture to create greater self-reliance and independence. The living testament to this is a huge two-storey factory plus basement located in La Chaux-de- Fonds. Opened in 2003, this factory of dreams represents the way forward and assures the enduring viable future of one of Swiss watchmaking's greatest names. This production facility, watched over by Ulysse Nardin's immensely capable technical director Pierre Gygax and chief engineer Lucas Humair, offers the manufacture great flexibility in the creation of new products. It also offers Schnyder and his team the psychological comfort of knowing that under this roof they are capable of producing almost anything necessary to the ticking entity known as the mechanical wristwatch. With his boundless enthusiasm, clarity of vision and the conviction to constantly raise the bar in the industry, Schnyder has done what many didn't feel was possible when he first purchased Ulysse Nardin. Not only did he rescue the manufacture and return it to its former place of glory, but on the strength of his innovations he has enabled Ulysse Nardin to transcend its past and achieve an even higher place in the rarified constellation of watchmaking's legends. In his 23 years at the helm of Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder's personality and that of the manufacture have merged. They have become one. The spirit of the watchmaker Ulysse Nardin has reached out over the great ocean of time to become inextricably intertwined with Schnyder's own great warrior spirit, a spirit that can at once wholeheartedly plunge into the humor of life while taking on and out-swimming life's perilous currents. In the years he has led Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder has fulfilled his fate. Rolf Schnyder in 2004 Family and personal life Schnyder often shuttled between Switzerland and Malaysia. When he was not overseeing business in Le Locle, he was either at his home in Kuala Lumpur or visiting subsidiaries and retailers around the world. Schnyder shared a tropical home with his wife, and they are the parents of three children. In recognition of his contributions to watchmaking, Schnyder was awarded the \\"Spirit of Enterprise\\" Gaia Award in 2003 by the Musee International d'Horlogerie for his entrepreneurial achievements and commitments. This award was followed by the bestowment of the \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" by the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve: Asian Edition in Singapore for his continued contributions towards watch making technology and innovations. When asked what he wished for when he blew out the 75 candles on his birthday cake, Schnyder commented \\"If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing\\"! On April 14, 2011 Schnyder died at the age of 75 after a short illness. His wife attended the CHT Awards and Ball 2011 to accept the Pursuit of Excellence (Expat) Award on his behalf.

The severity of the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism is related to the duration of the disease, the magnitude of the thyroid hormone excess, and the patient's age. There is also significant variability in the individual response to hyperthyroidism and individual sensitivity to thyroid hormone fluctuations generally. On top of that, Graves' disease patients can undergo periods of hypothyroidism (for further information, see symptoms of hypothyroidism): finding the right dosage of thyroid hormone suppression and/or supplementation can be difficult and takes time. The body's need for thyroid hormone can also change over time, like in the first months after radioactive iodine treatment (RAI). Thyroid autoimmune diseases can also be volatile: hyperthyroidism can interchange with hypothyroidism and euthyroidism.Psychische stoornissen bij endocriene zieken, 1983, C. van der Meer en W. van Tilburg (red.)

Women may experience infrequent menstruation or irregular and scant menstrual flow along with difficulty conceiving, infertility and recurrent miscarriage. * Neurological seizures, neuropathy from nerve entrapment by lesions of pretibial myxedema, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis may occur. Athetoid, choreia, and corticospinal tract damage, are rare. An acute thyrotoxic encephalopathy is very rare. Effects on skeleton Overt hyperthyroidism is associated with accelerated bone remodeling (resulting in increased porosity of cortical bone and reduced volume of trabecular bone), a generally reduced bone density, osteoporosis, and an increase in fracture rate. The changes in bone metabolism are connected with negative calcium balance, an increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in the urine (hypercalciuria) and stool, and, rarely, hypercalcemia. In hyperthyroidism, the normal cycle duration of bone resorption of approximately 200 days is halved, and each cycle is associated with a 9.6 percent loss of mineralized bone. In hypothyroidism, cycle length approximates 700 days and is associated with a 17 percent increase in mineralized bone.Normal and pathological remodeling of human trabecular bone: three dimensional reconstruction of the remodeling sequence in normals and in metabolic bone disease. Eriksen EF, Endocr Rev. 1986;7(4) 379. The extent of the reduction in bone density in most studies is 10‚Äì20%. The clinical manifestations on bone differ depending on the age of the patient. Postmenopausal woman are most sensitive to accelerated bone loss from thyrotoxicosis. Accelerated bone growth in growing children can increase ossification in the short term, but generally results in short-stature adults compared with the predicted heights. With the introduction of antithyroid drugs and radioiodine in the 1940s, clinically apparent hyperthyroid bone disease became less common. However, bone density measurements have demonstrated that bone loss is common in patients with overt hyperthyroidism and, to a lesser extent, in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. A history of overt hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for hip fracture later in life, which in turn is one of the causes of excess late mortality in previously hyperthyroid patients. It is therefore reasonable to assume that in some hyperthyroid patients bone density does not completely return to normal after antithyroid treatment. However, if the thyrotoxicosis is treated early, bone loss can be minimized. The level of calcium in the blood can be determined by a simple blood test, and a bone density scan can document the amount of bone loss. There are many medications that can help to rebuild bone mass and to prevent further bone loss. Risedronate treatment has been demonstrated to help restore bone mass in osteopenia/osteoporosis associated with Graves' disease.Chapter 11. Diagnosis and Treatment of Graves' Disease Leslie J. De Groot, MD Professor of Medicine ‚Äì http://www.thyroidmanager.org/chapter/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-graves- disease/ Updated: March 5, 2008 Nevertheless, weight-bearing exercises, a balanced diet, calcium intake of about 1500 mg a day and enough vitamin D, are of course elementary foundations. Eye symptoms Hyperthyroidism almost always causes general eye symptoms like dryness and irritation, regardless of what the cause of the hyperthyroid state is. However, these need to be distinguished from Graves' ophthalmopathy, which can only occur in patients who have Graves' disease. (It may also, rarely, be seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, primary hypothyroidism, and thyroid cancer). About 20‚Äì25% of patients with Graves' disease will suffer from clinically obvious Graves' ophthalmopathy, and not just from the eye signs of hyperthyroidism. Only 3 to 5% will develop severe ophthalmopathy.Graves' ophthalmopathy: a preventable disease? Luigi Bartalena, Claudio Marcocci and Aldo Pinchera1 ‚Äì European Journal of Endocrinology (2002) 146 457‚Äì461 However, when subjected to closer inspection (e.g. by magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits) many more patients have evidence of ophthalmopathy. It is estimated that for every 100,000 persons, 16 women and 3 men have Graves' ophthalmopathy every year. Although it is true that in most patients ophthalmopathy, goiter, and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis appear more or less coincidentally, it is also true that in certain cases eye signs may appear long before thyrotoxicosis is evident, or become worse when the thyrotoxicosis is subsiding or has been controlled by treatment. In approximately 20% of ophthalmopathy patients, ophthalmopathy appears before the onset of hyperthyroidism, in about 40% concurrently, and in about 20% in the six months after diagnosis. In the remainder, the eye disease first becomes apparent after treatment of the hyperthyroidism, more often in patients treated with radioiodine. It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between eye symptoms due to hyperthyroidism and those due to Graves' antibodies, not in the least because the two often occur coincidentally. What can make things particularly difficult, is that many patients with hyperthyroidism have lid retraction, which leads to stare and lid lag (due to contraction of the levator palpebrae muscles of the eyelids). This stare may then give the appearance of protruding eyeballs (proptosis), when none in fact exists. This subsides when the hyperthyroidism is treated. Due to Graves' ophthalmopathy Photo showing the classic finding of proptosis and lid retraction in Graves' disease Graves' ophthalmopathy is characterized by inflammation of the extraocular muscles, orbital fat and connective tissue. It results in the following signs, which can be extremely distressing to the patient: * Most frequent are symptoms due to conjunctival or corneal irritation: burning, photophobia, tearing, pain, and a gritty or sandy sensation. * Protruding eyeballs (known as proptosis and exophthalmos). * Diplopia (double vision) is common. * Limitation of eye movement (due to impairment of eye muscle function). * Periorbital and conjunctival edema (accumulation of fluid beneath the skin around the eyes). * In severe cases, the optic nerve may be compressed and acuity of vision impaired. * Occasionally loss of vision. Due to hyperthyroidism In the absence of Graves' ophthalmopathy, patients may demonstrate other ophthalmic symptoms and signs due to hyperthyroidism: * Dry eyes (due to loss of corneal moisture). * A sense of irritation, discomfort, or pain in the eyes. * A tingling sensation behind the eyes or the feeling of grit or sand in the eyes. * Excessive tearing that is often made worse by exposure to cold air, wind, or bright lights. * Swelling or redness of the eyes. * Stare * Lid lag (Von Graefe's sign) * Sensitivity to light * Blurring of vision * Widened palpebral fissures * Infrequent blinking * The appearance of lid retraction. Neuropsychological manifestations Several studies have suggested a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders and mental disorder symptoms in Graves' disease (and thyroid disease in general), which are similar to those in patients with organic brain disease. These manifestations are diverse, affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. The vast majority of patients with hyperthyroidism meet criteria for some psychiatric disorders, and those with milder presentations are probably not entirely free of mental symptoms such as emotional lability, tension, depression and anxiety. Anxiety syndromes related to hyperthyroidism are typically complicated by major depression and cognitive decline, such as in memory and attention. Some studies contradict the psychological findings. For example, a large 2002 study found \\"no statistical association between thyroid dysfunction, and the presence of depression or anxiety disorder.\\" In one study on hospitalised elderly patients, over half had cognitive impairment with either dementia or confusion. However, a controlled study on 31 Graves' disease patients found that while patients had subjective reports of cognitive deficits in the toxic phase of Graves' thyrotoxicosis, formal testing found no cognitive impairment and suggested the reported symptoms may reflect the affective and somatic manifestations of hyperthyroidism. Notably, a literature review of 2006 notes methodology issues in the consistency of Graves' disease diagnostic criteria, which might explain the apparently contradicting findings. These researchers found many reports about residual complaints in patients who were euthyroid after treatment, with a high prevalence of anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder, as well as elevated scores on scales of anxiety, depression and psychological distress. In a 1992 study, a significant proportion of the 137 questioned patients with Graves' disease reported ‚Äì among other things ‚Äì increased crying (55%), being easily startled (53%), being tired all the time (47%), a significant decrease in social activity (46%), feelings of being out of control (45%), feelings of hopelesness (43%), loss of sense of humor (41%), loss of interest in things they formerly enjoyed (39%), not being able to 'connect' with others (34%).Journal of Neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences, 1996, 8:181‚Äì185. Several studies point out that the severity of psychiatric symptoms could easily result in an inappropriate referral to a psychiatrist prior to the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Consequently, undiagnosed hyperthyroidism sometimes results in inappropriate use of psychotropic medications; prompt recognition of hyperthyroidism (or hypothyroidism) through thyroid function screening is therefore recommended in the evaluation of patients with psychiatric symptoms. Naturally, the management of patients would be improved by collaboration between an endocrinologist and a psychiatrist.Psychiatric Manifestations of Graves' Hyperthyroidism Pathophysiology and Treatment Options Robertas Bunevicius and Arthur J. Prange Jr ‚Äì CNS Drugs. 2006;20(11) 897‚Äì909 Overall, reported symptoms vary from mild to severe aspects of anxiety or depression, and may include psychotic and behavioural disturbances: * Varying degrees of anxiety, such as a very active mind,irritability, hyperactivity, agitation, restlessness, nervousness, distractible overactivity and panic attacks. In addition patients may experience vivid dreams and, occasionally, nightmares. * Depressive features of mental impairment, memory lapses, diminished attention span, fluctuating depressionPsychische stoornissen bij endocriene zieken, 1983, C. van der Meer en W. van Tilburg (red.) suggests usually with an agitated streak, not a depression of the inhibited type * Emotional lability and in some patients hypomania,. * The pathological well-being (euphoria) or hyperactivity may produce a state of exhaustion, and profound fatigue or asthenia chiefly characterizes the picture. * Erratic behaviour may include intermittent rage disorder and mild attention deficit disorder,.The Thyroid Solution, Arem Ridha Some patients become hyperirritable and combative, which can precipitate accidents or even assaultive behaviour. * In more extreme cases features of psychosis, with delusions of persecution or delusions of reference, and pressure of speech may present themselves. Rarely, patients develop visual or auditory hallucinations or a frank psychosis, and may appear schizophrenic, lose touch with reality and become delirious, Such psychotic symptoms may not completely clear up after the hyperthyroidism has been treated. Paranoia and paranoid-hallucionary psychosis in hyperthyroidism usually have a manic disposition and it is therefore often not clear if the patient is experiencing a paranoid psychosis with depressive streaks, or a depression that has paranoid streaks. Treatment of hyperthyroidism typically leads to improvement in cognitive and behavioral impairments. Agitation, inattention, and frontal lobe impairment may improve more rapidly than other cognitive functions. However, several studies confirm that a substantial proportion of patients with hyperthyroidism have psychiatric disorders or mental symptoms and decreased quality of life even after successful treatment of their hyperthyroidism. Effects on pre- existing psychiatric disorders Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders, will experience a worsening of their usual symptoms, as observed by several studies. A study of 1999 found that Graves' disease exacerbated the symptoms of Tourette's disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and points out that the lack of diagnosis of the Graves' disease compromised the efficacy of the treatment of these disorders. Patients who are known to have a convulsive disorder may become more difficult to control with the usual medications, and seizures may appear in patients who have never previously manifested such symptoms. Subclinical hyperthyroidism In subclinical hyperthyroidism, serum TSH is abnormally low, but T4- and T3-levels fall within laboratory reference ranges.Narrow Individual Variations in Serum T4 and T3 in Normal Subjects: A Clue to the Understanding of Subclinical Thyroid Disease Stig Andersen, Klaus Michael Pedersen, Niels Henrik Bruun and Peter Laurberg ‚Äì The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 2007, Vol. 87, No. 3 1068‚Äì1072 It primarily affects the skeleton and the cardiovascular system (abnormalities in other systems have also been reported), in a similar but less severe and less frequent way than overt hyperthyroidism does. It can alter cardiac function, with increased heart rate, increased left ventricular mass index, increased cardiac contractility, diastolic dysfunction, and induction of ectopic atrial beats. Long-term mild excess of thyroid hormone can thus cause impaired cardiac reserve and exercise capacity. In a large population-based study of 2008, the odds of having poorer cognitive function were greater for subclinical hyperthyroidism than for stroke, diabetes mellitus, and Parkinson's disease. Subclinical hyperthyroidism might modestly increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. A possible explanation for the mental symptoms of subclinical thyroid disease, might be found in the fact that the brain has among the highest expression of THR's, and that neurons are often more sensitive than other tissues to thyroid abnormalities, including sublicnical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis. In a 1996 survey study respondents reported a significant decline in memory, attention, planning, and overall productivity from the period 2 years prior to Graves' symptoms onset to the period when hyperthyroid. Also, hypersensitivity of the central nervous system to low- grade hyperthyroidism can result in an anxiety disorder before other Graves' disease symptoms emerge. E.g., panic disorder has been reported to precede Graves' hyperthyroidism by 4 to 5 years in some cases, although it is not known how frequently this occurs. However, while clinical hyperthyroidism is associated with frank neuropsychological and affective alterations, the occurrence of these alterations and their treatment in mild and subclinical hyperthyroidism remains a controversial issue. Regardless of the inconsistent findings, a 2007 study by Andersen et al. states that the distinction between subclinical and overt thyroid disease is in any case somewhat arbitrary. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been reported in 63% of euthyroid Graves' disease.,Studies on thyrotrophin receptor antibodies in patients with euthyroid Graves' disease. Kasagi K, Hatabu H, Tokuda Y, Iida Y, Endo K, Konishi J, Clin Endocrinol. 1988;29(4) 357. but only in 4% of cases where Graves' disease was in remission.Studies of thyroid function and immune parameters in patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease in remission.

Children and adolescents Hyperthyroidism has unique effects in children on growth and pubertal development, e.g. causing epiphyseal maturation. In growing children, accelerated bone growth from hyperthyroidism can increase osteogenesis in the short term, but generally results in short-stature adults compared with the predicted heights. Pubertal development tends to be delayed, or slowed. Girls who have undergone menarche may develop secondary amenorrhea. Hyperthyroidism is associated with high sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which may result in high serum estradiol levels in girls and testosterone levels in boys. However, unbound or free levels of these hormones are decreased. Hyperthyroidism before the age of four may cause neurodevelopmental delay. A study by Segni et al. suggests that permanent brain damage can occur as a result of the illness. Ophthalmopatic findings are more common but less severe in children (severe infiltrative exophthalmos is virtually unknown before mid-adolescence), but besides that, many of the typical clinical features of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents are similar to those in adults. An important difference between children and adults with Graves' disease, is that children have not yet developed like adults have (psychological and physiological), and that they are a lot more dependent on their environment. The encephalopathy will have profound effects on children's developing personalities and developing relationship with their environment. Disturbments in bodily development further complicates matters. The consequences for the development and the somatic and psychological wellbeing of the child can be very radical and sometimes irreversible. The earlier a person is affected by thyroid disease, the more the development of personality is affected and the bigger the delay from their potential development level. The child gets behind in its cognitive, emotional and sexual growth, which, by itself, also influences its processing abilities of the endocrine disease. Children with hyperthyroidism tend to have greater mood swings and disturbances of behavior, as compared with adults. Their attention span decreases, they are usually hyperactive and distractible, they sleep poorly, and their school performance deteriorates. Because devastating personality and emotional changes often appear in the child or adolescent with Graves' disease, many hyperthyroid children are (similar to many adults) referred to a developmental specialist or child psychiatrist before the presence of hyperthyroidism is suspected. Older patients In older patients, emotional instability may be less evident, or depression may occur, and the symptoms and signs are manifestly circulatory. In many, the thyroid is not readily palpable. Symptoms such as rapid heart rate, shortness of breath on exertion, and edema may predominate. Older patients also tend to have more weight loss and less of an increase in appetite. Thus anorexia in this group is fairly frequent, as is constipation. Elderly patients may have what is called \\"apathetic thyrotoxicosis\\", a state in which they have less and less severe symptoms, except for weakness, depression and lethargy (making it even more prone to escape diagnosis). Graves' disease and work Considering the many signs and symptoms, the generally delayed diagnosis, and the possibility of residual complaints after treatment, it is little wonder that a significant number of people with Graves' disease have difficulty keeping their job. One study found that of 303 patients successfully treated for hyperthyroidism (77% had Graves' disease) 53% dealt with lack of energy. About one-third were unable to resume their customary work, mainly due to persistent mental problems. In their 1986 study of 26 patients (10 years after successful treatment of hyperthyroidism), Perrild et al. note that four patients had been granted disability pensions on the basis of intellectual dysfunction. Between 2006 and 2008, Ponto et al. surveyed 250 Graves' disease patients. Of these, 36% were written off sick and 5% even had to take early retirement. In the same study, 34% of 400 questioned physicians reported treating patients with fully impaired earning capacity. Patients can and do recover with appropriate therapy while continuing to work, but more rapid and certain progress is made if a period away from the usual occupation can be provided. Two important considerations are adequate rest and attention to nutrition.

The workshop is located in Hardheim, Germany. The owner is master pipe organ builder Hans-Georg Vleugels. The company has a history spanning over 150 years.  History  Pipe organ manufacturing in Hardheim has existed since 1855, when organ-builder Ignaz D√∂rr started his own workshop. In 1958 Orgelbaumeister Hans Theodor Vleugels (born 1931) took over Maximilian Bader's workshop and two years later his brother's Wilhelm Bader. From 1960 to 1966 Paul Mund and Hans Theodor Vleugels led the company together. In 1967 Hans Theodor Vleugels founded the Orgelbau-Vleugels GmbH. While following traditional south German models, the company initially built instruments incorporationg modern technologies such as electric stop action. Cases had very contemporary designs, such as the organ in Cologne-Gremberg, set on a mushroom-shaped concrete pedestal, or in another organ that has free hanging steel frame with plexiglass used for the swell box and rollerboards, thus enabling a free view into the workings of the instrument. During the 1970s the firm abandoned the use of tropical woods and laminates in favour of solid woods, and electric action likewise was discarded in favor of mechanical action. While continuing to build new organs in the 1980s the firm began to devote attention to the restoration of older instruments, including organs of the South German Baroque, and Romantic instruments with valve chests and pneumatic actions. in 1988 the company moved into a large, open, and modern shop; that same year, Hans-Georg Vleugels (born in Stuttgart in 1958) became director of the firm.Cited from: Bush, Douglas E., and Richard Kassel, Edit.: The Organ - an encyclopedia. Published in 2006 by Routhledge Taylor and Francis Group, New Nork, NY. In 1991 Hans-Georg Vleugels took over the company chair and currently runs the company together with his son Johannes D.C. Vleugels (born 1983) in the second and third generation. Today there are three generations of master pipe organ builders in the Vleugels family working together. Developments during the 1990s included the restoration of several important concert hall organs: G√∂rlitz Stadthalle (1910 Sauer organ; 1991; 4/71); Heidelber Stadthalle (4/56); and Prague, Smetana-Saal (1912 Voit und S√∂hne, 1995‚Äì96; 3/70). The construction of large instruments in a late- nineteenth-century style was also completed at Aschaffenburg, Herz-Jesu Kirche (1995; 4/63); Munich, B√ºrgersaalkirche (1994; 3/50); Kitzingen, Stadtpfarrkirche St. Johannes (1996; 3/54); and J√ºlich, Probsteikirche (1998; 3/45). The J√ºlich organ contains accessories including thunder rolls, rain machine, and a croaking bullfrog. Vleugels also built new organs in the South German style in historic cases at W√ºrzburg, K√§ppele (1991; 2/31) and Sch√§ftlarn Benediktinerabtei (1996; 2/31). There were new directions in constructing cases using special materials - a glass case for the Christopherus-Kapelle of the Franz-Josef-Strauss airport in Munich (1/6) - and dramatic artistic effects with contemporary painting as in Kitzingen, Stadtpfarrkirche St. Johannes (1996; 3/54) and Runding, St. Andreas (1998, 2/36). Finally the 1990s saw the restoration of several historic organs in Germany: Gaibach, Heilig-Kreuz-Kapelle (1699 Schleich organ; 1989‚Äì90; 1/7); Gaibach, Pfarrkirche (1748 Seuffert organm 1997; 1/12); Mainz Budenheim (1747 Kohlhaas organ); and Laumersheim in der Pfalz (1717 Hoffmann organ).Cited from: Bush, Douglas E., and Richard Kassel, Edit.: The Organ - an encyclopedia. Published in 2006 by Routhledge Taylor and Francis Group, New Nork, NY.  Works  Buergersaal Church, Munich Initially, the majority of Hans Theodor Vleugels Organs were produced for the Southern German and Swedish markets. In addition to the production of instruments in accordance with classical principals, organ building in Hardheim stepped into new territories and established new accents in the field of organ building. Milestones include organs with electric action, the organ from Cologne-Gremberg, which set on a concrete mushroom shaped pedestal; a new smaller console (i.e. in Sinsheim III/36); and stops set on the side of the console which can be moved around (i.e. in Stuttgart-M√∂hringen III/37). Another highlight was the restoration of a decaying, but priceless baroque organ case (Walld√ºrn, Basilika III/40). The positioning of a free-hanging organ in a steel frame, the use of Plexiglas for a swell box (expansion chamber), roller boards, and a transparent console were only a few of the features that often caused surprised and sometimes shocked reactions. Herz Jesu, Aschaffenburg In the 1970s the company returned to the use of solid local woods and thus greatly reduced the use of tropical woods and laminates. The use of electric actions was also reduced. In Assamstadt (III/28), the artistic side of the company was further developed with creative pipe placement and paintings. The 1980s followed with a specialization in the restoration sector. Ever since the end of the 1970s, restoring valve chest organs and pneumatic actions had become fashionable again. In the fight against timber worm and other natural enemies more environmental friendly and material safe techniques, such as gassing, were being used. Also in the 1980s, the company concentrated in voicing in the Southern German baroque style. This characteristic of the instruments was enhanced by restoring old baroque organ pipes. However, organs with a strong, \\"romantic\\"-like sound were also inherited. Juliusspital, Wuerzburg In 1988 the company moved to a larger and more modern workshop and prepared to change leadership. Positive developments under master organ builder Hans-Georg Vleugels (born in Stuttgart 1958) shaped organ building in Hardheim in the 1990s and into the 21st century: * Restoration of the Europe's most important concert hall organs (G√∂rlitz city hall, IV/71; Heidelberg city hall, IV/56; Prague Smetana Hall, III/70). * Restoration of the electric action at the Voit organ in the Heidelberg city hall set new standards in restoration of pipe organs from that period. * New construction of large modern organs modeled after the style of the 19th century. (Aschaffenburg Herz-Jesu Kirche, IV/63; Munich B√ºrgersaalkirche, III/50; J√ºlich Probsteikirche, III,45). * New construction of southern German baroque style organs with historical cases (W√ºrzburg chapel, II/31; Sch√§ftlarn Benediktinerabtei, II/31). * Ground breaking contemporary organ case design through the use of special materials (i.e. glass case for the chapel of the Munich airport) and colour (Kitzingen St. Johannes III/54, Runding St. Andreas II/36, Bad T√∂lz Franziskanerkloster II/35, Schifferstadt St. Jakobus III/45, Krefeld Alte Kirche III/42, Geigant St. Bartholom√§us II/29). * The restoration of several of the oldest organs in southern Germany: (Gaibach, Franken, Hl. Kreuzkapelle, Schleich/1699; Gaibach Pfarrkirche, Seuffert/1748; Mainz Budenheim, Kohlhaas/1747; Laumersheim, Pfalz, Hoffmann/1717; Sulzbach, Main, 1710; Bartenstein, Schlo√ükirche, 1717). * Experience in restoration of the most famous pipe organs of the romantic period, built by Aristide Cavaill√©- Coll and E. F. Walcker Orgelbau Kaeppele, Wuerzburg The company currently operates out of a contemporary workshop and uses optimized work-processes consisting of modern machines and CAD.

Biography Cornelis Johannes van Doorn was born on 5 January 1837 in Hall (Gelderland), Netherlands, the son of the Reverend PW van Doorn. Van Doorn studied at the Technical School of Dr. Grothe in Utrecht and then at the Royal Academy in Delft. He received his degree in 1860 as a civil engineer. In his early career, he went to Java in the Dutch East Indies, returning home in 1863 to work for the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen railway company in North Holland. From March 1865 he worked as an engineer in designing the locks, pumping station and dam on the IJ (Amsterdam). In 1871 Van Doorn was invited by the Japanese government to act as an expert in hydraulic engineering, arriving in Japan on 24 March 1872, and staying to 22 July 1880. During his time in Japan, he was involved in port development and river improvement projects on the Edo River, Osaka, Yokohama, and Nobiru in Sendai Bay. He designed Japan's first western-style waterway, the Asaka Canal, which reclaimed land for 52 kilometers around Lake Inawashiro in Fukushima Prefecture and made the development of the city of K≈çriyama possible.. A memorial bronze statue was erected to him beside the sluice gate on the Tone River in 1931. He also designed Japan's first western-style lock, the Ishii lock in Ishinomaki, designated an Important Cultural Property in 2002. Returning to the Netherlands after eight years, Van Doorn died in Amsterdam in 1906. In the Netherlands, not much is known about his efforts in Japan. In Japan, on the other hand his name is found in schoolbooks, there are museums dedicated to him and streets and squares named after them. Even Van Doorns grave in Amsterdam is maintained at the expense of Japanese city of K≈çriyama.

The film stars David Kross, Stig Henrik Hoff, Florian Lukas, Rupert Grint and Lachlan Nieboer. Plot On 27 April 1940, a Luftwaffe Heinkel He 111 bomber (1H+CT) is pursued near Grotli by a Fleet Air Arm Blackburn Skua (L2940) fighter. Three of the four German crew survive the crash: pilot Leutnant Horst Schopis (Florian Lukas), Unteroffizier Josef Schwartz (David Kross) and Feldwebel Wolfgang Strunk (Stig Henrik Hoff). They prepare then set off for the coast to rejoin the fighting. When a snowstorm develops, they lose their supplies and encounter a hunter's cabin. Two British airmen from the other downed aircraft, Capt. Charles P. Davenport (Lachlan Nieboer) and his air gunner Robert Smith (Rupert Grint), are heard to approach the cabin. They start to deal with each other in the cabin. The following morning, an attempt to set out for help is abandoned when they start to get separated by the snowstorm. A Norwegian patrol is dispatched to look for the downed German airmen; when they encounter Smith and Strunk skiing downhill, a Norwegian sniper fatally shoots Strunk and captures Smith. Portside, a Norwegian officer interrogates the Britons, perceiving them collaborators. Davenport explains what happened and silences the interrogating officer. Shopis and Schwartz become prisoners of war in Canada; Smith and Davenport are returned to combat action. Davenport eventually survives the war.

Three British Royal Navy Blackburn Skuas operating from attacked the Heinkel He 111 and knocked out the Germans' port engine. The German aircraft crashed 1,000 meters above sea level in a remote mountain area, miles from any major road. The German tail gunner Hans Hauck was dead when the bomber crashed. Captain R.T. Partridge, squadron leader of the 800 Naval Air Squadron, Fleet Air Arm, experienced a failing engine in his Skua and glided down to land on a frozen lake. He had seen a small hut nearby and he and his radio operator, Lieutenant Bostock, hiked through heavy snow to the deserted reindeer hunters' cabin. A few minutes later, they were alerted by a whistle and saw the three survivors of the German Heinkel armed with pistols and knives. Speaking broken German and English, the British managed to persuade the Germans that they were the crew of a Vickers Wellington bomber, rather than the fighter that had shot them down. The Germans believed that they had been shot down by a Supermarine Spitfire. In Luftkampfgegner wurden Freunde (\\"Air combat opponents became friends\\"), Horst Schopis wrote in his memoirs:Partridge 1983. The two German survivors‚ÄîHauptmann Schopis and mechanic Joseph Auchtor‚Äîwere taken over the mountains to Stryn as prisoners.

By sheer coincidence the commander of the Norwegian patrol turned out to be a brother-in-law of a friend of Captain Partridge. The two freed British airmen hiked into √Ölesund, which was being defended by Royal Marines under heavy Luftwaffe bombing. As the destroyer scheduled to evacuate the British force failed to arrive, they commandeered a car and drove to the port of √Öndalsnes, where they were eventually returned to the United Kingdom by the cruiser .

Smolensk Kremlin () is a kremlin (fortification) enclosing the center of the city of Smolensk in western Russia. The partially preserved fortress wall was built between 1595 and 1602, during the reign of Tsars Fyodor I Ioannovich and Boris Godunov. The length of the walls is about , of which less than the half was preserved. The fortifications were built under the supervision of the architect Fyodor Kon. The Smolensk Kremlin is classified as an architectural monument protected at the federal level, and also has a great historical significance, in particular, as the fortress protecting the Russian state from the west over centuries.  History  Scheme of the Smolensk Kremlin, the remaining parts of the walls are shown in blue Smolensk historically had a great significance for the defence of Russia, and this is why Russian rulers paid considerable attention to its fortifications. In the spring of 1554, Tsar Ivan the Terrible ordered to build a new tall wooden fortress. After the development of artillery, it became clear that a wooden fortress was no longer suitable for the defense, and at the end of the 16th century, it was decided to build a new stone fortress at the place of the old one. In December 1595, the preparations for the construction started after the official decree was issued. The construction works were very intense and were performed daily from sunrise to sunset. The construction workers, however, lived in harsh conditions and revolted in 1599 because of hunger, cold, and diseases. In the summer of 1597 long and heavy rains flooded all the trenches and ditches, and the construction workers had to strengthen the landslide soil by piles. In 1600, because of the heat and heavy rains, a large number of crops was lost in Russia, causing a famine. The construction of the new fortress used the old existing fortifications, in some places the new wall was built on top of them, and in certain areas, the new fortress extended beyond the limits set by the old one. The construction started from the western side of the fortress.  Towers and walls Monument to Fydor Kon, the architect of the Smolensk Kremlin The walls of Smolensk in winter Several sections of the wall survived, the eastern section with nine towers, the south-western section with five towers, and the northern section with three towers. The most famous remaining tower is the round-cornered tower named Veselukha. This name was given to it because of the nice view which opens from the tower. In the daytime, citizens lead their guests to see the beautiful suburbs. However, in the evening time and especially during the night it is a rather dangerous place and has a bad reputation. Brave hearts who dare to appear at this place told about horror phantoms and ghosts. Finally it was found the reasonable explanation to that awful fact. This place was used by the counterfeiters who printed out false money and scared people who tried to walk around.

There are also entirely handmade rag dolls and hand sculpted figurines sometimes produced by Sexton within the Dolls and Dead Things brand. Controversy Dolls and Dead Things gained wide notice when some of the dolls were made with pieces of real human bone, taken from old, disregarded teaching skeletons. This revealed that within certain stipulations it is not illegal to own and use human bones for artistic purposes in the US, the main point of using bone, says Sexton, was to start a discussion about our own mortality and to examine beliefs about the state of being dead.

It is served by a service known as the Moselweinbahn (‚ÄúMosel wine line‚Äù), designated as regional rail line 94. The name has no historical basis, but is a neologism of Deutsche Bahn. Location Hangviadukt near P√ºnderich with trans regio diesel multiple unit. The 10.5-kilometre-long line is located in Rhineland-Palatinate in the Moselle valley. It connects the tourist town of Traben-Trarbach with the InterCity railway station of Bullay and runs for its entire length in the river valley. Trains on the line leave Bullay station at first running on the Koblenz‚ÄìTrier line, running over the Alf-Bullay double-deck bridge and then through the Prinzenkopf Tunnel. After the tunnel the lines runs over the 786 metre-long P√ºnderich Hangviadukt (a viaduct built on a slope with its supports much longer on the downhill side), the longest in Germany. The branch line starts at P√ºnderich station, which never had significant passenger traffic due to its very remote location and has been long closed for passengers. The branch line is single track and not electrified. After 1.5 km the line reaches Reil station. At the 6.8 km point is K√∂venig station, where in the summer months, a passenger ferry runs to Enkirch on the opposite bank. The old terminus at Traben-Trarbach was at the former end of the track at 10.6 km from P√ºnderich. This station has been replaced by a new station a couple of hundred metres short of it. The site of the former station is now a bus station. History  Following the opening of the Koblenz‚ÄìTrier railway was in 1879, all of the Moselle valley south of Bullay, where the line leaves the valley, still had no direct rail connection. A branch line was considered to connect Traben and Trarbach‚Äîwhich were still separate communities‚Äîto the main line. In 1880, a concession was grant to build the line, which was opened on 21 March 1883. In the 1980s the line had declining numbers of passengers and was considered for closure. At that time, it was operated almost entirely with obsolete railcars of class 795 and 798. The downward trend was only stopped with the introduction of an hourly service and the use of new vehicles‚Äîdiesel multiple unit of class VT 628.2 and 628.4, and temporarily double-decker rail cars of the class 670.0. Passenger numbers then increased significantly. The terminal station in Traben-Trarbach with its many freight tracks was closed many years ago, after the rationalisation of freight transport, and replaced by a new station two hundred metres to the north. In its place there is now a large bus station and a shopping centre. Current situation  Regionalbahn service of trans regio to Traben-Trarbach in Bullay station Most of the passengers of the line are now tourists, hikers and cyclists. The carriage of commuters and students play a minor role. The line is now served by Regionalbahn service RB 94 at hourly intervals operated by Rhenus Veniro with Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 rail cars. Freight traffic was never of great importance and it was closed many years ago. It consisted mainly of general freight, wine (in tank cars) and agricultural products and supplies to and from the depot of the Raiffeisen cooperative. Future  It was planned to electrify the line and to create a continuous Regional-Express connection to Koblenz from 2015. The plans were later scrapped.

It is designated one of the Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan. The art is traditionally centered on the city of Suzuka in Mie Prefecture. This is good for making a certain shape or picture within your project. It is different from Ise washi though both are made in Mie Prefecture. Description Multiple layers of thin washi paper are bonded with a glue extracted from persimmon, which makes a strong flexible brown coloured paper. The designs can be extremely intricate, and consequently fragile. Nowadays the stencils are sometimes sold as artwork, attached to hand fans, or used to decorate screens and doors in Japanese rooms. For kimono printing the stencils are stabilized by attaching them to a fine silk net. In past times, human hair was used instead of silk, but silk is less likely to warp and can be finer. Technique D≈çgu-bori, tools used for cutting the stencils Three sheets of or Japanese paper are pasted together with , tannin- rich persimmon juice. The pattern is excised using a variety of tools known as . Four principal cutting techniques are used: # Pulling the knife towards the artist, which results in long straight cuts. # Carving patterns, which allows for figurative designs. # Cutting circular holes, often in fan-like designs # Using shaped punches. The stencils are then used for resist dyeing. Rice paste is passed through the stencil onto silk. When dyed, the color does not adhere to the areas with rice paste. By multiple alignments of the stencil, large areas can be patterned. This technique was developed in France as Silk screen printing. The stencil is not generally used for more than one kimono, though multiple stencils can be cut at the same time. History Motiv with umbrellas, water and pine needle clusters (late 19th century): mulberry paper, persimmon-juice lacquer, silk thread The use of stencils was known by the Nara period, as is evident from objects in the . Later paper stencils developed alongside the kimono. It is known as Ise-katagami since towns in Ise Province, now Mie Prefecture, were historic centres of the craft. Production is now primarily localised around the town of Suzuka. Conservation Former practitioners (1883-1968), (1907-1973), (1894-1976), (1902-1985), (1909-1992), and (1917-2003) were recognized as . The was founded in 1992.

A plan announced in 1981 to use the Fujimae tidal flat as a waste disposal site was finally abandoned after a long campaign in 1999. Due to greater awareness of their function, there are now moves to return reclaimed flats to their original state. Birds The great cormorant, eastern spot- billed duck, and osprey are common throughout the year. The flat is also visited by a number of migratory birds, including the Eurasian curlew, bar- tailed godwit, dunlin, grey plover, northern pintail, little tern, and greater scaup. Some 172 bird species have been observed in the area in recent years. Eleven thousand shorebirds and a total of thirty-one thousand waterbirds were recorded in March 2000.

Keri has long been situated by important sea routes. Therefore, in 1719 a lighthouse was erected there on the order of Peter the Great. The present lighthouse was built in 1803. During a well drilling in 1902 natural gas was discovered. From 1906 to 1912 the gas was used to power the lighthouse and heat the other buildings on the island. During that time it was the only lighthouse in the world to be powered by natural gas. In 1912 after a seismic impulse the gas flow stopped. The island has been inhabited only by the families of the lighthouse keepers. The last keeper left the island in September 2002. Since then the lighthouse operates automatically; the power is derived from a wind turbine and solar panels. On June 14, 1940 the Finnish civilian airplane Kaleva was shot down by two Soviet Ilyushin DB-3 bombers near the island. On June 14, 1993 a monument to commemorate the 9 victims was erected on Keri.

History The park was founded in 1963, under the Curraghs Acquisition Act 1963 (an Act of Tynwald). The Isle of Man Government purchased about of land to be divided between as a reserve and as a wildlife park. The park was formally opened by the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Ronald Garvey on 23 July 1965.An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Isle of Man by David T. Webber Revised by Frank Cowin and F.J. Radcliffe page 46 (1997) The Manx Experience It contains about 100 primarily wetland species from around the world in walk-through enclosures.Wildlife park located next to the Ballaugh Curraghs of the park remains undeveloped and displays a variety of habitats such as bogs, Molinia grasslands, open water peat diggings, birch woodland and hay meadows. Nature trails run through this area with signage describing the ecology and history, comprising a nature trail, tree top trail and butterfly trail. In 2005, as part of the park's 40th- anniversary celebrations, it was host to the annual meeting of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA). In 2009 the park received the Small Collection award for \\"Best Education Project with schools\\" from BIAZA at a ceremony held at Knowsley Hall, Merseyside, in recognition of the park's work in education.Curraghs Wildlife Park Honoured in 2009 Biaza Awards The Curragh is designated as a \\"wetland site of international importance\\" under the Convention for Wetlands of International Significance, known as the Ramsar Convention.

He is an internationally acknowledged expert in quantum mechanics and in the foundation and interpretation of this discipline. His main interests in quantum information led him to focus his further research on the way in which biological and cognitive systems deal with information. He is also active in the field of the dialogue between science, philosophy and theology, and has been the Vice-Director of the international conference on Biological Evolution: Facts and Theories, held at the Pontifical Gregorian University on March 2009. Academics Auletta graduated from the Sapienza University of Rome where he took his PhD and completed his post-doctoral research work. He is an Aggregate Professor at the Pontifical Gregorian University where, from 2003 to 2012, held the position of Scientific Director of the Specialization in Science and Philosophy. He is also a Senior Researcher at the University of Cassino (Italy). From 2003 to 2010, Auletta has been the Scientific Coordinator of the STOQ Project (‚ÄúScience, Theology and the Ontological Quest‚Äù, a project under the patronage of the Pontifical Council for Culture involving seven Roman Pontifical Universities and supported by the John Templeton Foundation). Since 2009, Auletta is a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London and of the International Society for Science and Religion. Research interests and projects One of the main results of Auletta‚Äôs original research on the foundations and interpretation of quantum mechanics is the publication (together with Giorgio Parisi and Mauro Fortunato) of a handbook of Quantum Mechanics, (Cambridge University Press, 2009). Auletta has stressed that there are three basic forms of dealing with information: processing, sharing, selecting. This pathway of research eventually led him to consider quantum information as a fruitful approach for studying the way in which biological and cognitive systems deal with information at all scales. He has now published a book on Cognitive Biology, (Oxford University Press, 2011), in which an attempt is made to show the consistence of such an approach with the recent impressive achievements in life sciences, within the perspective of a thorough reflection on the current paradigm dominating biological disciplines. In particular, Auletta is interested in the relevance of notions like information control, functional equivalence class, formal constraints and top-down causation as to the organisms‚Äô capability of dealing with a challenging environment at the ontogenetic and epigenetic levels, eventually leading to the emergence of new biological functionalities at the phylogenetic level. Top-down causation mechanisms via information control may be considered as the way in which initial and random perturbations disturbing the homeostasis of an organism are subsequently framed in the organism‚Äôs network of formal constraints thus giving raise to a process of fine-tuning that ends up in an eventual stable form able to realize a new adaptive fit with certain environmental conditions and challenges. Such process of top-down fine-tuning bridging between randomicity and fitness may be at the basis of the emergence of new functionalities at the phylogenetic scale. Top-down causation via information control may also be enquired in developmental and epigenetic processes (as well as in regeneration processes) when the organism is forced to deal with unpredicted, uncontrollable and in principle noxious environmental stimuli. Finally, information control may be assumed to play a fundamental role also in the ontogenetic action of the organism on the environment (e.g. from chemotaxis up to niche construction as well as to planned actions). Accordingly, his efforts are aimed at both developing a theoretical framework and designing possible experiments and research projects based on the latter standpoints. Recently, he has published a book on the mechanization of inferences, Mechanical Logic in Three-Dimensional Space, (Pan Stanford Pub., Singapore, 2013). Here a reduction of logic to combinatorics is provided. In particular, a logical 3D space is built as a substrate of the logical algebra. Arithmetic operations on propositions allow a new logical calculus.

Like The Accidental, these stories often inhabit a domestic fictional realm, yet their approach to it is somehow the opposite of domestic realism, with all its implicit links to bourgeois, patriarchal values.

History In the years 1940-41, the demand for training machines increased steadily, especially in the semi- military pilot training program (Civilian Pilot Training, CPT). Although Taylorcraft was able to sell a larger number of the Model B to United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) as part of the program, versions with consecutive seats were considered more appropriate. So in 1940, half of all machines used for this purpose came from Piper, which the J-3 could offer with this seating arrangement. To better capture this market, Taylorcraft developed the Model D, which again took up the tandem seat layout of the earlier Taylor J-2. After the construction of 200 machines, the production was converted to the military version L-2. The first version was the DC-65, which was publicly presented in February 1941 and received the Type Approval on November 25, 1941. The standard engine was the Continental A65-8, but a Franklin 4AC-176 (DF-65) or a Lycoming O-145-B2 (DL-65) could also be installed. To identify the equipment with single or dual ignition, the letters S or D have been relocated (eg DL-65S for single-ignition and DL-65D for dual-ignition). The dimensions differed only slightly from those of the model B, only the span was reduced by about 18 cm due to the narrower cabin and the length was increased by 23 cm. Construction As with all pre-war Taylorcraft aircraft, the fuselage structure consisted of welded steel tubing, covered in fabric. Taylorcraft tried to utilise as many parts of the Model B as possible, however, this was only partially successful, as the main structural components were not interchangeable between the two patterns and the wing ribs were made of aluminum instead of wood. Because of the anticipated heavier load in the training operation, the airframe also received reinforcements. The tanks were in the wings and fed a collection tank behind the engine. The engine was enclosed in a partial cowling leaving the cylinder heads uncovered in the air flow. The machine could be flown from either seat. In the specifications of the designers John Hutmacher and Cameron Lusty was the requirement for a good all-round visibility, whereupon they lowered the upper strap of the trunk compartment (Longeron) at shoulder level of the pilot. When C.G. Taylor saw the first specimen in this form, he ordered it to be undone to restore the typical outward appearance of a Taylorcraft machine. The designers did this by placing a plywood fitting on the upper Longeron. In the later military version L-2A, this \\"turtle hump\\" was then removed and replaced by a transparent cladding.

Photo courtesy Arizona State Museum. Snaketown is an archaeological site southeast of Phoenix, Arizona that was inhabited by the Hohokam people.Martin, Paul and Plog, Fred. The Archaeology of Arizona. 1973, Pgs. 94, 146‚Äì147 Definitive dates are not clear, but the site was generally thought to be inhabited between 300 BCE and 1200 CE.http://www.nps.gov/pima/index.htm Hohokam is an O‚Äôodham word meaning ‚Äúthose who have gone.‚Äù Specifically who the Hohokam people were and when the site was inhabited is subject to debate. It was dedicated as Hohokam Pima National Monument in 1972. Snaketown is governed by the Gila River Indian Community, which chose to preserve the site by reburying it after early excavations. The Monument is not open to the public. The Hohokam People and Snaketown Snaketown in Arizona is dated by some scholars to around 300 BCE. Whether or not these were the Hohokam people is subject to debate. Martin and Plog maintain that these were the Ootam people, which was a subdivision of the Cochise Culture. According to these two, the Ootam were conquered and subsumed around 1000 CE by the Hohokam people from Mexico. Martin and Plog credit the Mexican Hohokam people with bringing extensive irrigation works, as well as other features attributed to what is thought of as Hohokam culture, from the south. Emil Haury, an established scholar on the subject, makes no mention of this apparently hostile takeover. Furthermore, he views the Hohokam as a harmonious people, particularly in the way they shared water.Haury, Emil. The Hohokam: Desert Farmers and Craftsmen. 1976, Pgs. 354‚Äì357 Archaeologist Brian Fagan dates Hohokam culture to 500 CE,Fagan, Brian. Elixir: A History of Water and Humankind. 2011, Reprinted by permission of Bloomsbury Press in Archaeology Vol. 64 Number 2. Pgs. 16, 54‚Äì58, 64 and sums up the situation by stating that there are simply two separate schools of thought on the subject.Fagan, Brian. Ancient North America. 2005, pgs. 347‚Äì351 Martin and Plog belong to the first group and Haury belongs to the second. The second group argues that these features the first group believes came from Mexico were developed locally. While there is much dispute on the origin of Snaketown, most scholars are able to agree that Hohokam culture peaked between 700 and 900 CE. Snaketown derives its name from another O‚Äôodham word meaning ‚Äúplace of snakes‚Äù and is considered to be one of the larger Hohokam settlements. A type of pottery (called red-on-buff) that is identified as distinctly Hohokam is found over ca. of the southwest. This indicates the extent and prominence of the Hohokam people at their height. Archaeology of Snaketown View of Snaketown site, 2008 The site of Snaketown is positioned on The Gila River and the community is estimated to have been 250 acres in size at its maximum extent, with much more farmland and smaller settlements surrounding it. It has been estimated that in the Hohokam era, canals were built in this area up to seven miles (11 km) long, providing water for 70,000 acres of land. The size of the canals indicates that Snaketown probably formed a type of weak chiefdom, however some feel that the canals do not indicate this type of social complexity.Snow, Dean R. Archaeology of Native North America. Boston: Prentice Hall, 2010. Print. Snaketown at its height contained between 1000 and 3000 people. The household was most likely the fundamental building block of Hohokam society. The water was thought to have been owned by the entire community, but families probably maintained the rights to plots of land. People who aided in the building of the canals may have received first pick of the land. The more affluent would own larger plots of land and were therefore rationed larger portions of water to maintain them. Housing of Hohokam people varies according to status, time and sources. It is generally agreed that simple adobe structures and impermanent housing were used depending upon the time of the year. Small dams were placed systematically to control the intensity of the river flow. Snaketown also included a central plaza and two installations, that were identified as ballcourts at the time of excavation since its earliest times, but did not always include irrigation. In its earliest stage it most likely resembled other agrarian cultures of the time. As irrigation grew, the Hohokam people continued to prosper. They began to grow new crops such as agave and tobacco, and although maize farmers, they most likely subsidized their diet with small amounts of hunting and gathering. As Snaketown grew in size between 975 and 1150 CE, an additional ball court was built. Some scholars believe the ball courts may have promoted trade or competition between communities or segments of communities. A number of status symbols and trading pieces were found at Snaketown, indicating the Hohokam‚Äôs affinity for trading. These pieces included shell, stone, and macaw feathers. Trash heaps played just as crucial of a role as trading pieces in the archaeology of Snaketown. Many of the trash heaps helped archaeologists develop the chronology of the site. The oval shaped fields at Snaketown were originally identified as ballcourts. Each was about 60 meters long, 33 meters apart, and 2.5 meters high. In 2009 it was suggested that the shape of an oval bowl with curved sides and the uneven embankments on the long sides are unsuited for any kind of ball game. On the other hand, they correspond perfectly with dance floors of the Papagos, used for their Vikita ceremonies until at least the 1930s.Edwin N. Ferdon, jr.: The Hohokam \\"Ball Court\\" ‚Äì An Alternative View of its Function. In: KIVA, Vol 75, No. 2, Winter 2009, , pp. 165‚Äì178 Snaketown houses were shallow pit houses. There were hearths, small clay lined basins near the doorways. These houses were home to small groups of extended families Archaeologists and Snaketown Winifred and Harold Gladwin began the intensive study of Hohokam culture with the help of Emil Haury. They eventually founded a research organization entitled ‚ÄúThe Gila Pueblo Archaeological Foundation‚Äù Woosely, Anne. Exploring the Hohokam. 1991, pgs. 2‚Äì3 and 153‚Äì154 that focused on the Hohokam tradition at other sites, but eventually led Haury to Snaketown, which he excavated in the early 1930s. Haury eventually returned to Snaketown in 1964 as a result of new data discovered by the works of Charles DiPeso and Albert Schroeder on Hohokam culture at other sites. This caused Haury to refine his view on Hohokam origins while also reaffirming some initial thoughts on Hohokam chronology. This was some of the latest archaeology done in Snaketown, as it was declared a National Monument in 1972 and reburied by the Pima people for preservation purposes. The records for the Gila Pueblo Archaeological Foundation are held by the Arizona State Museum Library & Archives.Arizona Archives Online: Gila Pueblo Foundation Papers 1928‚Äì1950 The abandonment of Snaketown It is not particularly clear what caused the abandonment of Snaketown around 1100 C. E. Haury cites over-irrigation leading to soil depletion as a possibility for its fall, but still contends that abandonment also occurred in nearby cultures that were less dependent on irrigation. Fagan notes that this time coincides with the Medieval Warm Period, which might have caused droughts. Fagan also suggests that the people continued farming in a much less organized manner or relocated according to remaining irrigation canals. Haury maintains that Snaketown was deserted around 1100 CE while Fagan uses the later dates of 1150‚Äì1450. Several texts maintain that its population increased until the dispersal of its population. The dispersal could have occurred quickly and violently, as the archaeological record indicates the burning of many buildings at the same time. Re-colonization and Snaketown In 1865, the United States Cavalry created Camp McDowell in the general vicinity of Snaketown. In 1867, a retired soldier began the Swilling Irrigating and Canal Company on the remains of the ancient canals. As the company succeeded, a settlement began to form, which was eventually dubbed ‚ÄúPhoenix‚Äù after the mythological Phoenix creature that is reborn from its own remains. This is the supposed origin of the state‚Äôs capital city and its name Phoenix (Arizona).

Administratively it belongs to Virtsu small borough in L√§√§neranna Parish, P√§rnu County. Puhtu is covered by a speciose old broadleaf forest. History Puhtulaid (Holm Puchten, Holm zum Pucht) was first mentioned in 1478 when it belonged to the von Uexk√ºll family. The first buildings were erected in the 18th century by the owner of Vana-Virtsu Manor, Carl Thure von Helwig. He designed Puhtu as a private resort with three Chinese-styled houses and alleys surrounded by hewn sculptures. In 1813 Carl Thure von Helwig's widow Wilhelmine von Helwig ordered a memorial stone to a family friend, world-famous German poet Friedrich Schiller (1759‚Äì1805). It's reputedly the earliest extant monument to Schiller in the world. During the World War II the monument was heavily damaged but was restored by Paul Horma in 1958. In 1857 a cattle manor building (now known as the Count's House) and a stable were built on Puhtu, both are extant today. In the 19th century the island was connected to the continent by building a road with a bridge to Virtsu. During the World War I Puhtu was used as a seaplane base by Russians. The soldiers and officers lived in the Puhtulaid's summerhouses. While retreating, all the summerhouses were demolished and the von Helwig family graves were plundered. Puhtu was acquired by the professor of University of Hamburg biologist Jakob von Uexk√ºll in 1927. 1929‚Äì1939 he spent nearly every summer some time in Puhtu. In the 1930s he built a new summerhouse on the southern end of the peninsula. In 1934 Jakob von Uexk√ºll invited Count Alexander Keyserlingk, an amateur ornithologist as the guardian of Puhtu; he lived there until 1939. In 1939 Puhtulaid and Adralaiud were taken under natural protection After the World War II Puhtu was given to Tartu State University but shortly after that to Estonian Academy of Sciences. The latter opened an ornithological station headed by Eerik Kumari on Puhtu. Besides the main building (Baron's House, summerhouse built by Jakob von Uexk√ºll in the 1930s) the station consists of a laboratory and a birdwatching tower (built in the 1960s) and a guardian house (Count's House, the cattle manor building from 1857, used by Alexander Keyserlingk). Since 1995 Puhtu belongs to the Matsalu National Park and from 1997 the station operates under the Estonian University of Life Sciences.

Origins Barry Popik of the American Dialect Society found an example from 1940, as well as this from the sports section of the San Francisco Examiner of 8 February 1942: ‚ÄúAnswer these questions correctly and your name is Flynn, meaning you‚Äôre in, provided you have two left feet and the written consent of your parents‚Äù. To judge from a newspaper reference he turned up from early 1943, the phrase could by then also be shortened to I'm Flynn, meaning ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in‚Äù. In later years, the rhyming phrase became associated with actor Errol Flynn, who had a reputation for womanizing, consumption of alcohol, and brawling. In November 1942, two under- age girls, Betty Hansen and Peggy Satterlee, accused him of statutory rape. A group was organized to support Flynn, named the American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn (ABCDEF); its members included William F. Buckley Jr. The trial took place in January and February 1943, and Flynn was cleared of the charges. According to etymologist Michael Quinion, the incident served to increase Flynn's reputation as a ladies' man, which influenced the connotations of the phrase \\"in like Flynn\\". Columnist Cecil Adams also examined the term's origins and its relationship to Flynn. Many early sources, attesting the phrase, say it emerged as war slang during World War II. In addition to the Errol Flynn association, etymologist Eric Partridge presents evidence that it refers to Edward J. Flynn, a New York City political boss who became a campaign manager for the Democratic party during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency. Boss Flynn's \\"Democratic Party machine exercised absolute political control over the Bronx.... The candidates he backed were almost automatically 'in'.\\" Quinion also notes that the title of the film In Like Flint (1967) is a play on the term, and that has led to a malapropism where some speakers believe that is the original phrase.

He is most recently notable as the head of the Alpha course in the US, an introduction to Christianity supported by multi- denominational churches in over 169 countries. Early life A top athlete in his youth, Long achieved notable success as a middle-distance runner and was captain of the team that had Olympic runner Sebastian Coe. He demonstrated an early aptitude for business, launching a successful commercial venture while still a college student. Career Once he was embarked on a career, Long agreed to serve as a pastor at a North London church, where he remained for 22 years (during this time he was also Chairman of Christians in Finance, founded in 1875). Over the same period, Long achieved notable success in the world of business, becoming a senior executive at HSBC Plc, one of the world's largest banks, and Europe's largest bank. His banking career took him around the world and included some significant roles including Director of the Year 2000 Program (Millennium Bug) for the UK and Europe. In 2001 he was moved to New York to launch a global product and then he was moved to Chicago to lead the integration of HSBC and Household International, following the latter's $13.8 billion purchase in 2003. He appeared on TV and in major newspapers both as an advisor on the Millennium Bug (Y2K) and as a Christian living for Jesus Christ in the City of London. In 2006, Long decided to leave his banking career to join Alpha USA. Where he was the CEO for seven years, helping the industry grow over 300%. He resigned in 2014 due to his daughter drowning. The Washington Post describes Long as a \\"former banking executive\\" as one of the \\"stars of the church-saving circuit,\\" and Alpha as a \\"church-saving business\\" that \\"sells course materials designed to boost church membership.\\"  The Breakthrough  In October 2010 Alpha USA released Long's first book, The Breakthrough. Developed in cooperation with business expert and author Ken Blanchard, The Breakthrough is a modern-day parable. Taking a page from \\"business-allegory\\" works such as Blanchard's One-Minute Manager, Long uses a simple story to communicate basic concepts about God, religion, suffering and the afterlife. He is now working on his second book which topic will focus on loss and grief, through his own personal experience, and how Christ-followers can understand and overcome it. Personal life Long lives with his wife, Jeannie, in Malibu, California. He has lost two children to unexpected tragedies. Long's daughter, Rebecca, also worked for Alpha USA as the National Director of Youth; she drowned at age 32 in Lake Michigan in May 2014. His youngest son, Alex, took his own life at age 17 in 2005. Long's surviving son, Ben, works in the City of London.

The theater is the last remaining historic theater in the city. The legendary building has a rich history of notable performances, and is being restored by a local nonprofit organization. History The original structure that would become the home of the Ritz Theater was constructed in 1883 at 107 Broadway in Newburgh, New York. ‚ÄúThe address had been the site of other ventures that offered some of life‚Äôs small luxuries: George Barnes‚Äô plumbing business ... a cigar factory ... and even a champagne factory.‚ÄùMcTamaney, Mary. ‚ÄúFrom Cohen‚Äôs Opera House to the Ritz Theater.‚Äù Mid Hudson Times 3 February 2010, print. 1900s In 1913, the intended manufacturing building was purchased by George Cohen, ‚Äúa Poughkeepsie entrepreneur,‚Äù and was named Cohen‚Äôs Opera House. The opera house opened on February 4, 1913. The opera house welcomed performers of all arts: jugglers, singers, dance troupes, theater companies, etc. The East- West Theater Company became a part of the theater and changed the theater‚Äôs name from Cohen‚Äôs Opera House to the State Theater in 1926. The State Theater was a major participant in the vaudeville theatrical genre that was extremely popular at the time. In 1933 Eugene Levy purchased the theater from George Cohen and ‚Äúconverted that playhouse of a gaudier era into an institution where cinematic and variety productions of the highest standard [were] presented with amazing skill, and affording the fascinated beholder the ultimate in comfort and convenience.‚ÄùThe November News, November 28, 1933 This would begin a new era for the Ritz Theater, which became a frequent stomping ground of many big name stars such as: Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Prima, Mary Martin, Peggy Lee, Wood Herman, Dick Powell, Bill ‚ÄúBojangles‚Äù Robinson, Eddy Duchin, Red Skelton, Xavier Cugat, The Inkspots, Vaughn Monroe, Montana Slim, Les Brown, Ricardo Crotez, and many more. On November 3, 1940, Frank Sinatra, an unknown singer at the time, stepped onto the Ritz Theater‚Äôs stage. The band of Tommy Dorsey backed Sinatra who captivated the Newburgh audience.Cronin, Kristen. ‚ÄúRestoration: History.‚Äù Ritz Theater. N.p., 12/13/2010. Web. 28 Mar 2011. The Ritz Theater is most notably famous for being the stage where Lucille Ball made her stage debut. ‚ÄúOn December 17th, 1941 she performed for the first time on stage and for the first time with her new husband, Desi Arnaz. It was on the Ritz stage that they planted the seeds for their sitcom, I Love Lucy.‚Äù Shows were brought to the Ritz Theater by New York City‚Äôs Paramount Theater to test their acts on the Newburgh audience before opening in New York City. Although the Ritz Theater continued to show movies, in the 1960s both the City of Newburgh and its once highly popular street of Broadway entered a slow decline that affected the theater as well as the city. The popular city of Newburgh was no longer as frequented as it once was as the ferry closed, and I-84 as well as the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge by-passed the downtown area of Newburgh. In October 1969, the Ritz Theater was closed, and the theater became a movie house containing two cinemas. Cinemas one and two were carved into the house and the stage was closed and walled off from the rest of the structure. In 1981 both of the cinemas were shut down after ‚Äúvandals damaged $15,000 worth of seating improvements inside the theater‚Äù and the owner of cinemas One and Two, Abram and Eva Levinson, ‚Äúquit Newburgh ... quietly closing up shop.‚ÄùUnknown. ‚ÄúTheater Closes its Doors.‚Äù Saturday Record 10/24/1981, Print. In February 1999, the movie theater was reopened by a former owner; however, the theater was quickly closed again for good in June of the same year due to lack of business. Throughout this span of seventeen weeks in business, the theater only had 700 customers. 2000s In 2002, the Ritz Theater was purchased by Patricia Haggerty-Wenz, Founder and Executive Director of Safe Harbors of the Hudson, which is a ‚Äúnonprofit organization that is committed to transforming lives and building communities through housing and the arts in the City of Newburgh.‚Äù The organization stumbled upon the theater in the process of restoring the adjacent former Hotel Newburgh, which is now the Cornerstone Residence, a supportive-housing facility. Haggerty-Wenz's mission for the only remaining historic theater in the City of Newburgh, is to ‚Äúprovide a venue for live performances in a city that has none, educational programs for our youth, employment opportunities for our community and to create an active cultural and tourist destination.‚ÄùHaggerty-Wenz, Patricia. ‚ÄúRitz Theater-Newburgh, Inc. project proposal.‚Äù Message to The Anneberg Foundation Radnor Financial Center. 02/10/2009. E-mail. This combination project, according to Haggerty-Wenz, is ‚Äúthe only one in the country that combines the restoration of a historic theater with a supportive housing project, all under one roof.‚Äù With Haggerty-Wenz and Safe Harbors of the Hudson being the new owner of the establishment, the renovation of the Ritz Theater Lobby began. The renovation of the supportive housing project called the Cornerstone Residence adjacent to the theater occurred from 2004-2006. The Cornerstone Residence consists of 128 apartments; 116 are supportive housing units and twelve are artist lofts. The apartments house a mixed tenancy of single adults, including formerly homeless, veterans, those living with a mental health diagnosis and/or physical disability, artists and other adults who need safe, attractive affordable housing. In 2008, Safe Harbors of the Hudson created a nonprofit organization called Ritz Theater-Newburgh, Inc. The mission of this particular nonprofit organization was to focus exclusively on the restoration of the Ritz Theater. A new era bloomed within the theater. It began hosting live performances in the newly restored lobby from award-winning musicians such as: Levi Kreiss, Pete Seeger and Odair Assad. The performances were part of the Tom Humphrey Guitar series. In 2009, Ritz Theater-Newburgh, Inc. continued providing programming and performances in the restored lobby from artists such as: Bucky Pizzarelli, Arturo O‚ÄôFarrill, The Michele Ramo Group, Jesse Lege, and many others. As well as providing performances in the lobby, the organization also focused on raising funds to restore the original theater to what it was. In July of the same year, Congressman Maurice Hinchey secured a federal appropriations bill which included ‚Äú400,000 to begin renovating the Ritz Theater, the last remaining historic theater in Newburgh.‚Äù In 2010, the Tom Humphrey Guitar Series continued to perform featuring artists such as: Larry Coryell, Maria Zemantauski and Duke Robillard. In October and November, Cindy Cashdollar and Frederic Hand performed and the second annual RitzKidz ‚ÄúNewburgh‚Äôs Got Talent‚Äù Talent Show was held. In February of the same year, the Ritz Theater secured 200,000 dollars in funding from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal‚Äôs Urban Initiatives Program. This funding was directed towards the building of a box office. Future The completion of the reconstruction of the Ritz Theater is scheduled for 2014. After the theater is finished, it will hold 825 people. There are a few nonprofit performing arts organizations who hope to make the newly renovated Ritz Theater their home; such as: ‚ÄúThe Greater Newburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Opera Company of the Highlands and the Newburgh Performing Arts Academy‚Äù (Ritz Theater Tour).

Upon his return to Canada, his extensive pioneering activities as an aviator/geologist earned him enshrinement in the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame.  Early life and infantry service  Harold Anthony Oaks was born in Hespeler, Canada, and reared in Preston, Ontario. At 18 years of age, he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force for service in World War I. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1917.  World War I aerial service By May 1918, Oaks had been trained and was posted to 48 Squadron as a Bristol F.2 Fighter pilot. He scored his first two aerial victories on 21 May 1918, in two separate combats. At 1815 hours, he drove a German Fokker Triplane down out of control over Carnoy, France. At 1853, he destroyed a second Triplane a mile north of Mericourt. On 10 June, he joined Frank Ransley, Charles Steele, and John Drummond in burning an Albatros D.V fighter in midair over Roye. On 25 June, he drove down a Fokker D.VII out of control. He won twice in separate combats on 2 July 1918; he destroyed one Pfalz D.III over Foucaucourt, and another over Soyecourt. The new ace scored a double victory on 24 July, sending down two Fokker D.VIIs down out of control. On 3 August, he was credited with the capture of an Albatros reconnaissance machine at Aveluy, France. He completed his victory list with a double win on 5 September 1918, when he burned a Fokker D.VII and drove another down out of battle. Oaks' final tally included two shared wins in the destruction of enemy planes, three others destroyed singlehanded, an opposing plane captured, and five others driven down out of control. Post World War I When the war was over, Oaks gave up his commission on completion of service on 7 February, retaining the rank of captain. He transferred to the unemployed list of the Royal Air Force on 15 April 1919. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 3 June 1919 by King George V. He returned home to Canada and returned to school. He graduated in 1922 from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Science degree as a mining engineer. He began using airplanes as an aid to prospecting in Quebec and northern Ontario. He invented the portable nose hangar for bush pilot use in 1926. He also founded Patricia Airways (along with G. A. Thompson) in 1926 while becoming manager and sole pilot of a newly formed Western Canada Airways in December. In 1927, he was the initial winner of the McKee Trophy for service to aviation. In 1929, he (and Pat Reid) made the first midwinter flight to Hudson Bay. He was also involved in formation of several airlines, including Oaks Airways Ltd.

The album contains both original compositions and covers and was recorded by Harvey over the course of three months in Grace Lane Studio, and later in Atlantis Sound Recording Studios, both in his native Melbourne and The Instrument Studio in London, England. The album received positive reviews upon its release, with Pitchfork Media describing its material as \\"cutting like saws through the songs' solid underlying texture,\\" however despite critical acclaim, Two of Diamonds failed to chart internationally. The album has sold under 100,000 copies worldwide. Background In 2005, Mick Harvey's solo studio album, One Man's Treasure, received very positive critical acclaim and was followed by a successful tour in its promotion. Accompanied by his solo band, featuring Rosie Westbrook on double bass and fellow Bad Seeds' James Johnston on organ and guitar and Thomas Wydler on drums, Harvey began plans for his follow-up album. Harvey reflected on the plans, saying that \\"with [One Man's Treasure], I thought I'd see how comfortable it felt and if I liked what was going on [...] I enjoyed it and the live shows have become really strong over time. I didn't want One Man's Treasure to be a one off. I thought that if I did one record, I'd do a few. To make it something I was going to be doing for a while, for five years or so, to be something I'd follow through with and make substantial. The thing with any undertaking like this is that you grow into it. With the first album I was feeling my way somewhat and now I'm feeling more comfortable in this role. With the songs I'm just trying to find a point of view in there to convey ideas and feelings... elemental stuff.\\" Recording Two of Diamonds was recorded over the course of three months in late 2006 at three various locations throughout Australia and the United Kingdom. The initial recording sessions; recorded at Harvey's own recording facility, Grace Lane Studio, in Melbourne; featured double bassist Rosie Westbrook and resulted in rough versions of three of the album's songs: \\"Little Star,\\" \\"Blue Arrows\\" and \\"Slow-Motion-Movie-Star.\\" This session was produced and engineered solely by Harvey. A second recording session was held at The Instrument Studio, stylised as Instrument [studio], on 18 October. \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Everything is Fixed\\" were recorded with Rob Ellis, who produced albums for PJ Harvey with Harvey, Westbrook and former Bad Seed James Johnston. This session was produced and engineered by Kevin Paul. The final recording sessions for the album were held at Atlantis Sound Recording Studios over the course of two days in winter 2006. On 23 November, \\"Here I Am,\\" \\"Sad Dark Eyes,\\" \\"I Don't Want You on My Mind\\", \\"A Walk on the Wild Side,\\" and \\"Out of Time Man\\" were recorded and featured former Bad Seed Thomas Wydler on drums, also adding overdubs to \\"Photograph\\" from the sessions in London. On 30 December, the final two songs to be recorded were \\"No Doubt\\" and \\"Home is Far From Here.\\" These sessions resulted in the bulk of the material featured on the album and were produced and engineered by David McCluney. Following the final recording sessions, McCluney mixed the final version of the album at Atlantis Sound on 1, 3 and 5 January 2007. Wez Prictor (credited as Wez Prichter) was also assigned to master the album and receiving McCluney's final mixes, mastered the final version at The Finishing Post in Melbourne later that month. Composition The album consists of an eclectic collection of songs which Harvey had chosen \\"to interoperate in his own distinctive and emotive style.\\" Of the album's twelve tracks, two are original Harvey compositions (\\"Blue Arrows\\", \\"Little Star\\"). Alike One Man's Treasure, Harvey's originals are combined with \\"more obscure classics, sometimes stemming from the pens of well known enigmatic songwriters.\\" Harvey has stated this his reasons for choosing such numbers for inclusion on the album was due to a profound personal connection with the songs. Some of the songs' lyrics refer directly to Harvey's past and the Australian musicians that have inspired him. \\"If I'm digging around, looking for material to use, that's very often where I'll find things that I'm interested in doing something with,\\" said Harvey. \\"There is a lot of stuff there that is usable, because it's so unknown outside of Australia.\\" \\"Sad Dark Eyes\\" was originally recorded by an Australian group from the mid-1960s, The Loved Ones. The song had previously been covered by Harvey when he was a member of The Birthday Party. \\"Photograph\\" is a song by Chris Bailey, of Brisbane-based punk band The Saints. The song was featured on their 1984 studio album, A Little Madness to Be Free. Bailey previously collaborated with Harvey whilst he was still in The Bad Seeds, Bailey was featured on backing vocals on the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds single, \\"Bring It On\\", released in 2003 from Nocturama. \\"Everything Is Fixed\\" is from unreleased demo recordings by David McComb, formerly of the 1980s Australian band The Triffids. Harvey performs McComb's tale of a date \\"with pre destination in the jailhouse while sensitively backed every step of the way\\" James Cruickshank of The Cruel Sea is also seen as one of Harvey's influences, with his song \\"No Doubt\\", a song featured on Cruickshank's Hymn For Her, being an \\"ode to newfound love\\" \\"Home is Far From Here\\" references Crime and the City Solution, a band he formed in the mid-1980s and with whom he recorded six albums until the group disbanded in 1991. This song was previously featured on the album Shine. However, songs by non-Australian artists are also featured on Two of Diamonds. \\"Slow-Motion-Movie-Star\\" is a song written by Harvey's friend PJ Harvey and an outtake from her 2001 album, Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea. \\"I Don't Want You on My Mind\\" was written by soul musician Bill Withers and \\"Here I Am\\" by Emmylou Harris. \\"Walk on the Wildside\\" was originally composed for the 1962 feature film adaptation of Nelson Algren's novel by Elmer Bernstein, with lyrics by Mack David, and performed by Brook Benton. \\"That's where the personal history comes in because it's always been an enormous frustration to me that the song is not on the soundtrack album,\\" said Harvey. \\"I had to watch the film again to figure out the song. And then I added some lyrics. I think with every one of these songs on Two Of Diamonds, although there is probably an exception, I've added lyrics or changed lyrics. That's part of the process for me. I'm not really a 'cover versions man', where you do it all dutifully and perform an exact rendition. When I get to a part of a song that I don't think is right for me, I'll change it. You have to make it YOUR version. It also relates to the way old folk and blues songs used to evolve over time and would have different verses added or lost through the years. I‚Äôd like to think my approach is part of that tradition.\\" Packaging The cover art arranges the track listing in card suits. Unlike Harvey's previous albums, Two of Diamonds does not feature a portrait of Harvey. The album cover features a selection of playing cards, including a joker, various suits of kings, queens and jacks and centred is the eponymous two of diamonds. There were three design personnel assigned to design the cover for the album; Katy Beale, Marina Lutz and Harry Howard. Beale conceived the idea for, and designed, the front and back cover artwork while Lutz was head of image processing. Howard designed the final layout of the packaging. The back cover art arranges the album's track list in suits. Release The album was released on 23 April 2007 and was issued on CD, Digipak and vinyl on Mute Records. Later versions were pressed in Europe by EMI and released in July 2007. Upon its initial release, Harvey toured throughout Europe to promote Two of Diamonds and included dates at All Tomorrow's Parties (ATP) in Somerset alongside Cat Power, Yann Tiersen and also performed with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and on his tour with The Ritchie Success in Prague, Czech Republic on 10 May and 27 May at Bush Hall in London, United Kingdom. Due to recording sessions for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' studio album Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!, Harvey's tour was limited to only a number of dates. The song \\"Out of Time Man\\" gained more popularity when it appeared in the Pilot of Breaking Bad one year later. Reception Critical reception to Two of Diamonds was positive. Pitchfork Media described the album's material as \\"cutting like saws through the songs solid underlying texture,\\" and praised his original compositions as the stand-out songs of the album. ARTISTdirect were critical of the abundance of cover songs but stated that \\"Harvey possesses considerable skill as an interpreter and collaborator.\\" Thom Jurek of Allmusic praised the mix of covers and origins, which he believed were mixed \\"strategically.\\" He also praised the original compositions describing them as \\"among the finest songs Harvey's ever written\\" and the overall album as \\"sadly beautiful [...] and imprinted in the heart.\\" Stylus Magazine summarized the album as \\"rich, textured, melancholy, and full of space\\" but like all reviews, focused on the inclusion of covers and originals; \\"his own originals are well crafted, sliding seamlessly into the proceedings, but the real triumph for Harvey is the fact that it all sounds like Mick Harvey, regardless of origin.\\" Other sundry reviews noted Harvey's vocal abilities as \\"resonates beautifully in the arrangements that unfold meticulously and cinematically.\\" Track listing All songs written by Mick Harvey unless otherwise noted.

The book focuses on the medieval Franco-Flemish War and the Battle of the Golden Spurs of 1302 in particular. It is written in Conscience's typical stylistic romanticism and has been described as the \\"Flemish national epic\\". Unusually for its time, The Lion of Flanders was written in Dutch and it is considered one of the founding texts of Flemish literature. It became a significant work for the emerging Flemish Movement, reviving popular interest in the Battle of the Golden Spurs and Flemish Medieval history as part of a modern political agenda. Despite its importance, the work has become little-read. It has nonetheless be the subject of numerous adaptations, including several cartoons and a film.  Background  Portrait of Hendrik Conscience as a young man Hendrik Conscience was born in Antwerp, then under French rule, in 1812 into a mixed French-Flemish family. He was brought up bilingual, speaking both French and Dutch. After briefly working as a teacher, he participated in the Belgian Revolution in 1830 and was inspired by the contemporary ideology of romantic nationalism. He served in the Belgian Army during the Ten Days' Campaign of 1831 but was demobilised in 1836 and moved to the impoverished Kempen region near the Dutch border where he began to pursue a literary career. Conscience worked in the new genre of historical fiction which had emerged in Europe around 1800. His early writing combined his interests in the language and history of Flanders with literary romanticism. His first book, In 't Wonderjaer (In the Year of Wonder) was published in 1837 and explored both themes. It was the first work of historical fiction yet published in Dutch and was set during the Beeldenstorm of 1566 and the revolt by Calvinists of the Spanish Netherlands against Catholic rule. Conscience was only able to publish the work with the support of friends, including King Leopold I. Though relatively successful, the work made him little money and Conscience began work on a new book. The innovative dimension of Conscience's work was his use of Dutch language in his writing. At the time, Belgian and Western European high culture was dominated by French which was also the established language of the upper classes and state bureaucracy across the country. Though Dutch dialects were commonly spoken in Flanders as a vernacular, their use was considered vulgar by the bourgeoisie and inappropriate in literature. Conscience, however, believed that Dutch provided a more authentic form of expression and preferred to use it, making his works unusual at the time.  Novel  De Slag der Gulden Sporen (1836) by Nicaise de Keyser may have served as an inspiration for the book In 1838, Conscience published his second book, entitled De Leeuw van Vlaenderen, of de Slag der Gulden Sporen (The Lion of Flanders, or the Battle of the Golden Spurs). The book was set in Medieval Flanders and focused on the Franco-Flemish War (1297‚Äì1305). Its centerpiece was the Battle of Kortrik of 1302, commonly known as the Battle of the Golden Spurs (Guldensporenslag), in which a small Flemish force, made up of local militia, unexpectedly defeated a superior invading force from the Kingdom of France. In choosing the topic, Conscience may have been inspired by a romantic painting of the battle by the Flemish artist Nicaise de Keyser, unveiled in 1836. Conscience's work approaches the subject through the romance between Machteld, daughter of Robert III, Count of Flanders (the eponymous \\"Lion of Flanders\\"), and the knight Adolf van Nieuwlandt. The book famously concludes with a direct injunction to the reader: In his foreword to the 1838 edition, Conscience explicitly stated that he intended his book to raise Flemish national consciousness and patriotism. Conscience researched the historical events by reading contemporary chronicles and his narrative frequently diverged from historical fact, contributed to the mythelogisation of the events as clash between the Flemish and French-speaking invaders.  Reception  The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica describes De Leeuw as a \\"passionate epic\\" and compares it to the historical fiction of the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832). With the immense success of the De Leeuw van Vlaanderen Conscience was widely credited as the man \\"who taught his people to read\\" (leerde zijn volk lezen) in popular culture. The work's public success confirmed Conscience's reputation as the leading Flemish novelist of his generation. By the time of his death in 1883, he had written around 100 novels and novellas. The Groeninge Monument (1906) in Kortrijk commemorates the Battle of the Golden Spurs, popularised by Conscience The publication of The Lion coincided with the emergence of the Flemish Movement which supported an increasingly assertive Flemish political identity. Conscience himself believed that Flemish and Belgian patriotisms were complementary and was himself a Belgian nationalist. Howeever, as a celebration of Dutch language and Flemish history the Lion became popular among flamingants and contributed to the increasing importance of the Battle of the Golden Spurs in Flemish political memory. The battle itself had been largely forgotten before Conscience's work but was revived in popular culture and local identity. Among other things, it inspired the flag of Flanders and the anthem \\"De Vlaamse Leeuw\\" (1847) by Hippoliet Van Peene. Today an annual holiday is held on the battle's anniversary in Flanders. It has been noted, however, that the increased status of the work in Flemish nationalist consciousness also coincided with a decreasing readership.  Adaptations  The Lion of Flanders has been the subject of various adaptations. At least nine comic strip adaptations have been produced; the most celebrated was by Bob De Moor and was serialised in Tintin after 1949 and published as a single volume in 1952. It was acclaimed as one of his best works. Also notable is Karel Biddeloo's loose adaptation of the work in 1984 within the De Rode Ridder series, inspired by surrealism. The work was also adapted into a film in 1984, directed by the celebrated Flemish writer Hugo Claus, to commemorate the anniversary of Conscience's death. The film was itself adapted into a television series by Claus in 1985. The work was a co-production between various private and state groups in Belgium and the Netherlands and, at 80 million Belgian francs, was the most expensive film produced in the Low Countries to date. As director, Claus attempted to stick as closely to the original text as possible. The film was a commercial and critical disaster, criticised for excessive romanticism and a Flemish- nationalist political agenda.

Levendusky (born 1979) is an American political scientist, best known for his 2009 book The Partisan Sort: How Liberals Became Democrats and Conservatives Became Republicans. His work has primarily focused on explaining political polarization, but also includes media analyses and topics related to public opinion and American foreign policy. Levendusky is currently associate professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania. Background Levendusky was raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, later attending Pennsylvania State University, where he graduated with a degree in political science in 2001. After graduating, he entered the political science PhD program at Stanford University. He was a runner-up for a National Science Foundation grant to attend Stanford, where he obtained a Ph.D. in political science. After completing his dissertation in 2006, Levendusky spent a year as a postdoctoral research associate at Yale University in the Center for the Study of American Politics in the Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Levendusky began working at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant professor in the political science department in 2007. The Partisan Sort The Partisan Sort: How Liberals Became Democrats and Conservatives Became Republicans, is a book on the phenomenon of growing political polarization in the United States. Levendusky finds that while a small number have become more extreme over time, most contemporary Americans maintain relatively similar views to those in previous generations. What has changed is the way people sort themselves into parties. Previously, many liberals identified as Republicans and many conservatives identified as Democrats. More recently, the parties have become more ideologically pure and encouraged people to think of themselves in that way as well. Thus, voters have been \\"sorting\\" into Democrats and Republicans and eliminated much of the middle ground that existed in previous generations. Reception for the book was positive.

It is the potassium salt of the heptafluorotantalate anion [TaF7]2‚àí. This white, water-soluble solid is an intermediate in the purification of tantalum from its ores and is the precursor to the metal. Preparation=Industrial Potassium heptafluorotantalate is an intermediate in the industrial production of metallic tantalum. Its production involves leaching tantalum ores, such as columbite and tantalite, with hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid to produce the water-soluble hydrogen pentafluorotantalate. : Ta2O5 \\\\+ 14 HF ‚Üí 2 H2[TaF7] + 5 H2O This solution is subjected to a number of liquid-liquid extraction steps to remove metallic impurities (most importantly niobium) before being treated with potassium fluoride to produce K2[TaF7] : H2[TaF7] + 2 KF ‚Üí K2[TaF7] + 2 HF Lab-scale Hydrofluoric acid is both corrosive and toxic, making it unappealing to work with; as such a number of alternative processes have been developed for small-scale syntheses. Potassium heptafluorotantalate can be produced by both anhydrous and wet methods. The anhydrous method involves the reaction of tantalum oxide with potassium bifluoride or ammonium bifluoride according to the following equation:Agulyansky, A. \\"Potassium fluorotantalate in solid, dissolved and molten conditions\\" J. Fluorine Chemistry 2003, 155-161. :Ta2O5 \\\\+ 4 KHF2 \\\\+ 6 HF ‚Üí 2 K2[TaF7] + 5 H2O The method was originally reported by Berzelius.J. J. Berzelius Pogg. Ann. 4, 6 (1825#. K2[TaF7] can also be precipitated from solutions in hydrofluoric acid provided that the concentration of HF is below about 42%. Solutions having higher concentrations of HF yield potassium hexafluorotantalate [KTaF6]. The K-salt can be also precipitated from a solution in hydrofluoric acid of tantalum pentachloride: : 5 HF + 2 KF + TaCl5 ‚Üí K2[TaF7] + 5 HCl Structure Potassium heptafluorotantalate exists in at least two polymorphs. Œ±-K2[TaF7] is the most common form and crystallises in the monoclinic P21/c space group. The structure is composed of [TaF7]2‚àí units interconnected by potassium ions. [TaF7]2‚àí polyhedra may be described as monocapped trigonal prisms with the capping atom located on one of the rectangular faces. Potassium atoms are 9-coordinated and may be viewed as distorted monocapped square prisms. At temperatures above 230 ¬∞C this converts to Œ≤-K2[TaF7], which is orthorhombic (space group: Pnma). This structure also consists of potassium ions and the complex anion [TaF7]2‚àí. The structure of the 7-coordinate [TaF7]2‚àí units is essentially unchanged. However the potassium atoms now exist in 2 environments where they coordinate to either 11 or 8 fluorine atoms.Langer, V. Smrƒçok, L. Boƒça, M. \\"Dipotassium heptafluorotantalate#V#, Œ≤-K2TaF7, at 509K\\" Acta Crystallographica Section E 2006, E62, i91-i93. Reactions K2[TaF7] is primarily used to produce metallic tantalum by reduction with sodium. This takes place at approximately 800 ¬∞C in molten salt and proceeds via a number of potential pathways. : K2[TaF7] + 5 Na ‚Üí Ta + 5 NaF + 2 KF K2[TaF7] is susceptible to hydrolysis. For example, a boiling aqueous solution of K2[TaF7] yields potassium oxyfluorotantalate (K2Ta2O3F6), known as ‚ÄúMarignac‚Äôs salt‚Äù. In order to prevent hydrolysis and co-precipitation of potassium oxyfluorotantalate, a small excess of HF is added to the solution.

In 1978, as a young sports journalist, Ludtke won a lawsuit for the right to be allowed in Major League Baseball locker rooms.  Early life  Ludtke was born in Iowa City, Iowa, but grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts. She was the oldest of five children, her father worked at the University of Massachusetts where he taught finance, and her mother earned a Ph.D. in anthropology. Ludtke attended Wellesley College in Wellesley, MA and graduated in 1973 with a Bachelor of Arts in Art History.  Career  Ludtke always had a passion for sports, and upon graduation, she began working for ABC Sports and Sports Illustrated. Ludtke was a writer and editor for the Nieman Reports magazine of Harvard University's Nieman Foundation for Journalism from 1998 to 2011. She then served as the Executive Director of the Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University from 2011 to 2013. Before her editor job at the Nieman Foundation, she had been a correspondent with Time magazine and a reporter/researcher with Sports Illustrated and with CBS News. In July 2013, Ludtke was featured in Let Them Wear Towels, a short documentary on females working in male locker rooms by Anne Sundberg and Ricki Stern.  Court case against Major League Baseball  Page from Complaint Ludtke was a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit, Melissa Ludtke and Time, Inc., Plaintiffs, v. Bowie Kuhn, Commissioner of Baseball et al. (1978) that is credited with giving equal access to Major League Baseball locker rooms to women sports reporters. In 1977, Ludtke sued the baseball commission on the basis that her 14th amendment rights were violated when she was denied access to the New York Yankees clubhouse while reporting on the 1977 World Series. She won the lawsuit. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York stated her fourteenth amendment right was violated since the New York Yankees clubhouse was controlled by New York City. That court also stated that her fundamental right to pursue a career was violated based on her sex. When asked how the case, Ludtke vs. Kuhn, has impacted journalism she said \\"It increased enormously the number of young women who came into sports media ‚Äî as reporters, as employees of sports teams and league offices, in agencies representing athletes and in other aspects of sports work that earlier generations of women had not been involved with, such as working as team trainers or as umpires.\\"  Honors  In 2010, Ludtke received the Yankee Quill Award, the highest individual honor bestowed on a journalist in New England. At Sports Illustrated, she was given a Front Page Award, and at Time was the recipient of several journalism awards. In 2012, Ludtke was nominated by the New York University Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute as one of the \\"100 Outstanding Journalists in the United States in the Last 100 Years\\".  Personal life  In 1978, Ludtke married sportswriter Eric Lincoln. In 1982, Ludtke and Lincoln divorced. Ludtke has a daughter, whom she adopted as a baby girl from China.

The Chapelle Saint-Gibrien in Sauvigny, France. His story appears in the fourth book of the Historia Remensis ecclesiae (\\"History of the church of Reims\\"), which was written by Flodoard in the tenth century. Gibrian is mentioned as one of a group of siblings from Ireland who were received by St Remigius at Reims, the seat of his diocese, and given permission to settle in the Marne region. They are said to number seven brothers, Gibrian, Helan, Tressan, German, Veran, Abran and Petran, and three sisters, Francla, Portia and Promptia. Gibrian chose for himself a spot near Chal√¥ns-sur-Marne, apparently in what is now the commune of Saint-Gibrien, which derives its name from the saint.Sigal 1962: 1524; Kenney 1966: 184 He died in 509 and a small chapel was built to mark his grave. Flodoard further writes that Normans destroyed the chapel in the ninth century, but that the body was left intact and following a series of miracles at his tomb, his relics were translated to an altar at Reims.Sigal 1962: 1524. Other versions of this account were later told in Gibrian's and Tressan's Lives, which James Kenney regards as \\"late and fabulous compositions\\". Kenney 1966: 184. While the matter of Gibrian's sanctity was not in danger, it was not until the mid-12th century that he began to attract a cult at Reims. This was due to the work of Odo, the abbot of Saint-Remi, who sought to support the new monastery of Chartreux in Champagne. In 1145, Odo had the saint's relics moved to a new shrine at the new monastery. As many as 102 miracles were recorded between April 16 (the day when the relics were translated) and August 24, mostly on Sundays and feast- days.Geary 1994: 206-7. The text of The Miracles of St Gibrian is given in the Acta Sanctorum, May 1, VII, pp. 618-650. There is no sign of a popular cult for a long while afterwards, but it enjoyed a revival in 1325, when the saint's reliquary was replaced with a more magnificent one, the place becoming a destination of renewed interest for pilgrims.Geary 1994: 206-7 NotesReferences * * * Category:Medieval Irish saints on the Continent ","title":"Gibrian"},{"id":"31621804","text":"The Coastal and Marine Institute Laboratory (CMIL), formerly known as the Coastal Waters Laboratory, is an academic laboratory operated by the College of Sciences of San Diego State University (SDSU), in the Point Loma district of San Diego, California.

Rabbi Jacobs was listed as number six in The Daily Beast and Newsweek‚Äôs list of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Top 50 Rabbis for 2013‚Äù and was 26th on the Jerusalem Post‚Äôs 2012 list of ‚Äú50 most influential Jews in the world.‚Äù  Life and career = Early life and education  A native of New Rochelle, New York, who grew up in Tustin, California where his parents had a retail furniture business, Jacobs was ordained as rabbi in 1982 by Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York where he had also earned his M.A. in Hebrew Literature in 1980. In the same year, he joined Avodah Dance Ensemble, a modern dance company which performs services in dance and concerts throughout the United States. He remained with the company until 1986 as dancer and choreographer, working as part-time rabbi in order to continue performing after being ordained. In Jerusalem, he studied at the Shalom Hartman Institute and at the Rubin Academy of Music and Dance. He considered a career as a dancer, but decided to ‚Äúdedicate his life to a religious and spiritual mission, and chose the rabbinate‚Äù.  Career and views  Before becoming rabbi at Westchester Reform Temple in 1991, Jacobs served as rabbi at the Brooklyn Heights Synagogue from 1982 until 1991, where he founded and co-directed the first homeless shelter at a synagogue in New York City and led the congregation's work with Brooklyn Ecumenical Cooperatives, an interracial coalition of faith communities that built 1,200 housing units in Brooklyn. Under Jacobs‚Äô leadership, Westchester Reform Temple grew from fewer than 800 member families to more than 1,200. Advocating for the Jewish mission of tikkun olam (repairing the world), the synagogue underwent an eco-friendly renovation and expansion in 2009 and houses a ner tamid (eternal flame) powered by solar energy. Jacobs was a member of the Union of Reform Judaism‚Ä≤s board of trustees from 1994 through 1998 and served as the Secretary of the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) and on the board of the World Union for Progressive Judaism (WUPJ), which, in 2000, rewarded him with its ‚ÄúInternational Humanitarian Award‚Äù for his commitment to human rights and social and economic justice. In 2005 he visited the Chad‚ÄìDarfur border area with an international humanitarian mission, and raised more than $250,000 to aid Darfur refugees. He delivered the opening prayer for the 2006 Darfur rally in Washington, D.C. He was the only rabbi who participated in the 2009 Brookings U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, Qatar, an annual conference designed to bring together key leaders in the worlds of politics, business, media, academia, and civil society from across the Muslim world and the United States. Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, he joined a delegation to assess disaster response. In July 2010 he participated in a protest in Sheikh Jarrah, a Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem, explaining: ‚ÄúI take issue with residents of east Jerusalem being taken out of their homes to make room for Jewish settlers;‚Äù in August of the same year he spoke on CNN in support of the proposed Islamic center near ground zero. Jacobs has published several essays in Reform Judaism magazine and reportedly is pursuing a Ph.D. in ritual dance at New York University. He also is a senior rabbinic fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem. In 2007, he received a Doctor of Divinity honoris causa from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in recognition of his 25 years in the rabbinate. Immediately after his nomination as URJ president, The Daily Beast and Newsweek placed him at number seven on their 2011 list of ‚ÄúAmerica's 50 Most Influential Rabbis,‚Äù describing him as ‚Äúmagnetic‚Äù and ‚Äúknown for prioritizing social justice ... and rethinking worship to engage the disaffected.‚Äù He held the same position on the 2012 list, where he was described as ‚Äúa charismatic speaker and...a staunch defender of Israel‚Äù, who was, however, also attacked by the Zionist Organization of America for being insufficiently pro-Israel, and moved up to position six in the 2013 list. In 2011, the Jewish Daily Forward listed him as number three on the ‚ÄúForward 50‚Äù, its list of the 50 most significant American Jews, and the Jerusalem Post lists him as number 26 on its 2012 list of ‚Äú50 most influential Jews in the world.‚Äù Articulating his view of the future of the Reform Movement upon his unanimous election as president in June 2011, Jacobs said: Jacobs' formal installation, the first in 16 years, was held at Congregation Beit Elohim in Brooklyn, New York on June 9, 2012. In his address, Jacobs promised to turn the Reform Jewish movement into a ‚Äúmovement undergoing renovation that will renew Jewish life.‚Äù He called on Reform Jews to ‚Äústand up for Israel‚Äù against its critics while fighting to ensure that Israel preserves the democratic and liberal ideals dear to the Reform Movement at the same time, and expressed the hope that ‚Äúone day soon the State of Israel will live in peace side by side with the State of Palestine.‚Äù Rabbi Jacobs visits and speaks frequently throughout the Jewish world. In September 2012, he was named as the scholar-in- residence for The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA)'s 2012 General Assembly, the largest annual gathering of the North American Jewish community. At the URJ 2013 Biennial convention, he spoke extensively about key themes in the organization's work to re-imagine Jewish life: youth engagement, partnerships, inclusion, Israel-Diaspora relations, and religious pluralism.http://urj.org/about/union/leadership/rabbijacobs/?syspage=article&item;_id=109240 In 2016, Jacobs led an effort to encourage efforts to accommodate multi- denominational Judaism in Israel. In 2016 at government hearings on non- Orthodox prayer space at the Western Wall, MK And tourism Minister Yariv Levin slammed Reform Judaism, a small denomination in Israel but the largest Jewish movement in the United States, saying egalitarian prayer space at the Wall is unnecessary based on his opinion that Reform Jews will \\"be all but gone in three generations.\\"Israeli Tourism Minister Blasts U.S. Reform Jews, Says Chelsea Clinton's Wedding Shows Extent of Assimilation Haaretz, Jan 31, 2013 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Levin‚Äôs remarks and the Reform movement in the U.S. has decided to shun him.

Billed as April March, The First Lady of Burlesque, she was a headline act in burlesque from 1952 to 1978. During her more than thirty-year career, she gained popularity throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe for her classy and sophisticated striptease. March was one of the innovators of the elegant strip tease. Early life April March was born Velma Fern Worden in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She was the only child of Clarence \\"Buddy\\" Worden and Fern Gragg. After her parents divorced her mother went through a string of marriages and alcoholism and her father was absent for most of her life. March was left to be raised by her grandparents Elmer and Ida Gragg. March began dance, skating and acrobatic lessons at an early age and aspired to be a movie actress. At the age of ten, she was cast as an extra in an Our Gang comedy that was being filmed in Oklahoma City. March was married to her first husband at the age of fifteen. The marriage lasted less than two years. At age seventeen, divorced and in need of money to get herself to Hollywood, she lied about her age to get a job as a cigarette girl at an Oklahoma City nightclub, The Derby Club. It was while working there that she was discovered by Barney Weinstein, a renowned Dallas club owner, who offered her a chance to be in burlesque. Burlesque career April March began her career in 1952 at The Theater Lounge in Dallas, TX. After meeting Barney Weinstein in Oklahoma and being offered the opportunity to work in his club, she traveled to Dallas. Weinstien had her trained as a burlesque stripper and gave her the name April March. At the same time, Weinstien and his brother, Abe, were training another burlesque legend, Candy Barr. March became an instant favorite with audiences who were intrigued by the mix of sensuality and innocence from the raven haired beauty and taken in by her warmth and charm. By the time she was eighteen years old, April March was touring, playing clubs and theaters across the United States, Canada and Mexico. While touring the club and theater circuits, March refined her act, playing on her image of the sophisticated debutante type and became known for her elegant, well choreographed striptease that put the emphasis on teasing. March inspired two original songs written specifically for her, \\"Blues for April\\" and \\"Springtime for April\\" which became popular numbers in her act. Throughout her career, April March worked with other burlesque legends such as Lili St. Cyr, Blaze Starr, Rose La Rose and Ann Corio as well as famous burlesque comics such as Billy \\"Cheese and Crackers\\" Hagen, Lenny Ross and Jimmy Matthews. In 1961, April March was given the title \\"The First Lady of Burlesque\\". When an agent pointed out March's striking resemblance to then First Lady of the United States, Jacqueline Kennedy, the agent jokingly said that March's new moniker could be \\"The First Lady of Burlesque\\". March's ladylike demeanor on stage also played a part in the title and she began using it. While appearing at the Picadilly Club in Miami, FL., March was invited to attend a luncheon by Prince Thamur and Prince Mansour of Saudi Arabia who were accompanying their father, King Saud, on a trip to the United States. King Saud heard of March from his two sons and requested a private audience with her. This invitation led to a request by the U. S. State Department for March to secretly deliver a letter to King Saud. March agreed to deliver the letter. March was asked by King Saud to accompany him to Majorca, Spain and then back to Saudi Arabia. On the advice of the United States Government, March turned down the offer, fearing for her life. Shortly after her meeting with the Saudi King, April March was involved in a fatal shoot out in another Miami club, The Place Pigalle. After a dispute over a bill on which he was charged for March's drinks while she sat at his table, a drunken customer began shooting randomly through the club. When the shooting was over, a singer had been murdered, a doorman had wounded in both legs and one of the dancers had been wounded in one leg which was eventually amputated. The shooter held a gun to April March's head and was overpowered just before pulling the trigger. True Detective magazine picked up the story, labeling March a Femme Fatale who had been the cause of the shootout. Later in her career, March starred in two shows with the Minsky Theaters in New York City and Wildwood, New Jersey. She turned down Harold Minsky's offer to star in his Las Vegas theater in favor of a three-month contract as the star of the Arthur Fox Review Bar in Manchester, England. March was a special guest star in Ann Corio's off-Broadway show, This Was Burlesque and was filmed for a late night television special entitled The Secrets of April March. She also went head to head in a television interview with Dorothy Fuldheim and appeared as a guest on the Joe Franklin Show. March was also a frequent headliner on the B&E; Theater Circuit, a chain of burlesque theaters across the U.S. and Canada owned and operated by Frank Bryan and Frank Engels. She appeared as the stripper in the 1961 Jim Henson short film, Time Piece, which may be the only existing footage of her performing. At various points in her career, April March received offers to appear on Broadway in the legitimate theater and was twice offered contracts with Columbia and United Artists studios. She turned down each offer in favor of her burlesque career. March also turned an offer to pose in Playboy Magazine, for a fee in excess of ten thousand dollars, citing the fact that she would never appear fully nude in public. Personal life April March was married eight times. Her first husband Inventor was Benjamin Joseph Mitson Born in North Idaho.They were only married for a year. She was romantically involved with an infamous Mafia boss in Chicago, Oklahoma oil tycoon, Keene Burwell, numerous entertainers such as actors Dale Robertson, Ray Shaw, Charles Braswell and Monty Hale, baseball legend, Joe DiMaggio and singers Hank Thompson and Mel Torme. March was also briefly involved with former Chairman of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur Mills. In order to get rid of Mills, whom she said she could not stand, March introduced Mills to a friend and fellow stripper, Fanne Foxe. For a brief time, March was engaged to singer, Mel Torme, who was to be her fourth husband. She jilted Torme to marry a man who owned a string of drugstores. Although Torme was furious, the two eventually renewed a friendship that lasted until Torme's death. During this fourth marriage, March took a six-year hiatus from burlesque, during which she discovered a second love, golf. She served as President of the Ladies Golf Association in Tulsa, OK. and developed an eight handicap. This accomplishment would later have her become the only burlesque stripper to be written up in Sports Illustrated in the June 1964 issue. March has one child, a daughter from her third marriage, and one grandchild. Retirement April March retired from burlesque in 1978 citing that the business had changed and become too blatant and sexual. After retiring, her only public appearance in thirty years would be in 1982 when she became the third woman ever (after Ann Corio and Elizabeth Taylor) to be honored as Person of the Year by The Circus Saints and Sinners Organization. In 2006, April March was invited to appear as one of the Legends of Burlesque at the annual Miss Exotic World in Las Vegas. After seeing the new burlesque revival and the acts dedicated to the classic strip tease, March was impressed and once again became part of burlesque doing annual appearances, lectures and teaching at festivals in Las Vegas, Boston and Canada. Although she no longer did a strip tease, she became a teacher in the old style of the elegant strip tease act. April March was one of the performers featured in the 2010 Leslie Zemekis film, Behind the Burly Q and in the Immodesty Blaize film, Burlesque Undressed. April March currently resides in upstate New York with her eighth husband and continues to make frequent appearances across the United States and Canada, passing on her knowledge and skill to new and upcoming burlesque stars.

Geography Moneensauran is bounded on the north by Tullynacross (Glangevlin) and Curraghglass townlands, on the east by Derrynananta Upper and Derrynananta Lower townlands, on the south by Doon (Drumreilly) townland and on the west by Slievenakilla and Legatraghta townlands. Its chief geographical features are Benbrack Mountain reaching to an altitude of 1,600 feet above sea-level, the Owenmore River (County Cavan), Munter Eolus Lough (Gaelic meaning 'The Descendants of Eolus'), forestry plantations, waterfalls and gravel pits. The townland is traversed by minor public roads and lanes. The townland covers an area of 1,739 statute acres and is the third largest in County Cavan. History Samhradh√°n, who lived about 1100 A.D., was lord of Tullyhaw and the son of Conchobhar mac Fearghal and is the progenitor of the McGovern (name) clan. The earliest surviving mention of the townland name is Moneenshawran from a list of County Cavan townlands printed in 1790. In the 19th century the townland was owned by the Earls of Annesley. The Tithe Applotment Books of 1827 list the following tithepayers in the townland- Annesley, Magauran, Sheridan. Tithe Applotment Books 1827 The Moneensauran Valuation Office Field books are available for August 1839. In 1841 the population of the townland was 222, being 122 males and 99 females. There were thirty-five houses in the townland and all were inhabited. In 1851 the population of the townland was 185, being 91 males and 94 females. There were twenty-seven houses in the townland and all were inhabited. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists forty-two occupiers in the townland. In 1861 the population of the townland was 140, being 65 males and 75 females. There were twenty-two houses in the townland and all were inhabited. In 1871 the population of the townland was 109, being 52 males and 57 females. There were eighteen houses in the townland and all were inhabited.(page 296 of census) In 1881 the population of the townland was 100, being 45 males and 55 females. There were twenty houses in the townland, all were inhabited. In 1891 the population of the townland was 107, being 60 males and 47 females. There were eighteen houses in the townland, all were inhabited. In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are twenty-three families listed in the townland. In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are eighteen families listed in the townland. A description of the townland in 1938 by Peggy McGovern is found in the D√∫chas folklore collection. The Magauran family of Moneensauran was the predominant family in the parish. They produced many Roman Catholic priests through the centuries, including Dr. James Magauran who was bishop of Ardagh from 1815 to 1829. His brother Peter and sister Elizabeth Magauran were elected as the last King and Queen of Glan in 1815.

It is commonly found in eastern Indonesia, as the counterpart of central and western Indonesian cuisines that favour rice as their staple food. Papeda is made from sago starch. The Moluccans and Papuans acquire the starch by felling the trunk of a sago palm tree, cutting it in half, and scraping the soft inner parts of the trunk, the pith, producing a crude sago pith flour. This flour is then mixed with water and squeezed to leach the starch from the flour. The still-moist sago starch is usually stored in a container made of sago palm leaflets, called tumang, in which it will keep for several months before spontaneous fermentation will turn it too acidic and unsuitable for making papeda. Depending on the variety and the growing conditions, it may take a sago tree five to fifteen years to accumulate enough starch in its trunk to make the effort of extracting it worthwhile.Schuiling, D.L.

(PhD thesis Wageningen University). Papeda is made by cooking sago starch with water and stirring until it coagulates. It has a glue-like consistency and texture. Sayur bunga pepaya (papaya flower bud vegetables) and tumis kangkung (stir-fried water spinach) are often served as side-dish vegetables to accompany papeda. There are similar dishes in Malaysia, where it is called ', part of the Melanau cuisine in the East Malaysia state of Sarawak, and in Brunei, where it is called ambuyat.  History  On some coasts and lowlands on Papua, sago is the main ingredient to all the foods. Sagu bakar, sagu lempeng, and sagu bola, has become dishes that is well-known to all Papua, especially on the custom folk culinary tradition on Mappi, Asmat and Mimika. Papeda is one of the sago foods that is rarely found. The anthropologist and the leader of Papua institution research, Johszua Robert Mansoben, stated that Papeda is known more in the tradition of the native folks of Sentani and Abrab by the Lake Sentani area, Arso, and Manokwari.

Body image flexibility  Body image and body image flexibility greatly impact on body acceptance and also body dissatisfaction.  Medical applications  In psychology, it typically refers to one's perceptions, beliefs, and emotional attitudes towards one's body. The concept is used to discuss various pathologies and disorder, such as anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, body integrity identity disorder and various post-stroke conditions like somatoparaphrenia, and unilateral neglect.

Conservation and restoration are aimed at preserving the ivory material and physical form along with the objects condition and treatment documentation. Activities dedicated to the preservation of ivory objects include preventing agents of deterioration that specifically connect with ivory as a material, preventative conservation, and treatment of ivory objects. Conservators, curators, collections managers, and other museum personnel are in charge of taking the necessary measurements to ensure that ivory objects are well maintained and will make the decision for any conservation and restoration of the objects. Ivory as a material is the tusk or teeth from animals and is soft and mailable with nonmetal tools. Often used in decorative and practical objects, ivory can be inlaid and used as an accent within objects made from other material like metal and wood. A popular decorative ivory work is scrimshaw, which is etched ivory with black or colored pigments. Ivory has been manipulated since prehistoric times and as a material has been used in religion, as jewelry, piano keys, decorative arts, and other products. The demand for ivory has caused specific animals to become endangered, including the African and Asian Elephant. Ivory is a coveted material throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia that is illustrated in religious objects, art, and demonstrates wealth. In the last thirty years, ivory has been mainly been used the jewelry and souvenirs markets.\\"To Save An Elephant\\" by Allan Thornton & Dave Currey, Doubleday 1991 Ivory Ivory is the tusks and unusually large or projected teeth of animals, such as elephants and walruses. It consists of dentin and made up of both organic (for growth and repair) and inorganic (rigidity and strength) components. Due to it being organic and inorganic the ivory is extremely sensitive and reactive Types of ivory Understanding the diverse types of ivory is important as it can impact the type of conservation and restoration work that is done. It can also determine the materials that are harmful or safe to use on the ivory. =Elephant and mammoth= Elephant and mammoth ivory comes from the two modified upper incisors. Tusks of some male African elephants can grow up to 2 meters (6 ¬Ω feet) and weigh up to 45 kilograms (100 pounds). The tusks have a pulp cavity where the root and soft tissues attach to the jaw and that extends for approximately one-third of the tusk. By looking at if the carved ivory does or does not have the pulp cavity it can help indicate what part of the tusk was used and its original length. The characteristic identifier in elephant ivory is the pattern of intersecting arcs that can be seen in the cross-section. These arcs can go by several names such as engine turnings, cross-hatchings, or Schreger lines (named after the German anatomist who first described them in 1800). The intersections of the lines form angles, obtuse arc angles are found in elephant ivory and acute arc angles are found in mammoth ivory. =Walrus= Walrus ivory is solid its entire length with a center of secondary dentin instead of a pulp cavity. It is characterized in cross section by the central core that has a marbled appearance surrounded by the smooth creamy white dentin layer. They may grow up to 1.0 meter (3 ¬º feet) in length. =Warthog= Warthog ivory comes from their upper and lower canine teeth and are strongly curved. It generally has squared cross sections and have a mottled appearance. When using a magnifying hand lens, the wart hog dentin shows irregularly spaced concentric lines with varying thickness. =Narwhal= Narwhal ivory comes from a single left incisor that is produced by males. It is distinguished by its spiral form. They can grow from 2.0-7.0 meters (6 ¬Ω-23 feet) in length. =Hippopotamus= The upper and lower canine and incisors are the most common sources for hippopotamus ivory and each one has a distinctive gross morphology. Using a magnifying hand lens, we can see tightly packed series of fine concentric lines, which can be regularly or irregularly spaced. The orientation of these lines will follow with the overall shape of the tooth. Hippo ivory is harder and opaquer than elephant or walrus ivory. The upper canines are curved and are oval to rounded in the cross-section. The lower canines are the largest teeth and strongly curved. In their cross-section, they are triangular. The incisors can be described as peg shaped and the center of the tooth in the cross-section shows a small dot. =Sperm whale and Killer whale= Both the Sperm whale and Killer whale have conically shaped teeth with a small amount of enamel at the tips and the rest of the tooth covered by cementum. The cross-sections of the teeth are rounded or oval. A characteristic feature is that the dentin forms in layers that alternate directions giving it a banded appearance. Their teeth are second in hardness to hippopotamus ivory. Sperm whale teeth may grow up to 20 cm (8 inches) in length while the killer whale teeth are slightly smaller. Killer whale teeth show two slight peripheral indentations and may also display a faint rosette pattern in the dentin cross-section. =French ivory= French ivory is a synthetic material that is typically composed of pigmented cellulose nitrate and/or casein. This type of ivory was commonly made in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It looks like elephant ivory and can have intersecting line patterns but the pattern is more uniform and regular than natural ivory. This ivory will be occasionally marked synthetic while ‚ÄúFrench Ivory‚Äù or ‚ÄúIndia Ivory‚Äù are common marks. It can be distinguished from natural ivory due to its lighter weight and more even coloring. Cellulose nitrate can be identified with a chemical spot test using diphenylamine. This ivory can degrade and produce acidic and oxidizing nitrogen. Oxide gases have been known to spontaneously combust so if this type of ivory shows any deterioration it must be kept away from the rest of the collection. =Vegetable ivory (ivory nuts)= Vegetable ivory is derived from several dense palm nuts that are native to Africa, South America, and the South Pacific. It is a cellulosic material. They grow to a maximum of 5 cm (approximately 2 inches) in diameter. =Composite mixtures= Can be various mixtures including ivory dust and casein, ivory dust and styrene resin, calcium carbonate and adhesive, casein and hardener. =Plastic= A proprietary plastic of cellulose nitrate and camphor that was developed in the mid-19th century as an ivory substitute. Other examples include polyester and phenolic resins. The plastics are sometimes laminated to show a striated surface to resembles ivory but ivory's intersecting arc pattern cannot be reproduced. Agents of Deterioration Ivory is susceptible to certain challenges to their preservation. In order to protect against damage, conservators should determine the agents that threaten its material make-up. The agents of deterioration include the following: Physical Forces Ivory is very fragile and susceptible to cracking, chipping and breakage. Ivory is porous, brittle, and prone to impact damage and delamination. This can be caused by human error such as dropping, bumping, or mishandling. It can also result from improper display and storage such as unstable shelving or lack of padding. Fire A special caution applies to French Ivory. Because it is usually composed of cellulose nitrate, it is potentially flammable and must be kept away from heat or other sources of ignition. Pests Bone, ivory, and antler are rarely attacked by insects, but horn is often seriously damaged by the larvae of carpet beetles and clothes moths. Light, Ultraviolet, and Infrared Ivory, bone, and antler should be kept away from bright light such as spotlights or direct sunlight. Bright light can increase the surface temperature of the object. When exposed to light, ivory can become stained or bleached, and ultraviolet light can cause it to yellow. Incorrect Relative Humidity Ivory is hygroscopic and anisotropic which means it absorbs or releases moisture with changing humidity. Ivory tends to shrink, swell, crack, split, and/or warp on exposure to extremes or fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature. Low relative humidity causes desiccation, shrinkage and cracking, while high relative humidity can cause warping and swelling. Thieves and vandals Ivory objects may be have come from illegal trade, so it is important to know what type of ivory the object is made from and its provenance. Water The organic components in ivory is called ossein, which is decomposed by hydrolysis and after long-term exposure can cause the ivory to turn into a sponge-like substance. Even for cleaning purposes, water can damage ivory so it should be avoided. Pollutants Corroded metals and colored materials can stain ivory and should not be placed near them. Dust can be removed from ivory using a soft brush. Incorrect Temperature Although ivory is most susceptible to fluctuation in relative humidity, it should be kept at a stable temperature that does not exceed 25C/77F. Ivory will warp in high temperatures, therefore extreme conditions in temperature should be avoided. Disassociation Disassociation is the result of losing an object or object-related data. Attempting to remove the ivory's patina or attempting to clean or repair an ivory object that is in poor condition can cause damage and lead to the loss of valuable information on the object's origins or production method. Preventive conservation=Handling When working with ivory objects it is important to wear white cotton gloves and if none are available be sure to thoroughly wash hands prior to touching the object. Since ivory is a porous material it is susceptible to staining. Ivory will yellow and/or brown with repeated contact to skin, fatty acids, and oils. Temperature and relative humidity Ivory is a hygroscopic material meaning that is absorbs and releases moisture with changing humidity. It is very reactive to its environment with the most severe changes linking to temperature and relative humidity. The relative humidity ideally is between 45-55% and the temperature at 70ÀöF (21.11ÀöC). If the relative humidity is too low it can lead to desiccation, shrinkage, and cracking. When the relative humidity it too high is can cause warping and swelling of the ivory. If the relative humidity exceeds 60% for a sustained time there is a chance that mold can develop on the ivory. It will be a white and greenish fuzzy growth that will require particular care and cleaning. Research has found that temperature does not have as great of an impact on the condition of ivory that relative humidity does. Big fluctuations with either temperature of relative humidity is harmful. When the temperature fluctuates from normal to high heat it will cause expansion and contraction of the ivory. Elevated temperatures can also result in a series of color changes. Lighting Sunlight and artificial light can damage the surface of the ivory by discoloring (patina) as well as make it more brittle. Sunlit or spotlight display cases as well as any closed cases where heat can build up from interior light bulbs will cause further damage ivory. Dark storage areas will help to prevent damage to the ivory objects. Lighting is kept at 5 foot- candles Integrated pest management Ivory is very rarely attacked by insects but benefits from being routinely inspected to ensure no pest activity. Rodents or other small mammals can cause structural damage by chewing on the surface of ivory. By maintaining good housekeeping and having an integrated pest management program will help prevent infestations. Proper storage Tightly closed display cases or storage will provide protection from any sudden changes in temperature, relative humidity, dirt, and dust. Storage drawers lined with a chemically stable cushioning material, for example polyethylene or polypropylene will protect the surface of the ivory. Another option for storage is wrapping it in unbuffered, acid free tissue paper and stored in a sealed polyethylene bag. Well washed unbleached muslin or dipper fabrication can substitute the tissue. Avoid rubber based materials as it can cause unnatural yellowing of ivory. Avoid storing or displaying ivory near radiators, heat pipes, outside windows, and incandescent lights as they can cause excessive drying and temperature fluctuations. Conservation and restoration=Cleaning If the ivory object is in good stable condition, cleaning the surface of dirt and grime is appropriate. If the dusting is not enough the ivory can be cleaned with a mixture of water and mild soap (such as Ivory Snow or WA Paste). Never soak ivory as the water could cause the dirt to become more visible by embedding it into cracks or pores. Many liquids can be destructive to ivory so avoid if possible or contact a professional. Stabilization and structural treatments Avoid over the counter adhesives when repairing cracks or breaks of ivory. These repairs are difficult and the use of poor adhesives can result in staining of the ivory and embrittlement as the adhesives age. Breaks and cracks can be important historically and show its use of the object. Unnecessary repairs can result in the loss of that historical information. Contact a conservator before any structural repairs are made. Surface treatments Avoid wax or other protective coatings as they can age over time resulting in yellowing or darkening of the ivory surface. It can also obscure surface details that may be important to the object. The protective coatings can become difficult or even impossible to remove without damage to the object. If possible to remove unstable surface treatments, do so with appropriate solvents. Use caution and have a professional consulted before doing any work on the ivory. Intervention Especially in archaeological contexts, interventive treatment may in some cases be considered necessary. Such intervention is governed by conservation ethics, in particular the principles of reversibility and minimum intervention. Possible treatments include the reduction of salts to prevent further deterioration, and the consolidation of delaminating and friable components. Any treatment should be undertaken by a conservation professional. Identifying ivory and previous treatmentsVisual examination= Visual examination is a very useful method to identify ivory. By using the characteristics of the variety of ivories listed about in addition to images and samples often they type of ivory can be identified. It is helpful to consider the size of the object, if it is a long and uninterrupted section it is may be elephant or mammoth. The weight is another indicator as ivory and bone are heavier than shell, horn, plastics, and composite mixtures. =Ultraviolet examination= By using ultraviolet light, it will help determine if the material is ivory or made from another material in a non-destructive way. The long wave ultraviolet light will fluoresce assorted colors or absorb the light which will help characterize the material. Ivory will fluoresce a bluish-white color as does bone and shell. Vegetable ivory will fluoresce a slightly orange color and the plastic ivory will absorb the light making it appear dull blue or matte. Ultraviolet light can also be used to see previous conservation materials and work done on the ivory along with possible pigmentation. =Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy= ‚ÄúFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is an analytical method that characterizes organic material based on the energy emitted by the bonds of specific chemical compounds comprising the composition of a sample when submitted to infrared radiation.‚Äù FTIR can differentiate ivory from other materials, except bone, as they have a similar chemical composition. It can also help identify the chemical composition of any pigments used on the ivory along with the previous mixtures and materials used for conservation or restoration of the object. =X-Radiography= X-ray can be used to look at the type of ivory it could be, if there are two separate pieces of ivory attached to each other, if there are nails/screws holding them together either from its original creators or for restoration work. =DNA analysis= DNA analysis is a more precise method of identification as it can identify if it is an African or Asian elephant and even specific areas from within a country that the ivory may belong to. This method requires a small sample of ivory where the mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA can be isolated and compared. Contact a professional Ivory is extremely sensitive and reactive, if it is broken or extremely dirty please contact a professional conservator to conduct the repairs and extensive cleaning. Ethical concerns With the dramatic decline in population for African and Asian elephants along with poaching there are certain laws and regulations for ivory. Laws Objects Specialty Group of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works See also, Ivory trade. *The Lacey Act (1900 and later amendments) prohibits the trade of wildlife that is taken in violation of any state or foreign wildlife law or regulations. This affects interstate commerce. *The Endangered Species Act (1973) is to help prevent the extinction of native and foreign species. It prohibits elephant parts and products from being imported into the United States except under certain conditions. Artifacts that are carved from elephant ivory may travel legally if it has documentation that proves its provenance pre-dates 1973. *Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is made up of 180 countries to eliminate the illegal trade in animals, their parts, and associated products. CITES regulations do not take place of national laws. CITES has an Ivory Control System that is focused on the ivory trade. *The African Elephant Conservation Act (1988) prohibits raw or worked ivory to be imported into the United States with some exceptions. It also established a grant program that funds elephant conservation work. Transportation regulations As of 2016, new regulations in the United States have been put into place regarding African-elephant Ivory and Asian- elephant Ivory. It is important to understand not only the federal laws but the state laws as well, as they can differ. =African elephant ivoryImport Commercial Purposes: It is now illegal to import African elephant ivory (raw, worked, antique, or brand new) into the United States for any commercial purpose. Non-Commercial Purposes: If the ivory was removed from the wild prior to February 26, 1976 and was otherwise legally acquired then the following can be imported into the United States for non-commercial purposes. *Musical instruments *Items in a household move or that are part of an inheritance *No more than two sport-hunted trophies per year (trophies must have appropriate permit that have been issued by the country hosting the hunt). Sale & export Commercial Purposes: To commercially export an item containing ivory it must qualify as an antique, as defined by the Endangered Species Act. *The item has not been repaired or modified with ivory, or any other part of a federally protected species since 1973 *The item is at least 100 years old *The item was either imported prior to 1982 or after 1982 through one of the 13 ports specifically designated for antiques. Or the item was manufactured in the United States from legally imported ivory. Non- commercial purposes: To be eligible it must be an antique as defined by the ESA, or it but have been created prior to 1979 and has not be bought or sold since that time. It is still illegal under federal law to export raw African elephant ivory for any purpose (commercial or non-commercial) Interstate commerce: To be eligible for legal sale across state lines it must satisfy the laws of the relevant states and either be an antique as defined by the ESA or it must have been legally important into the United States prior to 1990 and contain only a small amount of ivory (de minimis exception). Intrastate commerce: Under federal law, it the item was legally imported before 1990 or was imported with a CITES pre-convention certificate it can be sold within a state, if it also complies with relevant state and local laws. =Asian elephant ivoryImport, export, & interstate commerce It is legal if it meets the following criteria: *The item has not been repaired or modified with ivory, or any other part of a federally protected species since 1973 *The item is at least 100 years old *The item was either imported prior to 1982 or after 1982 through one of the 13 ports specifically designated for antiques. Or the item was manufactured in the United States from legally imported ivory. Intrastate commerce an antique ivory can be sold within a state only if it has documentation from CITES certifying that it was imported prior to 1975. =Traveling exhibition= Worked African elephant ivory can be imported as part of a traveling exhibition if the ivory was legally acquired before February 26, 1976, it has not been transferred from one person to another for financial gain or profit after February 25, 2014, the person/group qualifies for a CITES traveling exhibition certificate, the ivory is accompanied by the CITES traveling exhibition certificate or and equivalent documents that meets the requirements. Raw African elephant ivory cannot be imported as part of a traveling exhibition.

The first USAMU commander was Col. William D. Tigertt. One of the USAMU's first responsibilities was to oversee all aspects of Project CD-22, the exposure of volunteers to aerosols containing a highly pathogenic strain of Coxiella burnetii, the causal agent of Q fever. One pre-existing research project, Operation Whitecoat (1954‚Äì1973), outlasted the USAMU. (It was a medical research program using volunteer enlisted personnel ‚Äî all conscientious objectors.)

Dan Crozier assumed command of the USAMU. Modern principles of biosafety and biocontainment were pioneered at Fort Detrick throughout the 1960s by a number of scientists led by Arnold G. Wedum. General Order No. 6, dated 27 January 1969, Office of The Surgeon General, redesignated the USAMU as the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) still assigned to USAMRDC.

Inscription: PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEVS (Peace unto you, Mark, my Evangelist) The Lion of Saint Mark, representing Mark the Evangelist, pictured in the form of a winged lion, is an aspect of the Tetramorph. On the pinnacle of St Mark's Cathedral he is depicted as holding a Bible, and surmounting a golden lion which is the symbol of the city of Venice and formerly of the Venetian Republic. It is also found in the symbol of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria. It appears in both merchant and military naval flags of the Italian Republic. The Lion of Saint Mark is also the symbol of the award of the Venice Film Festival, the \\"Golden Lion\\", and of the insurance company Assicurazioni Generali. Symbolism The representation as a lion is derived from Mark‚Äôs description of John the Baptist as \\"...The voice of the one who cries in the wilderness: Prepare Ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths\\",Mark 1:3 which artists compared to a roaring lion.\\"St. Mark the Apostle, the Founder of the Coptic Church\\", Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States The wings come from Ezekiel 1:10 and the application of the prophet's vision of four winged creatures to the evangelists.\\"Saint Mark\\", Franciscan Media These appear again in Revelation 4:7. A second connection of Mark and lions comes from a tale recounted by Severus Ebn-El-Mokafa: \\"Once a lion and lioness appeared to John Mark and his father Arostalis while they were traveling in Jordan. The father was very scared and begged his son to escape, while he awaited his fate. John Mark assured his father that Jesus Christ would save them and began to pray. The two beasts fell dead and as a result of this miracle, the father believed in Christ.\\" In some depictions the lion rests his front paws on the ground, often in cities with rivers or in ones close to water, indicating the Venetian balanced power on land and sea. Lion of Venice, Piazza San Marco (Venice) Mark and Venice Venetian tradition states that when Mark was traveling through Europe, he arrived at a lagoon in Venice, whereby an angel appeared to him and said, \\"Pax tibi Marce, evangelista meus. Hic requiescet corpus tuum.\\" (\\"Peace be with thee, O Mark, my evangelist. Here thy body will rest.\\") This tradition was used as justification by Rustico da Torcello and Bon da Malamocco in 828 for stealing the remains of Mark from his grave in Alexandria, and moving them to Venice, where they were eventually interred in the Basilica of St. Mark. Lion of Scuola Grande di San Marco A fifteen-foot bronze statue of a lion stands atop a column of Egyptian granite in St. Mark‚Äôs Square. It was brought to the lagoon during the 12th century, and remained there until Napoleon moved it to Paris. Returned in 1815, it fell and was rebuilt. It was moved from its pedestal only at the end of the 1800s for restoration and during the Second World War for safekeeping. The Lion underwent careful restoration work in the 1990s.\\"St Mark‚Äôs Small Square\\", Meraviglie di Venezia, Regione del Veneto Restorers believe its body is roughly 2,300 years old.Wills, Garry. Venice: Lion City, The New York Times, September 30, 2001 There are also lions carved in relief on the fa√ßade of the Doge's Palace, and at the Scuola Grande di San Marco The coats of arms of Popes Pius X, John XXIII, and John Paul I contain the Lion of St. Mark in recognition of their previous positions as Patriarchs of Venice. Depictions The Venetian lion appears in two distinct forms. One is as a winged animal resting on water, to symbolise dominance over the seas, holding St. Mark‚Äôs Gospel under a paw. These animals can be seen all around the Mediterranean, usually on top of a classical stone column.Robinson, Myra, \\"The Lions of Venice\\" , Italy Magazine, July 14, 2011 The other form is known as the lion \\"in moleca\\", in the form of a crab. Here the lion is depicted full- faced with its wings circled around the head and resembling the claws of a crustacean. It is emerging from water, so that the lion \\"in moleca\\" is associated with the lagoon and the city, whereas the standing winged lion is thought to be more associated with Venetian territory around the Mediterranean. The Latin words engraved on the book are Pax Tibi Marce Evangelista Meus means Peace unto you, Mark, my Evangelist. Other elements often included in depictions of the lion include a halo over his head, a book, or a sword in its paws. In British heraldry, \\"Lion of St. Mark\\" is commonly used to refer to all winged lions. These figures are depicted in arms as both passant and, more commonly, sejant, and also appear as supporters. The heraldist Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, however, defined the true Lion of St. Mark as being one used specifically within religious badges to signify the saint, and to have a halo.Arthur Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, T.C. and E.C.

He was the link between the senior line of the Courtenay Earls of Devon made extinct following the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 (his elder brother's line) and the post-Wars of the Roses creation of a new Earldom for his grandson made in 1485 by King Henry VII. Origins Hugh Courtenay was born in 1358, the younger of two sons of Sir Edward de Courtenay (d. between 2 February 1368 ‚Äì1 April 1371) of Goodrington, Devon, by his wife Emeline (or Emme) Dawney (or Dauney, Daunay, etc.) (c.1329 - 28 February 1371/2), daughter and heiress of Sir John Dawnay (d.1346/7) of Sheviock in Cornwall, Mudford Terry and Hinton in SomersetHistory of Parliament by his wife Sybil Treverbyn. Emmeline Dauney was a great heiress who brought to her husband several manors and estates, including Boconnoc.Gilbert, Davies, (ed.), The Parochial History of Cornwall: Founded on the Manuscript Histories of Mr Hals and Mr Tonkin, Volume 1, London, 1838, p.63 Hugh Courtenay was the grandson of Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd/10th Earl of Devon (1303‚Äì1377). At the 2nd/10th Earl's death on 2 May 1377, Courtenay's elder brother, Edward, became the 3rd/11th Earl of Devon.; . Maternal inheritance His elder brother was due to inherit the earldom and the vast Courtenay estates under primogeniture or entail, and thus as the second son with no prospective patrimony, Hugh Courtenay was given the estate of Boconnoc by his mother, the heiress Emmeline Dauney, which he made his seat.Gilbert, p.64 The practice of raising up a younger son in this way was common in the case of a wealthy heiress who married an already wealthy husband, and frequently the younger son beneficiary was required to adopt the maternal surname and armorials.See for example the cases of Theobald Gorges, described in Warbelton v Gorges and Nicholas Carew of Haccombe Furthermore, his mother requested his elder brother the Earl to give him the estates of \\"Goderington\\" (Goodrington), Stancombe (alias Slancomb (sic) Dawney) and South Allington, which he duly performed by deed of indenture dated 1414.Risdon, pp.150-1; Gilbert, p.64 Career Courtenay's elder brother, Edward Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon (c.1357 - 5 December 1419), succeeded to the earldom of Devon in 1377, and by 1384 Hugh was serving as one of his brother's esquires. Earlier, in 1378 Courtenay had taken part with his uncles, Sir Philip Courtenay and Sir Peter Courtenay, in an unsuccessful naval expedition against Spain at which Courtenay was captured, but quickly ransomed. He had been knighted by 1387, and in March of that year served at sea in his brother's retinue under the Lord Admiral, the Earl of Arundel. Little else is known of his career until he went to Ireland with King Richard II's expedition in April 1399, serving under the Duke of Aumale, who had earlier been granted custody of the lands of Courtenay's stepson, Fulk FitzWarin. Over the years Courtenay acquired considerable property, much of it by way of his marriages. At his death he held 14 manors, principally in the West Country, but also in Essex and Herefordshire. Courtenay served on commissions during the reigns of both Richard II and his successor, Henry IV, including commissions concerned with inquiry into the possessions of Richard II's former supporters, suggesting that he accommodated himself to both regimes. He was made Commissioner of Survey to Devon and Cornwall in 1388, and again by Lords Appellant to the two counties in October 1397. In 1395 he was elected as MP for Devon and again in September 1397. At the height of the Crisis, King Richard II betrayed his uncle, Earl of Arundel, and as a consequence he lost his main supporters. After the usurpation by King Henry IV Hugh was made Commissioner of Array for Devon in December 1399 - responsible for raising troops and bringing the south-west to the Lancastrian cause. He proved a successful recruiter for the wars in France, as he was made commissioner again in July 1402 to fight the Welsh Rebellion. The commission met again in August, September, and October 1403, after King Henry had defeated Harry Hotspur and the Mortimers at Shrewsbury. In February 1400, Sir Hugh was a Commissioner of oyer and terminer dispensing the king's justice in the south-west. There was also a Commission of Inquiry into waste lands. King Henry made Hugh a Commissioner in the region and in Hampshire, a traditional land area of Courtenay holdings, to look into the concealment of possessions owned by adherents of the late king. He was also on the commission for \\"concealment of alnage\\" in Devon from July 1401. The south-western counties disliked the new king and interference of parliament and in 1405 the Cornish rebelled with widespread rioting. In January a commission was set up to look into \\"unlawful assemblies\\" during 1406. Sir Hugh, however was a known Lancastrian: in May 1402 he had been forced to proclaim the intention of Henry IV to govern well. Also he was a JP for Devon, appointed on 16 February 1400 for the period until 1407; instructed to enforce the law and collect the king's taxes. He was appointed Tax Collector for Devon in March 1404. He was made High Sheriff of Devon on 4 November 1418, holding the office for the year until 23 November 1419. When his brother the Earl of Devon died the new earl was fighting the French abroad, and so Sir Hugh was the most senior member of the family at home and probably felt compelled to represent Devon in parliament again in May 1421. Henry IV died in 1413, and during the new reign Sir Hugh found favour with Henry V. King Henry V had travelled triumphantly through France, securing the future accession of his son as King of both England and France. Sir Hugh was thus present as knight of the shire for the County of Devon. Hugh's brother, the 11th Earl, died in 1419, and was succeeded by his son, Hugh Courtenay, 12th Earl of Devon (1389 ‚Äî 16 June 1422). The 12th Earl spent considerable time abroad in service to the crown, leaving Hugh as the senior member of the family in England. After the death of his nephew in 1422, Courtenay was again the senior member of the family during the minority of Thomas Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon. Courtenay died on 5 or 6 March 1425, leaving two daughters, Joan and Eleanor, by his third wife Philippa, and two sons and a daughter by his fourth wife, Maud. The lands which had belonged to Philippa were divided between their two daughters, Joan and Eleanor. Courtenay's heir was his elder son, Edward, who was eight years of age at his father's death. Courtenay's younger son, Hugh (d.1471) of Boconnoc, was the father of Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon of the 1485 creation. Courtenay was buried at Haccombe beside his third wife, Philippa.Transactions of Devon Association LXXXIII 227.

The carving is the centre of the annual Fiesta Grande de la Virgen (Great Festival of the Virgin) that draws thousands of pilgrims from around the world in December.Graham, Melissa and Benso, Andrew, Rough Guide to Chile, p.169, retrieved January 12, 2014  Origins  The small wooden statue of the Virgin Mary is said to have been found by a local indigenous person near the mines of Andacollo at the beginning of the conquest period. There are many explanations for how the statue came to be where it was found. The most accepted holds that it was left there by a Spanish soldier or by priests who had fled with the statue after the 1549 attack on the city of La Serena by the indigenous population.  Veneration  After four centuries of veneration in Andacollo and devotion coming from beyond Chilean borders, Cardinal Mariano Rampolla del Tindaro decreed on 15 June 1899, at the command of Pope Leo XIII, that the statue be given a Canonical coronation. The decree was implemented by the Claretians, who took on stewardship of the sanctuary in 1900, and the crown and jewels were paid for in large part by local fundraising. The statue of Our Lady of Andacollo was crowned on 26 December 1901. Four churches have been built for the Virgin over the years. The first was constructed in the 16th century and the second in the 17th century, but this only lasted until 1776. The third church, constructed in the 18th century after undergoing numerous repairs for earthquake damage, is where the image of the Virgin now resides for most of the year. Finally, between 1873 and 1893, a new church was constructed which was declared a minor basilica by Pope John Paul II, the Basilica of Our Lady of Andacollo.Agust√≠n Cabr√© Rufatt, C.M.F., \\"El Santuario de Andacollo\\", pp. 9-11. Festivals The town of Andacollo is visited every year by thousands of pilgrims from Chile and abroad, the majority of whom come for the Fiesta Grande de la Virgen (Great Festival of the Virgin) which takes place in December. The Fiesta Grande, filled with colour, dancing and music performed by numerous confraternities and dance groups, is held at the Basilica of Our Lady of Andacollo. It starts each year on December 23 and lasts for at least five days, during which the statue is dressed in her crown and special clothes embroidered with gold, then carried in a solemn procession to the basilica accompanied by dance groups and pilgrims.The virgin of Andacollo, as Eduardo Huerta the priest in charge of the parish describe the celebrations livingatlaschile.com, December 26, 2013 There is also a smaller festival, the Fiesta Chica (‚Äúsmall festival‚Äù), which takes place on the first Sunday of October.

The festival is believed to be over 770 years old and attracts up to a million spectators each year. It was designated an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property of Japan in 1979. The sound of the Yamakasa has also been selected by the Ministry of the Environment as one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan. The Floats The floats, called Yamakasa, are divided into two groups. The Kakiyama are the smaller, carryable floats, that are raced through the town, while the Kazariyama are stationary floats, that are built up to 13 metres high and often depict historic or mythical events of Japanese culture. Originally the Kakiyama and Kazariyama were one and the same, with the large floats being carried through the city. However the Yamakasa were split up in 1898 when the electrical power lines in Hakata became too common for large Yamakasa to be carried through the streets. Hakata districts Hakata, once its own city, merged with Fukuoka in 1876. The festivities are mostly based in Hakata. Hakata was divided into seven districts by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1586/1587. Some of these districts have changed names and exact boundaries multiple times; they still see themselves as the original seven districts. Soon after the division, carrying the Yamakasa through one's own district became a competition for speed. Today, the main event, the Oiyama, is a race between the districts.

Guillaume Bonneau is the stone cutter who worked on the construction of the church in the town in 1731. The brand is associated with successfully combating the Phylloxera disease, which eliminated all the vineyards in the Bordeaux region, thus greatly impoverishing wine and cognac production. However, in 1883, Leon Croizet's grandson - Benjamin Leon Croizet, replanted American vines, in place of the diseased French ones, and surrounded these by stone walls. This technique overcame the Phylloxera disease, for which Benjamin Leon Croizet was honored with the L√©gion d'honneur.by the French President in 1883 More recently in the San Francisco World Spirit Competition Croizet won double gold medals for its XO in both 2004/5.

A detachment fold, in geology, occurs as layer parallel thrusting along a decollement (or detachment) develops without upward propagation of a fault; the accommodation of the strain produced by continued displacement along the underlying thrust results in the folding of the overlying rock units. As a visual aid, picture a rug on the floor. By placing your left foot on one end and pushing (with your left foot) towards the other end of the rug, the rug slides across the floor (decollement) and folds upward (detachment fold). Figure 1, is a generalized representation of the geometry assumed by a detachment fault. Figure 1. The general geometry of a detachment fold illustrating the shortening above a layer parallel decollement and the resulting geometry of a detachment fold in a compressional environment. Definitions Detachment folding occurs as strain imposed on a mechanically weak layer or incompetent unit, such as shale or salt, or at the boundary between an incompetent and more competent unit, induces resistance from the units resulting in folding typically observed in the competent unit. Homza, T. and W. Wallace (1995) Geometric and kinematic models for detachment folds with fixed and variable detachment depths, Journal of Structural Geology, 17/4: 575-588 Hayes, M. and C. Hanks (2008) Evolving mechanical stratigraphy during detachment folding, Journal of Structural Geology, 30: 548-564Mitra, S. (2003) A unified kinematic model for the evolution of detachment folds, Journal of Structural Geology, 25: 1659-1673 Once the resistance of these units is overcome with strain or the variation in strain between the units becomes great enough, a shearing motion known as a detachment fault may occur. Defined, a detachment fault may be located within an incompetent unit or at the boundary of an incompetent and a competent unit, which accommodates for strain differences between the units and allows displacement to occur in a planar field.Mitra, S. (2002) Structural models of faulted detachment folds, American Association of Petroleum Geologist Bulletin, 86/9: 1673-1694Stewart, S. (1996) Influence of detachment layer thickness on style of thin-skinned shortening, Journal of Structural Geology, 18/10: 1271-1274 Detachment folding occurs in regions of thick-skinned deformation, where the basement is involved in deformation and thin-skinned deformation, where deformation occurs at relatively shallow depth in the crust. Modes of detachment folding One of the principal ideas that should be recognized in each model is the law of conservation of volume, as conservation is a fundamental law in physics; it should also apply to geology. Two ways to maintain volume conservation are thickening of units and synclinal deflection of incompetent material; it is likely that both may occur. Figure 2. A model of the law of conservation of volume by synclinal deflection; that is the area (given by A then a subscript) of the anticline should be equal to the area of shortening plus the synclinal deflection A1 = A2+A3+A4. Synclinal deflection below the origin (dotted line) is shown marked by the A3 and A4. J. Contreras (2010) developed a model for low amplitude detachments using the conservation of mass equation. The results suggest the occurrence of layer thickening as an initial response to shortening and volume conservation.Contreras, J. (2010) A model for low amplitude detachment folding and syntectonic stratigraphy based on the conservation of mass equation, Journal of Structural Geology, 32, 566-579 Hayes and Hanks (2008) confirm layer thickening during the onset of folding, specifically their field data places the thickening at the hinges of folds rather than the limbs. When defining the geometry of detachment folding it may be necessary to define layer thickening as it has been recorded to affect the overall geometry.Hardy, S. and Poblet, J. (1994) Geometric and numerical model of progressive limb rotation in detachment folds, Geology, 22, 371-374 Though variable limb thickness is assumed; over time, limb rotation and limb length become the dominant mechanisms for deformation, leading to an increase in fold amplitude. Synclinal deflection, figure 2, is the result of folding where synclines, adjacent to an anticline in fold geometry, extend into the lower incompetent unit; these typically occur in regions of high wavelength and low amplitude. The occupancy of this area causes displacement above the detachment in the form of material migration to the anticlinal core.Wiltschko, D.V. and Chapple, W. M. (1977) Flow of weak rocks in Appalachian Plateau folds, American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 61, 5, 653-669 Withdrawal from the regional position is dependent on thickness and viscosity differences between the competent and incompetent units as well as the ductile nature of the incompetent unit, like Contreras, recognized a transition from unit deflection and material migration, to limb rotation and limb lengthening. Detachment fold evolution Though many models have been developed to help explain the kinematic evolution of single layer detachment faulting;Dalstrom, C. D. C. (1990) Geometric constraints derived from the law of conservation of volume and applied to evolutionary models for detachment folding, American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 75, 3, 336-344Suppe, J. (1983) Geometry and kinematics of fault-bend folding , American Journal of Science, 283, 684-721Mitchel, M. M. and Woodward, N. B. (1988) Kink detachment fold in the southwest Montana fold and thrust belt, Geology, 16, 162-165Poblet, J. and McClay, Ken. (1996) Geometry and kinematics of single-layer detachment folds, American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 80, 7, 1085-1109 many models do not account for multiple layers, complex fold geometries or differential strain through fold geometries or mechanically dissimilar stratigraphic units.Fischer, M. and Jackson, P. (1999) Stratigraphic controls on deformation patterns in fault-related folds: a detachment fold example from the Sierra Madre Oriental, northeast Mexico, Journal of Structural Geology, 21, 613-633 These models may not be good indicators of detachment folding on a large scale and are better suited to assist in interpreting fold geometries of detachment folds as their kinematic evolution is generally associated with single fold, single unit deformations. The definition of disharmonic folds (below) however, incorporates many types of symmetric folds over a larger area encompassing many geometries and attributes of the basic models and may be better suited to the application of these models. Figure 3. Disharmonic folding of a detachment fold using a symmetric geometric fold as a model. As compression develops, space issues arise in the anticlinal core. To accommodate these space issues folding becomes tighter within the inner units, creating a disharmonic fold geometry. By incorporating elementary fold geometries under the term disharmonic fold detachment folds may then be classified into one of two categories; disharmonic folds or lift-off folds. Disharmonic folds, figure 3, are defined as detachment folds characterized by parallel geometries at the outer limbs and non-parallel interlimb geometries at stratigraphically distinct and lower units; caused by differential strain as a result of strain dissipation or change in mechanical stratigraphy, where the termination of folding typically results in a detachment. Lift-off detachment folds are characterized by isoclinal folding in all units, with a tight isoclinal folded weak unit in the anticline and parallel geometries sometimes existing along the outer units.Hardy, S. and Finch, E. (2005) Discrete-element modeling of detachment folding, Basin Research, 17, 507-520 Present day examples detachment folding can be found in the Jura Mountains of Central Europe. This region complements the idea of detachment fold evolution put forth by Mitra in that it encompasses many of the basic fold geometries and comprises both disharmonic and lift-off geometries. Disharmonic and lift- off detachment folds are commonly assumed to form by separate modes of deformation; however, Mitra (2003) in a unified kinematic model challenged these ideas by suggesting an evolution of detachment folding wherein progressive deformation yields a fold transition from disharmonic geometry to lift-off detachment folding. While most kinematic models are developed to yield the most simplistic geometries by placing boundary conditions within the model and limiting variables; the unified model incorporates: mechanical stratigraphy parameter limb lengthening, limb rotation, area balancing and anticlinal and synclinal deflection, to develop a system that uniformly demonstrates the evolution of detachment folding. The evolution of detachment folding begins with the model assumption of a low-amplitude and short compressional environment with a mechanically dissimilar incompetent and competent unit. Folding initiates by shortening; limb lengthening and rotation and hinge migration, cause synclinal deflection below its original position accompanied by the flow of ductile material beneath the synclinal trough to the anticlinal core; resulting in increased amplitude of the anticlinal fold.Mitra, S.

(1969) Balanced cross sections, Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 6, 743-757 fail to recognize disharmonic folds as they focus on single layer detachment folding, lack the resolution in experimental methods or, though the assumption of multiple units is made, restrict unit parameters which may cause disharmony through deformation. Continued shortening and excess material within the anticlinal core not only results in increased amplitude and disharmonic folds, but may lead to the onset of thrusts out of the folded synclinal or anticlinal regions. Through further deformation by limb rotation and through hinge migration, isoclinal folds eventually assume lift-off geometries. Thrust faults in the synclinal fold, if any formed, may also be rotated to assist in the formation of detached lift-off folds upon further tightening and rotation (figure 4). Detachment faulting Figure 4. Schematic depicting faulting of a symmetric detachment fold. The result of continued limb rotation and compression is the formation of faults in the forelimb and backlimb of the fold. Eventually these faults reconnect with the detachment and a pop-up may occur. It is documented in many cases that faulting may develop from detachment folding or through the kinematic mechanisms involved with folding.Bowsworth, W. (1983) Foreland deformation in the Appalachian Plateau, central New York: the role of small-scale detachment structures in regional overthrusting, Journal of Structural Geology, 6, 1-2, 73-81 In general, faulting may occur during fault slip and detachment folding in two ways. Firstly, faulting may be induced when progressive folding or tightening of a folded limb reaches its maximum fold geometry resulting in a transition from folding to shearing. Secondly, it has been suggested a fault may propagate into the anticlinal core if material flow and accommodation space are not at equilibrium. The idea of insufficient material flow may not be as well addressed as faulting due to continued folding and rotation, but the grounds for such an argument lay within a strongly held belief of area conservation; without conservation faulting will likely compensate. The basic geometries of detachment faulting of a symmetric detachment fold are shown in figure 4. Refer to Mitra for an evolutionary model of faulted detachment folds in the asymmetric and symmetric settings. Faulting may occur in a symmetric or asymmetric fold, yielding fault geometries that are both alike and dissimilar. Faulting in either setting is reliant on the lock-up and strain accumulation of a fold typically at its critical angle. Asymmetric folding develops in the forelimb (the limb furthest from the source of thrust) of the fold and may either absorb strain into or transmit strain through the stratigraphic units composing the fold. A system that absorbs strain is recognized as a trishear zoneZehnder, A. T. and Allmendinger, R. W. (2000) Velocity field for the trishear model, Journal of structural Geology, 22, 1009-1014 being triangular in shape; while a parallel deformation zone transmits shear across the units of the fold and typically takes on the form of a parallelogram or is rectangular in geometry. These two deformation patterns may exist in a single fold and at some time during continued deformation may reconnect with the detachment. It is also the case that a backthrust may occur in an asymmetric fold geometry as shear across the forelimb due to rotation and migration of beds. Symmetric faults were essentially covered previously under the name ‚Äòlift-off‚Äô folds, see figure 4. Progressive limb rotation and lock-up in a symmetric fold induces shear at both the forelimb and backlimb of the fold which may then result in faults on both limbs causing lift-off. Like the asymmetric fold faulting, as progressive slip along the basal detachment occurs, either the forelimb or backlimb (the limb closest to the source of thrust) thrust may reconnect with the basal detachment. For a more robust definition of faulting reference Mitra 2002.

It is located across the street from Copenhagen Cathedral and Frue Plads, on the corner of N√∏rregade and Studiestr√¶de, in the city centre. Bispetorv, the small square next to it, is named after the building. History=Pre-Reformation situation The Bishop's House stands on the site where Copenhagen's second city hall was built in about 1400. It was a four-winged building in Gothic style. In 1479, a new city hall was completed on nearby Gammeltorv and the old building was taken over by the University of Copenhagen which was founded the same year by King Christian I with the approval of Pope Sixtus IV. At that time, the Roman- Catholic Bishop of Roskilde had his bishop's palace on Vor Frue Plads on the other side of the street, where it had been built after Bishop Henrik Gertsen gave up Absalon's Castle on Slotsholmen to King Valdemar IV in 1350. After the Reformation After the Reformation, the new Lutheran Bishop of Zealand was given the university's building, while the university relocated to the dethroned Catholic bishop's palace. Still Roskilde Cathedral remained the seat of the new Lutheran diocese, as it had been for its Catholic predecessor. After the Great Fire of 1728 The Bishop's House was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 but rebuilt from 1731 to 1732, on the same site but smaller and to a new design by Lars Erichsen, a master builder, who also worked for the university. In 1896, the building underwent a comprehensive renovation and alteration under the architect Martin Nyrop, known for designing the new Copenhagen City Hall completed in 1905. Architecture and decorations Bispeg√•rden The Bishop's House consists of two wings and is built in warm red brick with a black tile roof. The building has timberframing toward the yard. A bay window on the facade toward Studiestr√¶de was added by Nyrop in the 1896 renovation. Below the window, there is a plaque, also designed and written by Nyrop, which commemorates the long history and former uses of the site: It reads: Helt r√¶dsomt man med mig i Tiden monne raade: Som Raadhus f√∏rst jeg stod vor By til Gavn og Baade. 1479. Saa var jeg Studiegaard, men blev, da her i Landet Guds rene Ord fik L√∏b, til Bispegaard omdannet. 1537.

It forms part of Imutaike Prefectural Natural Park. Its plant communities were designated a Natural Monument of Japan in 1921 and sixty hectares of wetlands were designated a Ramsar Site in 2005. Geography Imuta-ike is surrounded by mountains; Funamidake (), San-o-dake (), Katagi-yama (), T≈çmigashiro (), ƒ™-moriyama (, known due to its beauty also as Imuta-fuji), and there is no incoming large river. The outgoing water flows into Sendai River and Hiwagi River. Imuta-ike is in the last stage of the lake-pond formation cycle and is shrinking with the deposition of sediment. The colour of the pond is brown, 14 on the Forel-Ule scale, and its pH is 6.8; the water of the pond contains organic substances.Masaaki Tanaka Nihon Koshoushi 2 2004, University of Nagoya Press , There are many cherry trees around the pond. About one third of its area, to the northwest, is wetland; dotted by floating islands composed of peat. This is very rare in warm areas and the pond was designated a Natural Monument as the \\"peat forming vegetation of Imuta-ike\\" in 1921. Biota On the surface of the pond, phragmites and wild rice grow thick and in the water, there are brasenia, nymphaea tetragona, water caltrop. As for fish, species include Zacco platypus (), Black bass, Carassius langsdorfii and Oryzias latipes. A rare dragonfly, Libellula angelina is found, leading to the pond's selection as a Ramsar Site. Sinanodonta woodiana in Imuta-ike Libellula angelina History Between 300,000 and 400,000 years ago, there were groups of lava domes, 4 km from east to west and 7 km from north to south. The centre of the domes was depressed forming a caldera. The lava dome formed Iimori- yama. The depression collected water and Imuta-ike was formed. Prior to the Taish≈ç era (1912‚Äì1926), Imuta-ike was known for the growth of common rushes (Juncus effusus), the raw material for tatami mats. In autumn, villagers used to cut and bundle rushes. Between 1741 and 1763, a 380-meter tunnel water lane was made at the eastern end of the pond, and 15 hectares of rice fields were made. In 1953, Imuta-ike was made a Prefectural Natural Park.

It was constructed by Charles Thomas Buckland in 1864 who was the commissioner of Dhaka during that period. History Farashganj Charles Thomas Buckland was appointed the commissioner of Dhaka 1864 and he had a very successful tenure at this post for 5 years. Azimush-Shan built a palace for himself in Posht on the bank of Buriganga which was situated about 400 yards away from Lalbagh Fort. The palace is now washed up by the river, but the embankment was visible for a long time. This embankment goes right eastward and terminates at Babubazar Khal. It is clearly visible when passing by boats. According to Rennel, this bund in 1765 extended four miles northeast to southwest. Even though there was already a bund by the Buriganga river bank from the Mughal period, it was Buckland who took the initiative to build a metaled road over it. That is how the road by the riverbank came to be known as the Buckland Bund which is almost one mile long, from Farashganj (French Town) to Babu Bazaar. Initially Buckland collected the funds to build the bund from Dhaka's well established and rich people amongst whom were Khwaja Abdul Ghani, the zamindar of Bhawal Kali Narayan Rai, Jagannath Rai Chowdhury and Mohinimohon Dash. In Nazir Hossain's Book Kingbodontir Dhakai he mentioned Bhutto Hazi as well as one of the financial contributors. Buckland started the construction work with the collection of tk.65, 000 but unfortunately he could not finish the work during his reign of 5 years as the commissioner as he had to leave Dhaka and as believe by many, it was probably Simson the next commissioner finished the work of Buckland Bund. It is said that the fund collected by Mr. Buckland was not enough to finish the construction work, hence his successor Simson arranged more tk.10,000 from the local fund and borrowed tk.8,000 from Khwaja Abdul Gani Miyah to continue the work even though there was still a little financial shortage. Seeing this, Khwaja Abdul Ghani donated Tk.2,000 more to help the cause and tk.2, 000 more was collected as tax from Mohini Mohon Dash to arrange the rest of the fund. A few more information was collected from the autobiography of Hridoynath Mojumder. According to him, during the first year of construction the road was built from Northbrook Hall to Owaiz Ghat and in the next year it was built from Ruplal House to Badamtoli Ghat. The east side was completed with the donation of Ruplal Dash and the west side was completed with the donation of Nawab Abdul Gani whereas the middle part was built with the donation of the government. Northbrok Hall, Dhaka 09 Architectural significance Buckland Bund was a place for recreation and passing time for local people not only in the 19th century but also in the beginning decades of the 20th century. It was a very attractive place to visit for the middle class local people of that time. During C. T. Buckland's period, under government initiative a lot of buildings and significant architectural creations took place in Dhaka. In fact, during the time of his leaving he was offered an ‚ÄúAppreciation Certificate‚Äù from the communities of Muslims, Hindus, Armenians and English which unfortunately he could not accept due to not having such permission from the government. Buckland Bund was a new gathering place for the people of Dhaka as the view of the river was an amazing piece of recreation for them. According to the autobiography of Ridoai Nath Mojhumder, 12 steel benches were provided there at first which were not sufficient so 8 more benches were added. The crowd visiting the Buckland Bund at that time proved that it was a very refreshing place and even today after almost 300 years the place is still used as a social gathering place by the local people. The construction of the bund quickly transformed the area into a very posh place and a lot of zamindars started to erect their mansions on and around this bund. Present condition Buckland Bund was a very elegant riverfront of Dhaka in the early 1900s but has since deteriorated. Academic Partha Chatterjee describes it, in 2002, as \\"one of the most congested streets of the city. As one trudges through the slush and garbage, negotiating the fruit and vegetable vendors and endless stream of rickshaws, one's view of the river blocked off by an ugly wall and with no trees in sight, it is hard to imagine that the road had been built as an attractive riverfront boulevard.\\" During the reign of Ayub Khan, the rights of the bund was transferred to the government from the public in 1963, the bund's maintenance and beauty started to deteriorate.

Finally he zeroed down on Hema Malini, Raveena Tandon and Charmy Kaur, an actress from South India who will be making her Bollywood debut in this movie. Actress Neha Sharma was also interested in doing Kaur's role, but eventually the role went to Kaur. Tandon later said that she signed the movie to work with Bachchan and Jagannadh. For another role in the movie, both Sonal Chauhan and Kangana Ranaut were in discussion, but eventually the role went to Chauhan. The 'mahurat' shot of the movie was done in March 2011 at Khoja Bungalow in Versova. While Jagannadh broke the coconut, actor Sonu Sood featured in the mahurat shot. The event was also attended by Bachchan, his son Abhishek Bachchan, daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, and actress Sonal Chauhan. On 26 April 2011, movie's shooting was disrupted, when Raj Thackeray led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena claimed that there were around 40 foreigners shooting in the movie without proper work permits and visas. MNS filed a police complaint in this regard and later stalled the shooting. Following day, director Jagannadh apologised to the outfit stating that there were indeed few junior foreign artists in the shoot without proper documentation, and assured to be more vigilant in future. Raveena Tandon has also shot for an item song in the film, titled \\"Main Chandigarh Di Star\\".

Ice cream All of its ice cream, and its hot fudge, is freshly made. The ice cream is old-fashioned, with less butterfat, and made without eggs. The ice cream is made in small batches of eight flavors (including chocolate, vanilla, butter pecan, and strawberry) and claims that no preservatives are used. An article in The New York Times described the ice creams as \\"creamy, ethereally light and perfectly balanced.
