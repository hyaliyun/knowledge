In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand. Storylines Slammiversary VIII featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers are portrayed as villains, heroes or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that build tension and culminate into a wrestling match or series of matches. On the May 20 edition of TNA Impact! Sting was ranked number one in the first Top 10 ranking by the TNA Championship Committee and was as a result given a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary. On June 10, Dixie Carter said on Twitter she would have a big surprise at Slammiversary that would ultimately change TNA forever. Also using Twitter, she later clarified her statement to indicate that while there will be a surprise revealed at Slammiversary, it will not be the one said to \\"change TNA forever,\\" which will instead be revealed in the coming weeks.

USS Nicholas Action The frigate was attacked by small arms from a pirate skiff while steaming off the coast of Kenya and the islands of Seychelles. Nicholas returned fire with a 50-caliber deck gun and disabled the vessel and three pirates surrendered. Commander Mark Kesselring ordered the skiff sunk and proceeded to attack the nearby pirate mother ship from which the skiff was operating. After a chase the mothership was captured and two more pirates were taken into United States Navy custody. The pirate mothership was likely a small steam powered vessel fitted out as a naval trawler which are regularly used by Somali pirates. The ship was confiscated by the Americans according to news reports and pirates were put in Nicholas brig, to await court either in Kenya or the United States. That same day, the destroyer , as flagship of Combined Task Force 151, was involved in a pirate attack on a Sierra Leone- flagged tanker, MV Evita. The incident also occurred in waters north-west of the Seychelles. Evita was fired on by three skiffs but was able to escape and increase speed and due to her crew who shot flares at the rifle and rocket- propelled grenade-armed pirates. The attack was reported to the nearby USS Farragut which arrived in the battle area and began operations. The vessels were boarded by American personnel and a SH-60B Seahawk covered the mission from the air. The pirate mother skiff was sunk later on by gunfire or explosives and after the pirates were stripped of their means to commit piracy, they were loaded onto the other two skiffs and freed. Eleven pirates were captured in total. Several fuel drums and grappling hooks were found aboard the boats. The pirate weapons, ammunition and other equipment such as ladders were seen thrown overboard by the Americans before the pirates were captured. Nobody is believed to have been injured during the engagements. Aftermath The captured pirates from the first incident were detained by the United States Navy until it was determined that they would be transferred to the United States to stand trial for piracy. After capture, the pirates were identified as Mohammed Modin Hasan, Gabul Abdullahi Ali, Abdi Wali Dire, Abdi Mohammed Gurewardher, and Abdi Mohammed Umar. The five pirates, were put in the custody of the United States Marshal Service and charged with a variety of piracy and weapons related charges.

The Sze Yap Cantonese group have contributed much to what makes Hong Kong a success. Hong Kong people of Sze Yap origin represented about 18.3% of Hong Kong's total population in 1961, and 17.4% in 1971; today this population still increases as more immigrants from the Taishanese speaking areas of Guangdong in mainland China continue to immigrate to Hong Kong.

It is said that over 100 famous people come from the Sze Yap region of Guangdong, making the region famous for producing more stars than any other city/region in mainland China. As a result, the local government in Jiangmen which administers the Sze Yap or Ng Yap cities of Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, Xinhui, and Heshan, decided to build a Stars Park called Jiangmen star park (). \\"Ê±üÈó®ÊòüÂÖâÂõ≠\\" nddaily .

It is a criminal offense in many jurisdictions. Tampering with evidence is closely related to the legal issue of spoliation of evidence, which is usually the civil law or due process version of the same concept (but may itself be a crime). Tampering with evidence is also closely related to obstruction of justice and perverting the course of justice, and these two kinds of crimes are often charged together. The goal of tampering with evidence is usually to cover up a crime. By law enforcement When police confiscate and destroy a citizen's photographs or recordings of officers' misconduct, the police's act of destroying the evidence may be prosecuted as an act of evidence tampering, if the recordings being destroyed are potential evidence in a criminal or regulatory investigation of the officers themselves. In a notable case in Nebraska, officers were charged with the felony charge of evidence tampering, as well as misdemeanor obstruction and theft, when they committed brutality and forcibly stole and destroyed the recordings, which was exposed due to a third party's recording. On the other hand, when police departments lose exonerating evidence that would create reasonable doubt for defendants in the cases they prosecute, such as dashboard-camera footage from patrol cars, it may be regarded as spoliation of evidence, potentially justifying motions to dismiss and/or mistrials. Police's loss of evidence such as footage may be considered as both spoliation and tampering, if it both exonerates the defendant and proves police misconduct. Spoliation of exonerating evidence in criminal cases may also constitute prosecutorial misconduct if the prosecutor is complicit in doing so.

Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Portrait of Francesco d'Este is a small oil on wood panel painting by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden dating to around 1460. The work is in good conditionFry, 201 and has been in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York since 1931. When attributed as a van der Weyden in the early 20th century, there was much speculation amongst art historians as to the sitter's identity. He was identified as a member of the d'Este family from the crest on the reverse, and long thought to be Francesco's father Lionello, an Italian and highly placed Burgundian prince and patron of Rogier. In 1939 Ernst Kantorowicz identified the man as Lionello's illegitimate son Francesco (c. 1430 ‚Äì after 1475), which is now generally accepted. The panel was painted when the sitter was about 30 years old\\"Francesco d'Este\\". MMoA. Retrieved on 17 April 2010. and is considered one of van der Weyden's finest portraits,Bauman, 38 in many ways a culmination of his later, more austere work. Van der Weyden sought to flatter d'Este; although not handsome, he is shown as broad chested, with a sensitive and cultured face, keen expression, long neck and aquiline nose. The hammer and ring (the latter only revealed after a 1934 cleaning) clutched in his hand are likely intended as status symbols although their exact significance has not been positively identified. Typically of van der Weyden, the sitter's fingers are highly detailed and prominent, shown as almost resting on the lower left of the panel frame, and are long, bony and highly detailed. The painting is unusually secular for the time, seeking to flatter d'Este's worldly position, rather than highlight his devotional worth or personal humility. The portrait follows the structural conventions of van der Weyden's late career male portraits. It is a half length, three-quarters viewFry, 200 of the sitter against a plain and shallow background. The background is one of its most striking features, its shallowness at odds with the deep, shadowed and atmospheric kind popular in Northern art since van Eyck. That the background is layered with white rather the more typical dark grey and black tones has been remarked on by many art historians. Identity of sitter The paintings of the Early Netherlandish masters fell out of fashion after the 16th century, and many disappeared from record only to re-emerge in the 19th century. This work was lost until sometime in the late 1800s when came into the collection of Sir Audley Neeld. There was much speculation as to the identity of the sitter, he was early identified as a member of the d'Este family from the crest shown on the back of the panel. In the early 20th century he was thought to be Francesco's father Leonello, based on similarities to the subject of a portrait of Pisanello. Leonello would have been around 42 at the time, and died from a cranial abscess the following year. Leonello D'Este portrayed by Pisanello. van der Weyden was for a period the highest placed artist at the Ferrarese court At another the time the panel was titled Portrait of a Goldsmith, presumably based on a misunderstanding of the significance of the hammer held in d'Este's right hand.Bauman, 46 Francesco's identity as sitter was established in 1939‚Äì40 by the art historian Ernst Kantorowicz. His representation here bears striking resemblance to a documented contemporary portrait found in a piece of iconography in Rome, as well as to an attributed portrait in the National Gallery of Art, Washington.Hand et all, 191 Francesco d'Este was the bastard son of the highly placed Lionello of Meliaduse d'Este, a marquis of Ferrara, Duke of Modena and Reggio Emilia, and the illegitimate son of Niccol√≤ d'Este III. Francesco spent most of his life as a military officer in the Netherlands, although he returned to Italy a number of times, usually as a Burgundian ambassador.Campbell, 114 He was sent by his father to the Burgundian court in 1444 to be raised and educated with Charles the Bold, and later given the title \\"Marquis of Ferrara\\". It is possible Francesco was killed in 1476 at the Grandson battlefield near Courcelles, in today's Belgium. His identity is established through the coat of arms shown on the reverse of the panel and through the inscription Francisque, also on the reverse. Description=Portrait The portrait was executed around 1460, late in van der Weyden's career, at a time when he was a highly sought after and prestigious portraitist. The panel is noted for its abandonment of the style developed by Jan van Eyck which had become the standard model for northern painters to then, a style perhaps typified by Petrus Christus' 1446 Portrait of a Carthusian. In contrast to the deep atmospheric space the sitters occupy in these works, here d'Este is set against a plain white or ivory flattened background with little shadow, a hark back to the traditions of the style of the International Gothic.Bauman, 28 The portrait is an advancement from the donor portraits common at the time, in part because it celebrates the sitter's earthly, secular values, and is absent of any moralising overtones or religious iconography. It is one of a number of portraits commissioned to an der Weyden by the Dukes of Burgundy from the late 1450s.Allmand, 444 In common with most of van der Weyden's male portraits, d'Este is shown half profile, staring aloofly into the middle distance. The painting has been described as embodying the \\"essence of court society ... with its aristocratic bearing and mannered elegance.\\" d'Este's broad chest is out of proportion to his long boney fingers, and wide enough that his head looks undersized in comparison - it reaches across the width of the canvas. Yet he has a sensitive face and slightly aloof expression, which give the impression of thoughtful dignity, refinement, and a hint of intellectual ennui. He has clear youthful skin accentuated by the white background, a roman style bridged nose, and a projecting lower lip and rounded chin.Wolff et al., 191 Yet he is not a handsome man. van der Weyden forensic style reveals sunken eyes, and heavy lids. His hair is not tightly held back as in the Pisanello portrait of his father, but falls over his ears and across his forehead in an almost monkish style. He holds a hammer and a ring in his right hand. Their exact significance is unknown although they are thought by art historians to be allusions to court ritual and society. The hammer is maybe a symbol of his authority as a knightly nobleman, related to his privileges and duties as a prince of his realm, perhaps connected with tournament ritual. It may also represent the hammer of the holy year, a symbol connected with the Jubilee. The ring held between his thin boney fingers may be a jousting prize. The ring had been painted out and was only rediscovered in 1934 when the painting was cleaned. Reverse The family coat of arms shown on the reverse of the panel The reverse of the panel shows a coat of arms consisting of the family arms quartered with representations of the honours bestowed to the d'Este family by Charles VII of France by letters patent in January 1431. The coat of arms is held by two lynxes-a pun on the word Leonello, his father's first name; another of the animal sits blindfolded on the arms. On either side of the animal are the letters M E - assumed to be abbreviations for Marchio Estenis (Marquis of Este), although they could equally stand for \\"Marchio Estenses\\" a title know to have been used by Leonello.Van de Put, A. \\"Letter to Margaretta Salinger\\". June 1935 On both sides, these letters are bound by tasseled chord. Lettering resembling inscription in the later gothic style above these reads VOIR TOUT (to see all) and is reminiscent of Leonello's motto Quade Vides ne Vide (Shut your eyes to what you see), the latter described by art historian Robert Fry as indicative of the \\"idea of astuteness, the most necessary virtue for a ruler of Leonello's type.Fry, 200-1 The achievement contains Francesco's name in French, the Burgundian court language, and at the top left hand corner the words non plus courcelles (no longer courcelles). This phrase is established as a later addition but has not been satisfactorily interpreted. It may be a reference to the then French village of Courcelles, in today's Belgium. The village is located near the site of the Battle of Grandson, a major defeat for Charles the Bold, where the sitter may have been killed in 1476 (he is last mentioned in records in 1475). Giving the similarity of the crest to that of his father's, as well as the significance of various letterings, many art historians see it as indicative of the illegitimate sitter's aspiration to be recognised as Leonello's son, with all the entitlements and historical recognition such acceptance would entail.Scher, 78 Provenance and attribution The painting was in the possession of Sir Audley Neeld of Chippenham until sold to R. Langton Douglas in 1909. It passed through the collection of Edgar Speyer before it was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Michael Friedsam in 1931. The authorship of van der Weyden has never been seriously contested since the late 19th century, although d'Este was not established as the sitter until 1939. The panel displays many of the typical characteristics of male portraits painted around the time of his visit to England, including the plain, shallow backdrop, the three-quarters view, the slightly pious middle gaze, and the focus on the sitter's thin and delicate hands. The work is exemplary of van der Weydens handling of paint, and its choice and richness of colour marked as one of his c 1460 male portraits completed during his visit to Italy, in the opinion of many art historians, perhaps his finest.

There is, however, still hope that Riedel's works may be recovered in the future, as parts of the various archives of Kaliningrad, post-war K√∂nigsberg, were distributed among Polish and Soviet institutions. It is not clear if he is related to another Georg Riedel, born 1715 in Neidenburg (Nidzica), who was cantor first of the L√∂benicht Church in K√∂nigsberg (1749‚Äì1753), then at K√∂nigsberg Cathedral (1753 to his death in 1791).G.

It is part of the Duisburg: Town and Harbour section of the Ruhr Industrial Heritage Trail. History The Rheinische mill works were commenced with a building erected by Jacob Cohen in 1896. After his death in 1919 his sons William Cohen (then Chairman of the Industry and Commerce Duisburg-Wesel) and Hugo Cohen (Judge of the District Court Duisburg), inherited the mill. With the rise to power of the Nazis the business was confiscated from the Jewish Cohen family on 3 January 1936, and taken over by the brothers Hermann and Wilhelm Werhahn Neuss. The company changed its name to Rheinische M√ºhlenwerke Werhahn. The Cohen family managed to emigrate to South America and survive the holocaust. In 1969, the mill itself was closed down but the storage space was used for state grain reserves until 1994. The demolition was prevented by a public pressure. The master plan by Foster and Partners for the inner harbour included the preservation of the old industrial, storage and office buildings.

The term ‚Äúdraj‚Äù is the Yiddish translation of the German word ‚Äúdrei‚Äù (i.e.: ‚Äúthree‚Äù). Genre and Style Ensemble DRAj focuses their work on the interpretation of Yiddish lyrics. But still, the style of their songs does not correspond to traditional Klezmer music. The musicians rather apply a special composition technique, very similar to the art of composing chamber music. Their main intention is to express their own individual feelings integrating their experience with classical music, modern music and jazz. History Ensemble DRAj was founded in 1996 by Anette Kr√ºger (vocals), Ralf Kaupenjohann (accordion), and Ludger Schmidt (violoncello). But it was not until a year later - after a period of arduous rehearsals that the group considered the songs to be mature enough to be presented to a public audience. The first program, ‚ÄúLieder aus den Ghettos‚Äù (‚ÄúSongs from the ghettoes‚Äù) was first performed in Essen (Kunstschacht Katernberg). In 2000 the first CD Lieder aus den Ghettos was produced (EthnoArt/Essen). In 2001 Ensemble DRAj was invited to perform at the 1. Buenos Aires Klezmer Festival in Argentina. But due to the terrorist attacks on September 11 the concert was cancelled. A year later, the group was invited by the Goethe-Institut of Lisbon to play at the Festival Europa. In 2003 singer Anette Kr√ºger left Ensemble DRAj and Manuela Weichenrieder joined the group. Her first performance with the two instrumentalists took place in the same year at the 1. Klezmer Festival of Bremen. In 2005 German radio station WDR 3 broadcast a special feature about Ensemble DRAj. At the beginning of 2006 the second album Kinderjorn was published (Laika/Bremen). It was characterized as ‚ÄúCD of the week‚Äù by the magazine bluerhythm. It was also WDR (Westdeutscher Rundfunk) that invited the group to perform at the EBU Folk Music Festival 2006 in Finland (Kaustinen) as the only German representative. Some time later Ensemble DRAj took part in the music contest Creole ‚Äì 1. Preis f√ºr Weltmusik aus NRW (Creole ‚Äì First Prize for World Music in NRW) and achieved the recognition as one of the best groups. In November 2006 the group started a new project in Essen together with J√ºrgen Wiersch, a well-known German lyric poet. In 2007 WDR transmitted a live concert given in Dortmund in the famous domicil in Dortmund. In 2008 Ensemble DRAj was invited to perform at the International Yewish Music Festival Amsterdam as the only German group.

It is produced exclusively by TV5 Network Inc. and bills itself as a \\"Barangay hall on-air\\" (referring to the Tagalog term for a community centre). The show aims to resolve minor conflicts between two arguing parties with the help of a panel of counselors that represent the legal, emotional and spiritual disciplines. It bears striking resemblance to the U.S. television show The Jerry Springer Show and the British talk show The Jeremy Kyle Show, but has a Filipino cultural perspective, predominantly with \\"marginalized and impoverished guests\\".Face to Face with Amy PerezRE/VIEW: ‚ÄúJuicy,‚Äù TV5‚Äôs biggest gain! The show is one of the most popular talk shows in the Philippines and has often been labelled as the \\"Filipino version of Jerry Springer\\" but has also proved to be controversial due to the violence exhibited in the show. Hence, the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board has requested that the show \\"tone down physical altercations between guests\\". Overview The program aims to make a televised Barangay Hall, a small local government office where people take arguments to be heard by Tanods (Peacekeepers). It also aims to give its audience lessons by showing the complainant's problems that the hosts and the counselors try to solve. Any citizen in the Philippines who can speak Tagalog can file any complaint about someone which will become the basis for an episode. The production crew then goes over the records available and choose which cases to present on the show. They will then interview the two parties and provide background about the problem. During the show, the host, Amy Perez, will talk to the complainant in-person to describe the problem. This is the Puti or white side. The Sawsaweros (male studio audience involver) and the Sawsaweras (Vice-Versa),may ask some questions or make statements, along with the persons originally involved. After a live interview with the complainant, the opponent is brought on stage and forms the Pula, or red side. Next there is a confrontation, which often results in an argument or even a fight on the stage. As the show progresses, both sides may add another person, to persuade the live audience. Before the guest go on the stage, they undergo security inspection for the safety of both arguing parties. At most key points in the show the host will ask the audience which side they are on, which is answered by the audience by raising signs with the colors for each side. The stage crew is always prepared for a fight and interdicted by two bouncers, designated B1 and B2 while a production crew and the security unit are the backup if more than two people are involved. In most cases the fight scenes are removed from the daytime version of the show, but left in the primetime edition, which is a 60-minute replay. The evening edition is always inspected by the MTRCB before it is broadcast. Paramedics are also available in case of serious injuries. The Trio Tagapayo (Three Advisers) can also give tips and advice to prevent fights. This group is composed of a lawyer, a psychologist and a priest who give legal, psychological, spiritual advice to the two parties respectively. Occasionally the show invites a guest expert as appropriate to the conflict involved. The show sometimes ends with statements from the involved parties that they are not yet ready to be friends again or resolve the problem. After giving the final resolution or not, the host pronounces her final thoughts (or Amy-nan) on the issue. The show also conducts a follow-up to confirm if there is progress or not. Face to Face was developed into a new program, Face the People, which will premiere on October 14, 2013. Amy Perez was supposed to host the new show, along with Gelli de Belen. However, Perez, who resigned as host of Face to Face on July 19, 2013, declined to join the program. Tin-Tin Bersola-Babao was chosen to be co-host instead. Hosts * Amy Perez titled as Tyang Amy (March 22, 2010 ‚Äì July 2012; April 11, 2013 ‚Äì July 19, 2013) * Gelli de Belen titled as Ateng Gelli (July 2012 ‚Äì April 10, 2013) Spin- offs=Untold Stories Untold Stories is a weekly docu-drama anthology on TV5 and is a spin-off of Face to Face. The show features stories featured on Face to Face and ran from September 9, 2010 until September 29, 2012. Critical responses In reviewing the program STIR Editor in Chief Edgar O. Cruz said: \\"The back-of-the-mind thought is that joiners are acting since they are paid\\" and described portions as \\"not very believable\\" and \\"not realistic\\". He added \\"The show gains more credibility points by being more spontaneous.\\" While some critics claim that the show is scripted, host Amy Perez, claims that it is not.

Scotland occupies the northern part of the United Kingdom. The landscape is diverse; ranging from rugged mountain terrain to arable flat land with many rivers and lochs. Biota The flora of Scotland is typical of the northern European part of the Palearctic realm. Prominent among Scotland's sub-biomes are the boreal Caledonian Forest, heather moorland and coastal machairs. The forest once covered almost all of Scotland but now only 1% of the forest remains in 35 isolated areas. Scotland's environment supports 62 species of wild mammals, including wild cats, grey and harbour seals and the most northerly colony of bottlenose dolphins. The black and red grouse populate Scotland's moorland and the country has significant nesting grounds for seabirds. The Scottish crossbill is the only endemic vertebrate species in the UK. Scotland's seas are among the most biologically productive in the world with at least 40,000 species are estimated to live in Scottish waters. 14,000 species of insect inhabit Scotland, including rare species. The population of large mammals rapidly decreased to extinction in historic times. Climate The climate of Scotland is classified as temperate and tends to be very changeable. Warm air from the Gulf Stream makes Scotland's climate much warmer than other areas on similar latitudes. For example, in Labrador, Canada the sea freezes over in winter and icebergs are a common feature in spring and early summer or Fort McMurray, Canada where -35¬∞C is not uncommon during winter. As Scotland occupies the cooler northern section of Great Britain, temperatures are generally lower than the rest of the United Kingdom. The average maximum temperatures in Scotland are 5.0-5.7¬∞C in winter and 20-25¬∞C in summer. The coldest ever UK temperature of -27.2¬∞C was recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains on 10 January 1982 and at Altnaharra, Highlands on 30 December 1985. Met Office: Weather Extremes The hottest temperature ever recorded in Scotland of 32.9¬∞C was recorded at Greycrook, Scottish Borders on 9 August 2003. Rainfall varies widely throughout Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are one of the wettest places in Europe with annual rainfall up to 4577mm. Rainfall Amount Annual Average This type of precipitation is orographic in nature. Wet, warm is forced to rise on contact with the mountainous coast, where it cools and condenses forming clouds. Much of eastern Scotland receives less than 870mm annually in comparison. Snowfall is less common in lowland areas but becomes increasingly more common with altitude. Snowfall map Geography Scotland is located in north-west Europe and comprises the northern third of the island of Great Britain. Scotland is surrounded by 790 islands incorporating the major archipelagos of the Shetland Islands, the Orkney Islands and the Outer Hebrides. Scotland's only land border is with England. It runs 96 kilometres (60 mi) in a north-easterly direction from the Solway Firth in the west to the North Sea on the east coast. The island of Ireland lies 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the south-west tip of the Scottish mainland. Norway is located 305 kilometres (190 mi) to the north-east of Scotland across the North Sea. Land The total area of Scotland is 78,772 km2 (30,414 sq. mi). Scotland has 11,800 kilometres (7332 mi) of coastline. There are three main geographical sub-divisions in Scotland separated by two boundary fault lines. The Highlands and Islands (commonly abbreviated to the Highlands) lies to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault. The Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands lie to the south of this fault line. The Southern Uplands Fault separates these two geographical areas. The Highlands, which make up about 60% of Scotland, are extensive mountainous areas rising to peaks of about 1300 metres (4400 ft). By international standards, Scotland's mountains are not high, but their exposure to changeable and very unpredictable weather influenced by the meeting of European and Atlantic air streams gives them seriousness that is out of proportion with their height. The Grampian Mountains is a mountain range that is to the east of the Great Glen. The mountains are characterised by their large areas of upland plateau. The city of Aberdeen and the nearby surrounding area is more like the Central Lowlands as their fertile plains are not similar to the rest of the highlands. The Central Lowlands make up 20% of Scotland and include the Forth-Clyde Canal. The area became home of widespread industrialisation from the late 18th century onwards. This was based on the large reserves of coal and iron ore found in the Central Lowlands, which was supported by the development of canals and railways. The remaining 20% of Scotland is made up of the Southern Uplands, a pastoral upland area characterised by lines of hills divided by broad valleys. In addition to the main upland zones, there are individual hills that are not part of any ranges. Several of these hills are volcanic in origin and are known by the Scots word law. Examples of these include the North Berwick Law and the Traprain Law. The west coast of Scotland, in particular, is heavily indented and is scattered with fjordlike sea lochs. The east coast is more regular with series of large estuarine inlets, or firths, and long sandy beaches. Much of Scottish coastline consists of machairs, a dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided. Water Scotland is bordered to the east by the North Sea and to the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean. Scotland has many rivers, lochs, reservoirs and estuaries. The River Tay is Scotland's longest river and is 193 kilometres (120 mi) long. Lakes in Scotland are known as lochs, with the exception of the Lake of Menteith and a few man-made lakes. The largest loch is Loch Lomond and is 71.1 km2 (27.5 sq. mi) in area and is Britain's largest freshwater body. In Scotland, water is a plentiful resource. Scotland's numerous lochs and rivers provide all of Scotland's water needs. Like most countries, tap water is treated with chlorine to make it safe to drink. Unlike other countries, tap water charges are included in council tax. Climate change Climate change poses a major threat to Scotland. Tackling climate change in Scotland is a devolved issue for the Scottish government, separate from the UK government. In 2009, the Scottish Parliament passed the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, London, HMSO The act includes the framework for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other duties for government ministers. Climate change has already affected Scotland. Over fifty years, the frequency of winter storms has doubled. The UK has seen nine of the ten warmest summers since 1990. Sea levels in Scotland have risen by 10 cm since 1900. Environmental protection Site-specific nature conservation began in the UK with the creation of the Nature Conservancy in 1948, which later became the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC). It moved from a research- based advisory group to become a campaigning body. The 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act excluded Scotland, but introduced the concept of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which were to become a key part of managing nature conservation.C. R. Warren, Managing Scotland's Environment (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , pp. 184-7. A Countryside Commission Scotland (CSS) was established under the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967.B. Cullingworth and V. Nadin, Town and Country Planning in the UK (London: Routledge, 2003), , p. 329 The SSSI were strengthened by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which for the first time introduced the concept of payments to farmers for inactivity in relation to specific sites and shifted the burden of proof from conservationists having to prove harm, to landholders having to prove that harm was not taking place. The NCC was broken up in 1991 and in Scotland was merged with CSS to produce Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), under a UK-wide Joint Nature Conservation Committee. SNH has a remit for both land and nature conservation and a responsibility towards sustainability and to the consideration of the needs of the Scottish people. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency was established by the Environment Act 1995, and took over the functions in Scotland of the river purification boards, waste regulation authorities and the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate. Its responsibilities include the water environment, air pollution, waste regulation, industrial pollution, radioactive substances and flood risk management.

Biography In Pressburg, where the phrase chadash asur min haTorah (the new is forbidden by the Torah) originated as a contra- modernist slogan, the pursuit of secular studies was discouraged. Yet, Rabbi Hoffman, always an original thinker, exhibited his individualism at an early age. As a yeshivah student, he did not participate in the institution of ‚Äúdays,‚Äù the practice whereby students were hosted for daily meals in different homes. He studied privately and received his matriculation diploma, which enabled him to earn a Ph.D. at the University of Vienna. His doctoral dissertation was entitled ‚ÄúHalachic Elements in the Koran.‚Äù He expressed his independence in other ways as well. While still in Pressburg, he joined the Zionist movement even though most yeshivot, including the Pressburg yeshivah, were anti-Zionist. In 1904, when Theodore Herzl died, Rabbi Hoffman delivered a public eulogy. This fiercely rugged individualism would mark Rabbi Hoffman‚Äôs entire rabbinic career. Hoffman‚Äôs life spanned a period in which the Jewish community experienced cataclysmic changes, such as the holocaust the establishment of the state of Israel, and growth of secularism. After ascending to the chief rabbinate of Radauti in 1912, Hoffman began reaching out to the secular and even anti-religious communities. His defense of the non-religious left a lasting impression on all who knew him. A test of Hoffman‚Äôs tenacity and independence came in 1923 when he was invited to serve as rabbi of the Jewish community (Judische Gemeinde) in Frankfurt am Main. There he succeeded the late Rabbi Nehemiah Nobel (the teacher of Franz Rosenzweig) in the position previously held by the illustrious Rabbi M√°rkus Horovitz, the talmid muvhak of Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer. In this position, Hoffman presided over a community with a vast array of community services including kashrut, mikvaot, etc. Additionally, he served as the head of the Rabbinical court (av beit din) of the community and head of the Hoffmansche Yeshiva. Rabbi Hoffman‚Äôs kehillah existed alongside another Orthodox community of Frankfurt am Main, Adas Yeshurun, founded by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. During Rabbi Hoffman‚Äôs tenure, Rabbi Shlomo Breuer, the son-in-law of Rabbi Hirsch, served as the rabbi of Adas Yeshurun. The very existence of two kehillot (communities) side by side, each with its own system of kashrut, for example, can lead to rivalry and conflict. In this particular case, however, there was another element that institutionalized the conflict ‚Äî the issue of Austritt (secession). When, some 50‚Äì60 years earlier, Rabbi Hirsch began rejuvenating Orthodoxy in Germany, he believed that success would only come by starting anew. That meant seceding from the larger Jewish community‚Äîwhich included Reform Jews‚Äîand creating a totally independent community. This independent community, Rabbi Hirsch insisted, should represent pure and authentic Orthodoxy and be recognized by the government for doing so. To Rabbi Hirsch, any Orthodox community that belonged to an umbrella organization with heterodox groups had no right to represent authentic Torah Judaism. This caused a rift within German Orthodoxy, for while many within the Orthodox community aligned themselves with Rabbi Hirsch‚Äôs philosophy, many others did not. Rabbi Hoffman‚Äôs kehillah did not separate itself from the general community, and therefore, in the eyes of those in Adas Yeshurun, did not represent authentic Orthodoxy. Members of the Adas Yeshurun community constantly attempted to delegitimize Rabbi Hoffman. Rabbi Hoffman‚Äôs lifelong espousal of the philosophy of Jewish peoplehood also explains his deep involvement with the Zionist and Religious Zionist movements (Mizrachi), which were not popular with German Orthodoxy. In fact, Rabbi Hoffman‚Äôs predecessor, Rabbi Nobel, though an ardent Zionist, was quite low-key about his Zionist activities. Rabbi Hoffman, however, publicly immersed himself in Zionist activity. So much so, that he was chosen to head the Mizrachi movement in Germany. He provided the movement with ideological direction. When Dr. Benno Jacob, a noted Bible scholar and leader of Reform Jewry, published an article questioning the religious significance of settling in Israel and arguing that the leadership of the old yishuv was not interested in restoring religious life in the Land of Israel, Hoffman responded, ‚ÄúThe life of religion in the Land of Israel will not be formed by Zionist leaders. It will be formed by throngs of Jews settling there. The enrichment of Jewish values will occur when a society of Jews will entrench themselves and be rooted with their emotions and thoughts on the holy land of the Land of Israel...To involve one‚Äôs self in the settlement of the land of Israel is a religious obligation.‚Äù As Rabbi Hoffman became more active in the Mizrachi movement, he took on leadership positions. Repeating his theme of Klal Yisrael, Rabbi Hoffman elucidated the Mizrachi stance. When Rabbi Avigdor Amiel, the chief rabbi of Antwerp and a leader in the Mizrachi movement, asserted that the differences between Agudah and Mizrachi were not ideological and that Mizrachi‚Äôs joining the World Zionist Organization was ‚Äúan empty formality,‚Äù Rabbi Hoffman responded: ‚ÄúOur joining the Zionist movement is to us more than a formality. It is an inseparable part of Mizrachi ideology to strengthen the idea of Klal Yisrael. And there is no difference whether the issue is one within the local Jewish community or whether it affects World Jewry. It is not sufficient to propagate an ideology in our own homogenous circles. We believe that it is our duty to be active in various organizations for our goals and to bring out into the public domain the religious cultural values that were created.‚Äù This statement encapsulates Rabbi Hoffman‚Äôs ideology: a strong belief in Zionism and a fervent commitment to remain part of the larger Jewish community. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, it took time for the Jewish community to understand the implications of this transfer of power. There were many, among them leaders of the Orthodox Jewish community, who believed that ‚Äúthis too shall pass.‚ÄùZur, Yaakov, (1999) Rabbi Dr. Jacob Hoffman: The Man and his Era Rabbi Hoffman sensed the impending disaster. While he did not want to cause people to panic, he could not allow his community to be lulled into slumber either. Thus, in his public statements, he was forced to juggle between these poles. Soon, however, it dawned on the German Jewish community that the situation was rapidly deteriorating. With the passing of the Nuremberg laws in 1935, the complacency of the Jewish leadership was shattered. During this terribly difficult period, Rabbi Hoffman took on a greater leadership role. Despite the disapproval of the Agudah and the separatists (those who advocated secession), Rabbi Hoffman was chosen to be the sole representative of Orthodox Jewry in the nine-person ruling body of the Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden (the supreme representative body of German Jewry in its dealings with the Nazi regime). He became involved in hatzalah work (acquiring certificates for his yeshivah students to go to Palestine) and spoke in cities throughout Germany to help raise the morale of the Jewish community. During this period he found time to publish papers on such topics as Maimonides as Master of Halachah. In the spring of 1937, Rabbi Hoffman‚Äôs tenure in Frankfurt am Main came to an abrupt end. Without warning, the Gestapo ordered Rabbi Hoffman expelled from Germany on a trumped-up charge that he had engaged in activities that were bound to upset the civil order. None of the efforts to overturn this decision was successful. On March 27, he was deported to Austria. In 1938, Rabbi Hoffman went to the United States on a mission on behalf of German Jewry. When the Nazi government came to power, one of its first measures was to prohibit shechitah (ritual slaughter). Inevitably, the price of imported kosher meat skyrocketed. Upon his arrival in the United States, Rabbi Hoffman hoped to raise funds to provide German Jewish institutions, including hospitals, old-age homes and yeshivot, with kosher meat. Shortly after arriving in New York, Rabbi Hoffman became the rabbi of Congregation Ohab Zedek on Manhattan‚Äôs West Side. Although the synagogue was in an area inhabited by many Hungarian Jewish families, Rabbi Hoffman did not adjust easily. Already in his late fifties, he had to face a new country and language. Furthermore, the ‚Äúempire‚Äù over which he had presided in Frankfurt could not be recreated. While in Frankfurt, members of the kehillah naturally deferred to the chief rabbi, in the United States, congregants had an entirely different relationship with their rabbi. In spite of all these difficulties, Rabbi Hoffman threw himself into his new role. He helped found Manhattan Day School; he became active in hatzalah work; he took on new leadership roles in the Zionist and Mizrachi movements. With the end of World War II, Rabbi Hoffman turned to mobilizing American Jewry in the struggle to establish Medinat Yisrael. In 1954, he moved to Israel, realizing his dream of aliyah. He died in 1956, after serving as a Jewish leader par excellence for almost 50 years. Tikvat Yaakov, a Bnei Akiva yeshivah in Israel, is named for him.http://www.ou.org/publications/ja/5762fall/Book%20Review.pdf ReferencesExternal links *Guide to the Jakob Hoffmann Collection at the Leo Baeck Institute, New York.

Description The length of the shell varies from 12 mm to 30 mm. (Original description) The slender, dull, light brown shell is eight-whorled. The protoconch is large, bubble-shaped, smooth and forms a blunt apex. The subsequent whorls are furnished with numerous (on the whorl next to the last 20, and on the last 27) narrow, little-raised, rounded riblets with somewhat wider interspaces, becoming less distinct and more crowded in the adult near the aperture. The posterior terminations of these riblets are waved, forming an obscure notch-band, each being slightly enlarged close by the suture and also on the anterior side of the band, thus forming two rows of indistinct nodulations, of which the sutural row is more clearly defined than the other. The riblets extend from suture to suture, and near its anterior third become obsolete on the body whorl. Here eight or ten rather indistinct revolving threads exist, becoming more distinct toward the end of the siphonal canal, separated from each other by shallow grooves. These pass round the column into the aperture. The siphonal canal is short and wide. The aperture is simple, with thin margins. The notch is rather indistinct in the adult.Dall, W. H. 1881.

Description The shell is up to 20 mm high, solid, with 5-6 moderately convex whorls and a conical spire. The last whorl is about 70% of total height. Protoconch of one smooth, mucronate whorl. Teleoconch is with a variably developed sculpture consisting of spiral cords and threads, and slightly flexuous or straight axial folds. There are usually three cords on the early spire whorls, rather flat and as broad as the interspaces, later the second-order spiral threads are intercalated. The main spiral cords tend to form small knobs at their intersections with the axial folds, which are narrower than the interspace and may be wanting on part or whole of the spire. Body whorl is somewhat constricted around the canal, which is not delimited by a ridge. Aperture is oval, merging into a broad and short siphonal canal. Outer lip is slightly thickened, smooth inside. Parietal and columellar edge are appressed, forming a thin callus which hardly extends over the previous whorl. Colour is whitish with diffuse, pale brown flames and blotches. Distribution Distribution of Buccinum oblitum include: * Eastern Atlantic, from the Faroes to southwestern Ireland in 300‚Äì1000 m. * Strait of Gibraltar in 362‚Äì526 m. * Gorringe Ridge seamount, moderately common in 155‚Äì1040 m. * Amp√®re and Seine seamounts, rare in 235‚Äì325 m. This apparently disjunct distribution is puzzling, but no appreciable morphological difference can be detected. The type locality stated by Sykes (1911) is \\"Porcupine\\" 1869 sta. 65, which is North of the Hebrides, 61¬∫10'N, 02¬∫21'W, 345 fathoms. The lectotype in USNM is reported (Bouchet & War√©n, 1985, and current USNM calalogue) to be from sta. 55 which is 60¬∫04'N, 06¬∫19'W, 605 fathoms.  Ecology  The type of larval development is direct (non-planktotrophic) inferred from paucispiral protoconch.

However, the latter has not been used as the valid name of a valid species after 1899, whereas Buccinum scalariforme M√∏ller, 1842, can be declared a nomen protectum under Art. 23.9 of the Code. WoRMS maintains this prevailing usage until such nomenclatural act is published. Description The ovate shell is elongated, slightly turreted and pointed at the summit. The spire is composed of seven very convex rounded whorls, united by a shallow suture. Upon the whorls are regularly disposed longitudinal ribs or folds, crossed by numerous, fine, approximate striae, which, by their mutual intersection, cover the surface of the shell. The white aperture is slightly rounded. The thin outer lip is striated internally. The columella is arcuated and is covered by the inner lip.

The aperture is large and a siphonal canal and horny operculum are present. They have two eyes at the base of tentacles, and a well-developed sense of smell. They are usually considered as predatory or scavengers. Their shell length is typically 3.5 cm. Whelks lay eggs in attached masses of lens- shaped capsules, each of which contains 200‚Äì450 eggs. Their egg size is about 275 Œºm, and the capsule diameter is about 5‚Äì6 mm. Buccinid whelks usually hatch from eggs as juveniles, so have limited dispersal capability.

It is of a reddish-brown color, covered transversely with striae and ridges, with some slightly apparent longitudinal striae. The transverse ridges are raised and very prominent. The spire is elongated and contains seven whorls. These are convex and depressed at their upper part. The body whorl is longer than all the others together. The aperture is elongated, ovate, of a reddish yellow, and slightly emarginated at its base. The outer lip is thin, forming at its upper and internal part a sort of small canal at its union with the left lip. The columella is almost straight, subverrucose, and of a reddish yellow.Kiener (1840).

It is generally of a clear fawn color, marked with numerous spots of a deep chestnut or reddish color, oblong or quadrangular, alternating with other similar spots of a dull white. The first, oftentimes, form longitudinal bands. The pointed spire is conical and, formed of six slightly convex whorls, the lowest of which is as large as all the others. They are flattened and angular at the upper part, crowned upon the angle by a subgranulated margin. The suture is accompanied at the upper part of each whorl, by a small, slightly convex and undulating margin. Upon the body whorl are seen nine rounded, transverse, very angular folds. The other whorls are also ornamented with three folds. The spaces between them bear fine transverse striae. The aperture is white, ovate and elongated.

Description The shell size varies between 20 mm and 45 mm, with the average size ranging from 35 mm to 40 mm. Usually the shell has dark brown ribs and orange background, but there are several different variations of color. It is an active hunter of other molluscs, feeding on snails, slugs, mussels and clams. The ovate, bi-conic shell is quite thick and solid. It is of a reddish white, and covered with a brown, velvety epidermis. The six whorls are moderate, pretty distinct, and provided with decurrent, subnodulous striae, of a brownish or blackish red. The intervals are white, and furnished with very fine striae scarcely apparent. The body whorl is much larger than all the others together, and has five or six thick, obtuse longitudinal folds of ribs, which are rarely continued as far as the base of the shell, and oftentimes form only tubercles, particularly in old shells. The aperture is ovate, elongated, whitish, and bordered with yellow. The siphonal canal is slightly prolonged, emargination slight and oblique. The outer lip, which is thickened by age, is denticulated throughout its whole length, and furrowed internally.

Description The length of the shell varies between 30 mm and 50 mm. (Original description) The ovate shell is elongated and spindle-shaped. It is of an olive color. The pointed spire is formed of six or seven slightly convex whorls, the lowest larger than all the others together, slightly angular, and flattish above. The edge of the angle in young specimens, is more prominent, and bordered by a row of pretty apparent tubercles, which disappear with age. The sutures are slightly perceptible. The first three upper whorls are covered with very approximate small longitudinal folds. The others are ornamented externally merely, with numerous, regular transverse striae, between which are distinguished other very delicate ones. These striae are interrupted by elongated white or reddish spots, often presenting grayish flammules upon the upper whorls. The ovate aperture is elongated, attenuated at its two extremities. Its interioris bluish. The whitish columella is smooth, almost straight, and a little twisted at its base.

As a writer of romantic fiction for women, she published over 200 novels, serials, stories and other fiction between 1878 and her death in 1943.Aitken, William Russell. Scottish Literature in English and Scots: A Guide to Information Sources. Detroit: Gale Research, 1982, p. 170. Sutherland, John. The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1990. , pp. 200‚Äì201.Anne Varty, ed., Eve's Century: A Sourcebook of Writings on Women and Journalism, 1895‚Äì1918. London and New York: Routledge, 2000, p. 254. Carol Anderson and Aileen Christianson, Scottish Women's Fiction, 1920s to 1960s: Journeys into Being. East Linton, Scotland: Tuckwell Press, 2000, p. 165. She has been called \\"one of the most commercially successful popular novelists of the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\\". Swan was politically active during the First World War, as a suffragist, a Liberal activist, and a founder-member and vice-president of the Scottish National Party. Early life Swan was born on 8 June 1859 in Mountskip, Gorebridge, Scotland. She was one of the seven children of Edward Swan (died 1893), a farmer and merchant, by his first wife, Euphemia Brown (died 1881). After her father's business failed, she attended school in Edinburgh, latterly at Queen Street Ladies College. Her father belonged to an Evangelical Union congregation, but she turned in adulthood to the Church of Scotland. She persistently wrote fiction as a teenager. Writings Her first publication was Wrongs Righted (1881), as a serial in The People's Friend. This periodical she long saw as the mainstay of her career, although she contributed to many others.Lindsay, Maurice. History of Scottish Literature. London: Hale, 1977, p. 348. The novel that made her reputation was Aldersyde (1883), a romance set in the Scottish Borders that was favourably reviewed. Swan received an autographed letter of appreciation from Lord Tennyson. Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone wrote to The Scotsman that he thought it \\"beautiful as a work of art\\" for its \\"truly living sketches of Scottish character\\".Robert Crawford, Scotland's Books: A History of Scottish Literature. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. Later successes such as The Gates of Eden (1887) and Maitland of Lauriston (1891) owed a debt to the fiction of Margaret Oliphant, who was among her critics, accusing Swan's novels of presenting a stereotypical, unrealistic depiction of Scotland. In a review of Carlowrie (1884), Oliphant went so far as to say Swan \\"presented an entirely distorted view of Scottish life.\\" Because of her dominance over Women at Home, editor- in-chief W. R. Nicoll often called it Annie Swan's Magazine. She became editor of the magazine from 1893 to 1917. While writing for the British Weekly, she became acquainted with S. R. Crockett and J. M. Barrie, whose work like hers was given the unflattering epithet kailyard, an allusion to its parochialism and sentimentality. By 1898, Swan had published over 30 books, mainly novels, many published serially. She also wrote poetry, stories and books on advice, politics and religion. In 1901, The Juridical Review reported that Swan's books were the most favoured by female inmates in Irish prisons.Charles J. Guthrie, \\"Our Punishment of Crime ‚Äì An Admitted Failure\\", The Juridical Review: A Journal of Legal and Political Science, Vol. XIII. Edinburgh: William Green & Sons, 1901, p. 139. In 1906, she was profiled in Helen Black's Notable Women Authors of the Day. She is named as the favourite novelist of William Morel's sweetheart Lily in D. H. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers (1913). (L to R) Helen Crawfurd, Janet Barrowman, Margaret McPhun, Mrs A. A. Wilson, Frances McPhun, Nancy A. John and Annie Swan. Swan used her maiden name for most of her career, but occasionally the pseudonyms David Lyall and later Mrs Burnett Smith. She was a respected public speaker involved in social and political causes such as the Temperance movement. She wrote books and novels on the suffragist movement in Britain, often as David Lyall, such as Margaret Holroyd: or, the Pioneers (1910).Maroula Joannou and June Purvis, The Women's Suffrage Movement: New Feminist Perspectives. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998, p. 116. Elizabeth Crawford, The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866‚Äì1928. London and New York: Routledge, 2001, p. 471. The novel used interconnecting stories that followed a young suffragette, Margaret Holroyd, and dealt with many real problems faced by suffragettes and suffragists, such as disapproval of family and friends, fear of public speaking, physical exhaustion and ethical dilemmas in a rebellious, sometimes militant atmosphere.Jane Eldridge Miller, Rebel Women: Feminism, Modernism, and the Edwardian Novel. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997, pp. 139‚Äì140. From 1924 Swan ran another penny weekly, The Annie Swan Annual. She also wrote several popular novels at this time including The Last of the Laidlaws (1920), Closed Doors (1926) and The Pendulum (1926). After her husband's death in 1927, Swan returned to Scotland, settling in Gullane, East Lothian. In 1930, she received a CBE for her contribution to literature. She remained in politics, becoming a founding member of the Scottish National Party and its vice president. Personal life Swan married the schoolteacher James Burnett Smith (1857‚Äì1927) in 1883. They lived initially at Star of Markinch, Fife, where she befriended the Scottish theologian Robert Flint and his sister.Donald Macmillan, The Life of Robert Flint. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1914, p. 466‚Äì467. They moved two years later to Morningside, Edinburgh, where Burnett Smith became a medical student, and in 1893 to London, where their two children, Effie (1893‚Äì1973) and Eddie (born 1896), were born. While in London they became friends and neighbours with the writer Beatrice Harraden and with Joseph and Emma Parker at a later date in Hampstead.Dr. Robert T. Henry, The Golden Age of Preaching: Men Who Moved the Masses Lincoln, Nebraska: iUniverse, 2005, p. 126. Philip J. Waller, Writers, Readers, and Reputations: Literary Life in Britain, 1870‚Äì1918. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 505. The family moved to Hertford in 1908, where her son Eddie died in a shooting accident in September 1910. Swan's autobiography My Life appeared in 1934 and was reprinted six times within a year. Her final published work was an article for Homes and Gardens, \\"Testament of Age\\", in March 1943. She died of heart disease three months later at her home in Gullane, on 17 June 1943. A collection of her personal correspondence, The Letters of Annie S. Swan (1945) edited by Mildred Robertson Nicoll appeared two years later. Public life During the First World War, Swan resigned her editorial position and volunteered for the British war effort. During the First World War she went to France on a morale- boosting tour and also worked with Belgian refugees. Swan visited the United States in January 1918 and again after the armistice at the end of the year. She met Herbert Hoover, then head of the U.S. Food Administration and lectured on the need to conserve food on the American home front and informed the American public of Britain's wartime contributions. Two successful plays, Getting Together by John Hay Beith and The Better 'Ole by Bruce Bairnsfather, were written for the occasion.William George Lyddon, British War Missions to the United States, 1914‚Äì1918. Oxford University Press, 1938, p. 186. While in the United States, she also wrote a book on the cultural differences between women in Britain and the United States entitled: As Others See Her: An Englishwoman's Impressions of the American Woman in War Time (1919). Swan was an active Liberal throughout her life and became a well-known suffragist. Shortly after the Representation of the People Act 1918 gave women the vote in Britain, she was the first female candidate, standing unsuccessfully for the Maryhill division of Glasgow in the general election of 1922. Of 32 female candidates across Britain in that general election, only two were returned. Annie Burnett Smith After her defeat, the Women's Freedom League claimed that Swan and other female candidates would have been elected under a system of proportional representation like those in Ireland, Netherlands and Germany.Cheryl Law, Suffrage and Power: The Women's Movement, 1918‚Äì1928. London and New York: I. B. Tauris, 2000, p. 153. She was also a founding member and one-time vice president of the Scottish National Party.Christopher Harvie, No Gods and Precious Few Heroes: Twentieth-century Scotland. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998, p. 124. Jack Brand, The National Movement in Scotland. London, Henley and Boston: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 236. Later life Swan's husband died in 1927 and she and her daughter moved to Gullane, East Lothian. She was made a CBE in the 1930 Birthday Honours for literary and public services. She died at her home in Gullane on 17 June 1943, aged 80. Posthumous reputation In the years since her death, there has been little study of her life or work by literary historians. Articles such as Edmond Gardiner's \\"Annie S. Swan ‚Äì Forerunner of Modern Popular Fiction\\" (1974) and Charlotte Reid's \\"A Cursory of Inspection to Annie S. Swan\\" (1990) pointed to her literary contributions. Several of her novels have reappeared in the last decade.

Description The size of the shell varies between 25 mm and 45 mm. The ovate, conical shell is smooth and reddish brown. The spire is composed of six whorls, whose length slightly exceeds that of the aperture. The whorls of the spire are convex, bent obliquely at the suture, and marked in that part by slightly projecting and distant longitudinal folds. The body whorl is partially free of these, and those perceptible there, are only slightly obvious on the upper half of the side of the aperture. The aperture is ovate and smooth. The lips are a whitish, clear fawn-color, but the depth of the cavity presents the same tint as the exterior. It is narrower towards the base, where it terminates by a shallow emargination, the edges of which are slightly curved towards the back. The outer lip is simple, sharp upon the edge and effuse. It has, towards its upper part, an oblique fold, which seems to widen the aperture and partially forms the obtuse angle. The columella is almost straight, shining, and of a livid color.Kiener (1840).

Description The length of the shell varies between 14 mm and 27 mm. (Original description) The small, thin, delicate shell is translucent, subfusiform. It contains a rather slender, acute spire; a short, straight siphonal canal ; and a few raised, strong, revolving cinguli . The suture is impressed. It has six to seven convex whorls, usually with three (rarely five or six) prominent, rounded cinguli, or carinae, separated by much wider, broadly concave interspaces. The uppermost one is usually some distance below the suture, and is often stronger than the rest, producing a slight shoulder. On the body whorl, in specimens with six whorls, there are about seven to nine principal carinae, occasionally with a smaller one interpolated, and becoming more crowded anteriorly. On one specimen with seven whorls, there are thirteen principal cinguli. Fine, delicate and close, raised lines of growth, or lamellae, cover the interspaces and cross the raised cinguli. The protoconch is very small, smooth and glossy. The first whorl is minute and regularly spiral, not upturned. Three spiral cinguli appear on the second whorl. The aperture is elliptical. The thin outer lip is rounded, incurved at the base of the siphonal canal, which is narrow, but very short, and straight. The columella is nearly straight in the middle. The epidermis is thin, lamellose, but not ciliated. The color is yellowish or grayish white. The operculum is ovate, with the outer or left end rounded and incurved, forming a small lobe, defined by a notch, and with the nucleus central to this small lobe. The odontophore is very slender. The outlines of the median plates are indistinct. They bear three very small but distinct and nearly equal denticles. The lateral teeth of the radula have only two denticles. Verrill, A. E. 1882.

The two or three upper whorls have a strong central keel. The rest show irregularly placed distant rounder tubercles. The body whorl is rounded, not keeled. The inside of the aperture is white. The erect egg-cases are ovate-oblong, on an expanded base and contracted beneath. The granular surface is deeply punctated. The white, opaque, outer coat of the shell is very much inclined to separate from the inner or central coat, which presents, where the outer coat is removed, a smooth surface of yellowish or brown colour.J.E.

Biography Payne was born in Annan in the old county of Dumfriesshire, the son of a Mason. He was educated at Annan Academy (along with fellow artist William Ewart Lockhart). He initially made his living as a house painter before becoming an artist. Payne moved to Derby in 1869 and was recorded as living at several places in the county of Derbyshire in the 1880s including Duffield and Barrow upon Trent. Payne was a student of George Turner \\"Derbyshire's John Constable\\") who also lived in Barrow upon Trent. Payne's carving of two anglers won the 1882 Derby Art Gallery medal for industrial art and the sculpture and medal have now been repurchased by the gallery.Two Anglers, Derbyshire Museums, accessed September 2011 Payne became a rural landscape and trompe l'oeil artist. He exhibited at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (R BSA), the Nottingham Museum and Art Gallery, and was a member of the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA). He is regarded as one of the best of the 19th-century Birmingham artists. In 1891, Queen Victoria visited Derby to lay the foundation stone of the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary and to knight Sir Alfred Haslam. The scene in the market place where hundreds of people, soldiers, horses and bunting turned out to meet Queen Victoria was captured by Payne. This painting is now in Derby Museum and Art Gallery, but he also has work in his home town.Harvest Home and Golden Corn , David Payne, 1875 Payne married and had 14 children.

Description The shell size varies between 25 mm and 50 mm. The surface of the shell may be cream or reddish-brown, with one or two subsutural darker bands. The interior is white or pale purple. This shell has shouldered whorls, with strong axial ribs and a papillose surface. Outer lip is crenulate, with several strong lirae into the aperture. The ovate, oblong shell is rough, and slightly turreted. Its entire surface is apparently armed with small spires. The spire is pointed and composed of nine or ten rather convex whorls, furnished with longitudinal folds or ribs, somewhat distant, and formed by the elevations of transverse striae, which are also cut transversely by other striae elevated and resembling sharp scales. These are a little more prominent upon the convexity of the longitudinal ribs than in their interstices, and it is their prolongation in this part, which causes them to resemble small spines. Its color is reddish, varied with fawn-colored or clear chestnut-brown spots. Oftentimes the lower whorl presents, towards its middle, a transverse brown band, the half only of which can be seen upon the upper whorls, the whole length of the sutures. The aperture is whitish, ovate, elongated, and narrowed towards its base. The outer lip has a slight obliquity, relatively to the axis of the shell. It is slightly crenulated upon the lip, and furnished interiorly with fifteen or sixteen transverse striae which are continued even to the depth of the cavity. The emargination is very oblique, accompanied externally by a thick, rounded, and twisted varix, which, revolving around the axis, terminates below the folds of the columella. This is slightly arcuated; one or two oblique folds are delineated at its base.Kiener (1840).

Description The shell size varies between 10 mm and 20 mm. This shell is quite variable in pattern and shape. Usually it is quite elongated, with strong axial ribs. It shows a brown or yellowish background with paler nodules and one or two suprasutural white bands along the spirals. The interior is white. The ovate, subfusiform shell is pointed at its summit. It is composed of eight very distinct whorls, a little swollen, ridged lengthwise by several subnodulous folds, covered also by transverse striae and ridges. The aperture is ovate, violet, edged with reddish, and narrowed at its base. The outer lip is deeply furrowed within. The columella is nearly straight, subgranular; rarely having a distinct fold at the base. The general color is brown, varied with fawn color, with a white zone at the base of each whorl, a broader decurrent band towards the middle of the body whorl.Kiener (1840).

Through the various filing requirements imposed by these regulatory bodies, Paulson makes regular disclosures regarding its portfolio holdings across various jurisdictions. History=Early years Paulson & Co. Inc. was established by its founder and President, John Paulson, in 1994. Paulson has invested in a number of undervalued companies that are acquisition targets, aiming to increase the bid price on these companies as a large shareholder. In 1997, Paulson, which owned a 6.2% stake in Washington National Corp., opposed PennCorp Financial Group Inc.'s $400 million deal to takeover Washington National, calling the terms of the deal \\"inadequate\\". This holding out paid off when another suitor, Conseco Inc., purchased Washington National for $410 million. The Financial Crisis In 2005, Paulson Co. analyst Paolo Pellegrini convinced John Paulson of the danger of weak credit underwriting standards, excessive leverage among financial institutions and a fundamental mispricing of credit risk particularly in the housing market. Paulson began \\"shorting\\" this credit risk by purchasing the hitherto obscure derivative known as credit default swaps to \\"insure\\" debt securities (Paulson Co. did not own those securities it was \\"insuring\\", but merely believed they would default) they thought would decline in value due to weak credit underwriting. The bubble continued to grow through 2005 and 2006, but by 2007 began to deflate. In one later widely publicized deal, Goldman Sachs put together a \\"synthetic\\" collateralized debt obligation (CDO) called ABACUS 2007-AC1 where investors (such as the European banks IKB Deutsche Industrie, and ABN Amro, and the New York insurance company ACA Financial Guaranty)John Paulson's Very Bad Year By Sheelah Kolhatkar businessweek.com 28 June 2012 provided the \\"long\\" by taking the risk from subprime mortgage bonds, effectively providing Paulson with insurance in the case of subprime mortgage default.Morgenson, Gretchen; Story, Louise: Banks Bundled Bad Debt, Bet Against It and Won. New York Times, December 23, 2009. The deal was made in late April 2007 and several months later the bonds began to default and Paulson eventually made about $1 billion total from those investors' losses. In total Paulson reportedly earned $15 billion on $12.5 billion of investment in 2007‚Äîa return of over 100%.Paulson, John. Statement to U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. November 13, 2008.Gross, Daniel. \\"The Greatest Trade Ever\\". Newsweek. November 10, 2009. In 2008, Paulson's bearish outlook on the credit markets continued. Paulson believed that credit problems would expand beyond subprime mortgages into consumer, auto, commercial and corporate credit, stressing financial institutions and causing some to fail. This led them to take short positions in several large financial institutions in the US and the UK that had high degrees of leverage, high concentrations of assets in deteriorating sectors and rising credit costs. Sectors include mortgage finance companies, specialty finance companies and regional, national, and global banks. In September 2008, Paulson bet against four of the five biggest British banks including a ¬£350m bet against Barclays; ¬£292m against Royal Bank of Scotland; and ¬£260m against Lloyds TSB.Mackintosh, James. \\"Paulson's hedge fund targets UK banks\\".

Bloomberg. June 13, 2007. =Criticism and lawsuits= Paulson has been criticized in the ABACUS investment for paying Goldman $15 million to put together what was a collection of \\"toxic\\" subprime securities with his help (creating \\"the concept\\" of the \\"ethically challenged 'synthetic' securities\\") to be sold by Goldman to long investors so that Paulson could bet against it, a process critics complained was \\"sleazy\\", or the work of those lacking a \\"moral compass\\", though not illegal. Paulson has replied that they \\"were not involved in the marketing of any Abacus products to any third parties,\\" and that \\"Paulson did not sponsor or initiate Goldman's Abacus program.\\" In April 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Goldman Sachs over the ABACUS Synthetic CDO alleging Goldman had represented the assembler of the mortgage package underlying the CDOs as an objective third party (ACA Management), when in fact a \\"short\\" standing to reap great financial benefit in the event the CDO's default (Paulson) had a major role in assembling the mortgage package. Paulson released a statement saying that it was \\"not the subject of this complaint, made no misrepresentations and is not the subject of any charges\\".Text of civil complaint in SEC v. Goldman Sachs & Co. et al.Reckard. E. Scott. \\"Hedge fund operator John Paulson a key player in SEC case against Goldman Sachs\\". Los Angeles Times. April 17, 2010. Goldman neither admitted nor denied the SEC allegations, but three months later paid $550 Million to settle the charges (the largest penalty a Wall Street company has ever paid to the SEC), acknowledging that it gave investors \\"incomplete information.\\" In 2011, ACA Financial Guaranty ACAFG.UL filed a lawsuit against Paulson for $120 million, claiming Goldman Sachs and Paulson \\"deceived ACA into believing Paulson was investing in the CDO\\". Paulson made money betting against ACA's position in the CDO. In 2013, Paulson asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, alleging ACA had relied on \\"mischaracterizations, emails unrelated to Abacus, and snippets of correspondence taken out of context.\\" Recovery and bankruptcy investment Paulson also has a long track record of investing in distressed debt, bankruptcies and restructurings. The 2008-2009 financial crisis resulted in a record high level of defaults and bankruptcies across numerous industries, and Paulson was a large investor in many of them, including the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and liquidation. At the end of 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent turmoil in the markets, Paulson became selectively bullish. It launched a fund dedicated to restructuring and/or recapitalizing companies such as investment banks, hedge funds, insurance and hotel, that were feeling the pressure of the more than $345 billion of write downs of under-performing assets linked to the housing market. By providing capital to companies at \\"trough valuations\\", Paulson believed it would enable the firms to survive the crisis while Paulson would profit from recovery by buying at the market bottom. Amongst some of the holdings disclosed in Paulson's June 30, 2009 13F filings were 2 million shares of Goldman Sachs as well as 35 million shares in Regions Financial.Woo, Terry. Two Ways: John Paulson Ups the Ante. Minyanville Gazette. August 13, 2009. Retrieved August 13, 2009. Paulson also purchased shares of Bank of America in the spring of 2009 when the bank was forced to recapitalize its balance sheet following the results of the bank stress tests conducted by the US government, and was reported to have a 1.22% stake in the bank in 2011. According to Bloomberg, Paulson purchased the shares expecting the stock to double by 2011.Wolinsky, Jacob. \\"Fair Value Of Bank Of America: Is There A Flaw In John Paulson's Math?\\".

In the words of John Paulson, \\"We view gold as a currency, not a commodity. Its importance as a currency will continue to increase as the major central banks around the world continue to print money.\\" =2011 to present= In 2011 PCI was ranked as the \\"world's fourth-largest hedge fund\\" with $36 billion in assets under management. However, during the course of that year his Advantage fund lost 36% and Advantage Plus 52%. The funds also had double-digit losses the next year. An unsuccessful investment in the Sino-Forest Corporation and a drop in the price of gold were in part responsible. In August 2013, Paulson entered into a merger agreement for the acquisition of Steinway Musical Instruments in a transaction valued at approximately $512 million.Steinway Musical Instruments, Inc.- Investor Relations - Press Release The company initiated a tender offer within five days for all of the outstanding stock, and Steinway Musical Instruments board recommended that shareholders accepted the offer. In September 2013, Paulson announced the completion of acquisition of Steinway Musical Instruments.

Description The length of the shell attains 15 mm, its diameter 7 mm. (Original combination) The small shell is pretty regularly fusiform. It has an elevated, rather acute spire, which forms nearly one-half the total length of the shell. It contains six to seven moderately convex whorls, with an impressed suture. The sculpture consists of about twelve rather prominent, stout longitudinal ribs, wliicli run nearly straight across the whorls. And on the body whorl these extend to the base of the siphon. These are separated by deeply concave intervals of about the same width. The whole surface is covered by strongly marked revolving cinguli, which cross both the ribs and their interspaces, and thicken so as to form small, rounded nodules where they cross the ribs. These are separated by interspaces of about the same width, in the middle of which there is a much smaller, thin revolving cingulus, alternating pretty regularly with the larger ones around the periphery. On the anterior part of the body-whorl, and sometimes at the periphery, there are two or three small revolving cinguli in some of the interspaces. On the penultimate whorl there are usually five to seven of the primary cinguli, and on the body whorl and siphon there are about eighteen to twenty. The whole surface is also covered, in perfect specimens, with fine, slightly elevated, wavy lines of growth, which are most conspicuous on the intervals between the ribs. They are usually worn off from the more prominent parts of the ribs and nodules. The protoconch consists of about 2¬Ω regularly coiled whorls. The first two are small, smooth, translucent and somewhat lustrous. The last is covered with rather faint revolving lines, crossed by the lines of growth, which gradually merge into the longitudinal sculpture of the normal whorls, there being no very distinct demarcation between the protoconch and the next whorl. The apical whorl is minute, regularly increasing. The aperture is elongated, ovate-fusiform; The outer lip is thin, sharp and regularly curved. The inner margin is regularly arched. The columella is somewhat elongated, its margin sinuous and somewhat excurved at the tip. The siphonal canal is narrow and somewhat elongated, a little curved. The color of the shell is bluish white. The epidermis is very thin, pale grayish or yellowish white.Verrill, A. E. 1884.

He worked in academia until 1938, when he became an official in the Norwegian Ministry of Church and Education. During the German occupation of Norway, he fled the country and worked with its government in exile. After the war, he returned to the education ministry until his retirement. Family and early life Devik was born in Gjerdrum to headmaster Ole Gabriel Johnsen Devik (1856‚Äì1941) and his wife Marthe Klausdatter L√∏nnebotn (1857‚Äì1929). His parents hailed from Gloppen and Hyllestad. He took the examen artium at Kristiania Cathedral School in 1904, and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.real. degree in 1911. Starting in 1908 he worked as an assistant to Vilhelm Bjerknes in geophysics and meteorology. He was subsequently an assistant to Kristian Birkeland from 1911, studied at the University of Heidelberg from 1913 to 1914, and was hired at the Royal Frederick University in 1914. From 1915 to 1918, he worked and lived at Haldde in Alta, together with Ole Andreas Krogness, who ran an aurora borealis observatory. The two successfully suggested the establishment of a geophysical institute in Troms√∏; both moved there to work in 1918. Their work culminated in the establishment of \\"V√¶rvarslinga for Nord-Norge\\", the weather forecast of Northern Norway, in 1922. In 1922 Devik was appointed to the position of Physics Docent at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. From 1923 to 1932 he held lectures in physics at Noregs l√¶rarh√∏gskule. Together with school teacher Sverre Bruun he wrote textbooks for schools; L√¶rebok i fysikk for middelskolen (1928) and L√¶rebok i fysikk for realgymnasiet (1933). Their book was reissued many times, and competed with Daniel Isaachsen and Gabriel Gabrielsen Holtsmark's Fysikk for gymnasiet. Bruun and Devik released L√¶rebok i fysikk for realskolen og de to f√∏rste klassene i gymnaset (1939, later reissued) and L√¶rebok i fysikk for ungdomsskolen (1964, later reissued). In 1931 Devik published the thesis Thermische und dynamische Bedingungen der Eisbildung in Wasserl√§ufen, which earned him the dr.philos. degree in 1932. In the same year he started working for the Chr. Michelsen Institute. Government service In 1938 Devik left academia and became deputy under-secretary of state in the Ministry of Church and Education. Following the German invasion and occupation of Norway in April 1940, Devik continued at the request of Norway's exiled government, but he was fired in 1941. He was offered a professorship, but declined and spent the next year as a freelance lecturer. In 1942 he was fired from that job too, and in 1943 he fled to the United Kingdom where he worked for the government-in-exile for the rest of the war. After the war he returned to the Ministry of Church and Education, retiring in 1956. The years saw the beginning of the huge growth in higher education in Norway. Among others, the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund, the University of Bergen and SINTEF were created. While studying he chaired the Norwegian Christian Student Association for a semester. He was a board member of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation from 1934. After the war he was a board member of the Foundation for Student Life in Oslo, and he was a member of NTNF from 1946 to 1959 and NAVF from 1949 to 1957. He was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters from 1928, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1932 and the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences from 1956. He was an honorary member of the society Norsk Geofysisk Forening, and published a small 50th anniversary history of the society in 1967 together with Peter Martin Thrane. He was appointed to the First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, as a Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog and as a Commander of the Order of the Polar Star. He was married to Dagny Othilie Hansen (1892‚Äì1988) since July 1915, and died in April 1987 in Oslo.

Published in 1989, it tells the story of Francis Urquhart, a fictional Chief Whip of the Conservative Party, and his amoral and manipulative scheme to become leader of the governing party and, thus, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. A television adaptation, written by Andrew Davies and produced by the BBC was aired in 1990. A six-part radio adaptation of the first novel, written by Neville Teller aired on BBC Radio 4 in 1996.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0153nnh In 2013, the serial and the Dobbs novel were the basis for a US television adaptation set in Washington, D.C., commissioned and released by Netflix. The novel was followed by two sequels - To Play The King and The Final Cut. Both were adapted for television by the BBC and aired in 1993 and 1995 respectively. Background Michael Dobbs began working for the Conservative Party in 1977, and from 1986 to 1987, served as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Chief of Staff. Dobbs fell out with Thatcher during a cabinet meeting on 4 June 1987, exactly one week before that year's general election. Thatcher was concerned she would lose the election, and according to one participant at the meeting, she was \\"almost hysterical, with her arms sweeping everywhere\\". According to Dobbs, \\"It all started because Maggie Thatcher beat me up and was actually rather cruel to me. She took out all her pain and anger and frustration on me, when in fact I was perhaps the most innocent person in the room at the time.\\" Shortly after leaving his post as Chief of Staff in 1987, Dobbs and his wife visited Malta on holiday. While sitting beside a swimming pool in Malta, Dobbs scribbled the letters \\"FU\\" and a drawing of two raised middle fingers on a piece of a paper. The letters would become the initials of House of Cards protagonist, Francis Urquhart. Dobbs stated that he had not planned to write the book saying, \\"None of this was planned. It was all a bit of a joke, an accident. I had no intention of being a writer, or even finishing the book. It was just a holiday distraction.\\" Dobbs insists that it is not a \\"book of revenge\\", but \\"most of the stuff I put into House of Cards was material from events I'd either seen, or participated in, or done, or watched other people do.\\" Dobbs has also stated that the book was not a comment on contemporary politics, and also drew inspiration from the works of Shakespeare. Plot Following the resignation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the ruling Conservative Party is about to elect a new leader. In the subsequent leadership election, the moderate but indecisive Henry \\"Hal\\" Collingridge emerges victorious. Francis Urquhart, an MP and the Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons, is secretly contemptuous of the well-meaning but weak Collingridge, but expects a promotion to a senior position in the Cabinet. After the general election, which the party wins by a reduced majority, Urquhart submits a memorandum to Collingridge advocating a cabinet reshuffle that would include a prominent ministerial position for Urquhart himself. However, Collingridge ‚Äì citing Harold Macmillan's political demise after the 1962 Night of the Long Knives ‚Äì- effects no changes at all. Urquhart resolves to oust Collingridge. Urquhart exploits his position as Chief Whip to leak inside information to the press to undermine Collingridge, ultimately forcing him to resign. Most of his leaks are to Mattie Storin, a young reporter for The Daily Telegraph. Urquhart then eliminates his enemies in the resulting leadership contest by means of fabricated scandals that he sets up himself or publicizes. These include threatening to publish photographs of Education Secretary Harold Earle in the company of a rent boy; causing Health Secretary Peter MacKenzie to accidentally run over a disabled man; and forcing Foreign Secretary Patrick Woolton to withdraw by blackmailing him with an audiotape of a one-night stand. His remaining rival, Environment Secretary Michael Samuels, is alleged by the press to have supported far-left politics as a university student. Urquhart thereby reaches the brink of victory. Prior to the final ballot, Urquhart murders the party's drug-addicted and increasingly unstable public relations consultant, Roger O'Neill, whom he forced into helping him to remove Collingridge from office. Urquhart invites O'Neill to his country house near Southampton, gets him drunk, and puts rat poison in his cocaine. Mattie untangles Urquhart's web and confronts him in the deserted roof garden of the Houses of Parliament. He commits suicide by jumping to his death. Revision After the initial TV series the author revised the published novel to bring it in line with the UK TV series, in which Urquhart throws Mattie from the roof rather than committing suicide, thus allowing for a continuation of the story. The name of the newspaper that Mattie Storin works for was changed from The Daily Telegraph to the fictional The Chronicle, same as the TV series. Sequels The novel was followed by two sequels - To Play The King and The Final Cut. Adaptations A television adaptation, written by Andrew Davies and produced by the BBC was aired in 1990. In 2013, the television series and the novel were the basis for a US television adaptation set in Washington, D.C., commissioned and released by Netflix. In 2018 was announced an Argentinian adaptation produced by Pol-Ka and Cablevision Flow.

It lies at the western edge of the Great Sandy Desert bioregion and within the Mandora Station pastoral lease. The marsh is part of the 3337 km2 Mandora Marsh and Anna Plains Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for supporting large numbers of waders and waterbirds.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Mandora Marsh and Anna Plains. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 010/08/2011. Description Mandora Marsh has formed over thousands of years on what used to be the lower reaches and estuary of an ancient river. The main features are two large lakes which are flooded after heavy cyclonic rainfall. The westernmost Lake Walyarta is a claypan that extends eastwards about 30 km from the inland side of the Great Northern Highway. Although its width may reach 5 km, the depth of water never exceeds 2 m. The eastern lake is separated from Walyarta by a calcrete ridge. It is a broad and braided drainage line containing islands of vegetation that floods extensively but soon dries out to a series of isolated salt and claypans. Connecting the lakes is Salt Creek, a mangrove-lined watercourse about 5 km long and 20 m wide. It holds permanent water and appears to be fed by a series of soaks.Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands: Eighty-mile Beach. Black-winged stilt Bilby Australian feral camel Despite its alternative name, as well as its saline wetlands Mandora Marsh includes a number of permanent or almost permanent freshwater swamps supplied by springs along the southern side of the two main lakes. The springs are usually formed of a central, raised mound, 2‚Äì3 m high, of saturated peat, supporting a mixture of Melaleuca and Sesbania trees, with mangroves appearing at the saline and brackish springs. The springs vary in size from 0.1 to several hectares; each spring's mound is generally surrounded by a moat, varying from a maximum depth of 50 cm to isolated shallow pools or just wet soil. Many springs also support small stands of cumbungi with the understories of some dominated by the fern Achrostichum speciosum. Thickets of saltwater paperbark are found where flood waters remain longest; stock watering bores have been established in these thickets and the watering troughs are used by waterbirds throughout the year. The most spectacular of the springs is Mandora Soak, a raised peat bog estimated to be 7000 years old. Flora and fauna Some 269 species of vascular plants, from 55 families, have been collected from Mandora Salt Marsh. This includes 37 species from the Poaceae, or true grass family, and nine introduced weeds. The most inland occurrence of mangroves in Australia is an isolated stand of grey mangroves in the eastern lake of the marsh, 60 km inland from Eighty-mile Beach.Graham (2001), p.326. A new species of bush tomato, Solanum oligandrum, known only from the Mandora Marsh area, was first described in 2001. A total of 55 species of waterbirds have been seen at the marsh, of which at least 13 species have been recorded breeding there. Particularly common ones include black-winged stilt, whiskered tern, grey teal, white-necked heron, and great egret. Australian pelicans and black swans breed there in large numbers when floods make conditions suitable. The threatened bilby, which is specially protected by the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, has been recorded in sandy sites within the marsh. Altogether, 22 species of mammal, 49 reptiles and six frogs have been recorded there, while a new goby species has been discovered in Salt Creek. Traditional ownership The Mandora Marsh is of high cultural significance to the Nyangumarta people, who hold native title over the area.

It is registered with The Charity Commission in the UK (803480). The association has over 9,000 members and fellows together with over 5,000 students. Members and fellows use the practising title of 'Taxation Technician' or ‚ÄòTaxation Technician (Fellow)‚Äô and the designatory letters 'ATT' and 'ATT (Fellow)' respectively. The ATT is based in London, UK. Although an independent organization, the ATT shares back-office services with the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT). The association is a charity and a leading professional body for those providing UK tax compliance services. Its primary charitable objective is to promote education and the study of tax administration and practice. One of its key aims is to provide an appropriate qualification for individuals who undertake tax compliance work. It contributes to consultations on the development of the UK tax system and seek to ensure that, for the general public, it is workable and as fair as possible. The ATT is a technician level qualification which entitles those who have completed the exams and obtained relevant supervised work experience to call themselves taxation technicians. Training may be provided by other organizations. For example, BPP University provides courses for students who plan to sit the ATT examinations to qualify as a taxation technician. As well as passing the exams, students seeking certification as a registered Taxation Technician must be able to show that they have two years' of acceptable practical experience. Higher Apprenticeship framework In 2011, the UK government launched the Higher Apprenticeship FundHigher Apprenticeship Fund, https://www.gov.uk/government/news/10-000-higher-apprenticeships-to-help- business to support a new wave of Apprenticeship frameworks. With the support from that Fund, PwC led the development of the Higher Apprenticeship in Professional Services framework.Professional Services Higher Apprenticeship (England), http://www.afo.sscalliance.org/frameworkslibrary/index.cfm?id=FR01200 The new framework includes distinct pathways for Audit, Tax and Management consulting. The tax pathway within this framework is aligned with the requirements of the ATT exams. The framework has the blend of technical knowledge, wider competence and business skills that employers have told us they are looking for to enable Apprentices to operate effectively and productively in a tax environment. Branches There are 40 branches run in conjunction with the Chartered Institute of Taxation catering for the requirements of the members and students within their areas.  Technical submissions to HMRC  The technical officers of the ATTmeet with officials from HM Treasury and HM Revenue & Customs, to help ensure that the viewpoint of the taxpayer and tax practitioners is taken into account in the development of HMRC's policy and practice. Some of the submissions made by ATT are: * Withdrawal of extra statutory concessions - The ATT comments sent to HMRC 8 January 2015 on Withdrawal of extra statutory concessions. 12 January 2015 * Collection and management of devolved taxes in Wales - The ATT response to the Welsh White Paper sent on 15 December 2014 on Collection and management of devolved taxes in Wales. 15 December 2014 * Tackling offshore tax evasion - The ATT responses sent to HMRC 31 October on Tackling offshore tax evasion: a new criminal offence and Tackling offshore tax evasion: strengthening civil deterrents. 31 October2014 References Taxation Technicians Category:Organizations established in 1989 Category:Tax practitioner associations ","title":"Association of Taxation Technicians"},{"id":"26987294","text":"N. alba may refer to: * Nepenthes alba, a tropical pitcher plant species endemic to Peninsular Malaysia * Nymphaea alba, the European white waterlily, white lotus or nenuphar, a freshwater aquatic flowering plant species found all over Europe and in parts of North Africa and the Middle East See also * Alba (disambiguation) ","title":"N. alba"},{"id":"26987301","text":"The University of Alberta Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, is located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in pharmacy. Background The faculty began in 1913 as a department within the Faculty of Medicine, and then as a school after 1917.\\"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences\\", University of Alberta Centenary, University of Alberta. Accessed February 1, 2014. The first three students to graduate from the school did so in 1921, and they thus became the first students in the British Empire to complete a four-year (instead of three-year) pharmacy program. In 1955, the school became the Faculty of Pharmacy, graduating its first PhD student in 1961. In 1968, it was renamed the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Its first dean, from its creation in 1955 until his retirement in 1978, was Mervyn Huston.\\"Passion for Life\\". University of Alberta Alumni Association, Autumn 2001. The admissions process is selective for those seeking a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Pharmacy. The undergraduate program has had a duration of four years, including a professional year in the field. The Faculty also offers MPharm, MSc, and PhD graduate programs. Since 2013, the faculty also began offering a 2-year post graduate PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) program for Practising Pharmacists who have already graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy. In the Fall of 2018, the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Alberta) replaced their four-year BSc. Pharm program with an entry to practise PharmD. program, with the first graduating class expected in April 2022. However, since the spring of 2017 the university has offered current BSc. Pharm students the ability to bridge to the PharmD. program. This requires the students to take two extra summer semesters between their third and fourth years, as well as an extra 16 weeks of clinical rotations during their fourth year. Only students graduating between 2018 and 2021 will have had this option. As a result, currently the university is offering 3 possible means to obtain a PharmD degree. That is the 2 year PharmD program for practising pharmacists, those in the PharmD for BSc. Pharm students (PBS), and those in the entry to practise PharmD program. BSc. Pharm students who did not enrol in the PBS program between 2018 and 2021 will be the final students to graduate with a bachelor's degree from the faculty. The school is located in the Medical Sciences Building at North Campus, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Academic reputation Students of the Faculty place first in Canada in the National Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada examinations 18 of the past 20 years. In 12 of those years the individual award for the highest achievement in these examinations in all of Canada came from the faculty (as of 2010). The school is known to admit and produce some of the highest quality pharmacists in Canada, as evidenced by their overall, as well as individual achievement in the National Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada Examinations, of which all Pharmacy students in Canada write.http://www.pharm.ualberta.ca/About_the_Faculty.aspx References Category:University of Alberta Category:Pharmacy schools in Canada ","title":"University of Alberta Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"id":"26987317","text":":Not to be confused with his nephew Nicolaus Bruhns, a German organist and composer.
