Lung Ying-tai spent more than 10 years researching material for the book and spent 400 days in Changchun, Nanjing, Shenyang, Matsu Islands, Taitung County and Pingtung County paying a visit to survivors of the Chinese Civil War in order to record their stories. Reviews Leo Ou-fan Lee wrote in Muse that 'the problem [of the book] lies in the author's over-ambitious intent to write a testimonial saga of mammoth historical scope - all in 450 pages or 150,000 words. It should have been three times that size.' Lung had said in the public that she especially wanted readers from mainland China to read this book. However, since the books covered various misdeeds of the Chinese Red Army during this era, it was banned by the People Republic of China government. However, this book is still obtainable to readers in mainland China through online purchase. In response to the book, Li Ao wrote a critical piece titled the Big River, Big Sea has fooled you ().

He made the acquaintance of Henri Frenay at some point during military school where he became a specialist of the 4th Bureau. Leader of a company of the French 13th motorized infantry, he was wounded by a bomb explosion at the start of the German offensive. In collaboration with Frenay and Lieutenant Pierre de Froment, Gu√©don organised the Lib√©ration Nationale information and propaganda movement. When the Combat Zone Nord group was annihilated through arrests, Gu√©don passed into the zone Sud. He commanded a company of the 7th regiment of Moroccan tirailleurs in Morocco until the allied landings. During the Tunisian campaign, he was head of the 4th Bureau (transport) of the Moroccan mountain division. Assigned as an instructor in a staff school, he subsequently entered the commissariat of prisoners and deportees, where Frenay charged him with organizing the future repatriation of French nationals held in Germany.

History BBA's history originates with Best Buddies International. During 2004, BBI approached the New South Wales Council for Intellectual Disability, offering a creative and innovate program for adults and young people who have an intellectual disability. Coincidentally, a staff member from Melbourne Big Brothers Big Sisters approached BBI at the same time asking to bring the program to Australia. After securing a modest grant from the New South Wales Government, BBA became incorporated in November 2004. The initial program focused on High School Students located in NSW and the provision of an independent Best Buddies Victoria Program focusing on Citizens (Adults). During 2007 additional funds were located and the organisation recruited its first Executive Director, Mark Trevaskis. In the following years, Best Buddies Australia has grown substantially, incorporating Victoria into a National framework. Programs Best Buddies Australia delivered two key programs, the High Schools and the Citizens Programs. BBA High Schools is primarily focused on Public High Schools located in Sydney, New South Wales. Each High School creates a Chapter led by a small team of student leaders. These roles include Chapter President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Buddy Director. Beyond the individual volunteer commitment, Best Buddies Chapters are required to deliver 4 additional group events across the year. These may include group meals, fund raisers or activities. The BBA Citizens Program is delivered in both Victoria and New South Wales and focuses on adults who have an intellectual disability. Best Buddies Day Each year Best Buddies Australia holds a Best Buddies Day celebration. This is a unique event bringing together all young people involved in the program. The event itself is activity based with the aim of not only enjoying and celebrating the volunteer commitment of the young people involved but a vehicle to engage the broader community and develop skills. Best Buddies Day has been sponsored by the Bank of New York Mellon during 2010 and 2011. Best Buddy Pair of the Year Award The BBA Best Buddy Pair of the Year Award is a special award granted to the buddy pair who demonstrate the best friendship. The applicants are asked to provide detail as to frequency of contact, types of activities engaged in and additional detail as to what their friendship is like.

It is the simplest known siloxane with hydrogen only R groups. The molecule contains six equivalent Si-H bonds and two equivalent Si-O bonds. Disiloxane exists as a colorless, pungent gas under standard conditions. However, it is generally safe for human use as evidence in its widespread use in cosmetics. It is also commonly known as disilyl ether, disilyl oxide, and perhydrodisiloxane  Structure  Disiloxane has a simple structure that consists of a siloxane bond (Si-O-Si) and hydrogen R groups. The structure of disiloxane has been studied by a variety of spectroscopic methods such as electron diffraction, dipole moment, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Commonly, the bond angles of the Si-O-Si bond are studied due to their unusual nature. These bonds are typically exhibit bond angles that are larger than average, around 130 to 160 degrees, larger bond lengths are not uncommon. Typical bond angles with oxygen atoms are around 105 to 125 degrees corresponding to the hybrid s and p orbitals. The abnormally large bond angle has led some scientists to believe that the molecule exhibits a linear geometry while others have collected data indicating that disiloxane exhibits a bent geometry. This disagreement usually depends on the spectroscopic technique used to analyze the compound. The unusual bond angle may be due to unshared electron interactions from oxygen interacting with the d orbitals of silicon. It has been estimated that the two lone pairs of oxygen are each about 50% involved with œÄ bond interactions with silicon‚Äôs d orbitals. There is also evidence of œÄ bonding between the p and d orbitals which results in a bond shortening between Si-O which improves the overlap and overall stability of the molecule. Because of this shortening, the Si-O bonds can exhibit some partial double bond behavior. In addition to studies of bond angles, vibrational analyses have also been done to determine the symmetry elements of disiloxane. IR and Raman spectroscopy have been used to propose a point group of D3d.  Synthesis  Synthesis of disiloxane is typically done by taking a hydrosilane species with a substituent leaving group and reacting it with water to produce silanol. The silanol is then reacted with itself to produce the final disiloxane through dehydrogenative coupling. This is shown in the reactions below: H3SiX + H2O ‚Üí H3SiOH + HX (first step) 2 H3SiOH ‚Üí H3SiOSiH3 \\\\+ H2O (second step) Other methods of synthesis involve the use of gold on carbon as a catalyst for the reaction carried out in water as well as InBr3\\\\- catalyzed oxidation of hydrosilanes.  Uses  Disiloxanes can be used as sealants for construction, paints, inks, and coatings, cosmetics, mechanical fluids, textile applications, and paper coatings. Commercial use of disiloxane is common in cosmetics. It is commonly found in products such as sunscreen, moisturizer, hair spray, eye liner, body spray, nail polish, makeup remover, and conditioner. The properties that disiloxane exhibits in these products include fast drying, oil reducing, moisturizing, skin conditioning, and defoaming agent (preventing formation of foam). Disiloxanes have been approved as teen and child safe. Siloxanes of many kinds are found to be extremely safe for topical use but can be dangerous if ingested.  Variations  The term disiloxane is commonly used to refer to structures that exhibit much more complex R groups than hydrogen. The most common molecule that makes use of this naming is Hexamethyldisiloxane which replaces the hydrogen groups with methyl groups. Other common variations include the use of disiloxanes as bridges and spacers in larger compounds such as polymers.

Career Maria Baptist was born in 1971 in East Berlin in a very musical family. Her grandfather was an orchestra musician and composer, her father himself is a pianist. Maria discovered very early her fascination for music and at the age of six she began playing the piano. At the age of eleven she composed her first pieces. Maria developed her desire to become a classical concert pianist. At the age of fifteen Maria listened to recordings of Dave Brubeck and Keith Jarrett and discovered for the first time the world of jazz and improvisation. Impressed by the musical expression, Maria felt that she had to continue on this path. She began studying piano at the music university in Berlin and won her first international piano competitions on improvisation. During this period, the Berlin Wall fell, which meant a great personal change in Maria's life. She took the opportunity to move to New York. Here Maria experienced the freedom, space and magic, which opened up whole new musical worlds to her. Maria's artistic work was significantly influenced and inspired by the tremendous creativity, energy, living will, the strength and melancholy of the metropolis. What remains until today is Maria's musical curiosity: Her music is characterised by absolute openness, she breaks up genre boundaries and without effort there comes energy that builds up to fascinating ranges of sounds. During her composition studies in New York with Maria Schneider, Maria Baptist came into contact with the orchestral music. \\"Her music is a gift, infused with all the creativity, power, emotion, generosity and warmth that she exudes in life.‚Äú commends the famous American big band composer the work of her Berlin colleague Maria Baptist. With twenty- five Maria returns to Berlin and is celebrated as the great young talent by the press and her audience. During this time she won a series of internationally renowned competitions including the Leipzig jazz price, the hr Big Band Composition Contest, the prize of the Thad Jones Competition for full orchestra with the Danish Radio Jazz Orchestra in Copenhagen and the NDR Composers Competition. Maria was invited to festivals and concerts throughout Europe. She thrilled her audience with her virtuoso ease, her passionate devotion and authenticity. Well-known soloists such as Ingrid Jensen, Rolf K√ºhn & Gitte Haenning and ensembles such as the Rias Big Band, the hr Big Band & Budapest Jazz Orchestra, were working together with Maria. Parallel to all the concerts, Maria finished her studies. Her curiosity was unlimited: In Berlin at the age of twenty-four, she started studying classical composition. Her two studies laid the foundation for a further focus of Maria's career: the joy of teaching. At the age of twenty-six, when she was still a student, Maria was already jazz teacher at the University of Music in Berlin. Since the age of twenty-nine she has been a guest professor at the University of Music \\"Hanns Eisler\\", where she teaches composition, arranging, improvisation and jazz theory. Throughout her career Maria published previously seven CDs (in a variety of instrumentations). She has no fear of contact with genre boundaries: as the first jazz pianist Maria played Arnold Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire with jazz improvisations. Her latest Jazz Trio CD \\"Spring in Berlin‚Äú offers an enormous variety of sounds: from chamber music influences, lyrical melodies to heavy grooving parts full of intensity and drive. Maria works with contrasts, subtile moments with emotional deepness and is able to connect classical influences with Jazz in a very natural and gentle way without effort.The album is highly acclaimed by the press: ‚Äûcool groove & cultivated touch with a great effect‚Äú (Piano News). ‚ÄûSpring in Berlin‚Äú is full of sunlight‚Äú (Jazzthetik), a listening pleasure (Jazzpodium). ‚ÄûMaria knows how to make a Trio burn‚Äú, says a famous German reviewer. In the same way, Maria convinces her live audience: as a soloist, in the intimacy of the jazz trio or as an orchestra conductor. She offers fascinating sound structures and Maria‚Äòs playing is always very intense and breathtaking virtuoso. She gave concerts e.g. in the United States, China, South Africa, Cuba, France, Iceland, Denmark, Greece, Sweden, Italy, Luxembourg, Hungary and Spain. In 2010 she took part at the Reykjavik Jazz Festival, which is a new unique and inspiring place for live Jazz. As a special concert experience Maria conducted the Reykjavik Big Band. She composed an ‚ÄûIcelandic Suite‚Äú, which had the world premiere. In 2008 there has been already a collaboration with Baptist and the Reykjavik Big Band, which acclaimed highly reputation. In 2011 Maria will combine her passion for conducting, composing and teaching. As a successor of Peter Herbolzheimer, she will lead the Federal Youth Orchestra of Germany. As a dedication to her fascination for big cities, the concert program \\"City Grooves\\" will be premiered. Maria Schneider (composer, arranger New York) about Maria Baptist: \\"Her music is a gift, infused with all the creativity, power, emotion, generosity and warmth that she exudes in life.\\" Professorship Apart from her engagements as a performer and composer, Maria has been a professor at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\"http://gremien.hu-berlin.de/frb/hc_dez09 Berlin since 2001.

The larvae feed on Populus sect. Aigeiros and Platanus species. Young larvae feed in groups and skeletonize the undersides of the leaves of their host plant. Older larvae are solitary feeders and feed on all of the leaf, only leaving major veins. They are light green with a broad, yellowish- white dorsal stripe and brownish patches and narrow indistinct lines on each side. Full-grown larvae reach a length of 30‚Äì42 mm.

Common names include red-barked sassafras, black sassafras, camphorwood, scentless cinnamon wood, and native camphor laurel. Its habitat is between the Williams River (New South Wales) and the Main Range National Park in Queensland. Growing in rich volcanic soils or on the poorer sedimentary soils, it is often in association with coachwood. Description A medium-sized tree up to 30 m tall, it has a stem diameter of 60 cm. The tree's crown is small and not spreading. The trunk is cylindrical and straight, somewhat flanged at the base on larger trees. Its bark is reddish brown and fairly smooth, but with some 1-cm-sized squares of bark and corky protuberances. Small branches on this species are usually green and smooth. The leaves are simple, opposite on the stem, and elliptical in shape with a blunt tip; they are 5 to 12 cm long, 2 to 3 cm wide, smooth and glossy green above, and duller green below. They are partially three-veined with the first pair of secondary veins reaching around half the length of the leaf before terminating at the leaf edge. Flowers form on panicles between February and July. The fruit is a black, fleshy drupe, oval in shape, 10 to 12 mm long, and 6 to 8 mm wide. The base of the fruit is sunken into a six-sided calyx tube. The single seed is 8 mm long and 5 mm wide, ripening from August to December. Fresh seeds should be sown, as they quickly dry out.

Deafness Educ Int. 12 (4) 204-216) published outcomes for children in an AV programme which were essentially quasi-experimental studies in that the assessment tool used had been standardised on typically developing children and so a comparison could be drawn between the age equivalence scores obtained by the children on the study and their chronological or ‚Äòhearing‚Äô age. (The hearing age of a child is the duration of time since the child has had optimal access to sound.) In these studies, the average rate of language development increased significantly during the time on the programme compared to the average rate of language development prior to embarking on the programme.

Volta Rev. 109,1‚Äì25 reviewed the evidence for Auditory Verbal Therapy and concluded that while it was not possible to demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between the intervention and the outcome, increasing the strength of evidence for outcomes was vital. In 2010, Dornan et al. published a longitudinal study comparing the outcomes of 29 children enrolled on an AV programme with age-matched controls. They found AV to be an effective intervention. A 2014 Cochrane review found that it was not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the A-V approach due to a lack of well controlled studies while acknowledging that lack of evidence does not necessarily imply lack of effect.

The music and lyrics were registered in the United States Copyright Catalog on February 6, 1945.  Recordings  On December 8, 1944, the song was recorded by Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians. This version, however, was not released until June 1950 when it was included on his Pleasure Time album by Decca. In November 1945, it was recorded by the Glenn Miller Orchestra for a radio broadcast. It was recorded the following year by Ray McKinley with a Billboard magazine review that called the recording a \\"cute novelty\\" with \\"plain and effective\\" vocals. McKinley's version was released as the B-side to his version of \\"We'll Gather Lilacs\\" from Ivor Novello's Perchance to Dream.  Origin  The song comes from the phrase \\"Got any gum, chum?\\" which was popular with British children at the time of World War II. Children would shout the phrase at passing American soldiers in an attempt to be given chewing gum or similar rations. In the liner notes to the 1983 compilation In the USA and Europe (Vol. II), Richard C. March (then-secretary of the UK-based International Glenn Miller Society) described the song as a \\"topical period piece\\" that would not be appreciated by \\"today's younger generation\\" but would be understood by those \\"brought up at the time of sweet rationing\\". The lyrics mention the gum brands Chiclets, Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit.

Travels As second lieutenant on the East India Company's survey brig Palinurus under Captain Robert Moresby, Wellsted took part in the detailed survey of the Gulf of 'Aqabah and the northern part of the Red Sea in 1830. He then returned to Bombay in 1833 and was reassigned under the command of Captain Stafford B. Haines to survey the southern coast of Arabia. In January 1834 Palinurus crossed over to Socotra and Wellsted spent two months on the island. He published the results of his journey as Memoir on the island of Socotra. During his travels to the Red Sea and the Siyal Islands, Wellsted documented the existence of peoples known as the Huteimi. They are described by Wellsted to be \\"found on the Arabian and Nubian coasts,\\" and that they are \\"cowardly in disposition, squalid and misshapen in form, and filthy in their habits.\\" According to various accounts, they are further described as a race of fishermen, found in various parts of the Hejaz, with \\"large encampments near Leyt to the southward of Jiddah.\\"Wellsted, James Raymond. \\"Travels in Arabia, Volume 2\\". J. Murray, 1838. p. 258-262. In November 1835 Wellsted gained permission from the Imam to travel in Oman with Lieutenant F Whitelock. The two reached areas previously unseen by Europeans and Wellsted published his early account of the journey in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. The following winter he returned but succumbed to fever and 'in a fit of delirium he discharged both barrels of his gun into his mouth, but the balls passing upwards only inflicted two ghastly wounds in the upper jaw'. He was taken to Bombay and from there returned to London on leave. He retired from the service in 1839, living part of the time on his navy pension in Blacklands House, a mental health facility of gentlemen. He died in 1842 at his family's home, 12/13 Molyneux Street, Marylebone. Wellsted's papers were read at the Royal Geographical Society and he was immediately recognised by the scientific world. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 6 April 1837 and was also a fellow of the Astronomical Society. In particular his unbiased accounts of geography and culture in Oman, continue as a unique description of the area at that early date. English Heritage are currently considering the erection of a blue memorial plaque at his family home in Molyneux Street.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Born into an aristocratic family, Larisch served during World War I as a troop officer during the war and was discharged from the army in 1920. He spent several years as landowner in Pomerania, and was re-employed by the Landesschutz, an unofficial branch of the army. He became an active officer again in 1933. During the early years of World War II he commanded units on inactive fronts or in occupational duties. From 1943 on he served as a field commander at the Eastern Front. After the war, he lived in Hamburg, West Germany until his death in 1972. Early years and World War I Coat of arms of the Larisch family Larisch was born in 1894 in Freiburg im Breisgau as the first son of a military officer. Both of his parents were members of the German nobility.Guido von Frobel: Milit√§r‚ÄìWochenblatt No. 18, 1924. Berlin: E. S. Mittler & Sohn, p. 431. After successfully completing his high school studies (Abitur), 19-year-old Larisch joined the army. Thanks to his noble birth and being from a military family, in February 1914, Larisch was accepted into the Prussian Army.Bradley, Hildebrand and R√∂verkamp, Die Generale des Heeres 1921‚Äì1945 Band 7, p. 394‚Äì395.Robinson & Robinson, Handbook Of Imperial Germany, p. 180. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914, Larisch was mobilized on 2 August 1914 and received a hastened commission to Leutnant in September of that year. He spent the majority of the war with the 18th Dragoon Regiment, serving as platoon and squadron commander. In January 1918 he was transferred to the 359th Infantry Regiment to assume the command of a company; in that position, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (1st Lieutenant) in May 1918. In August, he became Ordonnanzoffizier (Batman) at the staff of I Reserve Corps. He was still serving in that position when the German Empire capitulated on 11 November 1918. Interwar period=In the Weimar Republic While still in the army service, Larisch enrolled in the University of Rostock in February 1920 in order to study law; however, he never completed his studies.Œïntry of Heribert von Larisch in the Rostock Matrikelportal Larisch wasn't selected for the downsized, 1,000-man officer corps of the Reichswehr and was discharged. During the war, on 18 June 1917, he married Ellen Fanny Wanda Natalie Helene, n√©e Edle von Xylander (1895‚Äì1974), the daughter of Adolf Ritter und Edler von Xylander, a nobleman and Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel).Gothaisches genealogisches Taschenbuch der adeligen H√§user Teil A: Deutsche Uradel. 41. Jahrgang. Gotha: Justus Perthes 1942, p. 286. Larisch's mother-in-law, who had divorced Xylander in 1914 to marry the officer Eduard Ermekeil (31 October 1864 ‚Äì 18 November 1941) in 1916, came from a family of Pomeranian landowners. Among others, they owned the estates of Latzig, as well as the nearby estates of Zirchow B and Alt‚ÄìZowen in the Pomeranian District of Schlawe (Kreis Schlawe). Ellen Ermekeil (Larisch's mother-in-law) became administrator of the estate of Zirchow B in 1921.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Adelige H√§user B Vol. V, Vol. 26 of total series.

After his discharge, Larisch settled at Zirchow, along with his wife and his daughter Irmgard (1918‚Äì1998).Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Adelige H√§user Vol. XXX, Vol. 145 of total series. Limburg (Lahn): C. A. Starke, 2008, ISSN 0435-2408, p. 241‚Äì242. Larisch occupied himself with the administration of the estate in Zirchow B. During the 1920s, he and his wife had four more children: Siegrid (born 1921), Friederun (born in 1922), Karin (born in 1924) and Dankwart (born in 1925). In addition, Larisch occupied himself with the history of his Regiment during the war. The result of his work, Das 2. Gro√üherzogl. Mecklenburg. Dragoner-Reg. Nr 18 im Weltkriege 1914‚Äì1918 (The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg 2nd Dragoner Regiment No. 18 in the World War 1914‚Äì1918), was published in 1924.Das 2. Grossherzogl. Mecklenburg. Dragoner- Regiment Nr. 18 im Weltkriege 1914‚Äì1918 in the catalog of the German National Library. Retrieved on 25 November 2014. In 1928, he took over the estate of Zirchow B. National Socialism Seeking to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles and enlarge the size of the army strength, the leadership of the new army (Reichswehr), worked from 1926 on the development of a secret army, formed on existing paramilitary border guard organizations, which received training and equipment unofficially. Those formations were part of the Landesschutzorganisation (Land Protection Organization, or LO), and their main duty was the border protection, the training of the LO troops, and to an extent the maintaining of the civilian order. Naturally, the Reichswehr wished to utilize veteran officers who were discharged from the Reichswehr in 1920, but, since officially the Reichswehr was limited to 1,000 active officers, the officers of the LO were classified as \\"civilian employees of the Reichswehr\\" on paper, and were commonly known as L‚ÄìOffiziere (short for Landesschutzoffiziere, or Land Protection Officers).Graf von Matuschka, Organisation des Reichsheeres, p. 216 and 341. Larisch entered the Landesschutz on 1 July 1929, as an Oberleutnant (L). He was employed by the Wehrkreis (Military District) II (Mecklenburg and Pomerania, with HQ in Stettin), appointed as the District Administrator for the area of Schlochau and Bublitz, adjacent to the family estates. Larisch spent the following years in that rather quiet position. On 1 February 1932 he was transferred to the Command Office in Neustettin (also in Pomerania), where he witnessed Adolf Hitler's rise to power one year later: on 31 January 1933, he became Chancellor of Germany. In the following years, disregarding the confining Versailles Treaty, the Nazi regime intensified the German re-armament (Aufr√ºstung) and the size of the military. On 1 October 1933, Larisch was transferred from the Landesschutzen officers to the active officers of the Reichswehr, and was simultaneously promoted to Hauptmann (Captain). Evidently, Larisch was earmarked for active troop command, given that he was still 42 years old, and was given a troop assignment, the command of a company in the 4th Infantry Regiment (4. Infanterie‚ÄìRegiment), headquartered in Kolberg, Pomerania. He retained the same position as company commander when the regiment was restructured in the frame of the expansion of the Reichswehr ‚Äî which was renamed to Wehrmacht in 1935 ‚Äî from 1 October 1934 with a new designation, Infantry Regiment \\"Kolberg\\" (Infanterie‚ÄìRegiment Kolberg). One year later, he was posted as Instructor at the prestigious Infantry School in D√∂beritz (Infanterieschule D√∂beritz) near Berlin. He remained there until July 1936, when he was transferred to 94th Infantry Regiment (94. Infanterie‚ÄìRegiment), which was then under formation in Pomerania, again as a company commander. Shortly thereafter he was promoted to Major and in early October 1937 he was transferred to another Infantry School, this time to Hanover in Lower Saxony, as Taktiklehrer (Tactics Instructor). He taught officer classes there for the two following years, until the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939. World War II Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, marking the start of World War II in Europe. The organization of new divisions escalated in the weeks leading up to the war, and experienced officers were needed to man the newly formed divisions. The 86th Infantry Division was formed in Detmold on 26 August and Larisch took over command of the 1st Battalion of its 167th Infantry Regiment. This unit didn't participate in the Polish Campaign, however, as more accommodated to tactical doctrines officers were chosen to lead from the front, in favour of officers who had resumed their service in the 1930s. The 86th Division occupied a sector of the inactive Western Front. Larisch spent a great part of the Phoney War there, from October 1939 to January 1940, again trusted with training duties, in light of his earlier experience. In this capacity, he oversaw the training of Company and Battalion leaders. It can be assumed that Larisch's superiors held his training skills in high regard, but still deemed him unfit for field service, as he was transferred away from the front and posted as a Tactics Instructor for Company commanders in the city of K√∂nigsbr√ºck in Upper Lusatia on 10 January. Simultaneously, he was named commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 440th Infantry Regiment, which was being under formation in K√∂nigsbr√ºck. In February, he was promoted to Oberstleutnant (Colonel).Mitcham, German Order of Battle, 86th Infantry Division and 164th Infantry Division. In May 1940, his tenure as instructor ended, and he occupied himself exclusively with the command of his battalion. The quality of the units' training in K√∂nigsbr√ºck prompted the American military attach√© to write to his superiors that he was \\"impressed\\" of the German tactics in the army manoeuvres there.Anthony King (2014): The Combat Soldier. Infantry Tactics and Cohesion in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries. Oxford: Oxford University Press. , p. 193. Larisch remained battalion commander throughout 1940 ‚Äî his unit didn't participate in the battle of France ‚Äî but, after the successful Balkan campaign, he was elevated to commander of the 440th Infantry Regiment in July 1941 and, in October, he was promoted to Oberst (Colonel). At that time, his regiment was posted in Greece, charged with occupational duties, and the 164th Infantry Regiment was merged with the 713th Infantry Division (713. Infanterie‚ÄìDivision) to form the Fortress Division \\"Crete\\" (Festungsdivision Kreta). In July 1942, the more combat-effective parts of the 16th Infantry Division were transported to North Africa to fight with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps. Larisch, still deemed unfit for active combat duty, remained in Greece, and from October to November 1942 he commanded one of the units of the Festungsdivision Kreta that were left behind, the 1st Fortress Brigade (Festungsbrigade 1) with HQ in Thessaloniki.Scherzer, Formationsgeschichte des Heeres und des Ersatzheeres, p. 400 on. On 23 November 1942, the staff of the unit was transferred to the north and became the German Railway Security Staff Croatia (Deutscher Eisenbahn‚ÄìSicherungsstab Kroatien). In this capacity, Larisch was responsible for the protection of the essential railroad transport in the puppet Independent State of Croatia, from acts of sabotage by the partisan movement active there.Tomasevich, War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, p. 278. Larisch held this position in 1943; whether his units were implicated in war crimes is unknown. Operations at the Eastern Front, January to March 1945. The defensive line, which Larisch's 129th Infantry Division defended, lies along the river Narew, north of Warsaw, a tributary of Vistula river. By 1943, Larisch had completed 10 years of troop service, but hadn't yet received a combat assignment. Presumably, he had earned sufficiently good evaluations from his superiors to be considered as a future divisional leader, so, in the summer of 1943, he took part in a one-month divisional leaders course in Berlin. He returned to Croatia in August and, on 1 November 1943, he was given the command of the 78th Sturm Division, one of the strongest, best-equipped and most effective combat units of the Eastern Front. When Larisch took over the command, the division was engaged in heavy fighting with the Red Army, as the Soviets attempted to capture the vital Moscow‚ÄìMinsk highway, connecting Smolensk to Orsha. The battles lasted throughout the whole winter, and the division was able to form a defensive line and complete, for the time being, its objective.Zaloga, Bagration 1944, p. 48. On 15 February 1944, Larisch became commander of the 129th Infantry Division (129. Infanterie-Division), and was promoted to Generalmajor (Major General) on 1 April 1944. When, in June 1944, the Soviets launched a massive offensive (Operation Bagration), the 129th Infantry Division initially escaped total decimation, like many of the units of Army Group Center, but suffered heavy losses during the fighting in Belorussia.Mitcham, German Order of Battle, 129th Infantry Division. Arguably, Larisch's finest moment came in late summer 1944, when his division was defending the Narew river against the Soviet assault. The German units had set up strong defenses along the river, including trenches, barbed wire, obstacles and minefields, and manage to prevent the Soviets from breaking through.Maslov, Aleksander A. & Glantz, David M. (1998): Fallen Soviet Generals: Soviet General Officers Killed in Battle, 1941‚Äì1945. Routledge, , p. 155. This defensive success was met with visible enthusiasm from Larisch's superiors: on 1 September 1944, he was decorated with the German Cross in Gold. In addition, he was promoted to Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) on 1 October, a few weeks later, and in late December he was awarded with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, one of Nazi Germany's highest and most prestigious military decorations. Late war The defensive line at Narew was overrun during another large-scale Soviet offensive in January 1945. While the winter had caused the marshes to freeze, making the terrain impermeable to attacks, this line was smashed and the German units were forced to retreat.Buttar, Battleground Prussia, p. 106 on. By then, the 129th Infantry Division had suffered such heavy losses that it effectively ceased to exist as combat formation; Larisch gave up command of what remained of his division on 15 February 1945. For the remainder of the war, Larisch was posted as commander of Infantry School D√∂beritz. Anticipating the Soviet assault on Berlin, the school had been moved to Grafenw√∂hr in the Upper Palatinate. He remained in that position until 24 April, when he was placed in the \\"Leader's Reserve\\" (F√ºhrerreserve). Larisch continued to direct the regimental commanders course that had started in March. By late April 1945, the course continued to take place in Kr√ºn, a municipality in Southern Bavaria, adjacent to Tyrol. When Hitler's suicide became known on 30 April, the course came to an end. Before relieving the officers of their duties, Larisch assembled them in the local schoolhouse. His parting words were: \\"What you have learned in the past weeks was certainly not in vain, for just a few years from now, there will be a new German Army!\\"Gro√üjohann, Five Years, Four Fronts, p. 317. Post‚Äìwar After the war ended with the unconditional surrender of Germany on 8 May 1945, Larisch was able to evade capture for more than a month, but was arrested by American troops on 15 June 1945. He spent the next two years as a prisoner of war and was released on 1 July 1947, a few weeks shy of his 53rd birthday. Upon returning to Germany, Larisch and his wife settled in Hamburg in northern West Germany. With the exception of his only son, who went missing in action on 1 July 1944 in the northern sector of the Eastern Front,Entry at the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge database. all of his immediate family had survived the war. His Pomeranian estates were annexed by Poland. Thus, the family lived in strained conditions for some time; his daughter, Karin, a veterinarian, emigrated with her family to the United States of America in the 1950s.Fortuna Farm webpage. (Retrieved on 26 November 2014). Larisch spent his last years quietly in retirement. He served as chairman of the Officers' Association (Offiziersverein) of his old regiment (the 18th Dragoon Regiment).Damerau, Helmuth (ed.) (1973): Deutsches Soldatenjahrbuch 1973. 21.

In 1988, Mike Kinsella was the first to report Skrjabinoclava nematodes in Florida marsh rice rats. He identified the worm as Skrjabinoclava thapari, a species originally described from crab- eating raccoons (Procyon cancrivorus) in Brazil.Anderson and Wong, 1994, p. 1 In 1994, R.C. Anderson and P.L. Wong published an article comparing the rice rat Skrjabinoclava to Brazilian S. thapari and concluded that the two belonged to different species. They named the former as a new species, Skrjabinoclava kinsellai, with the specific name honoring Mike Kinsella. S. thapari has also been recorded from Florida American white ibises (Eudocimus albus), but Anderson and Wong could not examine the specimens and were consequently unable to determine whether these worms are S. thapari or S. kinsellai. S. thapari and S. kinsellai are remarkable for infecting mammalian hosts, as Skrjabinoclava are normally bird parasites.Anderson and Wong, 1994, p. 2 Skrjabinoclava kinsellai is a small and delicate worm. In the male, the left spicule (a spine-like copulatory structure) ends with a shoe-like form, not with a tapered, rounded end as in S. thapari. Both males and females have small structures resembling nipples on the ends of their tails, which are absent in S. thapari. Total length is 2.6 to 2.8 mm (0.10 to 0.11 in) in males and 3.4 to 4.9 mm (0.13 to 0.19 in) in females. Maximum width is 55 to 81 Œºm in males and 100 to 142 Œºm in females, esophagus length is 612 to 845 Œºm in males and 823 to 1000 Œºm in females, and tail length 76 to 112 Œºm in males and 80 to 90 Œºm in females. Of 110 marsh rice rats studied in Florida by Kinsella, 30 were infected by S. kinsellai, with one to ten (average four) worms present per rat. The worms are in the stomach. Larvae found in the crab Uca pugilator may belong to Skrjabinoclava and the crab may serve as an intermediate host.  References  Literature cited  *Anderson, R.C. and Wong, P.L. 1994.

The school is operated by the WA Department of Education. The school co-principals are Alan Curtis and Milanna Hiberle.  Overview  The school initially opened as a junior high school in 1971 and continued to operate as one until becoming a high school in 1974. The campus buildings were constructed by the Mount Newman Mining Company in 1972 before being taken over by the Education Department in 1974. In 2010 Newman entered into an alliance with Shenton College in Perth, to provide the students with extra motivation and positive role models. The school principal was Alan Curtis from 2005 to 2010. In 2011 Milanna Hiberle became principal; and was rejoined by Curtis in 2012. Enrolments at the school have been reasonably steady with 282 students in 2007, 314 in 2008, 323 in 2009, 262 in 2010, 260 in 2011 and 243 in 2012. The west wing of the school was destroyed by fire in 2014. Eight classrooms were lost during the blaze and teachers and staff evacuated the school as ten firefighters extinguished the blaze. The two storey building housed mathematics classrooms and science laboratories and the damage bill was estimated at 4 million.

The Medina Division was mostly deployed along the Karbala gap, west of the city of Karbala itself. The Iraqi Division was targeted as it was the best equipped Iraqi unit, and its destruction would negatively affect Iraqi military morale. The Medina Division sustained only limited damage during the engagement. The defeat for the Americans resulted in one AH-64 Apache being shot down intact. The two pilots were captured and shown on television along with the helicopter. Pentagon officials stated the captured Apache was destroyed via airstrike the following day, Iraqi officials claimed a farmer with a Brno rifle shot down the Apache. After the invasion, the farmer denied any involvement. Background Iraqi morale was high after putting up stiff resistance at the Battle of Nasiriyah. The U.S. sought to continue its shock and awe campaign by crippling the elite Medina Republican Guard division, thus demoralizing the enemy. In the aftermath of the Gulf War, the Iraqis learned from the no fly zones over their country. The threat of small arms fire from Iraqi soldiers was gravely underestimated by the U.S. attack helicopters participating in the attack.Atkinson (2008), pp. 147-153 Difficulties The AH-64 Apache helicopters of the U.S. Army's 11th Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, faced several problems before the operation. The terrain around Baghdad was not desert, but urban sprawl. Experience from the Battle of Mogadishu of 1993 showed that helicopters are vulnerable over urban areas. Intelligence was inadequate. The information on the enemy's disposition was sketchy, forcing the helicopters to search the target area themselves. Some targets, including 30 T-72 tanks, were not present on the battlefield. An accelerated timetable caused coordination issues. The Third Infantry Division moved ahead of schedule, causing the mission to be pulled in 24 hours. Suppression of enemy air defences occurred in accordance with the accelerated schedule even though the Apaches were behind schedule. The Apaches arrived only after a three-hour delay. The fighter-bombers had left the area by then and the helicopters were without support. The three hour interval allowed Iraqi air defences to recover. Engagement The 31 AH-64 Apaches of the 11th Aviation Group took off from Tactical Assembly Area Vicksburg, which was inside Objective Rams. One Apache crashed immediately after takeoff when its pilot became disoriented. When the Apaches turned north toward Karbala, signals intelligence picked up over 50 Iraqi cell phone calls alerting the Iraqi forward units of their approach. As the helicopters came within range, the Iraqis signaled their troops to open fire by turning off the city's power grid for several seconds. Ground troops then opened up with a barrage of PKM, NSV, 23mm, and 57mm fire. Lieutenant Jason King, gunner of Apache \\"Palerider 1-6\\", was hit by AKM fireBernstein, p. 49 in the neck and suffered a severe hemorrhage, but he never lost consciousness. He was later evacuated to Germany for surgery, but returned to his unit a few weeks later. The Apaches were reluctant to return fire as most enemy fire was coming from houses and the risk of collateral damage was high. The helicopters scattered in search of the Medina Division, but were hampered by poor intelligence. Apache \\"Vampire 1-2\\", flown by Warrant Officers David S. Williams and Ronald D. Young Jr., was forced down into a marsh after gunfire severed its hydraulics. Its radio was also hit, preventing communication with the other helicopters. Attempting to flee the crash scene, both men swam down a canal, but were captured by armed civilians. The Iraqi government would later show the helicopter on TV and claim that it had been shot down by a farmer with a Brno rifle; however due to the high volume of anti-aircraft fire and the armor of the Apache, it is unlikely that a bolt-action rifle was responsible. The Apaches turned back for Tactical Assembly Area Vicksburg after a half-hour of combat. Most were without functioning navigation equipment. At least two narrowly avoided a mid- air collision.

Aftermath Of the 29 returning Apaches, all but one suffered serious damage. On average, each Apache had 15-20 bullet holes. One Apache took 29 hits. Sixteen main rotor blades, six tail blades, six engines, and five drive shafts were damaged beyond repair. In one squadron only a single helicopter was fit to fly. It took a month until the 11th Regiment was ready to fight again.

It is usually made of wood. The structure may be specially shaped to assist the projection, for example, being formed as a parabolic reflector. In the typical setting of a church building, the sounding board may be ornately carved or constructed. The term abat-voix, from the French word for the same thing (abattre (‚Äúto beat down‚Äù) + voix (‚Äúvoice‚Äù)), is also used in English. Sounding board may also be used figuratively to describe a person who listens to a speech or proposal in order that the speaker may rehearse or explore the proposition more fully. The term is also used inter-personally to describe one person listening to another, and especially to their ideas.

Hayden is the first woman and the first African American to hold the post. She is the first professional librarian appointed to the post in over 60 years. From 1993 until 2016, she was the CEO of Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, Maryland, and president of the American Library Association (ALA) from 2003 to 2004. During her presidency, she was the leading voice of the ALA in speaking out against the newly passed United States Patriot Act. In 2020 she was elected to the American Philosophical Society.  Early life  Hayden was born in Tallahassee, Florida, to Bruce Kennard Hayden, Jr., at that time Director of the String Department at Florida A&M; University in Tallahassee, and Colleen Hayden (n√©e Dowling), a social worker. Her parents met while attending Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois. Hayden grew up in Queens, New York. When she was 10 years old, her parents divorced and she moved with her mother to Chicago, Illinois. She had a younger half-brother from her father's second marriage, Bruce Kennard Hayden, III, who died in 1992. Hayden's mother's side of the family comes from Helena, Arkansas. Her father's maternal side of the family, who eventually settled in Du Quoin, Illinois, had been slaves, which is chronicled in the book, It's Good to Be Black, by Ruby Berkley Goodwin. Hayden said that her passion for reading was inspired by Marguerite de Angeli's Bright April, the 1946 book about a young African-American girl who was in the Brownies. At Chicago's South Shore High School, Hayden became interested in books on British history and \\"cozy mysteries.\\" She attended MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois, and then transferred to Roosevelt University. While she loved libraries she didn't consider it as a career until after she had graduated from Roosevelt University with majors in political science and African history in 1973. Hayden received her master's degree in Library Science in 1977, and a doctorate degree in Library Science in 1987, both from the University of Chicago Graduate Library School.  Career  Hayden (left) poses with actress Lynda Carter Hayden began her library career at the Chicago Public Library. From 1973 to 1979, she worked as an Associate/Children's Librarian and from 1979 to 1982, she was Young Adult Services Coordinator. From 1982 to 1987, Hayden worked as a Library Services Coordinator at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. Hayden moved to Pittsburgh, where she was an associate professor, teaching at the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences from 1987 to 1991. At the time, well known African-American librarians, E. J. Josey and Spencer Shaw, were on the faculty there. Hayden then moved back to Chicago and became Deputy Commissioner and Chief Librarian of the Chicago Public Library, posts she held from 1991 to 1993. During her time working at the Chicago Public Library, Hayden became acquainted with Michelle Obama and Barack Obama. From 1993 to 2016, Hayden was Executive Director of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library.  Enoch Pratt Free Library  On July 1, 1993, Hayden began the appointed position of Director at Enoch Pratt Free Library, the public library system in Baltimore, Maryland. During her tenure, Hayden oversaw a library co-operative with 22 locations, hundreds of employees, and an annual budget of $40 million. She also oversaw the first new branch opening in 35 years along with the renovation of the co-operative's central branch, at a cost of $112 million. During the 2015 protests of the death of Freddie Gray, Hayden kept Baltimore's libraries open, an act for which she received extensive praise. When asked about the incident in a 2016 Time Magazine interview she stated that the library became a command center of sorts as many stores in the community closed, and that \\"we knew that [people] would look for that place of refuge and relief and opportunity.\\" She left this position on August 11, 2016.  ALA presidency  As president of the American Library Association (ALA) from 2003 to 2004, Hayden chose the theme \\"Equity of Access.\\" In her role as ALA President, Hayden was vocal in her public opposition to the Patriot Act, leading a battle for the protections of library users' privacy. She especially objected to the special permissions contained in Section 215 of that law, which gave the Justice Department and the FBI the power to access library user records. Hayden often sparred publicly with then-U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft over the language of the law. Ashcroft often ridiculed the library community, and stated that the ALA had been \\"misled into opposing provisions of the act that make it easier for FBI agents to fish through library records\\". Hayden's response was immediate, stating that the ALA was \\"deeply concerned that the Attorney General would be so openly contemptuous\\" (to the library community), while also pointing out that librarians had been monitored and been under FBI surveillance as far back as the McCarthy Era. Hayden asserted that Ashcroft should release information as to the number of libraries that had been visited under the provisions of Section 215. She has stated that the concern stemmed from making sure that a balance existed \\"between security and personal freedoms.\\" As a result of her stand for the rights of every American, she became Ms. magazine's 2003 Woman of the Year. In her interview with the magazine, she stated: Hayden says, \\"(Librarians) are activists, engaged in the social work aspect of librarianship. Now we are fighters for freedom...\\" Along with her objections of the Patriot Act, Hayden has done much in her career in outreach programs. As ALA President she wrote: > At a time when our public is challenged on multiple fronts, we need to > recommit ourselves to the ideal of providing equal access to everyone, > anywhere, anytime, and in any format ... By finally embracing equity of > access we will be affirming our core values, recognizing realities, and > assuring our future. One program she is notable for is for the outreach program she began at the Enoch Pratt Free Library. This outreach program included \\"an after school center for Baltimore teens offering homework assistance and college and career counseling.\\" Because of this, Hayden received Library Journal's Librarian of the Year Award. In January 2010, President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate Hayden as a member of the National Museum and Library Services Board and National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities.  14th Librarian of Congress  Hayden's official portrait in 2020 On February 24, 2016, President Barack Obama nominated Hayden to serve as the next Librarian of Congress. In a press release from the White House, President Obama stated: > Michelle and I have known Carla Hayden for a long time, since her days > working at the Chicago Public Library, and I am proud to nominate her to > lead our nation's oldest federal institution as our 14th Librarian of > Congress. Hayden has devoted her career to modernizing libraries so that > everyone can participate in today's digital culture. She has the proven > experience, dedication, and deep knowledge of our nation's libraries to > serve our country well and that's why I look forward to working with her in > the months ahead. If confirmed, Hayden would be the first woman and the > first African American to hold the position ‚Äì both of which are long > overdue. Hayden speaks in 2019 After her nomination, more than 140 library, publishing, educational, and academic organizations signed a letter of support. The letter said in part that Congress had \\"an opportunity to equip the Library and the nation with the unique combination of professional skills and sensibilities that Dr. Hayden will bring to the post.\\" The nomination was received by the U.S. Senate and referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. On April 20, 2016, the Committee on Rules and Administration, chaired by Senator Roy Blunt with Charles E. Schumer as ranking member, held the confirmation hearing. Hayden opposed the 2000 Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which was a sticking point in her nomination to become Librarian of Congress. On July 13, 2016, she was confirmed as Librarian of Congress by a 74‚Äì18 vote in the United States Senate. Hayden was sworn in by Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts on September 14, 2016. Even though more than eighty percent of American librarians are women, for over two hundred years the position of Librarian of Congress was filled exclusively by white men, making Hayden the first woman and the first African American to hold the position. Notably, she is also a librarian by profession. Many past Librarians of Congress have been scholars and historians. As Librarian of Congress, Hayden says she hopes to continue \\"the movement to open the treasure chest that is the Library of Congress.\\" Hayden said much of her early effort will focus on building and retaining staff. In the next five years, Hayden will also focus on making sure that at least half of the library's 162 million items are digitized, especially rare collections. Hayden hopes for the library to have live performances and broadcasts and have traveling exhibits tour America that tie in with educational programming for schoolkids. Hayden aspires to modernize the institution during her tenure by both preserving the collection and modernizing access to it, as she will be the first Librarian of Congress appointed \\"since the advent of the internet.\\" In a press release by the ALA Washington Office, ALA President Julie Todaro said, \\"Hayden holds a profound understanding of the integral role libraries play in formal education, community-based learning, and the promotion of individual opportunity and community progress. I believe that through her visionary leadership the Library of Congress will soon mirror society's rapidly changing information environment, while successfully preserving the cultural record of the United States.\\" She spoke of her desire to reach people outside of Washington, D.C., especially in rural areas and in accessible formats to people with visual disabilities. Another one of her main goals is to improve the infrastructure and \\"technological capacity\\" of the Library of Congress. She is undecided if the United States Copyright Office, which is overseen by the Library, should be independent of the Library, but believes the Office should be \\"fully functional\\" and be able carry to out its mandates to protect creators. In January 2017, Hayden hosted 4-year old Daliyah Marie Arana as Librarian of Congress for the day.  Honors  In 1995, Hayden was honored with the national Librarian of the Year Award by Library Journal, becoming the first African American to receive the prestigious award. Her commitment to equity of access was central to the honor. * 1995: Library Journal, Librarian of the Year Award * 1995: Loyola University Maryland, Andrew White Medal * 1996: DuBois Circle of Baltimore, Legacy of Literacy Award * 1998: Johns Hopkins University, President's Medal * 2003: The Daily Record, Maryland's Top 100 Women * 2003: Ms. Magazine, Woman of the Year * 2006: American Library Association, Jean E.

He is the chef patron of the Gauthier Soho restaurant in Soho, London and was awarded a Michelin star in 2011. He previously held a Michelin star as head chef of the restaurant Roussillon in Pimlico, London, until 2010. He trained under Alain Ducasse at Le Louis XV in Monaco, and has appeared as a judge on two versions of the BBC One television show MasterChef. He became a vegan in 2016. Career In 1991 he started working in a restaurant for the first time, at the Hotel Negresco in Nice, France. He moved to work under Alain Ducasse at his Le Louis XV restaurant in Monaco between 1993 and 1996. He left Ducasse's employment to go to Roussillon in Pimlico, London, which opened in 1998 with Gauthier as head chef. The restaurant had previously been known as Marabel's, but was relaunched upon Gauthier's arrival. In 2000, it was awarded a Michelin star. It was also awarded three AA Rosettes, and won the Time Out \\"Best Vegetarian Award\\" in both 2000 and 2001. During the Bird Flu pandemic in 2005, Gauthier removed chicken, pigeon and foie gras from the menu at Roussillon after he noticed a drop in demand. Gauthier left Roussillon in 2010 to set up a new restaurant called Gauthier Soho; he had been looking for a new location to open his own restaurant as he wanted to move away from his two business partners. Gauthier kept his share of the ownership of Roussillon. Because of this, Roussillon lost its Michelin star and went on to go through two chefs before finally closing on 1 June 2012. After it closed, Gauthier stated to the industry press that he hoped to be able to buy back the location. Gauthier Soho was set up in the space formerly occupied by the Richard Corrigan restaurant called Lindsay House. His takeover of the location included a full renovation of the location, with the conversion of the ground floor into a wine shop. The new restaurant was a joint venture between Gauthier and sommelier Roberto della Pietra. A year after its opening, the new restaurant was also awarded a Michelin star. In 2011, whilst dining at the restaurant DuckSoup, Gauthier was seated at a table near to food critics Matthew Norman from The Daily Telegraph and Tracey MacLeod from The Independent. MacLeod had previously given Gauthier Soho a critical review, while Norman had given the restaurant the best review it had received in Gauthier's opinion. Whilst sitting there, Gauthier tweeted the actions of the food critics to his followers and criticised them on several points such as their loudness, a copy of The Independent sitting facing out in an open bag by MacLeod's feet and that Norman didn't know what aioli was. Gauthier later said that it was \\"nothing personal\\", and the critics took it in good spirits with Norman saying, \\"I am extremely loud in restaurants because I am a little hard of hearing, my wife is thrilled that this has finally been independently confirmed.\\" Gauthier doesn't believe in timers or pre-weighing food to determine cooking time. Instead, as demonstrated in his television appearances, he relies on touching food to determine whether or not it is cooked. He also likes to showcase vegetables in his cooking, saying that \\"if they have the right texture you can play with vegetables like meat or fish\\". Although he will create a vegetarian menu on request, his vegetable tasting menu at Gauthier Soho can include meat products such as a meat au jus in the preparation of the vegetables. In 2015, Gauthier changed his vegetable menu to be fully vegan. The 'Les Plantes' menu went on to win 'Best Vegan Menu' at the PETA Food Awards 2016. Gauthier became a vegan in 2016;http://www.alexisgauthier.co.uk/ he is now opposed to the \\"savagery\\" of meat, and \\"excited about a vegan future\\". He is transitioning his restaurants to be fully plant-based.https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/gauthier-soho- vegan-fine-dining-232004 Television work He appeared with Gregg Wallace and Michel Roux Jr. as a judge on BBC One's MasterChef: The Professionals in October 2009. He later also appeared on the regular MasterChef series, once more alongside Wallace, and also with John Torode in March 2011 and March 2019. Personal life Gauthier was diagnosed in October 2010 with a fatty liver, which resulted in him cutting down his calorie intake and listing calorie counts on his menu at Gauthier Soho.

The image is about 4 mm wide. Amphimedon queenslandica (formerly known as Reniera sp.) is a sponge native to the Great Barrier Reef. Its genome has been sequenced. It has been the subject of various studies on the evolution of metazoan development. A. queenslandica was first discovered in 1998 on Heron Island Reef by Sally Leys during a survey of sponge species, and was formally described by John Hooper and Rob van Soest in 2006. Like most sponges it has a biphasic life cycle, passing through a planktonic phase whilst a larva, but later becoming a benthic dweller. It is hermaphroditic, and reproduces via spermcast spawning, meaning it releases sperm into water but retains eggs, which are fertilised internally. The embryos develop in brood chambers until they reach a certain size, then disperse as parenchymella larvae. During this larval stage, they have a strong preference for darkness. The sponge is difficult or impossible to maintain in captivity.  Genetics  The genome of Amphimedon queenslandica was sequenced in 2009 to provide insights into the evolution of animal complexity and remains the only sponge to be sequenced.

Life history He was born to a family of village chief on January 18, 1867. He discontinued his studies at Tokyo Senmon Gakkou (which became Waseda University later) and joined the navy. He traveled to Miyako Island in order to start a venture business of culturing pearls in 1892. There he found that the people of Miyakojima were under the torture of taxation named \\"Nintouzei\\", or poll tax by the Ryukyuan Kingdom. People between age 15 and 50 were subject to taxation; women made textiles called Miyako Jofu and men were engaged in farming. It was said that men in Miyakojima over age 50 could not work any more. Together with Seian Gusukuma, who was a technician of sugar manufacture, he started a movement which was aimed at the abolition of the poll tax. First they appealed to Okinawa Prefecture Governor Narahara Shigeru, but the taxation system had been supported by samurais who gained by this system. Finally they went up to Tokyo and appealed for the abolition of the taxation system at the National Diet together with Kama Nishiura and Moushi Taira, representatives of the farmers. On their way to the Diet, they had met various objections, upon their departure, they had met strong expectations and strong supports from Miyako people.

The company was founded in 1958 and was bought by Great Britain‚Äôs Vitec Group plc. in 1995. History Wendelin Sachtler was a cinematographer, actor and inventor, living in South-Germany. In 1958 he designed the first tripod head. This so-called gyroscopic head provided not only pans and tilt motion, but also added gyroscopic damping to smooth out camera moves. The new tripod head proved so popular with fellow camera operators that it led to the foundation of a new company, Sachtler, to meet demand. He worked out of a small workshop in Munich-Schwabing, Germany. After a pair of moves, since 2004 Sachtler GmbH has been located in Eching near Munich. Sachtler has 150 employees worldwide and is represented by retailers in more than 140 countries. The company has production facilities in Germany, Costa Rica and Great Britain.Hermann Simon mentioned this company in his correspondent Book as an example of a \\"Hidden Champion\\" (Simon, Hermann: Hidden Champions of the 21st Century : Success Strategies of unknown World Market Leaders. London: Springer, 2009.- .) In 1992 the company was awarded the \\"Scientific and Engineering Award\\", an award set up by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 1995 Sachtler was acquired by the Vitec Group PLC. https://web.archive.org/web/20090204194339/http://vitecgroup.com/group/group_history.aspx In 2001 Sachtler and Curt O. Schaller launched the artemis camera stabilizer system at the NAB Show in Las Vegas. The artemis systems were the first modular camera stabilizer systems in the world. In addition, the artemis HD systems were the first Full HD camera stabilizer systems worldwide. The artemis Trinity system, developed by Curt O. Schaller together with Roman Foltyn in 2015, is the first camera stabilizer system in the world that combines a mechanical stabilization system with an electronic one. In April 2016, ARRI acquired the artemis camera stabilizer systems developed by Curt O. Schaller from Sachtler / Vitec Videocom. Products The company's portfolio can be divided into: * Camera support * High quality bags for storage and transportation of professional broadcast, camera and audio equipment The camera support division includes the production of Sachtler fluid heads, tripods and pedestals and professional bags for cameramen and sound operators.

Ten years after the establishment of the first year. The first permanent building called the Ilocos Norte Provincial High School, was completed in 1909 -- Two years after the Honorable Provincial Board appropriated necessary funds to cover the expenses incurred. This building is now part of Ilocos Norte College of Arts and Trades (or INCAT) as the Related- Subjects-Building. It was used to provide adequate facilities for an expanded school population, it was however destroyed in the summer of June, 1941 due to a fire. A new school building was erected in 1929 in an adjacent site where INNHS now stands. Due to the unexpected destruction of the Related-Subjects- Building, the students of the following year were forced to study in improvised classrooms in several rented houses and in the grandstands of the provincial Grounds (also known as Marcos Stadium) During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines Girls and Boys were segregated into two separate buildings known as the Boy's High School and the Girl's High School, but after some time it was destroyed, the source of which is unknown. However, with the aid of the U.S.A under the Rehabilitation Act of 1946 the destroyed building was rehabilitated. During its early years of its existence, the school was administered by America, the first of which was a man named Mr. George Summers who later married the former Ms. Julia Agcaoili and the last American was Mr. Muilenberg. From thence on the position was held by Filipinos, Mr. Jose Aguila held the position from 1936 until 1937. The first alumnus of the school to be had by his Alma Mater is a Mr. Fermin Montano.

The specific name boucheti is in honor of French malacologist Philippe Bouchet. Distribution Map of southern part of the Central Indian Ridge (CIR) showing location of the Kairei hydrothermal vent site. The type locality is the Kairei hydrothermal vent site on the Central Indian Ridge, just north of the Rodrigues Triple Point. It occurs in a distinct microhabitat of black smokers and sites of diffuse venting at a depth of 2424 to 2443 meters. Description Threats  Vent fields in the Indian Ocean seabed are of particular interest for exploration of polymetallic sulfide mineral resources. An exploration-phase license for the Triple Point region was granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany under a 15-year contract, expiring in 2030. The license permits the extraction of mineral resources for technological and geological exploration purposes, yet even such restricted disturbances possess direct and indirect concerns to subpopulations of Iphinopsis boucheti. Habitat destruction through mineral extraction and the spread of sediment plumes from the agitation of vent fields and adjacent deposits have been cited as potential threats to this species.

In some locations of the town, both Mersin and the Mediterranean Sea can be viewed. The road between Mersin and G√∂zne is quite well cared and accessible whole year, the average travel time being about 30 minutes. The winter (settled) population of the town was 3746 (2012 est.) Turksat  History  It is known that there was a prehistoric settlement in the area which now is G√∂zne. So far, only one inscription has been unearthed which is in Aramaic. G√∂zne Castle was built in the Middle Age. The modern settlement in G√∂zne dates back to 19th century when people from Mersin and Tarsus began to use the surrounding as a summer resort (). During the Turkish War of Independence, Mersin and Tarsus were under French occupation See Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement and G√∂zne was one of the centers of the nationalists. After the liberation of Mersin in 1922, G√∂zne became a village and then a town in 1956.  G√∂zne as summer resort  Both being Mediterranean cities, Mersin and Tarsus are hot during the summers months. So it was a practice among the people to migrate to G√∂zne in summer months. During the 19th century and early 20th century, usually the landlords stayed in Mersin and met with their families on the weekends. However, after the roads were constructed it is just a short drive from Mersin, and it is possible to spend the night in G√∂zne and work in Mersin. Nevertheless, after the beginning of beach tourism and other touristic activities as well as the advance in climatization technology, G√∂zne is not as popular as it used to be.

The most widely used composition is with 16% Al. An alloy with 13% Al is also sometimes referred to as alfer. It exhibits large magnetostriction and it is used in magnetoelastic sensors. Later during the WW2, Japanese used the alloy with 12.7-12.9% aluminium as a replacement of nickel for the magnetostrictive transducers used in their Type 93 model 5, Type 3, and Simple naval sonars. Alperm is magnetically soft and exhibits high magnetic permeability. The material can be produced in 0.5 mm thick sheets, as well as 50-60 Œºm thick ribbons. The coercivity is usually below 5 A/m (for alfer it is around 50 A/m) and permeability 55 000 (for alfer 4000). Saturation flux density is 0.8 T (for alfer 1.28 T). The addition of Al increases electrical resistivity of alloy up to 140 ŒºŒ©m, which is almost four times the value in commonly used 3% SiFe electrical steel. For this reason alperm can be used in higher frequency range. However, because of the Al content the material is more susceptible to oxidation. The alloy was discovered by Japanese researchers H. Masumoto and Hideo Saito in 1939.

The original winter gardens comprised a theatre, opera house, aquarium, a small zoo, conservatory, promenades and halls situated under the grand glass domes. History The Winter Gardens were opened on 16 September 1874, on what was then the sea front at Southport. The building was in the form of two pavilions connected by a covered promenade, designed by Maxwell & Tuke of Manchester. Layout Southport Winter Gardens Artist drawing from 1874 The building had two Germano-Gothic pavilions, one of which held a concert hall known as the 'Pavilion', while the other was the iron and glass Winter Garden (known as the 'Conservatory'). The Pavilion had a capacity for 2,500 people and the Winter Garden was a total 180 ft in length with a maximum height of 80 ft. (In comparison, the central section of the Kew Palm House is just over 137 ft long and 63 ft high.) Southport Winter Garden was advertised as the largest conservatory in England and being the first seaside Winter Garden in the UK. Refreshment rooms and an aquarium filled the basement level. Decline Although it was one of the biggest buildings ever to grace an English sea front, the Winter Garden was not a great commercial success. The Southport Pavilion and Winter Gardens Company, which promoted it was locally based and had wide support in the town and throughout the north-west with 350 shareholders at its peak, but the addition of Frank Matcham's Opera House on an adjacent site in 1890‚Äì91 strained the capital base too far, and the Company went into liquidation in 1898. Many companies rapidly came and went in an effort to save the Winter Gardens in an attempt to turn a profit. Entertainments were lost or driven downmarket, until the Winter Garden was converted into a ballroom and roller skating rink, and the Pavilion became a cinema. Eventually both were demolished, the Winter Garden in 1933 and the Pavilion in 1962.http://www.lynnpearson.co.uk/palaces5.pdf Opera House The Opera House was built on Lord Street as an additional attraction to the main winter gardens complex. It opened on 7 September 1891 and was supported by leading dramatic companies in the area. It was designed by Frank Matcham, architect of many theatres in the United Kingdom. The building seated 2,000 people and cost around ¬£20,000 to build. At the time the Opera House theatre was considered nationally to be one of Matcham's finest creations. The venue was a great success and had many well known performers attend including Ellen Terry, Matheson Lang, Sir Henry Irving. In December 1929 a fire raged through the building completely destroying it.Grundy, I. (2005) \\"Playing Bingo - History and Folklore - Southport Garrick, Part 1.\\" http://playingbingo.co.uk/bingo- history-folklore/03-southport-garrick-history-1.shtml#axzz12EEDNWjD Garrick Theatre The Garrick Theatre was built during the 1930s on the site of the old Opera House following the fire. It hosted musicals, comedies and dramatic plays. Tommy Handley, George Formby, Gordon Harker, Robertson Hare are to name a few of the well known artists to have performed at the theatre. Today the Garrick is home to a Mecca Bingo hall. The Ribble Building=Railway Station The Ribble Building is a former Victorian building that was built on the site of the Winter Gardens to house the Southport Lord Street railway station The Station opened on 1 September 1884 as the Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway's (SCLER) northern terminus, which provided an alternative route to Liverpool City Centre from Southport, which ran coastally through the Sand Dunes. The last trains left the station on Saturday, 5 January 1952. Bus Station After the closure of the railway station Southport Lord Street Station was taken over by Ribble Buses. The spaces in between the platforms were filled in, but the rest of the interior remained the same. The train shed remained in use by the bus company until Ribble Buses ceased to operate from the building in the early 1990s. The train shed was later demolished but the frontage on Lord Street was retained and still exists today. In 2014 it was internally converted and opened as a Travelodge Hotel. The Ribble Building in 2007 Model Village The first model village in Southport was once situated on the Winter Gardens site and was known as the Land of the Little People. The Model village was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the aborted Winter Gardens/SIBEC shopping development. The site is now occupied by Morrisons car park and petrol garage. Winter Gardens Shopping Development In 1991 the ¬£40million plan known as the Winter Gardens Project crumbled as the construction company responsible for the projects went into receivership, a new developer was sought to continue the construction work on the already half built department store planned for the site.https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/archive/12apr91-uk-southport-winter- gardens-set-for-sell-off-after-attempts-to-find-new-contractor-are- abandoned-11-04-1991/ The work was finally completed for the new Safeway supermarket, which opened in the early 1990s, but the Winter Gardens Style shopping centre was never fully completed to the plans. Safeway later extended the car parking facilities and added a petrol garage to their facilities on site. The Safeway supermarket was taken over by Morrisons in 2004. A mural in memory of the Winter Gardens can be seen as you look up upon entering the main entrance to the Morrisons Store on the site today.

The species was first described in 1972 by Denton and Kinsella, who wrote that it was closest to Lyperosomum sinuosum, known from birds and raccoons in the United States and Brazil.Denton and Kinsella, 1972, p. 227 Three years later, Denton and Kissinger placed the two, together with a number of other species, in a new subgenus of Lyperosomum, Sinuosoides.Denton and Kissinger, 1975, p. 42 Species of Lyperosomum mainly infect birds; L. intermedium is one of the few species to infect a mammal. Lyperosomum intermedium is a long-bodied, parallel-sided, semitransparent worm with rounded ends. Length is 1650 to 4200 Œºm and width is 335 to 420 Œºm. The pharynx is rounded and has a diameter of 60 to 74 Œºm and the esophagus is straight to a bit curved in form and about 60 Œºm long. The testes are oval to rounded and have a diameter of 111 to 240 Œºm. The uterus is large. Eggs are light brown, have thin shells, and are 46 to 51 Œºm long and 23 to 27 Œºm wide. L. intermedium is smaller and broader than L. sinuosum and does not tend to assume a curved shape in fixation, as that species does. The two also differ in other anatomical details, such as the location and size of various body parts. Lyperosomum intermedium has been found in rats of saltmarshes in Florida and Georgia. It was found in 28 of 72 rice rats at Cedar Key, Florida, with the number of flukes per infected rat ranging from one to 150 (average 17), and in five of six rice rats from Sapelo Island, Georgia, with two to 51 flukes per rat (average 18), but did not occur in more than 100 rice rats from freshwater marshes in Florida.

The English lyrics have been credited to Joseph Campbell (1879‚Äì1944, also known as Seosamh MacCathmhaoil and Joseph McCahill, among others).Songs of Uladh (Herbert Hughes and Joseph Campbell) published in Belfast by William Mullan and Sons; in Dublin by MH Gill, 1904 Campbell was a Belfast man whose grandparents came from the Irish-speaking area of Flurrybridge, South Armagh. He started collecting songs in County Antrim. In 1904 he began a collaboration with composer Herbert Hughes.Norah Saunders, 1988. Joseph Campbell: Poet & Nationalist 1879-1944, a Critical Biography Together, they collected traditional airs from the remote parts of County Donegal. While on holidays in Donegal, Hughes had learned the air from Proinseas mac Suibhne, who had learned it from his father Seaghan mac Suibhne, who in turn had learned it fifty years previously from a man working with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. Campbell said that mac Suibhne knew the tune under the title of \\"The Belfast Maid\\", but did not know the words. A song by this title was published in various early 19th century broadsides, with the first lines \\"In Belfast town of high renown / There lives a comely maid\\".A new song called The Belfast Maid Broadside Ballads Online from the Bodleian Libraries, Harding B25(165) This ballad now has Roud number 2930. The Lagan referred to in the title most likely is the River Lagan in Belfast. Campbell's words mention Lambeg, which is just outside the city. The Lagan is the river that runs through Belfast.

He established the famous \\"Gorham's Rangers\\". He also commissioned two armed vessels: the Anson (Captain John Beare) and the Warren (70 tons, Captain Jonathan Davis), who patrolled off Nova Scotia. Gorham was first commissioned captain of a provincial auxiliary company in June 1744, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the 7th Massachusetts provincial Infantry Regiment in February 1745. Two years later, in 1747, he was commissioned captain of an independent company in the British Army when his unit was adopted into the regular army. He is sometimes confused with his father, Shubael Gorham (born in Barnstable, Massachusetts, 2 September 1686; died at Louisbourg, Nova Scotia, 20 February 1746), a provincial colonel during King George's War. He was the one of only a handful of American rangers - including, Gorham, his younger brother Joseph Gorham, Benoni Danks, and later Robert Rogers - to earn commissions in the British Army.Grenier, 2005, p. 76. Some historians, other than Grenier, contend this argument about who received these commissions first is not only flawed but irrelevant. Dozens of Americans received commissions from the British army in King George's War and the French and Indian War. For instance, several dozen were commissioned in the 50th and 51st regiments recruited in 1754‚Äì55. Yet Rogers' commission is often singled out as exceptional. While amateur ranger enthusiasts are fascinated by this, just why it matters is unclear. John Gorham was active during King George's War and Father Le Loutre‚Äôs War.  Family  The Gorham family had a long history of ranging which began under Benjamin Church. John Gorham I died while fighting alongside Church in the famous Great Swamp Fight. (Gorham, Maine and Gorham, New Hampshire are named for John Gorham I.)Josiah Pierce. A History of the town of Gorham, Maine. p. 169 John Gorham II also served with Church during the fourth Eastward Expedition into Acadia, which involved the Raid on Chignecto (1696) during King William's War. His son Shubael Gorham was a provincial officer of note during Queen Anne's and King George's War, during the latter he commanded the 7th Massachusetts Provincial Regiment at the Siege of Louisbourg (1745). Finally, John Gorham III, the subject of this article, and his brother Joseph Gorham served in Acadia as rangers,The first way of war: American War Making on the Frontier, 1607‚Äì1814 By John Grenier, p. 37 Joseph Gorham 1749 taken prisoneras well as in their father's regiment about Louisburg. Historical context Despite the Conquest of 1710 and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 with France, the British were not able to establish control in Nova Scotia/Acadia for decades. John Gorham and his Rangers arrived in Nova Scotia to move the military and political influence of the British beyond a defensive posture at Annapolis Royal and the fishing village of Canso. Gorham moved the British operation on to the offensive during King George's War. King George's War= Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744)  During King George's War, Gorham and his company of Indian rangers from New England were involved in defending Fort Anne from attacks from the French, Acadians, and Mi‚Äôkmaq. During the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744), on 4 October, Gorham and his rangers massacred Mi'kmaq men along with five women and three children that were in two nearby wigwams.Ruth Holmes Whitehead. The Old Man Told Us: Excerpts from Mimcac History. Nimbus. 1991. pp. 102‚Äì103; Grenier, Far Reaches of Empire. p. 118; Faragher, pp. 219‚Äì220 Governor Mascarene noted that the New England Rangers way of war was more effective than that practiced by conventional British troops.Ruth Whitehead, p. 102 On another occasion in October, Gorham returned with three scalps and a live native baby. Governor Shirley wrote in February 1746 that \\"the great Service which Lieut. Colonel Gorham‚Äôs Company of Rangers has been to the Garrison at Annapolis Royal, is a demonstration of the Usefulness of such a Corps.\\" The Maliseet and Mi'kmaq sought revenge for the ranger's killing of Mi'kmaq families during the siege. During the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1745), the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet took prisoner the captain of a provincial transport vessel, William Pote, as well as some of Gorham's Rangers, including four Wampanoags from Cape Cod: Jacob Chammock, Philip Will, Caleb Popmonet, and Isaac Peck, as well as Peter Dogamus, a Nauset Indian from Yarmouth, Massachusetts.Brian Carroll, \\"Savages in the Service of Empire: Native American Soldiers in Gorham's Rangers, 1744‚Äì1762,\\" New England Quarterly 85.3 (Sept. 2012): 401-409. John Gorham himself was not at Annapolis because he was fighting alongside his father in the Siege of Louisbourg. Among other places, Pote and the Native rangers were taken to the Maliseet village Aukpaque on the Saint John River. While at the village, Mi'kmaq from Nova Scotia arrived and, on July 6, 1745, tortured Pote and Chammock as retribution for the killing of family members by members of Gorham's company.Raymond, pp. 42‚Äì43 On July 10, Pote witnessed another act of revenge when the Mi'kmaq tortured an Indian ranger (possibly Popmonet or Dogamus) at Meductic.Raymond, p. 45  Siege of Louisbourg (1745)  Gorham fought alongside his father in the Siege of Louisbourg (1745). His father died just after the siege, apparently from natural causes. Gorham received a commission to defend Nova Scotia. In 1748 he was in command of Gorham's Independent Company of Rangers. This company had in its ranks many of the Wampanoag people, and was stationed in Nova Scotia. During 1748, Gorham's Rangers continued to be with the British regulars at Annapolis Royal. In the autumn of 1748, Gorham destroyed the Acadian resistance at Minas and then sailed (October 19) over to the Saint John River to end the Acadian and Maliseet resistance. Father Le Loutre's War John Gorham's Point, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1750Gorham's point was located at the foot of present-day Garish Street and is the location of where Gorham built the first recorded vessel in Halifax, Osborne, the first ship left Halifax in August of 1751. (See Bates, p. 67, note 109). Soon after the arrival of Governor Edward Cornwallis, on July 14, 1749, Gorham was appointed to the Nova Scotia Council.Akins, Thomas B. History of Halifax. Brook House Press, Dartmouth, 2002. Despite Gorham being put on the Council, Cornwallis was clear that he preferred Francis Bartelo of the two ranger leaders. In 1749, during Father Le Loutre's War, Gorham built Fort Sackville at present- day Bedford, Nova Scotia. He also participated in the Battle at St. Croix and the Battle at Chignecto. Frontier warfare was the standard practice of warfare between New England and the Wabanaki Confederacy in Acadia since the beginning of King William's War in 1689.The first way of war: American war making on the frontier, 1607‚Äì1814 Cambridge University Press. 2005. In Acadia and Nova Scotia, both the British and Mi'kmaq forces were engaged in frontier warfare or total war, that is, both sides of the conflict repeatedly killed families. While the British paid the New England Rangers for Mi'kmaq scalps, the French paid the Mi'kmaq for British scalps.The regiments of both the French and British militaries were not skilled at frontier warfare, while the Natives and Rangers were. British officers Cornwallis and Amherst both expressed dismay over the tactics of the rangers and the Mi'kmaq (See Grenier, 2008. p. 152, Faragher, p. 405). Gorham held his position on the Council for two years and then in August 1751 Gorham left Nova Scotia for England. He died in London of smallpox in December 1751.

Test series=First TestSecond TestThird TestFourth Test After being put into bat by Pakistan, England were reduced to 102 for 7 on the second day. Jonathan Trott and Stuart Broad then put on a world record score for the eighth wicket with a partnership of 332. =Betting allegations= On the third day of the 4th Test, British newspaper News of the World published a story with allegations that an agent loosely affiliated with some of the Pakistani players (later identified as Mazhar Majeed) had accepted a ¬£150,000 (US$232,665) bribe from undercover reporters for information that two Pakistani bowlers (Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir) would deliberately deliver no-balls at specific points during the match, information which could be used by gamblers to make wagers with inside information (a process known as spot- fixing, compared with match fixing to predetermine a match result). In the video posted by News of the World, Majeed, counting out the bribe money, predicted that Amir would be Pakistan's bowler for the third over, and that the first ball of that over would be a no-ball delivery. Amir did bowl the third over, and on his first delivery from the over, bowled a no-ball delivery. Commentary described the delivery as a \\"massive overstep\\", a good half-metre beyond the popping crease following the television replay of the delivery. Majeed also predicted that the sixth delivery of the tenth over would be a no-ball, and the ball, delivered by Asif, was also a no-ball delivery. As a result of the allegations and video posted by News of the World, Scotland Yard announced during the evening that they had arrested Majeed on charges of suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers. Two days later, after the Test match had completed, three more arrests were made (two unidentified men and an unidentified woman) on money laundering charges in connection with the allegations. Police also seized the cell phones of Asif, Amir, and Salman Butt as part of their investigations. Yawar Saeed, the Pakistan team manager insisted after the conclusion of the test series that the T20 series and the ODI series will be played. He also refused to say that Butt should resign as Test captain. On 1 November 2011, Asif, Amir and Butt were found guilty for their part in the spot-fixing and were given prison sentences, ranging from six months to 30 months. Twenty20 series Following the betting allegations, Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir and Salman Butt were eventually dropped from the Twenty20 and One day squad's at the players request. They had not been suspended, and three players would be called up to replace them. This followed several days where the PCB refused to drop or suspend the players from the rest of the tour, even after England requested that the trio sit out the rest of the tour. On 2 September 2010, after the warm-up List A game between Pakistan and Somerset, the International Cricket Council announced that they had suspended Asif, Amir and Butt under the provision of the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code.

As she had no siblings, her father made her his heiress. He died in 1717 and she succeeded to his lands which passed to the House of Rohan. The Dukedom of Ventadour however was extinct. In 1689, according to the memoirs of the marquis de Dangeau, Anne Genevi√®ve was a proposed bride for Jacques Henri de Durfort (1670-1697), the son of Jacques Henri de Durfort (1625-1704) and Marguerite F√©lice de L√©vis - the latter was Anne Genevi√®ve's own paternal aunt making the proposed groom her first cousin.

The couple married in Paris on 16 February 1691. As the House of La Tour d'Auvergne ranked as Foreign princes at Versailles, this entitled them to the style of Highness. As such, Anne Genevi√®ve took on this style. As part of her dowry, she was given the Lordship of Roberval which went to the House of La Tour d'Auvergne. The couple had no children as Louis was called to take part in the Battle of Steenkerque in 1692 and died having been injured. The young Princess of Turenne was a widow at the age of nineteen.

She married again on 15 February 1694 to Hercule M√©riadec de Rohan, son of Fran√ßois de Rohan, Prince of Soubise and Anne Julie de Rohan, one time mistress of Louis XIV. As the Princes of the House of Rohan also held the rank of Foreign princes, Anne Genevi√®ve was able to keep her style of Her Highness. Her second marriage produced five children, three of which would have progeny. She lost her only son Jules to smallpox in 1724 as well as her daughter in law Anne Julie de Melun. Her grandson, Charles, Prince of Soubise was born in 1710 and after the death of his parents, was raised by his grand father Hercule M√©riadec.

While it achieved promising results during testing, including the establishment of several world records during flight tests, the French Government chose to cancel its order for the Trident, leaving it as a development programme only. During the 1940s, as part of a wider effort to re-build French military power and to furnish France with advanced, new domestically-produced designs, a request for a supersonic-capable point defence interceptor aircraft to equip the French Air Force was issued to SNCASO. In response, the firm designed the mixed- propulsion Trident, powered by a single SEPR rocket engine, which was augmented by wing-tip mounted turbojet engines. On 2 March 1953, the first prototype Trident I conducted its maiden flight. Subsequently, refitted with Dassault-built MD 30 Viper ASV.5 wing tip engines, the prototype soon exceeded Mach 1 during a shallow dive even without the rocket motor installed. During an 18-month-long test programme, over 100 flights were conducted, during which a maximum speed of Mach 1.8 and a peak altitude of 20,000 metres (65,000 ft) were attained. On 21 May 1957, the first Trident II, 001, exploded during a test flight due an uncontrolled mixing of its fuels, Furaline and nitric acid, resulting in the loss of the aircraft and the death of its pilot, Charles Goujon. Despite having reached a late stage of development and achieving promising performance with the addition of nearly a dozen pre-production aircraft by July 1957, it was decided to terminate all work on the Trident programme during that same month. Allegedly, the cancellation had been a result of political factors at play, including those of the neighbouring United Kingdom, who had recently announced the cancellation of dozens of aircraft programmes during the infamous 1957 Defence White Paper. Regardless of the reasons for termination, the Trident never entered production nor operational service. Design and development=Origins During the late 1940s, following the end of the Second World War, France quickly set about its recovery and the rebuilding of its military, particularly the French Air Force. During this time, the French Air Staff sought both to become a strong military force once again and to foster the indigenous development of advanced military aircraft. In this respect, one area of high interest for prospective development was the relatively new field of rocket-powered aircraft. According to author Michel van Pelt, French Air Force officials were against a pure rocket-powered fight, akin to the wartime-era Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet, but instead favoured a mixed-propulsion approach, using a combination of rocket and turbojet engines. During 1944, a new company, Soci√©t√© d'Etudes pour la Propulsion par R√©action (SEPR), was founded for the purpose of developing France's own domestic rocket engines.Pelt 2012, p. 158. Accordingly, French aircraft company SNCASO received a request from the Air Staff to conduct activities upon the development of a capable and advanced point defence interceptor aircraft. During October 1948, SNCASO commenced work upon a series of design studies with the formal request in mind.Gunston 1981, pp. 218‚Äì219. Out of these studies, one particular design, led by aircraft engineer Lucien Servanty, emerged of a shoulder-wing monoplane which was capable of supersonic speeds. The envisioned aircraft made use of a mixed-propulsion configuration, being primarily powered by a single SEPR-built rocket engine and augmented with a set of wing-tip mounted turbojet engines; operationally, both rocket and turbojet engines were to be used to perform a rapid climb and interception at high altitudes, while the jet engines alone would be used to return to base. The rocket engine selected was based upon the unit used upon the Matra M.04 missile. It was powered by a mixture of Furaline and nitric acid; according to Pelt, the decision to use nitric acid as the oxidizing agent posed some challenges as it was corrosive to both the airframe and engine. The combination of Furaline, which was relatively difficult to manufacture in comparison to conventional kerosene, and nitric acid functioned as a hypergolic propellant, not requiring any igniting agent. However, as manned rocket aircraft were an entirely unknown commodity within France, it was decided to modify a single existing aircraft, the Sud-Ouest Espadon, to serve as an aerial test bed to prove the propulsion arrangement. During March 1951, the first ground tests of the rocket engine was performed; on 10 June 1952, the adapted Espadon test bed performed its maiden flight.Pelt 2012, pp. 158‚Äì159. During its test programme, improved rocket engines were trialed and the aircraft became the first European aircraft to attain Mach 1 during level flight.Pelt 2012, p. 159. Encouraged by the performance of the Espadon, the French Air Force issued a request to French aircraft companies for a high- speed lightweight interceptor aircraft that harnessed either turbojet or rocket propulsion, or some combination thereof. Amongst the specified requirements given were the ability to attain Mach 1.3, a relatively high climb rate, and the possibility of deploying the aircraft from austere airstrips. Amongst the various responses from French industry was SNCASO with their own proposal, which was based upon their earlier design studies; their design was later designated as the SO.9000 Trident. The Trident was a fast- looking bullet-shaped aircraft, furnished with an aerodynamically clean fuselage and thin, straight wings in order to minimise drag. The design of the Trident was unusual for more than just its mixed-propulsion arrangement. Instead of a conventional ejection seat, the entire nose section in which the pilot was accommodated could be jettisoned.Pelt 2012, p. 160. Particular attention had been dedicated to the control system to ensure it would be suitable throughout the transonic and supersonic stages of flight; while conventional ailerons were be used when flown at slow speeds, these would be locked out of use at higher speeds to prevent the formation of shock waves; instead, differential application of the flight control surfaces upon the horizontal surfaces of the tail unit controlled roll instead. All three tail surfaces were all-moving, eliminating the requirement for separate elevators and rudders while preventing control lock-ups during high speeds. Suitably impressed with the design and its projected performance, SNCASO received a contract to proceed with development. Accordingly, work on the production of a pair of prototypes commenced shortly thereafter.Pelt 2012, pp. 159‚Äì160. Test flights On 2 March 1953, the first prototype Trident I conducted the type's maiden flight; flown by test pilot Jacques Guignard, the aircraft used the entire length of the runway to get airborne, being powered only by its turbojet engines. It was initially flown without any rocket engine installed, relying solely upon its turbojet engines instead.Pelt 2012, pp. 160‚Äì161. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, the early test flights of the SO.9000 were 'hairy' prior to the installation of the rocket motor, which first occurred during September 1954. On 1 September 1953, during the first flight of the second Trident I prototype, flown by Guignard, the aircraft crashed after struggling to gain altitude after takeoff and colliding with an electricity pylon, resulting in its loss and Guignard sustaining severe injuries.Pelt 2012, p. 161. On 16 January 1954, test flights using the remaining Trident I prototype were resumed, flown by test pilot Charles Goujon. Partially in response to the loss of the second Trident I due to a lack of engine power, it was decided to adopt new turbojet engines in the form of the more powerful Dassault MD.30 Viper, a license-produced version of the British Armstrong Siddeley Viper engine, which were capable of producing 7.34 kN (1,654 lbf) thrust each, nearly double the thrust of the original engines. During March 1955, the first Trident I prototype performed its first flight following its refitting with the Viper engines. Powered by these engines, the aircraft soon proved its ability to exceed Mach 1 during a shallow dive even without the added thrust of the rocket motor.Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1956/7, pp. 154‚Äì155. In April 1956, it was decided to end flight testing with the sole remaining Trident I. During the 18-month-long flight test programme, the Trident I had completed over 100 flights, having eventually reached a maximum recorded speed of Mach 1.8 and a peak altitude of 20,000 metres (65,000 ft). A total of 24 of these flights had been flown using the rocket engine. According to Pelt, the French Air Force were impressed by the performance of the Trident, and were keen to adopt an improved operationally- capable model into service.Pelt 2012, pp. 161‚Äì162. By May 1957, an initial order for a batch of 10 pre-production Tridents had been issued. On 21 May 1957, the first Trident II, 001, was destroyed during a test flight out of Centre d'Essais en Vol (Flight Test Center); caused when highly volatile rocket fuel and oxidiser, Furaline ( C13H12N2O) and Nitric acid (HNO3) respectively, accidentally mixed and exploded, resulting in the death of test pilot Charles Goujon.Jackson 1986, p. 91.\\"The Paris Show...\\" Flight, 31 May 1957. p. 740. Retrieved: 15 October 2010. During 1958, the Trident II established new time-to-height and altitude records; its officially-observed record-breaking altitude of was achieved during a flight in May, flown by test pilot Roger Carpentier.\\"Trident's 79,720ft.\\" Flight, 9 May 1958. p. 623. During July 1957, a decision was taken to terminate all work upon the programme. According to Gunston, the cancellation had been heavily influenced by political developments in the neighbouring United Kingdom, specifically the announcement of the 1957 Defence White Paper by the British Defence Minister, Duncan Sandys, in which a large number of advanced aircraft development programmes, including their own mixed-power interceptor programme, had been abruptly aborted in favour of concentrating upon the development of missiles instead.

The students chose this animal in the late 1960s, in part because of the creature is not a predator. Students also identified with, and tended to share, its nocturnal biological rhythm. Woolman students, faculty, and alumni also refer to themselves as Woolmanites. Curriculum In the days of John Woolman School, a full complement of classes were offered from biology to creative writing and AP calculus. Since its rebirth in 2003, the Woolman Semester emphasizes the topics of World Issues, Peace Studies, Environmental Science, and Nonviolent Communication. It also uses the arts to promote learning, in ceramics and drawing classes. Campus The campus consists of of wood- and grasslands, including eight cabins on the west side of campus, each able to house five students, and twelve A-frames on the east side of campus, each capable of housing two students. All cabins are heated with wood- burning stoves in the winter. Each residential area has a bath house, each containing four sinks, four toilets, and two showers. The facility includes five main classrooms, a pottery and art building, and a large barn-shaped library. It is also used as the meeting house for the local Friends Meeting (Quaker). The dining hall has half of a welding gas tank, which is struck as a bell to call students and faculty to meals. Behind the Library/Meeting house is a multi-chambered step kiln. Houses and apartments have been built for use as faculty residences around the campus. Natural aspects of the campus include the meadows and Mel's Pond, named after the man who dug it out. Many acres of forest and trails lead through the local area. The Crystal Tree is arrayed with crystals hung by students. Until the winter of 1977-78, a large oak tree with a rope swing stood in a pasture near the center of campus. Songwriter Kate Wolf visited the school in 1977, and wrote a song called \\"Fly Away\\" about the rope swing tree, which appears on her album The Wind Blows Wild and on a DVD of one of her concerts.

The case dealt with limits of the powers of the Australian Federal Government under sections 51 and 92 of the Australian Constitution. The outcome of the case was that the Federal Government could found a federally owned airline, but it could not hinder private sector competition with that airline. Background In mid-1945, the Labor Federal Government of Prime Minister Ben Chifley introduced a bill into the House of Representatives that would have the effect of nationalising interstate Airlines in Australia. At the time, Australian National Airways (\\"ANA\\") was the dominant domestic carrier in Australia. After the bill received Royal Assent as the \\"Australian Airlines Act (1945)\\", it was immediately challenged by ANA in the High Court in its \\"original jurisdiction\\" as arbiter of Constitutional Law. ANA argued that the Act was in breach of sections 51 and 92 of the Constitution. Decision The High Court, per curiam, found that while nationalised enterprises could be established, ss 51 and 92 did not empower the Commonwealth to acquire pre-existing enterprises (in this case, an airline). ANA then sought to apply for a certificate under Section 74 of the Constitution of Australia to appeal to the Privy Council for a judgment on further restriction of Commonwealth powers.

He is known for being shipwrecked at R√∏st in northern Norway during the winter of 1432, and subsequently returning to Venice, where he wrote a report of his travels for the senate. He is also credited with popularizing Stockfish in the Veneto region, where it is prepared as Baccal√† alla Vicentina. History Bound for Bruges in Flanders in 1431, his merchant ship encountered a terrible storm off the western coast of France. The storm ravaged the ship, and the sailors had to go in the lifeboats. They fought the storm and cold for weeks. Many men drowned or died of starvation and fatigue when, left to their own fates, drifted on the Gulf Stream far across the North sea. Just after the new year, in January 1432, the survivors stranded on an island amid the skerries near R√∏st in Lofoten. Only eleven men, of a crew that totaled 68, made it. They were found by local fishermen, after nearly a month, and eventually spent more than three months together with the R√∏st inhabitants. This dramatic incident was the origin of trade between northern Norway and Italy, that made possible - among other beneficial outcomes - the combination of Norwegian stockfish and Italian cooking Querini opera The lyric opera based on the dramatic story about Pietro Querini was shown for the first time on R√∏st in 2012, and then again in 2014. It was very well received by critics, including by the Financial Times. The music is composed by Norwegian musician and composer Henning Sommerro. The author of the libretto is Ragnar Olsen.

Foundation  The industrialists of the Rhineland and the Bergisches Land, then part of Prussia, sought to avoid paying the high tolls for using the Rhine imposed by the Netherlands and very early in its development, saw the possibility of the new means of transport, the railway. As early as the 1830s committees were established the cities of the Rhineland to promote proposals for building railways. Some of the members of the Cologne committee under David Hansemann (1790‚Äì1864)‚Äîa merchant and banker from Aachen‚Äîand the Aachen Committee favoured a railway line through Belgium to the seaport of Antwerp via Liege. Belgium, which had been established as recently as 1830, was interested in trade relations with Prussia, which then included most of the Rhineland. Not having access to the Rhine, Belgium was at a commercial disadvantage to the Netherlands and therefore moved faster than any other country on the continent to build a rail network. The supporters of the line to Antwerp founded the Rhenish Railway Company on 25 July 1835 in Cologne. Its first president was Ludolf Camphausen, who a few years later in 1848 was briefly Prime Minister of Prussia. From 1844 until the company‚Äôs nationalisation in 1880, Gustav Mevissen was president of the RhE. A connection with the German North Sea ports was not achieved until years later. The Cologne-Minden Railway Company was founded in 1843 and in 1847 the line to Minden was finished. Connection with the Royal Hanoverian State Railways provided links to other German seaports. A direct rail connection between the Rhineland-Westphalian industrial belt and the German North Sea ports was established in 1856 with the opening of the Hanoverian Western Railway to Emden and in 1873/74 with the opening of the Hamburg-Venlo railway to Bremen and Hamburg. Construction of lines  Haus Belvedere, terminus of the line to M√ºngersdorf Cologne‚ÄìAachen‚ÄìBelgium line On 21 August 1837 the Company received a concession from the Prussian government to build the railway line from Cologne via D√ºren and Aachen to the Belgian border, a distance of 86 kilometres. The first seven kilometres of track from Cologne to M√ºngersdorf was opened in 1839. Two further sections to L√∂venich and from D√ºren to Aachen were completed in 1840 and 1841. This included the 1,632 m long K√∂nigsdorfer Tunnel, which has now been opened to create a cutting. The last section to the Belgian border at Herbesthal was opened to traffic on 15 October 1843. There was a grade of 1:38 between Aachen and Ronheide (the Ronheide ramp). Until 1855, cable-haulage powered by a stationary steam engine assisted trains up the slope. The line was the first line linking Germany with a non-German country. The opening of the line created further connections as the already well-developed Belgian network had two connections with northern France, but the routes to Paris was only finished in 1846, on 16 June from Valenciennes, and on 20 June 1846 from Lille. West Rhine line and Cologne Central Station  View from the Ichenberg tunnel towards Eschweiler Hbf between D√ºren and Aachen On 1 January 1857, the Company acquired the Bonn-Cologne Railway Company (Bonn-C√∂lner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BCE) for 1.05 million Prussian thalers along with its 45 km long route from Cologne (St. Pantaleon station) to Bonn and Rolandseck, beginning its development of railways along the Rhine. By 1859, it had extended the West Rhine line (or Left Rhine line, Linke Rheinstrecke) 107 kilometres via Koblenz to Bingerbr√ºck, where it connected with the Hessian Ludwig Railway to Mainz and Ludwigshafen as well as the Nahe Valley Railway to Saarbr√ºcken and its coal mines. In addition, in 1864 the Pfaffendorf bridge was built over Rhine at Koblenz and connected with the Nassau State Railways in Oberlahnstein. The Prussian state helped finance the construction of the Pfaffendorf bridge and its connection with the Nassau State Railways. After the takeover of the BCE, Hermann Otto Pflaume completed plans for a new RhE Central Station in Cologne. The station and the Cathedral Bridge (Dombr√ºcke) were opened in 1859. The Central Station was a combined terminal and through station: it included four terminal tracks for the RhE running to the west, while the CME had two through tracks connecting to its line on the eastern side of the Rhine by the Cathedral Bridge. Cologne‚ÄìKleve‚ÄìNetherlands line D√ºren station in 1920 1 June 1860, the Rhenish Railway Company took over the Cologne-Krefeld Railway Company (German, old spelling: C√∂ln-Crefelder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), including its 53 km long line from Cologne to Krefeld. In 1863 this line was extended more than 65 km via Goch to Kleve. From there it built a railway line in 1865 over the Griethausen railway bridge to the Spyck‚ÄìWelle train ferry over the Rhine, connecting to Elten and Zevenaar in the Netherlands. This line gave the RhE not only a connection to the Dutch North Sea ports but also part of a lucrative transit route from the Netherlands to Southern Germany and Switzerland. On 9 September 1865 the RhE opened a line from Cleves to Nijmegen, providing another route to Netherlands. In 1878 a new station was opened in Goch as a common station with the intersecting line of the North Brabant-German Railway Company (Dutch: Noord-Brabantsch-Duitsche Spoorweg- Maatschappij) from Boxtel to Wesel. The RhE‚Äôs Kempen‚ÄìVenlo line, opened in 1868, provided another link to the Netherlands, which ran parallel with the Viersen‚ÄìVenlo railway of the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company from Kaldenkirchen. Eifel line In 1864 work began on the construction of the 170 km long Eifel line from D√ºren via Euskirchen and Gerolstein to Trier, which cost more than 16 million Prussian thalers. The line was completed on 15 July 1871. This gave the RhE a line to the Saar coalfields and convenient connections to the iron ore mines of Lorraine now controlled by Germany as a result of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the company sought to supplement its Eifel line and the planned East Rhine Railway by taking over and the Nassau State Railways lines between Wiesbaden, Oberlahnstein and Wetzlar, now controlled by the Prussian government. However, since it was required to take over the loss-making Nahe Valley Railway in return it lost interest. A takeover of Nahe Valley Railway would have limited the profitability of the Eifel line. On 1 October 1875 a more direct route was opened from Kalscheuren on the West Rhine line to Euskirchen. Ruhr line  The company, which had previously operated only on the western side of the Rhine, opened a route across the Rhine on 1 September 1866 to connect with its Ruhr line from Osterath via Uerdingen, Rheinhausen, the Rheinhausen‚ÄìHochfeld train ferry across the Rhine, Duisburg- Hochfeld, M√ºlheim-Speldorf, M√ºlheim (RhE), M√ºlheim-Hei√üen to Essen Nord (RhE). It built sidings to the many coal mines in this region, generally free of charge. In 1874 the line was continued to Bochum Nord, Langendreer Nord to Dortmund S√ºd. In the same year, the train ferry was replaced by a solid bridge across the Rhine (Duisburg-Hochfeld rail bridge), with the ferry wharf on the right bank replaced by facilities for loading coal on barges. On 15 February 1870 a three-kilometre branch line was opened from Hochfeld train ferry station to (old) Duisburg, which was the starting point of a line to Quakenbr√ºck completed on 1 July 1879. Some sections of the Rhenish Ruhr line are now closed and where trains runs it is mostly used by freight trains, the only passenger trains on the route are the line S4 S-Bahn trains through southern Dortmund. The section of line between Duisburg-Neudorf and Essen Nord is now closed and has been converted into a cycling and hiking trail. East Rhine line The Rhenish Railway Company opened the East Rhine line (or Right Rhine line, Rechte Rheinstrecke) on 27 October 1869 from Ehrenbreitstein near Koblenz to Neuwied. On 11 July 1870 the section of line was opened from Neuwied to Oberkassel, where the Bonn‚ÄìOberkassel train ferry provided a connection between the West Rhine and East Rhine lines. The section from Oberkassel to Troisdorf opened in 1871. The continuation of the line from Troisdorf to M√ºlheim-Speldorf was completed on 18 November 1874, opening a cheap route for the shipping coal from the Ruhr to the south. The Ruhr route ran largely parallel to the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company‚Äôs existing Duisburg‚ÄìDortmund line and was quickly connected with many mines. The coal shipments grew enormously from the start, as the new railway launched its \\"one pfennig\\" tariff to compete for the coal business. As a result of coal prices in Germany and neighboring countries fell by 10% to 15%. Bergisch Land line In 1873 the company continued its policy of aggressive competition in its decision to build a 75 km long railway line through the Bergisches Land from D√ºsseldorf to Dortmund S√ºd via Elberfeld, Schwelm Nord, Gevelsberg, Hagen, Herdecke and H√∂rde, which was completed on 19 September 1879. This line also competed with a BME line. The line is currently used from D√ºsseldorf to Mettmann by line S28 S-Bahn trains and by freight trains from Dornap- Hahnenfurth. Most of the section east of Dornap-Hahnenfurth is closed, although the section from Gevelsberg West to Hagen-Heubing is used by line S8 trains and Regionalbahn RB 52 line uses the line from Hagen to Dortmund Signal-Iduna-Park. The North Sea Dorsten station is a typical building of the Rhenish Railway Company The Rhenish Railway Company still lacked a connection to the German North Sea ports. The Cologne-Minden Railway Company had completed its line on 18 June 1874 from Wanne through Haltern, M√ºnster, Osnabr√ºck and Bremen to Hamburg. The RhE gained a concession for its own route north from the Prussian government on 9 June 1873, which it completed within six years. On 1 July 1879 it opened the 175 km long Duisburg‚ÄìQuakenbr√ºck line via Oberhausen West, Bottrop Nord, Dorsten and Rheine to Quakenbr√ºck. It connected with the network of the Royal Westphalian Railway Company to Emden in Rheine and of to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways to Wilhelmshaven in Quakenbr√ºck. Operational lines  The Rhenish Railway Company‚Äôs lines in the Ruhr were not well connected to economic centres due to the relatively late construction, especially since they had been planned primarily for the transport of coal. This explains why most lines of these lines are no longer in operation. By contrast, its lines in the Rhineland and the Rhine Valley are still vital for rail transport. Business development and nationalisation  The founder of the Rhenish Railway Company was the leading banker and merchant Ludolf Camphausen. Also involved at an early stage were other bankers such as William Deichmann (of A. Schaaffhausen & Co.) and J. H. Stein & Co., and later Abraham Oppenheim (Sal Oppenheim jr) and J. D. Herstatt. The RhE was at that time the largest private company in Prussia with an initial share capital of three million Prussian thalers. Originally the banker Abraham Oppenheim, held almost a quarter of the share capital, and another six Cologne bankers held another third. Six months later, Oppenheim together with the Belgian banker Bischoffsheim held a majority of shares. To meet the high capital requirements of the railway company, the bankers developed new forms of cooperation such as national consortia (underwriters) and later joint-stock banks. Initially some of the Cologne banks which had acquired shares had found it difficult to sell them due to poor economic conditions and attempted to return their shares to the railway company. Finally in 1840 the Belgian government bought the unsaleable shares. In the course of Bismarck's nationalisation policy the nationalisation of the RhE was announced on 14 February 1880. At that time, the Prussian state held 42% of its share capital. The Prussian state railways created the Royal Directorate of the Rhenish railways at Cologne (German: K√∂nigliche Eisenbahn-Direktion zu K√∂ln linksrheinisch) for the management and operation of the network taken over, with effect from 1 January 1880. On 23 February 1881 this was renamed the Royal directorate of left Rhine railways at Cologne (K√∂nigliche Eisenbahn- Direktion zu K√∂ln linksrheinisch). The east bank were combined with those of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company which had also nationalised with effect from 1 April 1881 in the newly established Royal directorate of right Rhine railways at Cologne (K√∂nigliche Eisenbahn-Direktion zu K√∂ln rechtsrheinisch). At its nationalisation the Rhenish Railway Company had 507 locomotives, 862 carriages and 13,572 freight wagons. It operated a rail network of 1,356 km length. The purchase price was financed by government bonds worth 591,129,900 marks. The company was formally dissolved on 1 January 1886.

He was also professor of law at the Free University of Brussels. He was governor of the powerful trust, the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique and chairman of the Union mini√®re du-Haut-Katanga amongst many other companies.  Life  F√©licien Cattier was born in Cuesmes on 4 March 1869. A member of the Royal Academy of Belgium, Felicien Cattier made a brilliant career in finance and banking. He was a close associate of the Belgian King Albert I, Emile Francqui, Adolphe Stoclet, , politician Emile Vandervelde, US President Herbert Hoover and the Prime Minister and Minister of State Henri Jaspar. He was Dean of the Faculty of Law at the Free University of Brussels from 1909 to 1911. He participated in the drafting of the colonial charter of the Belgian Congo and was a member of the Colonial Council. Before moving towards the economic sector, under the influence of Albert Thys, Felicien railed against the Congolese human zoo during the Brussels International exhibition of 1897 and criticized the abuses of the Congo Free State, then held as the personal property of Leopold II. His book A Study of the situation in the Congo Free State (1906) was partly responsible for the formal annexation of Congo by the Belgian State in 1908. Cattier wrote: Having served as legal advisor to the King of Siam, he became secretary of the International Company of the East and Managing Director of Bank of Overseas. Throughout that time he did participate in the Belgian expansion in China - he was head of the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company and Chinese Central Railway. He then lead the main group of colonial societies at the Union mini√®re du-Haut- Katanga, the Formini√®re, the Compagnie Maritime Belge, the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo or the Banque du Congo Belge later called Banque Belgolaise. During WWII he was governor of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique. He also played a role in exporting the uranium to the US which helped to create the atomic Bomb. In the Belgian Congo there was a town called Cattier in his honor and one of the congolese mineral is called Cattierite. He was also one of the founders of the International Maritime Agency, the University Foundation and the National Fund for Scientific Research, the foundation Francqui and the Foundation Universitaire. He met the greatest scientist of the time, including Albert Einstein. He died 4 February 1946 in Funchal, Madeira. The Congolese community of Lufu-Toto, then in the Belgian Congo, and the ore Cattier cattierite, were named in his honor. A conference room of the Free University of Brussels bears his name. One of his sons, Jean Cattier, was a prominent investment banker at Wall Street and financial chief of Marshall Plan operations in West Germany. One of his daughter, Marie Louise Cattier, married Marcel Godfrey Isaacs, son of Godfrey Isaacs, managing director of the Marconi's Wireless Telegraphy Company, and nephew of Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading and Viceroy of India.

The tribe ranges from southern South America, through Central America, into Mexico and the Caribbean. It includes New World genera formerly included in the tribe Thrinacinae, which was split after molecular phylogenetic studies showed that Old World and New World members of the tribe were not closely related. Description Members of the tribe are palms with fan shaped (or palmate) leaves and are pleonanthic‚Äîthey flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan. They are usually hermaphroditic (male and female sex organs are present together in flowers), but some species are polygamodioecious, in which some plants have both male and hermaphroditic flowers, while others have a mixture of female and hermaphroditic flowers. Taxonomy The Cryosophileae is one of eight tribes within subfamily Coryphoideae. Within the subfamily, it is a sister taxon to the Sabaleae (which includes just a single genus, Sabal). Together these are sometimes referred to as the New World thatch palm clade. In the first edition of Genera Palmarum (1987), Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield placed a variety of New World and Old World genera in the subtribe Thrinacinae. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the Old World and New World members of the Thrinacinae were not closely related. As a consequence of this, Dransfield and colleagues split the subtribe, and placed the New World species in a new tribe, the Cryosophileae, while the Old World species were placed in the subtribe Rhapidinae, which was transferred to the tribe Livistoneae. A new genus and species, Sabinaria magnifica, was described in 2013 and placed in this tribe. Evolution Andrew Henderson and colleagues considered the distribution of the tribe to suggest that its origins lay in the southern hemisphere. However, the discovery of fossil remains of Trithrinax in Caribbean amber from the Tertiary indicates that this genus, now the southernmost member of the Cryosophileae, once existed further to the north. This, coupled with the presence of Thrinax fossils from the Tertiary in Europe, and Cryosophila-like fossil pollen from Central America in the same time period, led Stine Bjorholm and colleagues to conclude that the current distribution of these palms represents northern hemisphere origin and a north-to-south migration, instead of the reverse. Cryosophileae are found in France during Oligocene (Rupelian) and Miocene (Tortonian). Distribution The members of the Cryosophileae form a sequence of species that extends from southern South America through Central America and into Mexico and the Caribbean. The southernmost genus, Trithrinax, is found in subtropical parts of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, and includes some of the most cold-tolerant palms in the Americas. Chelyocarpus and Itaya are next in the sequence; Chelyocarpus and Itaya are found in the western Amazon basin‚Äîin Peru, Brazil and Ecuador‚Äîwith one species of Chelyocarpus extending into the Pacific lowlands of Colombia. Sabinaria is restricted to the Colombia/Panama border. Cryosophila ranges from northern Colombia, through Central America into Mexico. Schippia is found in Belize and a small area of Guatemala. Thrinax, Coccothrinax and Leucothrinax are widespread in the northern Caribbean; Zombia is restricted the island of Hispaniola and Hemithrinax to Cuba.

The release of Public Version 1.0 was announced by the International Code Council on March 11, 2010. The IGCC was established to aid in the construction of sustainable buildings in the business and residential sectors.IGCC Launched Public Version 2.0 was released on November 19, 2010. History The IGCC initiative began in 2009 with cooperating sponsors American Institute of Architects (AIA) and ASTM International. The AIA has been involved with green initiatives and sustainability movements before, including its 2030 carbon neutrality challenge. ASTM's involvement with the IGCC is an attempt to ensure that the code will use certain voluntary consensus standards recognized by the industry. Goals The goal of the IGCC is to decrease energy usage and carbon footprints along with several other issues. *The code addresses site development and land use, including the preservation of natural and material resources as part of the process. *Enforcement of the code will improve indoor air quality and support the use of energy-efficient appliances, renewable energy systems, water resource conservation, rainwater collection and distribution systems, and the recovery of used water, also known as greywater. *The IGCC emphasizes building performance, including features such as a requirement for building system performance verification along with building owner education, to ensure the best energy-efficient practices are being carried out. *A key feature of the new code is a section devoted to \\"jurisdictional electives\\", which will allow customization of the code beyond its baseline provisions to address local priorities and conditions. Implementation The work of the Code Council/AIA/ASTM team in developing the IGCC was joined with the Standard developed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES). The IGCC will reference the Public Version 1.0/ ANSI/ASHRAE/USGBC/IES Standard 189.1-2009 for the Design of High-Performance Green Buildings, Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, as an alternative jurisdictional compliance option within the IGCC. The participants in designing this Standard also voiced their support for the new IGCC and its potential to contribute to a more sustainable built environment.

It was registered under the Societies Act 1860 on 28 January 2009. Cyberpark is set up by Kerala State IT Infrastructure Limited (KSITIL) and is headed by a Chief Executive Officer. In addition to this, it has a General Body and a Board of Governors, both of which include top officials of the government. It has both SEZ (Special Economic Zone) and non-SEZ options. The Cyberpark Kozhikode is the third IT hub in Kerala, the other two being the Technopark at Thiruvananthapuram and the Infopark in Kochi. of land at Nellikode will be notified under SEZ for investors. The first phase of the project is expected to be ready for allotment by March 2011. It is situated in Nellikkode and Pantheeran Kavu villages of Kozhikode Taluk, near to Medical college at Chevayur. It is 25 km away from Kozhikode International Airport and 10 km from the seaport. The Park Centre of the Cyberpark was opened on 15 February 2014 by Industrial Minister P.K. Kunhalikutty. The Park Centre comprises an area of 11,000 square feet with two floors and hosts the administrative office, three software development companies, main conference hall, a mini conference hall, two guest rooms and a cafeteria. A 20-MW, 110-kV, gas-insulated substation and a second IT building for the park will be set up. Intelligent Street Lighting System to save energy. An inbuilt astronomical clock will switch on in the evening and off in the morning History In January 2007, the Government of Kerala announced its decision to promote Kozhikode as an IT hub. The proposal to set up an IT park in Kozhikode came in the announcement of the State Government's IT policy made by Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan. Soon after the proposal, a convention under the auspices of Calicut IT Initiative (CITI) in Kozhikode was organized. The CITI includes representatives of the Malabar Chamber of Commerce, Calicut Forum for IT (CAFIT), IIM-Kozhikode, Calicut Management Association, Kerala Builders Forum and NIT-Calicut among others. The name Cyberpark was suggested by the convention. An appeal was also made to the Calicut Corporation to include the IT Park in the master plan that was being prepared for the city. At this convention, many companies, including IBS, US Technology, NeST Software, Leela Group, and Finpro Business Solutions offered to set up their units in the Kozhikode IT unit. By March 2008, official sources pointed out that already over 10 companies have shown interest in starting their organizations in this IT Park. The Park Centre of Cybercity Kozhikode was formally opened by Industries Minister P.K. Kunhalikuttty on 15 February 2014. The project is expected to be completed in 2015. By May 2018 Minister for Labour T.P . Ramakrishnan opened the new company - Infinite Open Source Solutions LLP - in the first warm shell space at Sahya IT building, measuring 7,000 sq.ft Space.

Borneo, the third largest island in the world, divided between Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, was once covered by dense tropical and subtropical rainforests. In the 1980s and 1990s the forests of Borneo were leveled at a rate unprecedented in human history, burned, logged and cleared, and commonly replaced with agriculture. The deforestation continued through the 2000s at a slower pace, alongside the expansion of palm oil plantations. Half of the annual global tropical timber procurement is from Borneo. Palm oil plantations are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest. Much of the forest clearance is illegal. The World Wildlife Fund divides Borneo into a number of distinct ecoregions including the Borneo lowland rain forests which cover most of the island, with an area of , the Borneo peat swamp forests, the Kerangas or Sundaland heath forests, the Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests, and the Sunda Shelf mangroves. The Borneo mountain rainforests lie in the central highlands of the island, above the elevation. These areas represent habitat for many endangered species; for example, orangutans, elephants and rare endemics such as the elusive Hose's civet. The Bornean orangutan has been a critically endangered species since 2016. As well as Borneo's importance in biodiversity conservation and as a carbon sink, the forests have significance for water security and food sovereignty for local communities of indigenous peoples. Malaysian Borneo Satellite image of rainforest converted to oil palm plantations. The Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah (East Malaysia), in the north, occupy about 26% of the island. The forested area here shrank rapidly due to heavy logging for the Malaysian plywood industry. Two forestry researchersSabah Forestry Department. Forest.sabah.gov.my.

Indigenous peoples of Malaysia have been impacted by logging without their free, prior and informed consent in their ancestral forests. They have used peaceful demonstrations and social media advocacy to raise awareness of their rights to the forest, with some success. Questions about how and why logging licenses were granted without community consent remain unaddressed. The rainforest was also greatly destroyed from the forest fires of 1997 to 1998, which were started by the locals to clear the forests for crops and perpetuated by an exceptionally dry El Ni√±o season during that period. During the great fire, hotspots could be seen on satellite images and the haze thus created affected the surrounding countries of Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. In February 2008, the Malaysian government announced the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy plan to harvest the virgin hinterlands of northern Borneo. Further deforestation and destruction of the biodiversity are anticipated in the wake of logging commissions, hydroelectric dams and other mining of minerals and resources. Indonesian Borneo Logging road and impacts in East Kalimantan: logged forest on the left, primary forest on the right Approximately 73% of the island is Indonesian territory; the Indonesian name for the island, Kalimantan, is used in English to refer to the Indonesian-controlled territory. To combat overpopulation in Java, the Indonesian government started a massive transmigration (transmigrasi) of poor farmers and landless peasants into Borneo in the 1970s and 1980s, to farm the logged areas, albeit with little success as the fertility of the land has been removed with the trees and what soil remains is washed away in tropical downpours. The Mega Rice Project was initiated in 1996 in the southern sections of Kalimantan. The goal was to turn one million hectares of \\"unproductive\\" and sparsely populated peat swamp forest into rice paddies in an effort to alleviate Indonesia's growing food shortage. The government made a large investment in constructing irrigation canals and removing trees. The project did not succeed, and was eventually abandoned after causing considerable damage to the environment. The peat swamp forest in the south of Kalimantan is an unusual ecology that is home to many unique or rare species such as orangutans, as well as to slow- growing but valuable trees. The peat swamp forest is a dual ecosystem, with diverse tropical trees standing on a 10 to 12 m layer of peat - partly decayed and waterlogged plant material ‚Äì which in turn covers relatively infertile soil. Peat is a major store of carbon. If broken down and burned it contributes to CO2 emissions, considered a source of global warming.Sabangau Forest. orangutantrop.com A NASA satellite image showing the extent of 2015 Southeast Asian haze on 24 September 2015. The water channels, and the roads and railways built for legal forestry, opened up the region to illegal forestry. In the MRP area, forest cover dropped from 64.8% in 1991 to 45.7% in 2000, and clearance has continued since then. It appears that almost all the marketable trees have now been removed from the areas covered by the MRP. It turned out that the channels drained the peat forests rather than irrigating them. Where the forests had often flooded up to 2m deep in the rainy season, now their surface is dry at all times of the year. The government has therefore abandoned the MRP, but the drying peat is vulnerable to fires which continue to break out on a massive scale.Boehm, H-D.V. and Siegert, F. Ecological Impact of the One Million Hectare Rice Project in Cantral Kalimantan, Indonesia, Using Remote Sensing and GIS. (PDF) . Retrieved on 22 January 2012. After drainage, fires ravaged the area, destroying remaining forest and wildlife along with new agriculture, filling the air above Borneo and beyond with dense smoke and haze and releasing enormous quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. The destruction had a major negative impact on the livelihoods of people in the area. It caused major smog-related health problems amongst half a million people, who suffered from respiratory problems. Peat forest destruction is causing sulphuric acid pollution of the rivers. In the rainy seasons, the canals are discharging acidic water with a high ratio of pyritic sulphate into rivers up to 150 km upstream from the river mouth. This may be a factor contributing to lower fish catches. A joint UK-Indonesian study of the timber industry in Indonesia as a whole in 1998 suggested that about 40% of the throughput of timber was illegal, with a value in excess of $365 million.Indonesia-UK Tropical Forestry Management Programme (1999) Illegal Logging in Indonesia. ITFMP Report No. EC/99/03 More recent estimates, comparing legal harvesting against known domestic consumption plus exports, suggest that 88% of logging in the country is illegal in some way.Greenpeace (2003) Partners in Crime: A Greenpeace investigation of the links between the UK and Indonesia‚Äôs timber barons. See http://www.saveordelete.com Malaysia is the key transit country for illegally logged wood products from Indonesia.Environmental Investigation Agency and Telepak (2004) Profiting from Plunder: How Malaysia Smuggles Endangered Wood. Logging A logging truck in Sarawak, Borneo. Deforestation in Borneo was historically low due to infertile soils, unfavourable climate, and the presence of disease. Deforestation only began in earnest during the mid- twentieth century. Industrial logging rose in the 1970s as Malaysia depleted its peninsular forests, and former Indonesian strongman President Suharto distributed large tracts of forest to cement political relationships with army generals. Thus, logging expanded significantly in the 1980s, with logging roads providing access to remote lands for settlers and developers. Logging in Borneo in the 1980s and 1990s was some of the most intensive the world has ever seen, with 60‚Äì240 cubic meters of wood being harvested per hectare versus 23 cubic meters per hectare in the Amazon. In Kalimantan for example, some 80% of lowlands went to timber concessions, including virtually all its mangrove forests. By the late 1980s, it became clear that Indonesia and Malaysia were facing a problem of timber crisis due to over-logging. Demand from timber mills was far-outstripping log production in both Malaysia and Indonesia. Fires Most fires in Borneo are set for land-clearing purposes. While the Indonesian government has historically blamed small-scale swidden agriculturalists for fires, World Wildlife Fund notes that satellite mapping has revealed that commercial development for large-scale land conversion ‚Äì in particular oil palm plantations ‚Äì was the largest single cause of the infamous 1997‚Äì1998 fires. Today fires are still set annually for land clearing in agricultural areas and degraded forests. When conditions are dry, these fires can easily spread to adjacent forest land and burn out of control. Increasingly, the frequency and intensity of fires is causing political tensions in the region. Neighbouring countries, in particular Malaysia and Singapore, blame Indonesia for failing to control the fires. In turn, Indonesia accuses Malaysian firms of starting many of the fires for land- clearing process. There is a need for a sustainable management of the forest‚Äôs resources, in particular the aspect of logging. But in order for that to materialise, there is a need to recognise that protection and conservation of the forest do not solely lie in the hands of Indonesia and/or Malaysia. It is unreasonable to assume that the few highly indebted countries that contain the majority of remaining rain forest should be responsible for single-handedly providing this global public good.Todaro, M. P., & Smith S. C. (2009). The Environment and Development. In Todaro, M. P., & Smith S. C. (10th Ed) Economic Development (pp. 483‚Äì529). Essex: Pearson Education Limited. It is a global effort to protect the rainforest which in turn, will then help to solve the development problems Indonesia and Malaysia face with regards to the Borneo rainforest. Reforestation Recently a reforestation project in East Kalimantan has reported some success. The Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation (BOS), founded by Dr Willie Smits, bought up nearly 2000 ha of deforested degraded land in East Kalimantan that had suffered from mechanical logging, drought and severe fires and was covered in alang-alang grass (Imperata cylindrica). The intention was to restore the rainforest and provide a safe haven for rehabilitated orangutans while at the same time providing a source of income for local people. The project was given the name Samboja Lestari, which roughly translates as the \\"everlasting conservation of Samboja\\". BOS Australia website . Orangutans.com.au. Retrieved on 22 January 2012. Reforestation and rehabilitation is the core of the project, with hundreds of indigenous species planted. By the middle of 2006 more than 740 different tree species had been planted.Samboja Lodge website . Sambojalodge.com. Retrieved on 22 January 2012. In the Lamandau Wildlife Reserve, Orangutan Foundation have planted over 60,000 saplings as part of their Forest Restoration Programme. These saplings were planted in order to reforest and rejuvenate areas damaged by fires.

Popular cameras of this type at that time were mainly from Europe but a few from Japan, including the Asahi Pentax, the Miranda T and the Topcon R. The miniature SLR camera concept was conceived in the 1930s at Ihagee in Dresden, resulting in the 1936 Kine Exakta. Influential cameras designs like that of the 1939 KW Praktiflex, the 1949 ZI Contax S, and 1952 the KW Praktina marked the steady progress toward a perfected SLR. Several features of the latter seem to have influenced the design of the SR-2 although dissimilar in many respects. The obvious similarities are the stepped top plate, the carrying strap lugs, the self-timer lever and some general body features. The name Minolta was first used in 1932 on the 4.5√ó6 format Semi- Minolta using 120 film. The manufacturer was established in November 1928 by (1899-1985) as the Nichidoku Shashinki Sh≈çten (Japan-German Camera Store) together with two Germans living in Japan, but reorganised as a joint stock company named the Molta Goshi Kaisha in the summer of 1931. It is likely that this inspired the name Minolta that later became a registered trade mark. However, in 1937 the company was reorganised as the Chiyoda Kogaku Seik≈ç KK, CHIYOKO for short. Chiyoda Kogaku manufactured leaf shutters and photographic lenses, as well as melting their own optical glasses, an achievement very few camera makers ever have matched. In 1947, the Minolta-35 was launched as the company's first 35mm camera, resulting in a brief range of quite popular rangefinder models lasting until the end of the 1950s. In 1962 the company name was changed to Minolta Camera K.K. Description The Minolta SR-2 is well built and thoroughly constructed; including features that remained characteristic of the Minolta SLR camera range to follow until the advent of the auto focus cameras in the 1980s. The main features are a single stroke wind-on lever; an instant return mirror and a sturdy three-pronged bayonet lens mount with an internal automatic aperture stop-down mechanism. This mount is the earliest example of a modern 35mm SLR bayonet lens mount, used throughout the entire lifespan of the Minolta manual focus camera area. The automatic aperture mechanism on this camera does not reopen the aperture after exposure, a feature at the time regarded as unnecessary, since the darkened finder might indicate the camera not being made ready for the next exposure. The SR-2 was joined a year later by the budget model SR-1, and was replaced in 1960 by the improved SR-3. This range was complemented by an increasing selection of high quality Minolta SR mount Rokkor lenses, within a few years ranging from 35mm to 600mm, and an RF 800mm f8 mirror lens in 1960, some of these even multicoated from the very start.Minolta sales literature The characteristic features of the Minolta SR-2 * Camera body with fixed pentaprism finder with Fresnel lens for even brightness * Reflex finder mirror flips up and returns instantly after exposure. * Hinged strong back with double light traps for simple and safe film loading. * 45mm wide throated three-pronged bayonet lens mount. * Lens diaphragm closes automatically to the preset aperture and opens on winding on. * Wind-on lever makes camera ready in one quick operation for continuous shooting. * Shutter release is situated in the hub of the wind-on lever. * Focal plane shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/1000 second and B set on a single stationary dial. * Automatic frame counter placed under a magnifying glass, which resets when opening the back. * X and PF flash synchronization contacts with separate PC sockets. * Self-timer with separate release button. * Combined folding crank rewind knob and back door opener. * Rewind release button on the camera base. * Secondary yellow LV (Light value) numerals engraved on the aperture ring and the shutter speed dial; the sum of the set pair of values ads up to the required LV number. * ASA / DIN film type reminder dial on the back.Minolta SR-2 Cat.# SR-101 leaflet The Rokkor lenses for the SR-2 * W.Rokkor-HG 1:2.8 35mm (1958) * Auto W.Rokkor-HG 1:2.8 f=35mm (1959) * Auto Rokkor-PF 1:1.8 f=55mm (1958) * Auto Rokkor-PF 1:2 f=55mm (1959) * Tele Rokkor-QE 1:3.5 f=100mm (1958) * Auto Tele Rokkor-QE 1:3.5 f=100mm (1959) * Tele Rokkor PG 1:2.8 f=135mm (1958) * Auto Tele Rokkor-PG 1:2.8 f=135mm (1959) * Tele Rokkor-PF 1:2.5 f=180mm (1959) * Auto Tele Rokkor-QF 1:3.5 f=200mm (1959) * Tele Rokkor-QF 1:4 f=250mm (1959) * Tele Rokkor-TD 1:5.6 f=600mm (1959).http://minolta.eazypix.de/index.html References Category:135 film cameras SR-2 Category:Cameras introduced in 1958 Category:Products introduced in 1958 ","title":"Minolta SR-2"},{"id":"26864863","title":"List of airports in West Bengal"},{"id":"26864943","title":"2007 Asian Cycling Championships"},{"id":"26864996","text":"Hermann Foertsch (4 April 1895 ‚Äì 27 December 1961) was a German general during World War II who held commands at the divisional, corps and army levels.

The trial resulted in Foertsch's acquittal because he was a staff officer at the time that the criminal orders were transmitted. Hostages trial As a chief of staff for several generals commanding Wehrmacht forces in occupied Greece and Yugoslavia, Foertsch passed on orders to subordinate units to take hostages or conduct reprisals. These orders were deemed criminal by the Tribunal, but staff officers were not considered culpable unless they drafted such criminal orders or made a special effort to distribute them to the troops that carried them out. Citing a lack of evidence of a commission of an unlawful act, the Tribunal acquitted Foertsch of war crimes.

A band not signed to a major record label, they have nevertheless been able to sustain themselves, self-releasing a string of EPs and full-length albums since 2007. Biography The band started when Rishava Green and Matt King met in the Model Caf√© in Allston, Massachusetts, where they decided to form a band before ever playing a note together. Green had recently written and recorded eleven tracks that were later named Douglas Sessions '05 with the purpose of attracting the right band members. In October 2006, Jesse James joined on drums. Adam Ritchie joined on guitar in June 2007. Both James and Ritchie were attending Syracuse University at that time, but never met before joining the band. In October of that same year the band released their self- titled EP, The Lights Out (EP). Late 2007 saw the band \\"blitzing\\" Boston with a string of shows in support of the record. In June 2008, the band released their follow-up five-song EP, ¬°Heist!. By September 2009, the band had taken the songs from their two previous EPs and put them together with a new batch of compositions to create their first LP, Color Machine. That year the band also became a semifinalist in the WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble and headlined a showcase at CMJ Music Marathon. In May they played Gillette Stadium to open the New England Patriots' 2009 season. In 2010 the band's song \\"Gottagetouttahere\\", from Color Machine, was featured in an Absolut Vodka ad and was featured in Vh1‚Äôs Tough Love Couples. The music video for the song, produced by Boston Music Awards Video of The Year director Mike Gill, was released in October. That fall, the band released their third EP, Rock Pony. The EP‚Äôs cover caused a stir, and for Halloween the band dressed and performed as Madonna. The band self-released their second LP, Primetime, on January 1, 2011. To promote the album, a theme record about what it is like to be in a band, the band held a mock auction for their tour van named \\"Tim\\". The band's third LP, On Fire, was released on June 1, 2012, and a track from the album, \\"Today Was The Day\\", was selected as MP3 of the Week by The Boston Phoenix. Songs from On Fire were featured on MTV and the band supported the album with an appearance at South By Southwest. T.R.I.P. is the band‚Äôs fourth LP. The album, mainly about parallel realities, is synchronized with a wearable light show invented by the band. It is also the first studio album ever released on a can of craft beer. The band supported the album by opening for Andrew W.K. and the Dream Theater, King's X and Dixie Dregs side project called The Jelly Jam.

He has also been Chair of the Office of Government Commerce as well as sitting on the boards of several well known companies and organisations. Early career After graduating from Cambridge University with a First in Mathematics in 1969, Gershon joined International Computers Limited and worked in the computer industry for seventeen years, before holding senior line managerial positions in the telecommunications industry between 1987 and 1994.

In August 2003 he was invited to lead a major review of efficiency across the whole UK public sector by Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown. The Gershon Review was completed in 2004/2005 and was intended to lead to significant savings in public spending by 2007/2008.

The body also claimed to have identified ¬£6bn in efficiency savings which would allow the Conservatives to avoid the Labour Party's planned rises in National Insurance contributions in 2010. Honours Gershon was appointed a CBE for his services to industry in 2000 and knighted in 2004 for his work on public procurement.

A letter received from the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on 9 June 1995 included proposals from France, the Netherlands and United Kingdom to strengthen UNPROFOR by the creation of a rapid reaction force within it.S/1995/470 Letter dated 9 June 1995 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council. The rapid reaction force would form an integral part of the existing peacekeeping operation and that UNPROFOR would remain impartial. The Council was concerned by the continuing armed hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that a further ceasefire was not agreed. Attacks on UNPROFOR and civilians by Bosnian Serb forces were condemned. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council demanded that Bosnian Serb forces release all detained UNPROFOR personnel and that all parties respect the safety of UNPROFOR. The conflict would not be resolved through military means and negotiations had to begin, reiterating that the Bosnian Serb side accept the Contact Group peace plan as a starting point. A complete ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and unimpeded access to humanitarian organisations, particularly to the safe areas and Sarajevo, was demanded. The resolution called on the parties to respect the safety of civilians and the status of the safe areas. It was then decided to increase the size of UNPROFOR by an additional 12,500 personnel, an increase of over 50%, as provided for in the letter of the Secretary-General. Any further changes should consider the security of the force and reduce the danger to which they were exposed. China and Russia abstained from the voting on Resolution 998 after expressing concern that UNPROFOR should remain a strictly peacekeeping force, which was approved by the other members of the Council.

The organization designs, manufactures and distributes solar and wind-up media players and radios for classroom and group listening and was behind the first solar and wind-up radio for humanitarian use which launched in 2003. Since it began operations in 1999 more than 550,000 wind-up and solar powered radios and media players have been distributed, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Millions of listeners have been reached, as classrooms of up to 60 children or listening groups can use each radio or media player. Lifeline Energy is a 501 (c) (3) US charity and a Section 18A and 21 South African public benefit organisation, and relies on contributions from individuals, family foundations, corporate funding and government-sponsored programmes. It collaborates with governments, international relief organizations and in- country NGO partners to implement education and information projects. In 2009, it established Lifeline Technologies Trading Ltd, a for-profit new product development and trading arm that designs and develops the products that Lifeline Energy uses in its projects. This is a relatively unique hybrid business structure with Lifeline Technology‚Äôs profits accruing to the charity. The Times, a UK newspaper, selected Lifeline Energy (then known as Freeplay Foundation) as a beneficiary for its 2005/2006 Christmas Charity Appeal. The organization was also awarded the first annual Tech Museum of Innovation Award in the education category in 2001 and won the Energy Project award in the World Bank‚Äôs Development Marketplace in 2006. The Lifeplayer MP3 was awarded a top prize in the inaugural SAB Foundation Innovation awards in 2011 and was also chosen as a finalist in the INDEX: Design to Improve Life award in the same year. Lifeline Energy‚Äôs current on-going projects include a radio distance education programme in Zambia and providing information and education access to Somali women refugees in Kenya‚Äôs Dadaab camps. History The Freeplay Foundation was legally established in late 1998 by Rory Stear, the co-founder of Freeplay Energy Group. Freeplay Energy, which by then was a public company, was sold in July 2008 to Delhi-based businessman Devin Narang. Rory Stear ‚Äì along with all other directors - resigned from Freeplay Energy Group in 2008. Lifeline Energy runs under the direction of Chief Executive Officer, Kristine Pearson. She has held this position since January 1999 when the charity became operational. On 8 April 2010 the Freeplay Foundation changed its name to Lifeline Energy. Over the years Lifeline Energy has implemented information and education projects using solar and wind-up radios in more than a dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa. These include Rwanda, South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Niger, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan and Sudan. Donors have included Anglo American PLC, the Body Shop, Vodafone Group Foundation, Asda, NASDAQ, CARE, Vodacom, the Founders and Supporters of International Tom Hanks Day and the World Bank. Gordon Roddick, co-founder and former chairman of The Body Shop International plc said in an interview with The Times, London \\"Radio is the perfect way of getting quality education to a wide area incredibly cheaply.\\" Lifeline Energy is technology agnostic and focused on finding appropriate ways to improve the lives of those it aims to assist. It seeks technology solutions to meet these challenges ‚Äì whether high or low tech. As with its Lifeplayer MP3, Lifeline Energy encapsulates known technologies (solar, battery, audio, radio, MP3) in products that are developed to meet the challenges of the environment and social contexts of their use. Products must be robust, intuitive in their function and sustainable, even for the least sophisticated users. The Lifeplayer MP3 The Lifeplayer MP3 was launched to the media in September 2010. It was the world‚Äôs first MP3, 5-band radio and recorder designed specifically for humanitarian use and group listening. Solar-powered and wind- up, it was designed to give large groups of up to 50 people sustainable listening access. Listening content is pre-loaded on a microSD card, and the Lifeplayer can record live voice or radio programmes for playback later. In 2011, the Lifeplayer MP3 was launched in a project for farmers in Rwanda, in partnership with the multinational giant SC Johnson and a US-based NGO, Radio Lifeline. The initiative disseminated information on modern farming techniques, market information and health news to Rwandan pyrethrum farmers via MP3 podcasts and a monthly nationwide FM radio programme. Since then, it has been used in a number of initiatives, including school lessons for children, health information for women's listening groups, and conservation and farming skills for farmers. The Lifeplayer was created and developed by Lifeline Energy and Lifeline Technologies. Its approach to new product development is end-user focused and based on field feedback. The development funding was raised through private donations. Supporters of the Lifeplayer include James Kimonyo - Rwanda's Ambassador to the U.S. - as well as Academy Award winner Tom Hanks. The Prime The Prime radio replaced the Lifeline radio - the first solar and wind-up radio made exclusively for the humanitarian sector and which Lifeline Energy and Kristine Pearson innovated. Prime radios can reach up to 60 listeners and has five bands ‚Äì AM, FM and three short-wave bandwidths. It also features an LCD screen, a solar panel, a hand crank, and a DC input that can be plugged into either a wall socket or a car battery. The solar panels can charge the radio directly through a cable or can charge wirelessly. The Prime radio improves on its predecessor, the Lifeline. In 2001, the Lifeline radio concept won the first Tech Museum of Innovation Award for Technology Benefiting Humanity for Lifeline Energy, in the education category. During the development the organisation arranged focus groups of orphaned children in South Africa, Kenya and Rwanda. The focus group findings determined that the radio needed to be a bright colour, easy to carry and robust. Energy poverty and lighting research Since its inception, Lifeline Energy has undertaken in-depth research into the effects of energy poverty, specifically how it relates to lighting and energy access, in remote areas throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Research was conducted in rural and peri- urban slum areas of South Africa to determine how much child and grandmother- headed families spent on candles and kerosene for lighting per month. The research involved looking at the types of tasks and activities that were used for lighting and the consequences people experienced as a result of their not having any access to electricity. Zambia‚Äôs Learning at Taonga Market Education Initiative Since 2000 Lifeline Energy has been helping to provide education access to vulnerable children taking part in the Learning at Taonga Market radio distance education initiative in Zambia. The programme offers a high quality primary school education to children who are unable to access government-run schools. Since the Zambian Ministry of Education launched it, close to 800,000 children have obtained a basic primary education. Learning at Taonga Market is entirely free and has had a profound effect on orphaned children, who are often left out of Zambia‚Äôs education system. The informal classrooms are run by community volunteers who use Lifeline Energy‚Äôs solar and wind-up radios and Lifeplayers to access the daily radio broadcasts. Children taking part in Taonga Market performed better than conventional schools in reading, numeracy and life skills. Taonga Market students are also more likely to continue to secondary school than children in government-run schools. Information and Education Access in Dadaab Refugee Camps Since 2007 Lifeline Energy has distributed more than 1,100 solar and wind-up radios in the Dadaab refugee camps and nearby host communities, benefitting more than 15,000 Somali women directly. The radios provide access to programming on women‚Äôs rights, health and controversial issues such as female genital cutting. The radios also provide access to daily broadcasts on where refugees can attain food aid, how new refugees can register and where to locate lost relatives who have also travelled to the camps from neighboring countries. The radios have also helped educate children. Using Lifeline Energy‚Äôs radios, children are able to access radio-based primary education lessons in Somali.

The phenomenon was first described in the 1980s. Kodokushi has become an increasing problem in Japan, attributed to economic troubles and Japan's increasingly elderly population. It is also known as and . History The first instance that became national news in Japan was in 2000 when the corpse of a 69-year-old man was discovered three years after his death; his monthly rent and utilities had been withdrawn automatically from his bank account and only after his savings were depleted was his skeleton discovered at his home. The body had been consumed by maggots and beetles.A Generation in Japan Faces a Lonely Death Norimitsu Onishi, New York Times, November 30, 2017 Statistics Statistics regarding kodokushi are often incomplete or inaccurate. Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported that 32,000 elderly people nationwide died alone in 2009. The number of kodokushi tripled between 1983 and 1994, with 1,049 lonely deaths reported in Tokyo in 1994. In 2008, there were more than 2,200 reported lonely deaths in Tokyo. Similar numbers were reported in 2011. One private moving company in Osaka reported that 20 percent of the moving company's jobs (300 per year) involved removing the belongings of people who had died lonely deaths. Approximately 4.5% of funerals in 2006 involved instances of kodokushi. Kodokushi mostly affects men who are 50 or older. Causes Several reasons for the increase in kodokushi have been proposed. One proposed reason is increased social isolation. A decreasing proportion of elderly Japanese people are living in multi-generational housing and are instead living alone. Elderly people who live alone are more likely to lack social contacts with family and neighbors, and are therefore more likely to die alone and remain undiscovered. Economic reasons for kodokushi have also been proposed. Many incidents of kodokushi have involved people who were receiving welfare or had few financial resources. McDonald suggests that the \\"Japanese trait of uncomplaining endurance,\\" or gaman, discourages people in need from seeking help from neighbors and authorities. Victims of kodokushi have been described as \\"slipping through the cracks\\" between governmental and familial support. Additionally, the economic slump in Japan since 1990 has been cited as contributing to the increase in lonely deaths. Since 1990, many Japanese businessmen have been forced into early retirement. Many of these men have never married and become socially isolated when removed from the corporate culture. Masaki Ichinose, head of the University of Tokyo's Institute of Death and Life Studies, hypothesizes that the increase in kodokushi is linked to Japan's contemporary culture which ignores death. Several hundred years ago, Japanese people commonly confronted death; for example, bodies were typically buried by family members. In contrast, in modern Japan, there are fewer opportunities to witness death and death is not readily discussed. Hypothesized psychological reasons for the increase in kodokushi include social apathy and life stress. Social isolation is used as a coping mechanism to avoid stressful situations. Scholars have also analyzed how \\"contemporary discourse constructs kodokushi as a ‚Äúbad death‚Äù and as evidence for the decay of ‚Äútraditional‚Äù social bonds, such as family, neighborhood and company ties,\\" with government and community initiatives thereby pushing \\"to implement new welfare systems, often suggesting to re-activate lost family and community bonds\\". Responses Some districts in Japan have begun campaigns and movements to prevent lonely deaths. Officials in Tokyo's Shinjuku Ward have started a kodokushi awareness campaign that includes scheduled social events and checking in on the well-being of elderly citizens.

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for Wales, and at club level for Ammanford RFC and Llanelli RFC, as a scrum-half, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Wales, and the Other Nationalities, and at club level for Batley (vice-captain), as a . Background Fowler was born in 1894 in Pantyffynnon, a small village in Carmarthenshire, Wales he worked as a coal miner, and a foreman, and he died aged 86 in Batley, West Yorkshire, England. Rugby career Fowler first played rugby for Tycroes, a club in the neighbouring village. He progressed to Ammanford before being selected by first class Welsh team, Llanelli. On the recommencement of rugby after the First World War, Llanelli faced two matches against New Zealand teams, the Larkhill depot of the New Zealand Army and the New Zealand Maoris. Fowler played in both matches. In 1919, Fowler won his first and only rugby union international call-up, when he was one of thirteen new caps to represent Wales against a New Zealand Army team. The Wales team lost 3-6, but before the country's next international match, Fowler turned professional, by joining rugby league team Batley. Such was the resentment caused by turning professional, Fowler was not only banned for life from playing rugby union at any level; a standard punishment, but he also had to wait until a 1975 'amnesty' to receive his international cap. Fowler had a long career at Batley and secured two further international caps. His first came in 1921, when he was chosen to play for the Other Nationalities team to face England. Protests were made to recognise the team as a Wales squad as the entire 13 members were all Welsh by birth, but the request was rejected. On 12 April 1926 he was selected to play for the actual Wales rugby league team, against England at Pontypridd. Fowler played in Batley's 13-7 victory over Wigan in the 1923‚Äì24 Championship Final during the 1923‚Äì24 season, at The Cliff, Broughton, Salford on Saturday 3 May 1924, in front of a crowd of 13,729.

Life Born in Valencia, Evangelista began his professional training at the University of Valencia where he studied computer science for seven years and earned a degree in that subject in 1967. At the same time he pursued music courses at the Valencia Conservatory and earned a premier prix in music composition there in 1967. His most influential teacher at that school was Vicente Asencio who taught his harmony, composition, and orchestration classes. In 1969 Evangelista moved to Canada and settled in the city of Montreal. From 1970-1973 he was a pupil of Andr√© Pr√©vost at the Universit√© de Montr√©al where he earned a Master of Music in composition.

Although the judgment involved a question as to the law of the Isle of Man (rather than English law, strictly speaking), the Privy Council's judgment in Schmidt v Rosewood was adopted into English law by Briggs J (as his Lordship then was) in . Facts Mr Vadim Schmidt sought disclosure of accounts and information in relation to two trusts set up by his father, who had died intestate. Rosewood Trustee Ltd was the trustee of the two relevant trusts, having assumed that office from Lorne House Trust Ltd (the original trustee). Mr Schmidt had a discretionary interest under the settlement and sought disclosure in his capacity as a beneficiary as well as in his capacity as the administrator of his father's estate. The defendant trustee argued that Schmidt was not entitled to disclosure of the trust documents because he did not have a proprietary interest under the trust (being only \\"a mere object of a power\\"). Nor, the defendant trustee argued, had the father been the settlor under the trust, which had been executed by Pacquerette Ltd as settlor (the nominee of Mr Schmidt). Advice The Privy Council rejected the previous proprietary explanation of a beneficiary's right to disclosure that had been set out in Re Londonderry's Settlement [1965] Ch 918 per Salmon LJ. Rather, Lord Walker (giving the advice of the Privy Council) held that: \\"the Board cannot regard it as a reasoned or binding decision that a beneficiary's right of claim to disclosure of trust documents or information must always have the proprietary basis of a transmissible interest in trust property.\\" (at [50]) Lord Walker went further, writing that a proprietary interest under a trust \\"is neither sufficient nor necessary\\" (at [54]). Disclosure to a beneficiary having a proprietary interest has thus become a matter of discretion, although the nature of the interest is relevant to the court's consideration of whether to exercise its discretion. Lord Walker made the following clear.[2003] UKPC 26, [51]-[52] See also *Re Londonderry's Settlement [1965] Ch 918 NotesReferences *David Pollard, 'Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd [2003] UKPC 26 [2003] 2 WLR 1442.'

It is the headquarters of the Thrissur District. It is known as the 'Cultural Capital of Kerala'. The culture of the city can be termed as predominantly South Indian. Residents of Thrissur are known as Thrissukkar; they are an important part of the South Indian weltanschauung. Thrissur, the cradle of culture of Kerala is decorated with Vadakkunnathan Temple, from where the name derived. The old name was 'Thrishivaperur' derived from \\"Thiru Shiva Perur\\" or \\"Land of Lord Shiva\\". The Thrissur Pooram, celebrated during April‚ÄìMay is top on the list of cultural attraction of South India. Thrissur is referred to as the cultural nerve center of the state of Kerala. Representing the rich cultural heritage and traditional legacy of the state of Kerala, Thrissur houses several literary and cultural societies that impart training in performing arts of the region. Thrissur celebrates numerous religious and social festivals with much pomp and glory. Onam, Pooram and Pulikkali are some of the prominent festivals of the local population of Thrissur. The unique culture of the beautiful place of Thrissur is reflected through the various festivities of the place. During the Onam festival, the artists of Thrissur perform the traditional dance of Kathakali. The cultural hub of Kerala, Thrissur maintains a harmonious balance between traditional arts and modern values. Thrissur is widely acclaimed as the land of elephant lovers. Thrissur Pooram formation of gold-caparisoned elephants at the Thrissur Pooram. Poorams are Hindu Temple-centered festivals popular among both Keralites and tourists. The world-renowned Thrissur Pooram, arguably called the 'pooram of all poorams,' is celebrated in Thrissur city of Kerala. Celebrated in the Malayalam calendar of Medom (April‚ÄìMay) in every year, it consists of processions of richly caparisoned elephants from various neighbouring temples to the Vadakkunnathan Temple, Thrissur. The most impressions are those from the Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple and the Devi temple at Paramekkavu. Pooram is an assemblage of suburban deities before the presiding deity at the Siva temple in down town Thrissur. The Pooram celebration is held at the Thekkinkadu Maidan. Since the word pooram literally means a group or a meeting, it was believed that every year the dynastic gods and goddesses of neighbouring province met together for a day of celebration. This usually happened on the pooram asterism of one of the spring months. The gods and their entourage arrived for the meeting on colourfully decorated tuskers. Even today, the converging of these divine processions at the festival venue is an awe inspiring sight. The pooram draws to a close with mind-blowing fireworks displays in the evening and in the wee hours of the next morning. The Pooram festival is also well known for the magnificent display of fireworks. It is celebrated by two rival groups representing the two divisions of Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple vying with each other in making the display of fireworks grander and more colourful. Each group is allowed to display a maximum of fifteen elephants and all efforts are made by each party to secure the best elephants in South India and the most artistic parasols, several kind which are raised on the elephants during the display. The commissioning of elephants and parasols is done in the utmost secrecy by each party to excel the other. Commencing in the early hours of the morning, the celebrations last till the break of dawn, the next day. Of the rival groups participating in the Pooram, the most important ones are those from Pramekkavu and Thiruvambadi. At the close of the Pooram both these groups enter the temple through the western gate and come out through the southern gate to array themselves, face to face, one from the round and other form the Municipal Office road. This spectacle is highly enchanting. Although this grand festival is known as Thrissur Pooram, it is in fact the conclusion of the eight-day Utsavam of nine temples. The procession of the Thiruvambadi to the grounds of Vadakkunnathan Temple and back is not only important, but also quite enlivening. The marvelous as well as magical effect of the Panchavadyam, a combination of five percussion and wind instruments, is to be felt and enjoyed. Thousands of people from all walks of life gather at the Thekinkadu Maidanam at Thrissur to celebrate the pooram or festival. The festival highlights include among other things a spectacular pageant of 30 caparisoned elephants and Kudamattom, a competition in the swift rhythmic changing of brightly coloured and sequined parasols. Dazzling fireworks, and a variety of musical performances including the Chendamelam and the indispensable Panchavadyam are also conducted. The Thrissur Pooram, arguably the most famous festival of Kerala, is a heady mixture of pomp and pageantry. Puli Kali Swaraj Round, Thrissur is the place to watch Puli Kali in Kerala. Puli Kali also known as Kaduvakali is a colorful recreational folk art from Thrissur. It is performed by trained artists to entertain people on the occasion of Onam, an annual harvest festival, celebrated mainly in Kerala. On the fourth day of Onam celebrations (Nalaam Onam), performers painted like tigers and hunters in bright yellow, red, and black dance to the beats of instruments like Udukku and Thakil. Literal meaning of Pulikali is the 'play of the tigers' hence the performance revolve around the theme of tiger hunting. On the fourth day of Onam, the Pulikkali groups or 'sangams' as they are called, from all four corners of Thrissur move in a procession, dancing, pouncing and shaking their bellies to the beat of the drums through the streets to the Swaraj Round, Thrissur situated in the heart of the city. Scenes such as the tiger preying on an animal, and a tiger being hunted by a game-hunter are enacted beautifully in between. Thousands of spectators line the streets enjoying the dance, cheering the dancers some of them even trying to join in. The groups assemble at Naduvilal in the Swaraj Round, Thrissur in front of the Vadakkunnathan Temple and offer a coconut each to the deity of the Ganapati shrine (Naduvilal Ganapati Kovil) here, before going on a procession around the ground. The procession also include floats from each village. The different troupes vie with each other to make the best floats as well as the best dressed tigers. A striking feature of this folk art is the colorful appearance of the performers. A particular combination of tempera powder and varnish or enamel is used to make the paint. First of all, the dancers remove the hair from the body, and then, the base coat of paint is applied on them. It takes two to three hours for the coating to dry. After that, the second coat of paint is applied with enhanced design. This entire procedure takes at least five to seven hours. A large number of artists gather to apply paint on the tigers. It is a meticulous process and often starts from the wee hours in the morning. Kanimangalam Valiyalukkal Bhagavathi Temple Cuisine The cuisine of Thrissur is linked to its history, geography, demography and culture of the land. Mainly Rice is the staple food of the people in Thrissur. Typically, Thrissur Hindus are not vegetarians, though some individual members may avoid non-vegetarians. Muslims and Christians, that are predominantly non- vegetarians use fish, poultry and meat. The routine dietary in a family consists of breakfast, lunch, tiffin and supper. Kanji or Rice gruel with some vegetable curry and pickles formed the main breakfast until very recently in almost all families, but it has now been replaced by tea, coffee or other beverages taken along with dishes like Dosai, Iddali, Poori, Chappathi and Uppuma. Fish is an important item in the diet of about 90% of the population. Tapioca is another vegetable used by poor and the middle class. The reason for the large scale consumption of tapioca is attribute to its high calorific value. Grated coconut and coconut milk are widely used in dishes and curries as a thickener and flavouring ingredient in Thrissur. Black pepper, cardamom, cloves, ginger, and cinnamon play a large part in Thrissur's food habits. Achappam (rosette cookies) and Kuzhalappam are the most popular snack that you come across in Thrissur Christian families. These snacks are mostly served in the time of Christmas or church festivals in Thrissur. Achu means 'mould' and appam means something made with rice flour which is deep fried or steam cooked. Achappam are made using intricately designed irons. The iron is heated to a very high temperature in oil, dipped into the batter, then re-immersed in the hot oil to create a crisp shell around the metal. The iron is immediately removed and the achappam is separated from the iron. Usually, the edges of the achappam are dipped into frosting or sugar. Vellayappams are the other dish which Thrissur is adored for. Many small houses near Basilica of Our Lady of Dolours specializes in selling fresh Vellayappams.
