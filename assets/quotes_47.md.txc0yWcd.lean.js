Continuity *Set after Angel season 5 (after the episode Not Fade Away), and after the comic series, The Curse. Canonical issues Angel comics such as this one are not usually considered by fans as canonical. Some fans consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while other fans consider them as taking place in an alternative fictional reality. However unlike fan fiction, overviews summarising their story, written early in the writing process, were 'approved' by both Fox and Joss Whedon (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as officially Buffy merchandise. Therefore, there is evidence for these comics to represent an (albeit incomplete) continuation of the Angel storyline. Wesley-Wyndam Pryce died in \\"Not Fade Away\\". He does not appear in this comic, instead we see a doppelganger created by Dr Sparrow. (This is also the reason why Cordelia and Fred seem to appear in this comic, both having previously died in \\"You're Welcome\\" and \\"A Hole in the World\\" respectively). Old Friends contradicts the story established by Angel: After The Fall, which reveals Gunn has been turned into a vampire and has not lost either of his eyes.

Geography Bana is accessed by road P15 which comes from Bamena in the east which passes through the heart of the commune and continues west to join the N5 road in the north- east of Bafang. The word Bana means \\"birth place\\" (Ba = place, Na = born). The inhabitants are called N√©e however they often call themselves bana in French. N√©e signifies insistence, harassment, pursuit which may reflect the qualities of the founder of the town. The language spoken in the commune is Fe'fe' which the locals simply call Bana. The commune is located at a high altitude of 1,418 metres and consequently has a cool climate. Geology The land is of volcanic origin with basaltic bedrock (25%), granite (45%), and gneiss (18%). The soil is fertile. The wooded landscape is the result of a long interaction between the people and the land.

The average temperature here is 16 ¬∞C with an average temperature of 13 ¬∞C during rainy season. People live mainly from agriculture and small businesses. Most houses are made with bricks. Some elites have built very large and luxurious mansions. This district has been led for the past thirty years by His Majesty Victor Kamaha II who was a senior officer in the Cameroon police. =Bakassa= Bakassa is a village in the south of Bana. This is one of the largest villages by both population and area in the Bana arrondissement. This mountain village lies between other riverbank villages: Bana, Banfeko, Badoumkassa, Bassap, Bapoutcheu Ngaleu, etc. It can be reached by road via all these villages. Agriculture is the main activity including food crops and coffee. This village has a particularly cool climate because of the altitude. This is one of the oldest chiefdom in the district headed, for many years, by His Majesty F. Ngako.

As such, the body of the Titan beetle is considerably larger than that of the Hercules beetles. The short, curved and sharp mandibles are known to snap pencils in half and cut into human flesh.Zahl, P. A. (1959): Giant insects of the Amazon. Natl. Geogr. Mag. 115 (5): 632-669. Adult titan beetles do not feed, searching instead for mates via pheromones while in flight. The larvae have never been found, but are thought to feed inside wood and may take several years to reach full size before they pupate. These beetles are also thought to feed on decaying wood below the ground. Boreholes thought to be created by titan beetle larvae seem to fit a grub over two inches wide and perhaps as much as one foot long. A famous \\"life-sized\\" photograph of a putative larva of this beetle appeared in National Geographic magazine, filling an entire page, but it turned out to be of a different species of beetle, possibly Macrodontia cervicornis. The adults defend themselves by hissing in warning and biting, and have sharp spines, as well as strong jaws. Distribution It is known from the rain forests of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, the Guianas, and north-central Brazil.

Background He was born in 1882 in Tehran and spent his early years in London. He was educated at Westminster School and studied law at the University of London after which he was admitted to the bar at Inner Temple. He became involved in politics through a position in the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Iran.http://www.iichs.org/index.asp?id=176&doc;_cat=7 Career In his early political life Ala served as the chef de cabinet of the Iranian foreign ministry from 1905 to 1916. Subsequently, he was a member of an Iranian diplomatic delegation sent to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Despite the efforts of the delegation, led by Aliqoli Massoud Ansari, and assisted ably by Ala, the British government of the time nixed Iran's hopes of officially attending the diplomatic gathering. Moreover, with the Iranian Government in Tehran having recently negotiated the Anglo-Iranian Agreement it was decided that Ansari and Ala would be banished to foreign legations to ensure they would not act as lightning rods against the agreement. Ala was appointed as the Iranian diplomatic envoy to Spain in 1920. Shortly thereafter Ala was appointed as Iran's lead diplomat in Washington where he attempted to interest American oil companies to agree to invest in Iran, to undercut the monopoly of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He then became a member of parliament and was among the opposition to the fall of the Qajar dynasty during the Shah Pahlavi transition. He was the governor of Bank Melli Iran from 1933 to 1934 and from 1941 to 1942. From 1934 to 1936, AlƒÅ was ambassador to the United Kingdom.The International Who's Who 1943‚Äì44. 8th edition. George Allen & Unwin, London, 1943, p. 9. AlƒÅ was Iranian Ambassador to the United States from 1946 to 1950. He was elected Prime Minister by parliament following the assassination of Haj Ali Razmara in 1951. His premiership, however, was not to last long, and he resigned on 27 April after Mohammad Mosaddegh had submitted another oil nationalisation bill to parliament two days earlier. The issue of nationalisation was a hot potato, and AlƒÅ did not want to appear to oppose it. During his brief administration, the term of service of members of parliament was increased from 2 to 4 years. He was later appointed as Court Minister, remaining one until his death. AlƒÅ was appointed Prime Minister for the second time in 1955, and in November 1955 survived an assassination attempt at the funeral of a son of Abol-Ghasem Kashani.. He was replaced in April 1957 after an upsetting international incident involving the murder of three Americans by outlaw Ahmad Shah and his gang. AlƒÅ died in 1964 at the age of 82. He left a son and a daughter, and was survived by his wife, who died in 1981. His son, Dr. Fereydoun Ala, was the founding director of the National Iranian Blood Transfusion Service and is currently honorary president of the Iranian Comprehensive Haemophilia Care Center. His daughter, IrƒÅn, is married to Eskandar Firouz, the noted authority on Iranian fauna and environmental topics.

The parish includes the hamlet of Wilmington. History A walled field boundary, which marks the boundary between the manor of Priston village and the former manor of Wilmington hamlet contains megaliths, indicating it may have been a boundary in pre-historic times. Priston is the site of a Roman villa dating from about 100 AD. A coffin from this site was discovered in 1917. Around 925 the manor of Priston was given by king √Üthelstan to Bath Abbey. The parish of Priston was part of the Keynsham Hundred, The village is recorded in the Domesday Book as including the presence of a church, possibly wooden; however the nave of the Church of St Luke and St Andrew was added in the 12th century, and the church has a tower dating from the 15th century. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. It is crowned with a disproportionately large weather vane given as a gift by the lord of the manor in 1813. The manor was held by the Prior of Bath Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries, passing into the hands of the laity. From the 18th century to 20th centuries it was held by the Jenkins family. Priston Mill was given by the monks of Bath Abbey in 931. It is powered by a overshot water wheel. The present building dates from the late 18th or early 19th century and is maintained in working condition. The associated tithe barn was built around 1700 and is currently used as a wedding and conference venue. Priston was in Keynsham Poor Law Union, with records showing it had a population of 292 in 1861, including the hamlet of Wilmington. Priston was the site of a mine on the Somerset coalfield. The mine closed in 1930. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

In 346, in light of Zhang Jun's death and succession by Zhang Chonghua, Later Zhao launched a major attack against Former Liang, with intent to destroy Former Liang. Under the recommendation of the general Zhang Chen (), who knew of Xie's capabilities in military strategy, Zhang Chonghua made Xie a general and had him face the Later Zhao forces commanded by Wang Zhuo () and Ma Qiu. After an initial victory later in 346, Zhang Chonghua created Xie the Count of Fulu. In 347, as Ma sieged the important city Fuhan (, in modern Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu), Zhang Chonghua sent Xie to try to relieve the city. As Xie arrived at the frontline, he was seen wearing a white cap and riding in a wagon‚Äîmaking him appear to be a civilian‚Äîand Ma felt insulted that Xie apparently did not consider his siege an emergency. He sent some elite soldiers to make an attack against Xie, but Xie calmly responded, and Ma's elite soldiers thought they were getting into a trap and stopped their advance. Meanwhile, an army sent by Xie had already gone behind them and started an attack. Xie then advanced as well and dealt Ma a great loss. In the fall, Ma attacked Former Liang again and was again repelled by Xie. (However, Xie's victories appeared to be insufficient for Former Liang to regain the territories lost in the initial Later Zhao attack, south of the Yellow River.) Several years later, due to defamations by Zhang Chonghua's attendants Zhao Zhang () and Wei Ji (), Zhang Chonghua sent Xie out of the capital to be the governor of Jiuquan Commandery (, roughly modern Jiuquan, Gansu). However, when Zhang Chonghua grew gravely ill in 353, he tried to recall Xie to be regent for his son and heir Zhang Yaoling. The order, however, was intercepted by Zhao and Zhang Chonghua's brother Zhang Zuo and not announced. Zhang Chonghua soon died and was succeeded by Zhang Yaoling, but real power was in Zhang Zuo's hands. In early 354, Zhang Zuo, with the support of Zhang Chonghua's mother Princess Dowager Ma (with whom he had an affair), formally took over as ruler, and he, still bearing grudge against Xie for having earlier warned Zhang Chonghua about his treachery, had Xie put to death.

He was also a publisher, judge, and merchant. Biography Phelps left his father Alexander Phelps' house at the age of 13 years. In partnership with George D. Prentice (afterward of the Louisville Journal), he owned and edited (before his majority) the New England Weekly Review, published at Hartford. In 1827 he began the manufacture of glass in Dundaff, Pennsylvania, and became acquainted with the coal fields of the Lackawanna Valley, in which he was afterwards so closely and profitably connected. Later he became connected with his cousin, Amos R. Eno, as large wholesale merchants in New York City, under the firm name of Eno & Phelps, which firm was continued for ten years, when they dissolved. He continued in the mercantile business, and operated largely in real estate, with great boldness and success. Before he was 40 years old he had built a splendid block on the site of old Grace Church, and another on the site of the Park Theatre. All these operations were entered into by his old partner, Amos Eno, who finished by building the Fifth Avenue Hotel.

Early life  Qavam was born in 1873 to a prominent Iranian family with origins in Ashtian. His uncle, Amin Aldoleh, was a prime minister of Iran. He served in the royal court of Nasereddin Shah early in his career. He slowly climbed his way up, and obtained the title Ghavam al-Saltaneh during the Constitutional Revolution of Iran. Hasan Vothuq (also known as Vothuq al-Dowleh) was his older brother. The letter signed by Mozaffaredin Shah to accept the Iranian Constitutional Revolution was written by Ghavam, who had the title of Dabir-e Hozoor (Private Secretary) at the time. In fact Ghavam was instrumental in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution[2]. He became Prime Minister several times during both the Qajar and Pahlavi dynasties. Any time the country needed him, he accepted the challenge. Twice he played a significant role in preventing the USSR from separating Iran's northern provinces. Nevertheless, historians have mixed feelings about his legacy.  Political career left Qavam was appointed governor of Khorasan Province in 1918, during which time he responded to the ongoing famine and the Spanish flu pandemic. In 1921, during the coup d'√©tat of Tehran against the Qajar government, Tabatabaei ordered Colonel Pessian to arrest many of the opposition, among them Ahmad Qavam. Qavam was arrested and sent to Tehran. However with the fall of Zia'eddin Tabatabaee's government, Mostowfi ol-Mamalek among others was offered the position of Prime Minister, which he and the rest declined, due to the unstable political situation at the time. Hence Ghavam who had just been released from the Ishratabad prison of Tehran was offered the position, which he accepted and became Prime Minister overnight. So unusual was his rise that Iraj Mirza wrote the following verses: €å⁄©€å ÿ±ÿß ÿßŸÅ⁄©ŸÜÿØ ÿßŸÖÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ ÿØÿ± ÿ®ŸÜÿØ ⁄©ŸÜÿØ ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ ÿØ€å⁄Øÿ± ÿßŸà ÿ±ÿß ÿÆÿØÿßŸàŸÜÿØ \\"One day in prison he is thrown, another day the King's chair he'll own\\" Ghavam in fact ordered the arrest of Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee in an incident 25 years later. He also ordered the crackdown on the revolt of Colonel Pessian which he crushed with the aid of Reza Pahlavi Of the major events that occurred during his terms as the Prime Minister, was his invitation to Arthur Millspaugh for assisting the government in its finances. Another was the riots of 1942 for economic hardship. He appointed Sepahbod Ahmad Amir-Ahmadi to restore order and end the riots, which he did forcefully. Qavam was also instrumental in the 1942 Tripartrite Treaty between Iran, Russia, and Britain. He was again voted Prime Minister on 26 January 1946 with a slim margin in the Majlis of 52-51.\\"Iran Chooses Premier in 51 to 50 Vote\\", Salt Lake Tribune, 27 January 1946, p8; Manuucher FarmƒÅnfarmaian and Roxane Farmanfarmaian, Blood and Oil: A Prince's Memoir of Iran, from the Shah to the Ayatollah (Random House, 2005), p. 179 The Majlis thought he would have the best chance of resolving the Soviet inspired rebellion of the occupied Azerbaijan province since Qavam was the largest property-owner in the region. Qavam did not disappoint. He ordered the Iranian delegation to the UN to negotiate issues pending before the Security Council directly with the Soviet delegation. He then flew to Moscow to discuss the issues personally with Stalin. When the Soviets violated the terms of the Tripartite Pact which called for all foreign military forces to be withdrawn from Iranian territory by 2 March 1946, it drew a strong rebuke from Parliamentary Whip, Mohammed Mossadegh. Qavam arranged a deal with the Soviets, granting an oil concession in the North contingent on the approval of the Majlis after the elections. Under the terms of the agreement with Qavam, Soviet troops began withdrawing from Iran. When the new Majlis was seated, they immediately voted against the proposed Soviet oil concession. This earned Qavam the congenial title, \\"The Old Fox\\". Death Qavam died at the age of 82 in 1955 in Tehran. He was survived by his second wife and his only son, Hossein.

Once home to the noble Shuvalov and Naryshkin families, the building has housed the Faberg√© Museum since 2013. History The palace's main staircase in 2015 Private ownership The details of the construction are unknown, but the Naryshkin- Shuvalov Palace was constructed in the late 18th century, possibly to a design by Italian architect Giacomo Quarenghi. The first owners of the palace were the Count and Countess Vorontsov. In 1799, Maria Naryshkina, born Princess Maria Czetwerty≈Ñska-≈öwiatope≈Çk (who was a Polish noble and was for 13 years the mistress of Tsar Alexander I) purchased the palace. Her husband, Dmitri Lvovich Naryshkin, filled it with spectacular art and marble sculptures, as well as antiquities including gems, coins, and weapons. The palace became the center of the Saint Petersburg society, and its grand ballroom ‚Äî also known as the Alexandrovsky or White Column Hall ‚Äî played host to society balls of up to 1,000 people. The most famous ball was held on to celebrate the 16th birthday of the tsarevich Alexander Nikolaevich, the future Emperor Alexander II. In 1844, the palace underwent extensive renovation for the wedding of Sofia Lvovna Naryshkina, the only daughter of Lev Naryshkin and Olga Potocka, to Count Pyotr Pavlovich Shuvalov. After the 1846 wedding, the palace became known as the Naryshkin-Shuvalov Palace. The renovation of the Naryshkin- Shuvalov Palace would continue until 1859, during which time it was redone in a neo-Renaissance style by the French architect Bernard de Simone and Russian Nikolai Yefimovich Yefimov. When World War I began in 1914, the last owner of the palace, Yelizaveta Vladimirovna Shuvalova, donated the house to be used as a military hospital for wounded soldiers. The great ballroom was used as an officer's ward. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Shuvalov Palace was nationalized on 1 August 1918. Soviet era After the Revolution, the palace's celebrated artwork and antiquities were strategically hidden in secret hiding spots. The first items were discovered in 1919 when the World War I infirmary was removed. A large pantry was discovered under the fireplace in the \\"Blue Room,\\" containing paintings, porcelain and Limoges enamel. From 1919 to 1925, the \\"Museum of Aristocratic Life\\" operated in the palace. Following the closing of the museum, the majority of the Shuvalov collections were transferred to the Hermitage Museum and the Russian Museum, while some of the items remained in the museum fund. The palace then served as a print house followed by a design institute in the 1930s. During the Siege of Leningrad, shelling and bombing heavily damaged the palace. On 14 September 1941, a bomb completely destroyed the courtyard wing. An incendiary bomb caused even greater damage when it went through the roof into the attic above the Alexander Hall, starting a devastating fire that caused the roof to collapse.

Benjamin said that \\"fascism tends towards an aestheticization of politics\\", in the sense of a spectacle in which it allows the masses to express themselves without seeing their rights recognized, and without affecting the relations of ownership which the proletarian masses aim to eliminate. Benjamin said: > Fascism attempts to organize the newly proletarianized masses without > affecting the property structure which the masses strive to eliminate. > Fascism sees its salvation in giving these masses not their right, but > instead a chance to express themselves. The masses have a right to change > property relations; Fascism seeks to give them an expression while > preserving property. The logical result of Fascism is the introduction of > aesthetics into political life. (...) Mankind, which in Homer‚Äôs time was a > spectacle for the Olympian gods, has become one for itself. (...) Communism > responds by politicizing art. The counter response to the reactionary aestheticization of politics is the politicization of art.Walter Benjamin (1935) The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\", ch.XIX/Epilogue, link to full translated text In this theory, life and the affairs of living are conceived of as innately artistic, and related to as such politically. Politics are in turn viewed as artistic, and structured like an art form which reciprocates the artistic conception of life being seen as art. This has also been noted as being connected to the Italian Futurist movement and postulated as its main motivation for getting involved in the fascist regime of Italy. Alternately, \\"politicization of aesthetics\\" (or \\"politicization of art\\") has been used as a term for an ideologically opposing synthesis, sometimes associated with the Soviet Union, wherein art is ultimately subordinate to political life and thus a result of it, separate from it, but which is attempted to be incorporated for political use as theory relating to the consequential political nature of art. The historian Emilio Gentile has stressed that these two ideas are not mutually exclusive, and both regimes had a large degree of the other. In Benjamin's (original) formulation, the politicization of aesthetics was considered the opposite of the aestheticization of politics, the former possibly being indicated as an instrument of \\"mythologizing\\" totalitarian Fascist regimes. In that light, the politicization of aesthetics was associated with a revolutionary praxis, a redeeming force, solace, undertoned by the fact that it represented a means to cope in such as the case of a restrictive, censorship enforcing society. It painted within a frame, so that something was put in place as a psychological incentive for survival, depending on a story dissolute outside of that frame - the story of a somehow socially asocial or asocially social (citizen-)individual able to transcend mundane surroundings and scenery, having an \\"ascetic scale\\", a ladder, maybe, at hand. Benjamin's concept has been linked to Guy Debord's 1967 book The Society of the Spectacle.Tamara Trodd (2015) The Art of Mechanical Reproduction p.14 Translations * by Harry Zohn at marxists.org, published by Schocken/Random House, ed. by Hannah Arendt; * In Walter Benjamin Illuminations.

Moran recorded first with Greg Osby and debuted as a band leader with the 1999 album Soundtrack to Human Motion. Since then, he has released albums with his trio The Bandwagon, solo, as a sideman, and with other bands. He combines post-bop and avant-garde jazz, blues, classical music, stride piano, and hip hop. Career=Early years Moran was born in Houston, Texas, and grew up in the Pleasantville neighborhood of Houston. His high middle-class parents, Andy, an investment banker, and Mary, a teacher, encouraged his musical and artistic sensibilities at the Houston Symphony, museums and galleries, and through a relationship with John T. Biggers and a collection of their own. Moran began training at classical piano playing, in Yelena Kurinets' Suzuki method music school, when he was six. However, his father's extensive record collection (around 10,000 in 2004), varied from Motown to classical to avant- garde jazz. As a boy he developed a preference for hip hop music over the piano until, at the age of 13, he first heard the song \\"‚Ä≤Round Midnight\\" by Thelonious Monk at home, and switched his efforts to jazz. Monk's childlike melodies, with their many silent spaces, struck him as relatively easy to play and not overly ornate, while the rhythms were reminiscent of hip hop songs, and the harmonies unorthodox. Both jazz and hip hop were part of Houston's skateboarding scene in which he was involved. He attended Houston's High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA), graduating in 1993 from the jazz program headed by Robert Morgan. In his senior year, he was student director of the school's jazz combo and part of the Texas high school all- state jazz ensemble. Late 1990s He then enrolled at the Manhattan School of Music, from which he would graduate in 1997 with a BM degree, to study with pianist Jaki Byard. The next year he participated in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead exclusive workshop, composing the piece \\"Make a Decision\\" for the final concert. In 1997, when Moran was a senior at Manhattan School of Music, he was invited to join the band of saxophonist Greg Osby for a European tour, following a conversation that lingered mostly on older piano jazz, and no audition. Osby liked his playing, and Moran continued to play with Osby's group upon their return to the United States, making his first recorded appearance on Osby's 1997 Blue Note album Further Ado. He would subsequently appear on several other Osby albums, and Osby would introduce him to avant- garde pianists Muhal Richard Abrams and Andrew Hill. His stint with Osby led Moran to sign a contract of his own with Blue Note. His debut Soundtrack to Human Motion was released in 1998. Moran was joined on the album by Osby, drummer Eric Harland (a classmate of Moran's at the Manhattan School, and the one who recommended him to Osby), vibraphonist Stefon Harris and acoustic bassist Lonnie Plaxico. 2000s Moran's next album, 2000's Facing Left (after a work by Egon Schiele), featured a trio that formed out of Osby's group, New Directions: Moran, bassist Tarus Mateen and drummer Nasheet Waits. Compositions were some of Moran's and some by Mateen, Duke Ellington, Bj√∂rk and Byard. The trio, which came to be known as The Bandwagon, was joined by saxophonist and pianist Sam Rivers for their next album, Black Stars, which appeared in 2001. Black Stars was included in NPR's \\"The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade.\\" In 2002, Moran released a solo album, Modernistic, and followed it in 2003 with a live trio album, recorded at New York's Village Vanguard, called The Bandwagon. That same summer he appeared in the Montreal International Jazz Festival, first partnering with Lee Konitz, and then with the trio. In 2004 he played on Don Byron's Ivey-Divey. The Ivey-Divey Trio (sometimes a quartet) toured for a number of years, from the Monterey Jazz Festival 2004 to Montreal's Jazz Festival in 2006 to WinterJazzFest in 2009. Moran's 2005 album Same Mother, an exploration of the blues, brought guitarist Marvin Sewell into the Bandwagon mix. Moran's 2006 release, Artist in Residence, included a number of selections from different works commissioned by museums, all of which premiered in 2005: \\"Milestone\\" is centered on a visual work by Adrian Piper from the Walker Art Center; \\"The Shape, the Scent, the Feel of Things\\" was incorporated into a preexisting installation of that name by artist Joan Jonas; and \\"RAIN\\", inspired by ring shouts from African American slaves, is a recording of The Bandwagon with guests Marvin Sewell, Ralph Alessi and Abdou Mboup. Critical reception to Artist in Residence has been arguably colder that to his other releases.See for example Moran's IN MY MIND, premiered in 2007, is a multimedia presentation inspired by Thelonious Monk's 1959 \\"large band\\" concert at The Town Hall in New York City. It utilises filmed and taped material of Monk's rehearsal, found in the archive of W. Eugene Smith, and video art by David Dempewolf. A text-laden painting from Glenn Ligon extracted the words \\"In My Mind\\" - which Monk says on one of Smith's tapes - as did Moran, incorporating the soundbite into the set. The program is played by The Big Bandwagon: the trio with a largely changeable five piece horn section. The New York Times wrote, \\"It had a magical balance of theory and intuition, and the crowd stayed fully with it.\\" The February 2009 installation is the subject of a documentary film of the same name. In April 2007 Moran took the piano in Charles Lloyd's New Quartet, succeeding Geri Allen. He was the last member to join the group, which keeps touring (as of 2014), having recorded one studio album and two live ones. Moran and Lloyd recorded a duo album, Hagar's Song, in 2013. From September 2009 to about 2012 Moran toured with Dave Holland's Overtone Quartet. \\"Live: Time\\" is a 2008 complement to the Philadelphia Museum of Art exhibition on The Quilts of Gee's Bend. Cane was written for classical wind quintet Imani Winds - among them Moran's college classmate Toyin Spellman. It premiered in October 2008, and appeared in their album Terra Incognita in 2010; it relates to Marie Th√©r√®se Metoyer and Moran's family history in Natchitoches, Louisiana. \\"Refraction\\" is a ballet Moran scored and accompanied for Alonzo King LINES Ballet in 2009. Four independent short films and a feature documentary appeared in the 2000s with soundtracks by Moran (see below). In addition, he collaborated with Ligon on 2008's The Death of Tom: an abstract, conceptual, video artwork. Reflecting their shared historical interests, Moran contributed a score based on the song \\"Nobody\\" by Bert Williams. The work is in the MoMA collection, but he played to it again in a screening in 2011. 2010s The album Ten, released in 2010, marked a ten-year interval from the Bandwagon's debut, Facing Left. It features \\"Blue Blocks\\" off the Philadelphia Museum commission, \\"RFK in the Land of Apartheid,\\" from an original score to a documentary film of the same name, and \\"Feedback Pt. 2\\", an homage to Jimi Hendrix's performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Monk's \\"Crepuscule with Nellie\\" was recorded at the IN MY MIND tour. Ten also contains a composition by Moran and Andrew Hill, and others by Leonard Bernstein, Jaki Byard, Conlon Nancarrow and Bert Williams. The Downbeat 2010 critics' poll voted Ten \\"Jazz Album of the Year\\", while also voting Moran \\"Pianist of the Year\\" and \\"Jazz Artist of the Year.\\" The New York Times chose Ten among 2010 top 10 pop and jazz albums. Since 2011 Moran has been performing the show \\"Fats Waller dance party\\", originally commissioned by Harlem Stage. It became the basis of a 2014 release, All Rise: A Joyful Elegy for Fats Waller, dedicated to Fats Waller and the form of popular entertainment that jazz was in his days. Participants in the fluid roster have included singers Meshell Ndegeocello, in a co-leader position, and Lisa E. Harris, drummer Charles Haynes' ensemble with trumpeter Leron Thomas and trombonist Josh Roseman, saxophonist Steve Lehman and bassist Mark Kelly. Moran's composition, \\"Slang\\", was commissioned for the 2011 Other Minds Festival in San Francisco. In the May 2012 Whitney Biennial, Alicia Hall Moran and Jason curated BLEED, a week-long event that involved many artists and artisans, and aimed to expose artistic processes to the point \\"it has to be scary\\". Later that year a new performance with Joan Jonas, Reanimation was first staged in dOCUMENTA (13). In the summer of 2013 and the next, Moran accompanied, with The Bandwagon and guest Jeff Parker, skateboarding shows in SFJAZZ Center. In April 2014 Moran and Imani Winds premiered Jump Cut Rose, which he wrote for the quintet and a piano, In May, Looks of A Lot, a theatrical co-production with Theaster Gates on the theme of Chicago artistic history premiered in the city's Symphony Center; participants included The Bandwagon, the Kenwood Academy Jazz Band, Ken Vandermark and Katie Ernst, bassist and vocalist. The same month, the Bandwagon played their composition, \\"The Subtle One\\", to a ballet adaptation by Ronald K. Brown. In September he appeared twice in the Monterey Jazz Festival: Leading a Fats Waller Dance Party, in a one-piano duo with Robert Glasper, and with Charles Lloyd New Quartet. He was responsible for the music of the multi-nominated 2016 documentary 13th. In addition to recordings under his own name, Moran has recorded with a range of other musicians including Greg Osby, Steve Coleman, Charles Lloyd, Cassandra Wilson, Joe Lovano, Christian McBride, Von Freeman, Francisco Mela, and Don Byron. He also performed with Marian McPartland,Rochester, 2002Monterey, 2004: Lee Konitz, Wayne Shorter (as substitute), Robert Glasper, violinist Jenny Scheinman, The Bad Plus, guitarist Mary Halvorson and trumpeter Ron Miles, drummer Herlin Riley, Dave Holland (Overtone Quartet), and Bill Frisell. Teaching and organization Moran has been on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music since 2010, where he coaches two ensembles, teaches lessons, and gives masterclasses. At the Kennedy Center he has been the musical adviser for jazz since 2011, and artistic director for jazz since 2014, occupying the position of Billy Taylor. Apart from these positions, Moran has organized events such as \\"713-->212: Houstonians in NYC\\" in January 2011A webcast of Moran and Glasper, playing with a double trio (), was mentioned in a New York Times' albums of the year list by Ben Ratliff: ref. and Very Very Threadgill, a two- day festival dedicated to Henry Threadgill, his \\"favorite composer\\", in September 2014. Moran and his family manage the granting of \\"Moran Scholarship Award\\", first set in 1994 for jazz students at HSPVA. In 2005 they set in Houston The Mary Lou Chester Moran Foundation, for similar purposes. In 2013 he expressed support for the Justice for Jazz Artists campaign of the American Federation of Musicians. For the date July 2013 see \\"Jazz Injustice: A History\\" by Todd Bryant Weeks: In 2015 Moran was appointed Honorary Professor at the Rhythmic Music Conservatory (RMC) in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he periodically conducts workshops and master classes. Awards and honors Closing 2010, Francis Davis wrote in Village Voice, \\"Moran's only competition in the Fifth Annual Village Voice Jazz Critics' Poll was Jason Moran. Ten, his first trio album in seven years, won Album of the Year in a landslide, but that's not all. The pianist figured prominently on the runner-up, Rudresh Mahanthappa and Bunky Green's Apex, and Charles Lloyd's Mirror, which finished fourth...Add Paul Motian's Lost in a Dream...that gives the 2010 MacArthur Fellow four appearances in the Top 10\\" JazzTimes' 2011 Expanded Critics' Poll voted Moran second place \\"Artist of the Year\\" and first place \\"Pianist of the Year\\"; the Charles Lloyd New Quartet, \\"Acoustic Group of the Year\\" and The Bandwagon fifth place in that category. In 2013, the New Quartet was second place in its category and Moran second in pianists. Moran won the Jazz Journalists Association's Up-n-Coming Jazz Musician award in 2003. The Down Beat critics' poll voted him Rising Star Jazz Artist, Rising Star Pianist, and Rising Star Composer for three years (2003‚Äì05). In 2005, he was named Playboy magazine's first Jazz Artist of the Year. In 2007, he was named a USA Prudential Fellow by United States Artists. In 2010, he was named a MacArthur Fellow. In 2013, Moran held residencies in SFJAZZ, Juilliard, and Molde Jazz Festival. Another full-length documentary, Grammar about \\"jazz through Jason Moran\\" and genre boundaries, is in the making, after first director Radiclani Clytus had found funding in a 2012 kickstarter campaign. In 2018, Moran received his first museum survey at the Walker Art Center and was written up as an artist-to-watch by Cultured Magazine. In 2018, Moran wrote the score for 'Between the World and Me' by Ta-Nehisi Coates which premiered at the Kennedy Center, where Moran is Artistic Director for Jazz. Family Moran married Alicia Hall, a mezzo-soprano and artistic collaborator, in 2003. They have worked on several projects together. They live in Harlem and have twins. He has an older and a younger brother. Two of his cousins, Tony and Michael Llorens, toured with Albert King playing piano and drums, and were recorded on In Session.

He served as Prime Minister of Iran twice. He was the older brother of Ahmad Qavam. Life Hassan Vosough was born to one of Iran's most famous families. His father was named Mirza Ebrahim Motamed os-Saltaneh, and his grandfather was named Mohammad Qavam od-Dowleh. His ancestors had already served at high ranks under the Shah of Iran. Four members of his family were prime ministers: Ahmad Qavam, Mostowfi ol-Mamalek, Ahmad Matin-Daftari, and Mohammad Mosaddegh. His mother died when he was at an early age, making his uncle take care of. His father worked as a financial manager in several provinces of Iran. Hassan received a good education through home teachers and spoke fluent French and English. As an adolescent, he accompanied his father on his travels, and took over the financial administration of Iranian Azerbaijan at a young age. Vosough was elected in part as a founding member of the inaugural session of the first parliament of Iran in 1906 as deputy president of the Parliament. In the years of 1911‚Äì1915, Vosough was the first foreign minister and later finance minister of Iran. He later became prime minister from August 1916 to June 1917. After the abdication of the Russian Tsar on 15 March 1917, hope came to Iran for an end of World War I, and withdrawal of Russian and British troops who invaded Iran in November 1914, and were occupying the country since that time. Vosough played a leading role in the negotiations with the British Ambassador, which resulted in the Anglo-Persian Agreement that would end badly for the Iranians. Later it became known that Great Britain had bribed Vosough for this agreement. Although Vosough denied that he had enriched himself personally, and also offered to repay the money.Cyrus Ghani: Iran and the rise of Reza Shah. I.B.Tauris, 2000, p. 54. His reputation was so damaged that he left Iran. He returned in 1926 to refund a portion of the bribe back to Iran. During the reign of the new king of Iran, Reza Shah, Vosough returned to the country in June 1926, where he became the financial officer, and later became minister of Justice. In November 1926 he resigned as minister because he had applied for a seat in the Iranian Parliament and was also elected. After the expiry of the seventh session of the Iranian parliament in 1928, Vosough withdrew from politics. He was still frequently consulted by Reza Shah in financial matters. In 1936 he became a member of the newly founded Academy of Persian Language and Literature. Hassam Vosough died in 1951 in Tehran.

The nine saints are divided into two groups: # Severus (or Secundius), Severian(us), Carpophorus (Carpoforus), Victorinus (Victorius, Vittorinus) # Claudius, Castorius, Symphorian (Simpronian), Nicostratus, and Simplicius''' According to the Golden Legend, the names of the members of the first group were not known at the time of their death \\"but were learned through the Lord‚Äôs revelation after many years had passed.\\"William Granger Ryan Jacobus, The Golden Legend: Readings on the Saints (Princeton University Press, 1993), 291-2. They were called the \\"Four Crowned Martyrs\\" because their names were unknown (\\"crown\\" referring to the crown of martyrdom). First group Severus (or Secundius), Severian(us), Carpophorus, and Victorinus were martyred at Rome or Castra Albana, according to Christian tradition. According to the Passion of St. Sebastian, the four saints were soldiers (specifically cornicularii, or clerks, in charge of all the regiment's records and paperwork) who refused to sacrifice to Aesculapius, and therefore were killed by order of Emperor Diocletian (284-305), two years after the death of the five sculptors, mentioned below. The bodies of the martyrs were buried in the cemetery of Santi Marcellino e Pietro on the fourth mile of the via Labicana by Pope Miltiades and St. Sebastian (whose skull is preserved in the church). Second group The second group, according to Christian tradition, were sculptors from Sirmium who were killed in Pannonia. They refused to fashion a pagan statue for the Emperor Diocletian or to offer sacrifice to the Roman gods. The Emperor ordered them to be placed alive in lead coffins and thrown into the river in about 287. Simplicius was killed with them. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, > [T]he Acts of these martyrs, written by a revenue officer named Porphyrius > probably in the fourth century, relates of the five sculptors that, although > they raised no objections to executing such profane images as Victoria, > Cupid, and the Chariot of the Sun, they refused to make a statue of > √Üsculapius for a heathen temple. For this they were condemned to death as > Christians. They were put into leaden caskets and drowned in the River Save. > This happened towards the end of 305. The references in the text of the martyrs' passio to porphyry quarrying and masonry located at the 'porphyritic mountain' indicate that the story's setting is misplaced; there are no porphyry quarries in Pannonia and the only porphyry quarry worked in the ancient world is in Egypt. Mons Porphyrites was quarried to supply the rare and expensive imperial porphyry for the emperor's building works and statuary, for which it was exclusively set aside. Mons Porphyrites is in the Thebaid, which was a centre of Christian erimiticism in Late Antqiuity. The emperor Diocletian did indeed commission the extensive use of porphyry in his many building projects. Diocletian also visited the Thebaid during his reign, though he was more usually associated with the Balkans, which might explain why the story's location was transposed to Pannonia over time.del Bufalo, Dario Porphyry: Red Imperial Porphyry, Power, and Religion Turin: Umberto Allemandi, 2012. pp. 65-82 Joint veneration When the names of the first group were learned, it was decreed that they should be commemorated with the second group. The bodies of the first group were interred by St. Sebastian and Pope Melchiades (Miltiades) at the fourth milestone on the Via Labicana, in a sandpit where there rested the remains of other executed Christians. It is unclear where the names of the second group actually come from. The tradition states that Melchiades asked that the saints be commemorated as Claudius, Nicostratus, Simpronian, and Castorius. These same names actually are identical to names shared by converts of Polycarp the priest, in the legend of St. Sebastian.Alban Butler, Sarah Fawcett Thomas, Paul Burns, \\"Butler's Lives of the Saints,\\" (Continuum International Publishing Group, 1997), 63. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, however, \\"this report has no historic foundation. It is merely a tentative explanation of the name Quatuor Coronati, a name given to a group of really authenticated martyrs who were buried and venerated in the catatomb of Saint Marcellinus and Pietro, the real origin of which, however, is not known. They were classed with the five martyrs of Pannonia in a purely external relationship.\\" The bodies of the martyrs are kept in four ancient sarcophagi in the crypt of Santi Marcellino e Pietro. According to a lapid dated 1123, the head of one of the four martyrs is buried in Santa Maria in Cosmedin. Confusion and conclusions The rather confusing story of the four crowned martyrs was well known in Renaissance Florence, principally as told in the thirteenth-century Golden Legend by Jacopo da Voragine. It appears that the original four martyrs were beaten to death by order of the emperor Diocletian (r. AD 284-305). Their story became conflated with that of a group of five stonecarvers, also martyred by Diocletian, in this case because they refused to carve an image of a pagan idol. Due to their profession as sculptors, the five early Christian martyrs were an obvious choice for the guild of stonemasons, but their number seems often to have been understood to be four, as in this case. Problems arise with determining the historicity of these martyrs because one group contains five names instead of four. Alban Butler believed that the four names of group one, which the Roman Martyrology and the Breviary say were revealed as those of the Four Crowned Martyrs, were borrowed from the martyrology of the Diocese of Albano Laziale, which kept their feast on August 8, not November 8. These four \\"borrowed\\" martyrs were not buried in Rome, but in the catacomb of Albano; their feast was celebrated on August 7 or August 8, the date under which is cited in the Roman Calendar of Feasts of 354. The Catholic Encyclopedia wrote that the \\"martyrs of Albano have no connection with the Roman martyrs\\". The double tradition may have arisen because a second passio had to be written. It was written to account for the fact that there were five saints in group two rather than four. Thus, the story concerning group one was simply invented, and the story describes the death of four martyrs, who were soldiers from Rome rather than Pannonian stonemasons. The Bollandist Hippolyte Delehaye calls this invented tradition \\"l'opprobre de l'hagiographie\\" (the disgrace of hagiography). Delehaye, after extensive research, determined that there was actually only one group of martyrs ‚Äì the stonemasons of group two - whose relics were taken to Rome. One scholar has written that \\"the latest research tends to agree\\" with Delehaye's conclusion. The Roman Martyrology gives the stonemasons Simpronianus, Claudius, Nicostratus, Castorius and Simplicius as the martyrs celebrated on November 8, and the Albano martyrs Secundus, Carpophorus, Victorinus and Severianus as celebrated on August 8.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ) Basilica of Santi Quattro Coronati Basilica of Santi Quattro Coronati. In the fourth and fifth centuries a basilica was erected and dedicated in honor of these martyrs on the Caelian Hill, probably in the general area where tradition located their execution. This became one of the titular churches of Rome, and was restored several times. Veneration The Four Crowned Martyrs were venerated early in England, with Bede noting that there was a church dedicated to them in Canterbury. This veneration can perhaps be accounted by the fact that Augustine of Canterbury came from a monastery near the basilica of Santi Quattro Coronati in Rome or because their relics were sent from Rome to England in 601. Their connection with stonemasonry in turn connected them to the Freemasons. One of the scholarly journals of the English Freemasons is called Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, and the Stonemasons of Germany adopted them as patron saints of \\"Operative Masonry.\\" Depictions Around 1385, they were depicted by Niccol√≤ di Pietro Gerini.in illo tempore ¬ª November 8, the Four Crowned Martyrs, with images of them and of Santi Quattro Coronati and the Chapel of Pope St Sylvester I Then in about 1415, Nanni di Banco fashioned a sculpture grouping the martyrs after he was commissioned by the Maestri di Pietra e Legname, the guild of stone and woodworkers, of which he was a member.

It is a colorless pyrophoric liquid. Its chemical formula is (C2H5)3B, abbreviated Et3B. It is soluble in organic solvents tetrahydrofuran and hexane. Preparation and structure Triethylborane is prepared by the reaction of trimethyl borate with triethylaluminium: :Et3Al + (MeO)3B ‚Üí Et3B + (MeO)3Al The molecule is monomeric, unlike H3B and Et3Al, which tend to dimerize. It has a planar BC3 core. Applications=Turbojet engine Triethylborane was used to ignite the JP-7 fuel in the Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojet/ramjet engines powering the Lockheed SR-71, and its predecessor A-12 OXCART. Triethylborane is suitable for this because of its pyrophoric properties, especially the fact that it burns with a very high temperature. It was chosen as an ignition method for reliability reasons, and in the case of the Blackbird, because the JP-7 fuel has very low volatility and is difficult to ignite. Conventional ignition plugs posed a high risk of malfunction. It was used to start each engine and to ignite the afterburners. Rocket Mixed with 10‚Äì15% triethylaluminium, it was used before lift-off to ignite the F-1 engines on the Saturn V rocket. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket also uses a triethylaluminium-triethylborane mixture as a first and second stage ignitor. Mission Status Center, June 2, 2010, 1905 GMT, SpaceflightNow, accessed 2010-06-02, Quotation: \\"The flanges will link the rocket with ground storage tanks containing liquid oxygen, kerosene fuel, helium, gaseous nitrogen and the first stage ignitor source called triethylaluminum- triethylborane, better known as TEA-TEB.\\" Organic chemistry Industrially, triethylborane is used as an initiator in radical reactions, where it is effective even at low temperatures. As an initiator, it can replace some organotin compounds. It reacts with metal enolates, yielding enoxytriethylborates that can be alkylated at the Œ±-carbon atom of the ketone more selectively than in its absence. For example, the enolate from treating cyclohexanone with potassium hydride produces 2-allylcyclohexanone in 90% yield when triethylborane is present. Without it, the product mixture contains 43% of the mono-allylated product, 31% di-allylated cyclohexanones, and 28% unreacted starting material. The choice of base and temperature influences whether the more or less stable enolate is produced, allowing control over the position of substituents. Starting from 2-methylcyclohexanone, reacting with potassium hydride and triethylborane in THF at room temperature leads to the more substituted (and more stable) enolate, whilst reaction at ‚àí78 ¬∞C with potassium hexamethyldisilazide, and triethylborane generates the less substituted (and less stable) enolate. After reaction with methyl iodide the former mixture gives 2,2-dimethylcyclohexanone in 90% yield while the latter produces 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone in 93% yield. center It is used in the Barton‚ÄìMcCombie deoxygenation reaction for deoxygenation of alcohols. In combination with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride it cleaves ethers. For example, THF is converted, after hydrolysis, to 1-butanol. It also promotes certain variants of the Reformatskii reaction. Triethylborane is the precursor to the reducing agents lithium triethylborohydride (\\"Superhydride\\") and sodium triethylborohydride. :MH + Et3B ‚Üí MBHEt3 (M = Li, Na) Triethylborane reacts with methanol to form diethyl(methoxy)borane, which is used as the chelating agent in the Narasaka-Prasad reduction for the stereoselective generation of syn-1,3-diols from Œ≤-hydroxyketones.

He helped paint in the tribune at church of San Bartolomeo Porta Ravegnana (1690). Franceschini frescoed the ceiling of the Sala d'Onore (\\"Hall of Honor\\") in the Ducal Palace of Modena, commissioned in 1696 for the marriage of Rinaldo d'Este to Princess Charlotte Felicity of Brunswick. He painted the altarpiece in the Cathedral of Finale Ligure and the canvas of San Carlo in the church of the same name in Modena. His massive program of historical and mythological scenes in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio of the Palazzo Ducale of Genoa (1701‚Äì1704) were destroyed by a fire in 1777. These had been completed with the help of Tommaso Aldrovandini, Quaini, and Antonio Meloni. In addition, his decorations of the pendentives and lunettes of the Piacenza Cathedral were removed in the late 19th century. He decorated the church of Corpus Domini (1688‚Äì1694) in Bologna.The frescoes in Corpus Domini were damaged during World War II. He painted 26 canvases of the Seductions and Loves of the Diana and Venus (1692-1700) for the Viennese palace (now Liechtenstein Museum) of Prince Johann Adam I of Liechtenstein.

There are two canvases of the Story of Rachel in the Pinacoteca B.P.E.R.. He painted the \\"cartoons\\" used to make the mosaic decoration of the Cappella del Coro in St. Peter's Basilica. Knighted by Pope Clement XI, he was founding a member and a subsequent director of the Clementine Academy in Bologna. His paintings have an academic and idealist strain, even for a member of the Bolognese School of Painting. The sparse figures are severely arranged and often porcelain in features. He worked with a younger colleague, Donato Creti. His style is often classified as Barochetto, a mixture of baroque and rococo; but it also could be said the neoclassical influence of French artists was beginning to overtake the baroque tradition. Wittkower describes him as the \\"Bolognese Maratta\\". Numerous painters worked and trained in his prolific studio.

It took Egypt's president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, to numerous locations and it notably sailed with President Anwar Sadat to Jaffa, Israel, during the 1979 peace talks between Egypt and Israel. It was renamed back to El Mahrousa in 2000 and recently became the first ship to cross the New Suez Canal extension in 2015. History She was built by the Samuda Brothers on the River Thames and designed by Oliver Lang along the same lines as . Twice in the ship's history significant alterations to the ship's length were carried out. Firstly by 40 feet in 1872, with a further 16.5 feet being added in 1905. The 1905 rebuild was undertaken at the Pointhouse Shipyard of A & J Inglis in Glasgow, Scotland and included the replacement of her two paddle wheels with triple propellers powered by steam turbines built by Inglis at their Warroch Street Engine Works in Glasgow. Inglis were one of the first companies to be granted a license by the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company, Wallsend for the construction of steam turbines in their own works. After the abdication of King Farouk and his arrival in Europe he sent back the yacht to Egypt with all the crew and the equipment; she was taken over by the Egyptian government for use as a naval training ship, and her name was changed to El Horreya. She spent most of her career in the eastern Mediterranean, but did participate in the International Naval Review held to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States of America. In 1984 its title as the largest super yacht was taken by Prince Abdulaziz, after having retained it for 119 years. Presently, the ship is cared for by the Egyptian Navy, and is occasionally used as a Presidential Yacht. The ship goes to sea about three times a year, usually for just a day. On 10 September 2000 after visiting the El Horreya, President Mubarak changed the name back to her original name Mahroussa.http://www.amwague.com/article-single-id-7801.html On 6 August 2015, the ship was used to inaugurate the New Suez Canal.

It is part of the Sumitomo Group. The company makes a wide range of rubber based products, including automobile tires, golf balls and tennis balls. Sumitomo brands include Dunlop Tyres (in certain regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America), Falken Tire and Ohtsu Tire. History The company traces its origins to 1909, when the Sumitomo Group made an investment in Dunlop Japan, the newly formed Japanese subsidiary of the British company Dunlop Rubber. Over the years Sumitomo and Dunlop developed a close business relationship, and in 1963 the Sumitomo Group acquired control of Dunlop Japan and renamed it Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. In 1985, when Dunlop Rubber was taken over by BTR plc, the company acquired the automobile tire assets of Dunlop, including the right to use the Dunlop brand on automobile tires. The acquisition did not include the US and Australian businesses, which were separately owned, but in 1986 Sumitomo also acquired the Dunlop Tire Corporation of the US from its management. In 1997, Sumitomo formed a joint venture with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, by which Goodyear and Sumitomo agreed to manufacture tires for each other's markets, including Dunlop branded tires. As part of the agreement, Goodyear acquired 75% interests in Dunlop Tyres, the UK company which Sumitomo had formed, and in Dunlop Tire Corporation. Goodyear and Sumitomo also made investments in each other. On 14 February 2014, Goodyear announced its intention to dissolve its partnership with Sumitomo due to alleged \\"anticompetitive conduct\\". On June 4, 2015, Goodyear announced the end of its joint venture with SRI, effective end of year 2015. The brand Dunlop will be shared between the 2 companies: * in North America, Goodyear will control the Dunlop brand for replacement tires and for new cars made by non- Japanese auto makers. Sumitomo Rubber will hold rights to the Dunlop brand for new cars made by Japanese auto makers, as well as for motorcycles * in most parts of Europe, Goodyear will control the Dunlop brand * in Japan, Sumitomo Rubber will retain rights to the Dunlop brand In December 2013 Sumitomo Rubber Industries acquired Apollo Tyres South Africa (Pty) Ltd from Apollo Tyres, which owned the Dunlop tyre brand in South Africa, as part of its strategic global development plans. It subsequently renamed the company Sumitomo Rubber South Africa (Pty) Ltd. Sumitomo Rubber South Africa manufactures the Dunlop, Sumitomo and Falken passenger car tyre brands in Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal. The Ladysmith plant began to produce Dunlop truck and bus radial tyres in July 2018, following the second of two large investments by Sumitomo Rubber Industries to upgrade and modernise the plant. Dunlop truck and bus radial tyres produced in Ladysmith will be sold in the South African market and will also be exported to several African states from 2019. Falken Tire The Falken Tire brand was launched by Sumitomo in Japan in 1983, and was introduced in North America two years later. In January 2016, after the dissolution of the partnership with Goodyear, the Sumitomo Rubber USA factory in Tonawanda, New York began to produce Falken Tire-branded tires. SRI Sports Limited SRI Sports Limited is the subsidiary of Sumitomo that specializes in sports equipment, with the main focus being tennis and golf. SRI Sports owns Srixon, Cleveland Golf, its subsidiary, Never Compromise, as well as rights to the Dunlop name in most parts of the world. Srixon produces tennis balls, golf balls, golf clubs, and a full range of golfing accessories. It holds several professional golfers under endorsement deals including Hideki Matsuyama Graeme McDowell and Keegan Bradley. Cleveland Golf also makes a full range of golf equipment, and has endorsement deals with Vijay Singh and Boo Weekley among others. Following the acquisition of Cleveland Golf, SRI Sports announced their intention to consolidate its operations, with Cleveland overseeing marketing and distribution across North America, with Srixon doing the same in Europe and Australia, and Dunlop taking over in Asia. In 2018 Dunlop entered into a partnership with Tennis Australia and became the official ball of the Australian Open, in a multi-year deal.  Acquisition of Dunlop brands from Sports Direct  In 2016, Sumitomo Rubber filed for regulatory approval before the Philippine Competition Commission in connection with its planned acquisition of Dunlop-related wholesale, manufacturing, and licensing business from Sports Direct. The company intended to acquire the entire issued share capital of Dunlop Brands Limited, Dunlop Slazenger 1902 Limited, and Dunlop Australia Limited, and the Dunlop-related business of Dunlop Sports Group Americas, Inc. which are subsidiaries of Sports Direct. Sumitomo Rubber manufactures and sells tires under the Dunlop brand name in many countries including Japan, as well as sports goods in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. The Philippine Competition Commission has approved the regulatory filing for the said acquisition in the same year. The acquisition allowed Sumitomo Rubber to consolidate the Dunlop brand across various products including sports goods worldwide.

In the early 1990s, he joined Pr. Rutter's MRC Child Psychiatry Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London where he held a Senior Lecturer post and an Honorary Consultant position at the Maudsley Hospital. In 1997, he was promoted as Reader In Epidemiological Psychiatry at the Institute of psychiatry. In 2001, he was appointed at McGill University in Canada as tenured full professor in Psychiatry. From 2001 to 2009, he directed the child psychiatry division at McGill University and the psychiatry department at the Montreal Children's Hospital, where he played a key role in the launch of its autism clinical and research program. Fombonne is also the recipient of the Canada Research Chair in child psychiatry since 2001. He is a practicing child psychiatrist and has clinics at the Montreal Children's Hospital for subjects with autism and other developmental disorders. Fombonne was president of the Association of Professors of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of Canada (APCAPC). He was Associate Editor of the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders from 1994 to 2003, and is a member of several editorial boards, and a consultant for several scientific organizations such as NIH/NIMH or foundations. Over the years, he has been a supportive member of several family associations, including Autism France and Autism Europe. Research His research focuses on epidemiological investigations of childhood mental illness and related risk factors, with a particular focus on the epidemiology of autism. He conducted the first population based survey of child psychiatric disorders among school aged children in France. In the UK, he conducted research on childhood depression and its long term outcomes. In France and in the UK, and later in Canada, he performed several surveys of autism in childhood populations. He and his colleagues were credited with demonstrating that there is no epidemiological evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine or mercury-containing vaccines and autism, as postulated by other researchers including Andrew Wakefield. Fombonne was subsequently involved as a key scientific expert witness in several trials in US courts and class actions. He was influential in explicating the lack of evidence linking thimerosal in vaccines, or specific vaccine types such as MMR, to autism in children. He testified on behalf of the US DHSS and the US Department of Justice in well publicized trials in front of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Court in Washington DC between 2006 and 2008. He has conducted several epidemiological studies of child and adolescent psychopathology, looking at overall mental health, depression, eating and substance use disorders. An early focus of his work was on secular trends in the incidence of youth mental health disorders, and factors that might cause these changes over time. One of the major studies conducted by Fombonne examined depression and suicidal behaviors, which linked alcohol abuse to increased suicidal tendencies in boys, using data on 6,000 subjects. He has also been involved in long-term outcome studies of child and adolescent depression. At McGill University, Fombonne has consolidated the Autism Spectrum Disorder program at the Montreal Children's Hospital since his appointment there in 2001. He currently heads an autism research program directed at evaluating environmental risk factors, such as vaccines and environmental neurotoxicants, and investigating genetic risks associated with the heritability of autism. He has also been involved in several molecular genetic studies of autism, and in outcome studies of autism spectrum disorders. Fombonne recently conducted a metanalysis of available epidemiological evidence of the prevalence of autism. His review concluded that the prevalence rate for autism is 25/10,000 and the rate of all pervasive developmental disorders around 90/10,000. However, he also noted several more recent studies indicating a much higher prevalence rate than this with a broader inclusion basis. He attributes the apparent rise in autism cases to wider recognition of the condition, and argues that claims of an 'autism epidemic' are unfounded unless proven otherwise. In 2001, he told the BBC \\"That rates in recent surveys are substantially higher than 30 years ago merely reflects the adoption of a much broader concept of autism, a recognition of autism among normally intelligent subjects and an improved identification of persons with autism.\\" However, he also states that a real change in the incidence of autism in human populations may also have contributed to the upward trends and that environmental risk factors that may influence these changes should be examined. Published works Fombonne has written over 260 scientific reports in peer reviewed journals and 40 book chapters. He was associate editor of the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders from 1994 to 2003. NotesReferences * Fombonne E. (1994) The Chartres study. I.

Here, only the rule of the first order is discussed, i.e., that of the Order of Friars Minor. Origin and contents of the rule=Origin Whether St. Francis wrote several rules or one rule only, with several versions, whether he received it directly from heaven through revelations, or whether it was the fruit of his long experiences, whether he gave it the last touch or whether its definite form is due to the influence of others, all these are questions which find different answers. =The Rule of 1209= The first rule is that which Francis submitted to Pope Innocent III for approval in the year 1209; its real text is not known. However, according to Thomas of Celano and Bonaventure, this primitive rule was little more than some passages of the Gospel heard in 1208 in the chapel of the Portiuncula. From which Gospel precisely these words were taken, is unknown. The following passages, Matthew 19:21; Matthew 16:24; Luke 9:3, occurring in the second rule (i and xiv), are considered as a part of the original one of 1209. They enjoin apostolical life with all its renouncements and privations. The three vows of obedience, chastity, and poverty, essential to any religious order, and some practical rules of conduct were added. Thomas of Celano says in this regard \\"Blessed Francis, seeing that the Lord God was daily increasing the number [of the brethren] for that very purpose, wrote down simply and in few words for himself and for his brethren, both present and future, a pattern and rule of life, using chiefly the language of the holy Gospel after whose perfection alone he yearned\\". Bonaventure and the so-called \\"Legend of the Three Companions\\" (viii) repeat almost the same words. It was to this \\"form of life,\\" which has become known as the first Rule, that Innocent III gave verbal approval on April 23, 1209.Robinson, Paschal. The Writings of St. Francis, 1905 In 1215, Canon 13 of the Fourth Council of the Lateran forbade the establishment of new religious orders, and required those who wished to found a new house to choose an existing approved rule. Livarius Oliger sees in the fact that Francis and his followers were considered exempt from this prohibition, an implicit approval. The text of the primitive rule seems to have been lost very early. This first rule marks the stage of the order governed by St. Francis's personal authority, and it is quite natural that this first attempt could not be developed as later rules were. Francis did not take as his model any monastic order, but simply the life of Christ and His Apostles, the Gospel itself. =The Rule of 1221= Jacques de Vitry, in a letter written at Genoa, in 1216 says that the rule of 1209 was successively improved at the annual general chapter at Portiuncula by new statutes, the fruit of ever-growing experience. The traditional \\"Legend of the Three Companions\\" says (c. xiv): \\"At Whitsuntide [every year] all the brethren assembled unto St. Mary and consulted how best they might observe the Rule. Moreover St. Francis gave unto them admonition, rebukes, and precepts, according as seemed good unto him by the counsel of the Lord.\\" During the years 1219-1220 in the absence of the holy founder in the East, some events happened which determined Francis to recast his rule, in order to prevent similar troubles in the future. The only author who informs us well on this point is Jordanus of Giano in his Chronicle. The vicars left in charge of the brothers by Francis having made some innovations against the spirit of the rule, and Francis having heard of this, he immediately returned to Italy and with the help of Cardinal-Protector Ugolino repressed the disorders. One of these innovations was a prohibition against eating meat. This Francis overruled in keeping with Acts 10:15, \\"What God has made clean, you are not to call profane\\". Jordanus then goes on: \\"And thus the disturbers with the help of the Lord being kept down, he [St. Francis] reformed the Order according to its statutes. And the blessed Francis seeing that brotherCaesarius [of Spires] was learned in holy letters, he charged him to embellish with texts of the Gospel the Rule which he himself had written with simple words.\\" In the early years, Francis had been able to lead the friars by his personal charisma. As their number grew, and there were scattered in distant countries many who had never or rarely met the founder.Acocella, Joan. \\"Rich Man, Poor Man\\", The New Yorker, January 6, 2013 Angelo Clareno says that at some general chapter the ministers and custodes, asked Cardinal Ugolino to use his influence with Francis that he might introduce some organization into the order according to the Rules of Augustine, Benedict, and Bernard, and that they might receive some influence. Francis being questioned, answered that he was called to walk by the way of simplicity, and that he would always follow the folly of the Cross. The chapter at which this occurred was most, likely the one of 1220. Nonetheless, in a bull of Honorius III, of 22 September, 1220 \\"to the Priors or Custodes of the Friars Minor,\\" one year of novitiate is introduced, in conformity with other orders, after which no one may leave the order (c. ii of the rule of 1221). Furthermore, much authority is given to the ministers through the general chapter, which hitherto had been frequented by all the brothers, but now is reserved to the ministers. This is about the time that Francis delegated the direct day to day governance to Peter of Cataneo as vicar general. The second rule was probably published at the General Chapter of Portiuncula, 1221, where for the last time all the friars convened. It was certainly in use in the autumn of the same year, since the Friars in Germany held at Augsburg in October 1221, a provincial chapter in accordance with c. xviii of this rule. It may appear strange that neither Thomas of Celano nor St. Bonaventure mentions this second rule, which certainly marked an important stage in the Franciscan Order. The reason thereof may be because it was composed in connexion with troubles arisen within the order, on which they preferred to keep silent. The second rule is called \\"Regula prima\\" by a number of Franciscan writers, it being the first known in its text, or also \\"Regula non bullata,\\" for it was never solemnly confirmed by a papal Bull. It has been preserved in many manuscripts and has been often printed. It consists of twenty-three chapters, some of which are composed almost entirely of scriptural texts; in others many admonitions are found and towards the end even prayers. is not a new one, but the same that Innocent III approved, not indeed in its original form, which has not come down to us, 4 but rather in the form it had assumed in the course of twelve years, as a consequence of many changes and additions. Paschal Robinson says that it \\"...is not a new one, but the same that Innocent III approved, not indeed in its original form, which has not come down to us, but rather in the form it had assumed in the course of twelve years, as a consequence of many changes and additions.\\" The introductory words \\"Brother Francis . . . promises obedience and reverence to our Lord Pope Innocent\\" (d. 1216) show clearly that the second rule is only an enlarged version of the primitive one. =The Rule of 1223= Bonaventure relates that when the order had greatly increased, St. Francis had a vision which determined him to reduce the rule to a shorter form. Francis, with Brother Leo and Brother Bonizo of Bologna, went in 1223 to Fonte Colombo, a beautiful wood-covered hill near Rieti, where, fasting on bread and water, he caused the rule to be written down by Brother Leo. Brother Elias, to whom this rule was entrusted, after a few days declared that he had lost it, hence Francis had the rule rewritten. The rule composed in 1223 was solemnly confirmed by the Bull \\"Solet annuere\\" of Honorius III of 29 November 1223. The rule of 1223 is the Franciscan Rule properly so called, the rule which the Friars Minor still observe. It is named by Franciscan authors \\"Regula bullata\\" or \\"Regula secunda.\\" From what has been already said, it may be gathered that St. Francis successively developed his rule, adapting it to the circumstances. Those who believe in an influence exercised on St. Francis in recasting the third rule the point that Pope Gregory IX, in the Bull Quo elongati (1230), says that he knew the intention of St. Francis with regard to the rule, as he had assisted him when he wrote it and obtained its confirmation. Contents The rule is contained in the Bull \\"Solet annuere\\", and begins with these characteristic words: \\"The rule and life of the Minor Brothers is this, namely, to observe the holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ by living in obedience, without property and in chastity.\\" St. Francis promises obedience to Pope Honorius and his successors, the other brothers are to obey Brother Francis and his successors (c. i). Having thus laid the solid foundation of unity upon the Church, St. Francis gives particulars concerning reception, profession, and vestments of the brothers. They are forbidden to wear shoes, if not compelled through necessity (c. ii). Chapter the third prescribes for the clerics \\"the Divine Office according to the order of the holy Roman Church, with the exception of the Psalter; wherefore (or, as soon as) they may have breviaries.\\" The laybrothers have to say Paternosters, disposed according to the canonical hours. The brothers are to \\"fast from the feast of All Saints until the Nativity of the Lord,\\" during Lent, and every Friday. The forty days' fast (obligatory in the rule of 1221), which begins Epiphany, is left free to the good will of the brothers. Beautiful exhortations follow on the behaviour of the brothers when they go through the world. They are forbidden to ride on horseback, unless compelled by manifest necessity or infirmity (c. iii). The next chapter \\"strictly enjoins on all the brothers that in no wise they receive coins or money, either themselves or through an interposed person.\\" However, the ministers and custodes have to take the greatest care of their subjects through spiritual friends, according to places and times and other circumstances, saving always that, as has been said, they shall not \\"receive coins or money\\" (c. iv). To banish idleness and to provide for their support, St. Francis insists on the duty of working for \\"those brothers to whom the Lord has given the grace of working.\\" But they must work in such a way that \\"they do not extinguish the spirit of prayer and devotion, to which all temporal things must be subservient.\\" As a reward of their labour they may receive things needed, with the exception of coins or money (c. v). Of the highest importance is chapter vi. It contains the prescriptions of the most ideal poverty: \\"The brothers shall appropriate nothing to themselves, neither a house nor place nor anything. And as pilgrims and strangers in this world...let them go confidently in quest of alms.\\" \\"This, my dearest brothers, is the height of the most sublime poverty, which has made you heirs and kings of the kingdom of heaven: poor in goods, but exalted in virtue....\\" Then follows an appeal for fraternal love and mutual confidence, \\"for if a mother nourishes and loves her carnal son, how much more earnestly ought one to love and nourish his spiritual brother!\\" (c. vi). The following chapter treats of penance to be inflicted on brothers who have sinned. In some cases they must recur to their ministers, who \\"should beware lest they be angry or troubled on account of the sins of others, because anger and trouble impede charity in themselves and in others\\" (c. vii). Chapter viii charges all the brothers \\"always to have one of the brothers of this religion (order) as Minister General and servant of the whole brotherhood.\\" At his death the provincial ministers and custodes must elect a successor in the Whitsun chapter. The general chapter, at which the provincial ministers are always bound to convene, is to be held every three years, or at a longer or shorter interval, where the general so wishes. After the Whitsun chapter, provincial chapters may be convoked by the ministers (c. viii). A special chapter on preachers follows next. The brothers are forbidden to preach in any diocese against the will of the bishop, and unless they are approved by the minister general. The brothers must preach \\"for the utility and edification of the people, announcing to them vices and virtues, punishment and glory...\\" (c. ix). \\"Of the admonition and correction of the Brothers\\" is the title of chapter x. The ministers \\"shall visit and admonish their brothers, and shall humbly and charitably correct them, not commanding them anything against their souls and our Rule. The brothers however who are subject must remember that, for God, they have renounced their own will.\\" If any brother cannot observe the rule spiritually, he must recur to his minister, who is bound to receive him kindly (c. x). In chapter xi the brothers are forbidden to have suspicious intimacy with women, nor are they allowed to \\"enter monasteries of nuns, except those to whom special permission has been granted by the Apostolic See.\\" Nor may they \\"be godfathers of men or women.\\" The twelfth and last chapter treats of those who wish to go among the Saracens and other infidels, for which purpose they must obtain leave from their provincial ministers. The ministers are bound to ask of the pope a cardinal-protector, \\"so that\\" ‚Äî with these touching words St. Francis concludes his rule ‚Äî \\"being always subject and submissive at the feet of the same holy Church, grounded in the Catholic faith, we may observe poverty and humility and the holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which we have firmly promised\\" (c. xii). As may be seen from this short survey the Franciscan rule contains many commandments, tempered by the sweet exhortations of St. Francis. It is the tender voice of a loving father that speaks to his children through the rule. This rule has been praised in the highest terms by different authorities. First of all St. Francis himself had a high idea of it: \\"This Rule he declared to be for his brethren the book of life, the hope of salvation, the marrow of the Gospel, the way of perfection, the key of Paradise and the covenant of an eternal alliance (II Cel., ii, 158). Nicholas III (Exiit) speaks in the same way: \\"This Rule is founded on the words of the Gospel, it has its force from the example of Christ's life, it is confirmed by the words and deeds of the founders of the Church, the Apostles.\\" Angelo Clareno (Expositio) calls it \\"the Rule of charity and piety,\\" \\"the Rule of peace, truth and piety.\\" \\"The Evangelical Rule\\" is a much-used expression for it in old Franciscan literature. The influence which the Rule of St. Francis has exercised for now seven hundred years is immeasurable. Millions have followed it, finding in it peace of heart, and the means of their own and other men's sanctification. Nor has the rule had less important effects in a more general way. Unlike all former rules, it established poverty not only for the individual members, but for the order as a whole. On this point St. Francis influenced even the Order of St. Dominic and many subsequent institutions. As early as the thirteenth century, Salimbene (ed. Holder-Egger, Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script., XXXII, 256) wrote: \\"Whoever wants to found a new congregation, always take something from the Order of blessed Francis.\\" For the general influence of Franciscan poverty see Dubois, \\"St. Francis of Assisi, social reformer\\" (New York, 1906). The constitution of the order is likewise different from that of the monastic orders. It is strictly hierarchical, the convents being grouped into provinces which are governed by the provincials, who in turn are under the jurisdiction of the minister general, the head and ruler of the whole order. ‚Äî The words of St. Francis (c. iii Reg.): \\"Let the clerics perform the Divine office according to the order of the holy Roman Church with the exception of the Psalter,\\" have had a singular result. Through adopting the shorter breviary of the papal Curia the Franciscans made this breviary popular, reformed it in many points and led to its being practically received by the whole secular clergy. (See Baeumer, \\"Geschichte des Breviers,\\" Freiburg im Br., 1895, p. 318 sqq.; Batiffol, \\"Histoire du Breviaire Romain,\\" Paris, 1893, p. 142 sqq.) The principles concerning preaching as laid down by St. Francis in c. ix of his Rule contain the secret of the great Franciscan preachers who have always been among the most successful and popular. Finally, chap. xii on missions amongst the infidels is a happy innovation in religious rules, as Angelo Clareno in his exposition wisely observed. There can be no doubt that the great impulse given to foreign missions in the thirteenth century is due to St. Francis, who was himself a missionary in the East and saw some of his brethren martyred for the Faith. Interpretation The ideal that St. Francis laid down in his rule is very high; the apostolical life was to be put in practice by his brethren, and indeed we see that St. Francis and his companions lived perfectly according to that standard. But the number of the friars rapidly increasing, and on the other hand, some being received into the order who had not the pure intentions and the great zeal of Francis, the rule gave rise to many controversies, and, as a consequence, to many declarations and expositions. The first exposition of the rule was given by St. Francis himself in his Testament (1226). He puts there his own and his first disciples' life as an example to the brothers. Moreover he forbids them \\"to ask for any letter from the Roman Curia, either for a church or for any other place, whether under pretext of preaching, or on account of their bodily persecution.\\" He enjoins also on all brothers \\"not to put glosses on the Rule,\\" but as he had written it purely and simply, so ought they \\"understand it simply and purely ‚Äî and with holy operation observe it until the end.\\" Nevertheless we have a great number of expositions of the rule, and it cannot be said that they are, in their greatest part, against the will of St. Francis. He himself had in his lifetime been humble enough to submit in everything to the decisions of the Church, and so he desired his sons to do. Even the Spirituals, who cleaved to the letter of the rule, as Olivi and Clareno, were not against reasonable expounding of the rule, and have written expositions thereof themselves. Besides, the decisions of the popes are not dispensations, but authentic interpretations of a rule, that binds only inasmuch as it is approved by the Church. To proceed with order, we shall firstly speak of the authentic interpretations, secondly of the private expositions. Authentic interpretations These are the papal Constitutions on the rule. Doubts about the meaning and the observance of the rule having risen at the general chapter of Assisi (1230), a deputation of prominent men was sent to Gregory IX, to obtain a papal decision. On 28 September 1230, the pope edited the Bull \\"Quo elongati\\" (Bull. Franc., I, 68), a document of capital importance for the future of the order. In this Bull the pope, claiming to know the intentions of the holy founder, since he had assisted him in the composition and approval of the rule, declares that for the tranquillity of conscience of the friars, the Testament of St. Francis has no binding power over them, as Francis, when making it, had no legislative power. Nor are the brothers bound to all the counsels of the Gospel, but only to those that are expressly mentioned in the rule, by way of precept or of prohibition. Dispositions are made with regard to money and property. The brothers may appoint a messenger (nuntius), who may receive money from benefactors and in the latter's name either spend it for the present needs of the friars, or confide it to a spiritual friend for imminent wants. The principle of absolute poverty is maintained for the individual friar and for the whole community; still the use of the necessary movable objects is granted them. These are some of the most striking dispositions of Gregory IX, whose principles of wise interpretation have remained fundamental for the order. Innocent IV, in the Bull \\"Ordinem vestrum,\\" 14 Nov., 1245 (Bull. Franc. I, 400), confirmed the dispositions of his predecessor, but at the same time made more ample concessions, since he allowed the brothers to recur to the messenger or spiritual friend not only for things necessary, but also for things useful and convenient (commoda). The order, however, in two general chapters, at Metz, 1249, and at Narbonne, 1260, declined to receive this privilege, inasmuch as it goes farther than the concession of Gregory IX. In the same Bull Innocent IV declares that all things in the use of the friars belong to the Apostolic See, unless the donor has reserved the ownership to himself. A necessary consequence of this disposition was the institution of a procurator by the same pope through the Bull \\"Quanto studiosius,\\" 19 Aug., 1247 (Bull. Franc., I, 487). This procurator was to act in the name of the Apostolic See as a civil party in the administration of the goods in use of the friars. The faculties of this procurator, or Apostolic syndic, were much enlarged by Martin IV through the Bull \\"Exultantes in Domino,\\" 18 January 1283 (Bull. Franc., III, 501), especially in regard to lawsuits. The order received the disposition of Martin IV at the chapter of Milan, 1285, but warned at the same time against the multiplication of legal actions (see Ehrle, Archiv f√ºr Litteratur- und Kirchengeschichte, VI, 55). The two most famous Constitutions on the Franciscan rule, which have been inserted in the text of canon law, and which are still in uncontested authority with the Friars Minor, are the Bulls \\"Exiit qui seminat\\" of Nicholas III, and \\"Exivi de Paradiso\\" of Clement V. The Constitution \\"Exiit\\" (c. iii, in VI, lib. V, tit. xii), prepared with the advice of eminent men in and outside the order, given at Soriano near Viterbo, 14 Aug., 1279, treats the whole rule both theoretically and practically. Nicholas III, against the enemies of the order, states that complete expropriation, in common as well as in particular, is licit, holy, and meritorious, it being taught by Christ Himself, although He, for the sake of the weak, sometimes took money. The brothers have the moderate use of things according to their rule. The proprietorship goes to the Holy See, unless the donor retains it. The question of the money is treated with special care. The employment of the messenger and spiritual friend is confirmed and explained. The friars have no right over the money, nor can they call to account an unfaithful messenger. Lest the great number of papal decisions should produce confusion, the pope declares that all former Bulls on the subject are abolished, if they are against the present one. However, this Constitution did not put an end to the questions moved by the more zealous brothers, called Spirituals. It was through their agitation at the papal court at Avignon (1309‚Äì1312) that Clement V gave the Constitution \\"Exivi,\\" 6 May 1312 (c. i, Clem., lib. V, tit. xi). Whilst Angelo Clareno, the head of the Spirituals, rejects all papal declarations on the rule, he speaks well of the Bull \\"Exivi,\\" \\"which is among the others like a flying eagle, approaching nearest to the intention of the Founder\\" (Archiv f√ºr Litteratur-und Kirchengeschichte, II, 139). Clement V declares that the Friars Minor are bound to poverty (usus pauper) in those points on which the rule insists. Characteristic of this Bull is the casuistic manner in which the prescriptions of the rule are treated. It declares that St. Francis wished to oblige his brothers under mortal sin in all those cases in which he uses commanding words or equivalent expressions, some of which cases are specified. The Constitutions \\"Exiit\\" and \\"Exivi\\" have remained fundamental laws for the Franciscans, although they were in the most important point practically suppressed by John XXII, who in his Bull \\"Ad conditorem canonum,\\" 8 Dec., 1322 (Bull. Franc., V, 233), renounced on behalf of the Apostolic See the proprietorship of the goods of which the order had the use, declaring (according to the Roman law) that in many things the use could not be distinguished from the property. Consequently he forbade the appointment of an Apostolic syndic. Martin V in \\"Amabiles fructus,\\" 1 Nov., 1428 (Bull. Franc., VII, 712), restored the former state of things for the Observants. Private expositions Only the earliest ones, which had influence on the development of the order, can be mentioned here. The most important is that of the Four Masters, edited at least six times in old collections of Franciscan texts, under the names of Monumenta, Speculum, Firmamenturn (Brescia, 1502; Salamanca, 1506, 1511; Rouen, 1509; Paris, 1512; Venice, 1513). The chapter of the custodes at Montpellier, 1541, had ordered that the solution of some doubts about the rule should be asked for from each province. We know of two expositions of the rule drawn up on this occasion. Eccleston (c. xii, alias xiii, Analecta Francisc., I, 244) speaks of the short but severe exposition which the friars in England sent to the general, beseeching him by the blood of Jesus Christ to let the rule stand as it was given by St. Francis. Unfortunately, the text of this declaration has not been handed down. We have, however, that of the province of Paris, issued on the same occasion by four masters of theology, Alexander of Hales, Jean de la Rochelle, Robert of Bastia, and Richard of Cornwall. The custos Godfried figures only as an official person. This interesting exposition of the rule, and the most ancient, for it was written in the spring of 1242, is short and treats only some dubious points, in conformity with the Bull \\"Quo elongati\\" and two later decisions of Gregory IX (1240, 1241). Their method is casuistic. They propose doubts, resolve them, and sometimes leave the questions to the superiors, or invoke a decision of the pope, although they speak twice (c. ii, ix) of the possible danger for the pure observance of the rule, if too many papal privileges are obtained. The work of the Four Masters has had the same effect on subsequent private expositions as the Bull \\"Quo elongati\\" had on all following pontifical declarations. The most prolific writer on the Rule of St. Francis was St. Bonaventure, who was compelled to answer fierce adversaries, such as Guillaume de Saint-Amour and others. His treatises are found in the Quaracchi edition of his works, VIII, 1898 (see SAINT BONAVENTURE). The standpoint of St. Bonaventure is observance of the rule as explained by the papal declarations and with wise accommodation to circumstances. He himself exercised great influence on the decretal \\"Exiit\\" of Nicholas III. About the same time as St. Bonaventure, Hugo of Digne (d. about 1280) wrote several treatises on the rule. His exposition is found in the above-mentioned collections, for instance in the \\"Firmamentum\\" (Paris, 1512), IV, f. xxxiv, v. (Venice, 1513), III, f. xxxii, v. John of Wales (Guallensis) wrote before 1279 an exposition, edited in \\"Firmamenturn\\" (Venice, 1513), III, f. xxviii, v. In his treatise \\"De Perfectione evangelica,\\" John of Peckham has a special chapter (c. x) on the Franciscan rule, often quoted as an exposition, \\"Firmamentum,\\" ed. 1512, IV, f. xciv, v; 1513, III, f. lxxii, r. David of Augsburg's sober explanation, written before the Bull \\"Exiit,\\" is edited in great part by Lempp in \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr Kirchengeschichte,\\" vol. XIX (Gotha, 1898‚Äì99), 15-46, 340-360. Another expositor of the Franciscan rule towards the end of the thirteenth century was Pierre Johannis Olivi, who, besides a methodical exposition (Firmamentum, 1513, III, f. cvi, r.), wrote a great number of tracts relating to Franciscan poverty. These treatises, comprised under the name \\"De perfectione evangelica\\" are not yet printed in their entirety [see Ehrle, \\"Archiv f√ºr Litteratur-und Kirchengeschichte,\\" III, 497, and Oliger, \\"Archivum Franciscanum Historicum\\" (1908), I, 617]. The theories of poverty taught by Olivi exercised great fascination over the Spirituals, especially over Angelo Clareno (d. 1337), whose exposition of the rule will shortly published by the present writer. Of others who directly or indirectly exposed the rule, or particular points of it, we can only name the best known, according to the centuries in which they lived. Fourteenth century: Ubertino of Casale, Gundisalvus of Vallebona, Petrus Aureoli, Bartholomew of Pisa, Bartholo di Sassoferrato (a lawyer). Fifteenth century: St. Bernardine of Siena, St. John Capistran, Cristoforo di Varese (not published), Alessandro Ariosto (Serena Conscientia), Jean Perrin, Jean Philippi. Sixteenth century: Brendolinus, Gilbert Nicolai, Antonio de Cordova, Jerome of Politio (O.Cap.), Francis Gonzaga. Seventeenth century: Peter Marchant, Pedro of Navarre, Mattheucci, De Gubernatis. Eighteenth century: Kerkhove, Kazenberger (several times reedited in nineteenth century), Castellucio, Viatora Coccaleo (O.Cap.), Gabrielle Angelo a Vincentia. Nineteenth century: Benoffi, O.M.Con. (Spirito della Regola de' Frati Minori, Rome, 1807; Fano, 1841) Alberto a Bulsano (Knoll, O.Cap.), Winkes, Maas, Hilarius Parisiensis (O.Cap.), whose learned but extravagant work has been put on the Index of forbidden books. Finally, Bonaventure Dernoye (Medulla S. Evangelii per Christum dictata S. Francisco in sua seraphica Regula, Antwerp, 1657) and Ladislas de Poris (O.Cap.), Meditations sur la R√®gle des Freres Mineurs (Paris, 1898) have written voluminous works on the rule for purposes of preaching and pious meditation. The Rule of St. Francis is observed today by the Friars Minor and the Capuchins without dispensations. Besides the rule, both have their own general constitutions. The Conventuals profess the rule \\"juxta Constitutiones Urbanas\\" (1628), in which all former papal declarations are declared not to be binding on the Conventuals, and in which their departure from the rule, especially with regard to poverty, is again sanctioned. Legacy Also non-Catholic organisations have been founded in inspiration of Saint Francis and his rule; see for instannce Franciscan spirituality in Protestantism.

He was an energetic pastor who dedicated himself to missions across Naples either in large locations or in rural areas where he was known for succinct and concise preaching that resonated with all people regardless of their social status. But from his love for the missions came a desire to be in the Far East for missions; he was pained when he was not allowed to join the Jesuit mission in Japan or India but continued to dedicate himself to preaching and teaching students. He is known to have written the \\"Diu vi Salvi Regina\\" which later was adopted as the national anthem of an independent Corsica in 1735. Life Francesco de Geronimo was born in Grottaglie on 17 December 1642 as the eldest of eleven children to Giovanni Leonardo di Geronimo and Gentilesca Gravina. He led a pious childhood and at age twelve held the position of a sacristan and catechist at a house of the Theatines near his home. The reception of his First Communion made him hunger ever more for the frequent reception of the Eucharist. In 1658 he entered the college at Taranto which was under the care of the Jesuits after his parents decided to send him there after noticing his talents. He underwent his humanities and philosophical studies there and was so successful to the point that his local bishop sent him to Naples to attend lectures in both theological studies and canon law at the college of Ges√π Vecchio. He received his ordination to the priesthood in Naples on 18 March 1666 from the Bishop of Pozzuoli Benito S√°nchez de Herrera. He had to receive dimissorial letters from his archbishop (regarding studies) and a papal dispensation from Pope Alexander VII in order to be ordained under the age required. Until 1670 he was placed in charge of the pupils of the college of nobles in Naples where the students nicknamed him as \\"il santo prefetto\\". But he soon felt a strong inclination to join the Jesuits despite his father's opposition. His father sent him a long and vehement letter but his son answered it with great affection to induce his father to acquiesce to the will of God. He entered the Jesuit novitiate on 1 July 1670 and in 1671 after his probation was sent with an experienced missioner to get his first lessons in the art of preaching in the neighborhood of Otranto. From 1671 until 1674 he was labouring in towns and villages but was granted permission to complete his theological studies before being sent to reside at Ges√π Nuovo in 1675. He would have preferred to serve in the missions of the Far East but his superiors told him to abandon the idea and to concentrate on his work there in Naples where he remained for the remainder of his life. He had wanted to go either to Japan or India but was refused this request. He first devoted himself to stirring up the religious enthusiasm of a congregation of workmen called the \\"Oratio della Missione\\" which had established at the professed house of the Jesuits in Naples. The main object of this association was to provide the mission priests with helpers. It was at the Oratorio that he succeeded in establishing a mont de pi√©t√©; the capital was increased with the gifts of the associates. He was an energetic preacher and went visiting all the environs of Naples; his voice was loud and sonorous and could be heard at a great distance due to its distinctness. Whatever time was unoccupied with his missions he devoted to giving rural missions. He tried to establish an association of Francis Xavier (whom he made his patron and model); or else a congregation dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. For just over two decades he preached her praises once a week in the Neapolitan church known as Santa Maria di Constantinoppli. He was often seen walking through the streets of Naples with an ecstatic look on his face and tears streaming. He had a reputation for being a miracle-worker with those who testified during the process of canonization attributing to him numerous wonders and cures of all kinds. In March 1715 - the start of Lent - he was giving a retreat to some students when he suddenly felt a racking fever so strong that he had to be carried out of the room to his bed. This ailment subdued over the course of the week and he resumed his usual duties despite his weakness which declined towards December. It was before Christmas that he felt so frail that his anxious superior sent him to Puzzuoli to recuperate. In March 1716 he was well enough to return to Naples where he stayed in the hospital wing. In mid-1716, he died from pleurisy after a fortnight of great pain. His remains were buried in a leaden coffin but when they were exhumed on 3 July 1736 it was discovered that they had turned to dust. The dust was collected and deposited into a coffin of wood lined with brass. Cardinal Orsini - the future Pope Benedict XIII - dedicated an entire sermon to him in the Benevento Cathedral. There is a chapel dedicated to him at Ges√π Nuovo in Naples, and in 1934 Francesco Jerace sculpted the statue that honors him. Sainthood Not long after the Jesuit died, the Naples archdiocese petitioned the Congregation for Rites to begin the sainthood process; the Nola and Benevento dioceses made similar requests. On 2 May 1758 he was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope Benedict XIV declared in a formal decree that the late Jesuit priest had practiced the theological and cardinal virtues in a heroic fashion. He would have been beatified soon afterwards but the storm surrounding the suppression of the order led to the suspension of the beatification process. Pope Pius VII approved two miracles attributed to him and beatified him on 2 May 1806 in Saint Peter's Basilica, while the confirmation of two more miracles saw Pope Gregory XVI canonize Francesco de Geronimo as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 26 May 1839.May 11th - Saint Francis Jerome, SJ Writings Francesco de Geronimo wrote little. Some of his letters have been used in biographical works and cited by other authors. The archives of the Jesuits contain a voluminous collection of his sermons. The account he wrote to his superiors of the fifteen most laborious years of his ministry dates from October 1693. He called it Brevi notizie della cose di gloria di Dio accadute negli exercizi delle sacri missioni di Napoli da quindici anni in qu√¢, quanto si potuto richiamare in memoria. Giuseppe Boero published it in S. Francesco di Girolamo, e le sue missioni dentro e fuori di Napoli, p. 67-181 (Florence, 1882). ReferencesSources * For his writings, cf.

This type battery was developed as the first rechargeable electric battery marketed for commercial use and it is widely used in automobiles. Plant√© was born on 22 April 1834 in Orthez, France. In 1854 he began work as an assistant lecturer in physics at the Conservatory of Arts and Crafts in Paris. In 1860 he was promoted to the post of Professor of Physics at the Polytechnic Association for the Development of Popular Instruction. An amphitheatre at that institute is named after him. In 1855, Plant√© discovered the first fossils of the prehistoric flightless bird Gastornis parisiensis (named after him) near Paris. This gigantic animal was a very close relative of the famous diatrymas of North America. At that time, Plant√© was at the start of his academic career, serving as a teaching assistant to A. E. Becquerel (father of Nobel laureate Henri Becquerel).Pr√©vost (1855) This early discovery‚Äîalthough it created considerable excitement in 1855‚Äîwas soon to be overshadowed by Plant√©'s subsequent discoveries. Lead-acid battery In 1859, Plant√© invented the lead-acid cell, the first rechargeable battery. His early model consisted of a spiral roll of two sheets of pure lead, separated by a linen cloth and immersed in a glass jar of sulfuric acid solution.Dell et al. (2001) The following year, he presented a nine-cell lead-acid battery to the Academy of Sciences. In 1881, Camille Alphonse Faure would develop a more efficient and reliable model that saw great success in early electric cars. Plant√© also investigated the differences between static electricity and dynamic electricity (i.e., from batteries). As part of this investigation, Plant√© invented a mechanical device that he called the Rheostatic Machine. The Rheostatic Machine used a bank of mica capacitors, a clever rotating commutator, and a series of contacts to alternately charge a bank of capacitors in parallel (from a high-voltage battery source) and then connect the capacitors in series. This arrangement multiplied the battery voltage by the number of capacitor stages to obtain very high voltages. By rapidly rotating the shaft, a series of high-voltage sparks many centimetres long could be rapidly generated. This device was a mechanical predecessor of the modern-day Marx generator. Using this device, Plant√© explored the electrical breakdown of air, the formation of Lichtenberg figures, and the behaviour of thin wires when pulsed by high electric currents. Death and legacy He died on 21 May 1889 in the Bellevue part of Meudon, near Paris. In 1989 the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences established the Gaston Plant√© Medal, which is awarded every few years to scientists who have made significant contributions to the development of lead-acid battery technology.

Wayland Baptist has a total of 14 campuses in five Texas cities, six states, American Samoa, and Kenya. It was originally chartered in 1908 and currently has a total enrollment of approximately 5,000 students. History In 1906, the Staked Plains Baptist Association purposed the creation of a school. Dr. and Mrs. James Henry Wayland offered $10,000 and of land in Plainview if the Staked Plains Baptist Association and the citizens of the city would raise an additional $40,000. In 1910, the school offered its first classes despite the administration building not yet being fully built. A total of 225 students were taking classes in primary education through junior college levels during the school's first term. After a public school system was well established in Plainview, the elementary grades were discontinued. Wayland Baptist gained membership to the American Association of Junior Colleges in 1926 and would later be approved as a senior college by the Texas Department of Education and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Texas Education Agency for teacher education training. The school is the oldest institution of higher education in continuous existence on the High Plains of Texas due to the leadership of Dr. George W. McDonald, the fifth president of the school. When a run on the banks during the Great Depression threatened to close the school, the administration and faculty agreed to forgo pay to continue the task of educating students, trusting God to supply their needs. In 1951, a black teacher approached the college asking if she could fulfill continuing education requirements at the college. Dr. James W. \\"Bill\\" Marshall, the school's sixth president, led the college to take the historic step to admit black students to the college, making Wayland the first four-year liberal arts college in the former Confederate states to integrate voluntarily. This action came three years before the Supreme Court's decision to ban school segregation, Brown v. Board of Education. The Malouf Abraham Family Arts Center on the Wayland campus was endowed by the family of the late State Representative Malouf Abraham, Sr., and his son, Malouf Abraham, Jr., a retired allergist and active art collector from Canadian, the seat of Hemphill County in the northeastern Texas Panhandle. A musical scholarship has been established at Wayland in honor of Sybil Leonard Armes, a Christian writer and alternate poet laureate of Texas in 1969, who was the mother of Wayland President Paul Woodson Armes. In 1979, the Hawaii campus opened as Wayland's first outside of Texas. Twelve satellite campuses are now located throughout the US. In May 2008, entertainer Jimmy Dean, a Plainview native, announced that he was making the largest ever gift to Wayland. In 2013, Wayland was ranked as the #72 university in the West Region by US News. In 2014, Wayland was recognized as having some of the most affordable online degree programs in the United States. They have the most affordable online nursing degree program in the country, as well as the 12th most affordable online education degree program. Athletics Wayland Baptist teams, nicknamed athletically as the Pioneers are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Sooner Athletic Conference.. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, football, golf, soccer, track and field, and wrestling; women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, soccer, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling. Until 2018, Wayland Baptist was the only college in Texas to offer a wrestling program. On April 1, 2010, Wayland Baptist announced its intention to bring back the football program and join the Central States Football League in 2012. On December 8, 2010, the Pioneers introduced Jeff Lynn, former head coach of New Mexico Military Institute, as the first head coach in over 70 years. On April 24, 2011, Lynn stepped down from head coach because of family reasons. He would be replaced by former Lubbock Coronado High School coach Butch Henderson. The cross country and track and field program have won a total of 14 national championships. The programs compete at notable track meets and cross country events such as the Cowboy Jamboree, Texas Relays, Drake Relays, and the Micheal Johnson Classic. In 2012, Wayland's men's track team won the NAIA National Championship by a margin of 38 points, which was the largest margin of victory in 23 years. Four Wayland athletes won individual championships, in addition to Wayland winning the 4x400 relay championship. Women's basketball Wayland's women's basketball program, The Hutcherson Flying Queens, has the distinction of being the winningest team in women's collegiate basketball history. On November 30, 2017, during the 2017‚Äì18 season, the Flying Queens posted their 1,600th win, 300 plus more wins than any other women's collegiate basketball team in USA history. By the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season, Tennessee who leads all NCAA DI schools, had 1,252 wins, followed by Louisiana Tech with 1,199 and Connecticut with 1,118. Wayland had 1595. The Wayland women's basketball team has also distinguished itself in the following ways: * The Flying Queens are the only team in collegiate basketball history (men or women) to record a 131-game consecutive winning streak (1953‚Äì1958). In 2013, the 1953‚Äì58 teams were honored as \\"Trailblazers of the Game\\" by the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame for the 131 game-winning streak. The team is featured in a documentary entitled Flying Queens: A Basketball Dynasty, directed by Kellie Mitchell and produced by Aperture Art Productions. * From the 1948‚Äì49 season through 2017‚Äì18 season the Flying Queens posted 1622 wins against 562 losses for a winning percentage of .743. In this 69-year period, the Wayland Team averaged 23 wins per season. * The Wayland Team has won 19 National Championships. * The Flying Queens' program has had eight individuals inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in Knoxville, Tennessee. * Members of the Wayland Hutcherson Flying Queens have received 212 All-American Awards from various organizations, excluding NAIA Scholar Athletes and a COSIDA Academic Award. Since the 1948‚Äì49 season, when Wayland began keeping official statistics on the Queens, the Wayland Team has had the following affiliations: * AAU (Amateur Athletic Union): Between the 1948‚Äì49 season through the 1976‚Äì77 season, Wayland competed in AAU women's basketball and was one of only a few colleges to compete in this league, as teams were primarily industrial and basically professional. The Wayland Team won 10 National AAU Championships, placed second 9 times, and third 3 times. Wayland Team members received 88 AAU All-American Awards.Nadler S. F. (1980). A Developmental History of the Wayland Hutcherson Flying Queens from 1910 to 1979 (Doctoral Dissertation). East Texas State University. * NWIT (National Women's Invitational Tournament): The NWIT was initially sponsored by the Amarillo Chamber of Commerce. Wayland administrators had presented the idea to them because of Wayland's strong desire to have a national tournament limited to college teams. The NWIT was one of the first two national basketball tournaments for college women, coincidentally starting one day apart. The Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics Tournament held in West Chester, PA, March 20‚Äì24, 1969 and the NWIT in Amarillo, Texas, March 21‚Äì24, 1969. Wayland competed in the NWIT for 9 years (1969‚Äì1977), winning 9 consecutive NWIT National Championships and receiving 23 NWIT All-American Awards. The NWIT faded in prominence when the NCAA and NAIA assumed governance for women's basketball and was discontinued in 1996. In 1998, Triple Crown Sports resurrected the tournament as the Women's National Invitational Tournament (Women's NIT). * AIAW (Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women): Wayland competed in the AIAW play-off structure for nine years, 1974‚Äì1982. During that period the team made it to the Final 4 three times finishing third in 1976 and fourth in 1978 and 1982. In both 1974 and 1975 they won the Consolation bracket. * NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics): The Wayland Team has competed in NAIA Division I basketball from 1983 through 2018. They have qualified for the National Tournament 25 times garnering 38 NAIA All-American Awards, one COSIDA Academic All American, and 39 NAIA Scholar-Athlete Awards. * FIBA (International Basketball Federation): Between 1953 and 1975, Wayland was represented on all seven of FIBA's Women's World Championship Teams. Nineteen Flying Queens have played in FIBA World Championships. * Pan American Games: Between 1955 and 1979, Wayland was represented on all seven USA Pan American teams. Twenty-seven Flying Queens competed in these games. Wayland coaches coached the USA's teams to first place victories in 1955 and 1959 and second place in 1971. * USA All-Star Teams: Between 1958 and 1978, eighteen Flying Queens were selected for basketball tours that were part of the State Department's Intercultural Exchange Program to enhance relations between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In 1959, eight Wayland players and a coach participated in the first women's basketball game ever to be played in Madison Square Garden. Russia won, 42‚Äì40. Also, to foster international goodwill, Wayland hosted national teams from Russia, The Republic of China, and Mexico on the Wayland's Plainview campus. Wayland teams made a number of trips to Mexico City to play both Mexican national teams and Mexican independent teams. Other Organizational Honors: In addition to the 149 All-American Awards previously mentioned, members of the Wayland Team garnered 63 other All- American Awards: Hanes Underalls (6); National Scouting Association (6); Street & Smith Preseason (9); Kodak (18); American Women's Sports Federation All Star Team (14); American Women's Sports Federation All American Freshman Team (7); and, JC Penny All-American Five (1). The Wayland women's team has had 13 coaches: # Sam Allen (1947‚Äì48 through 1950‚Äì1951; 1952‚Äì53). Record: 71‚Äì28 # Hank Garland (1951‚Äì52).

Record from 2013‚Äì14 through 2017‚Äì18: 114‚Äì43 The women's team also has a rich history. Wayland's first women's basketball game was in 1910‚Äì11, the same year that Wayland opened for classes. Women played club sport basketball against high schools from the 1910‚Äì11 season through the 1947‚Äì48 season when the Wayland women's team played its first game against another college, beating Texas Tech. The Wayland Team played its first AAU competition in 1948‚Äì49, which is also when Wayland began keeping official game statistics. The Wayland Team played its first International Competition in 1949‚Äì50 against Mexico. Beginning with the 1950‚Äì51 season, the Wayland Team became the first women's basketball team to fly to all away games, as Claude and Wilda Hutcherson, owners of Hutcherson Flying Service, picked up sponsorship of the team and flew the team to away games in Hutcherson Flying Service planes. This tradition of flying resulted in the team being named the \\"Hutcherson Flying Queens\\". In the early 1950s, Wayland became the first 4-year collegiate program in history to provide 13 full scholarships annually to a women's collegiate team. [19, 20] The Wayland Team attracted 40 to 50 women to Plainview each year for tryouts. The mascot for the women's team is the Flying Queens. The original team name was the Wayland Lassies, but in 1948, a local company, Harvest Queen Mill provided uniforms for the team, so they became the Harvest Queens. Before the 1950 season began, the team had a chance to play a game in Mexico City. A Wayland grad, Claude Hutcherson, was persuaded to fly the team to Mexico. Hutcherson became enamored with the team, and became a major sponsor, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the team. When Hutcherson Air Service became a full sponsor of the team, they began calling the team the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Hutcherson provided three sets of uniforms, plus traveling attire, and flew the team about 9,000 miles a year to games. To this day, Hutcherson Air Service continues to provide travel for the women's road games. Ironically, the strong support of Claude Hutcherson created problems for the school. Wayland considered dropping the team because the scholarships threatened their accreditation. In 1961, the Wayland board of trustees voted unanimously to eliminate women's basketball. The school had difficulty funding the academic programs. The accrediting organization, the Southern Association of Colleges, was not interested in AAU championships. No plans were made to eliminate the men's scholarships, only the women's scholarships. The local citizens did not accept the decision. Local businessmen, under the leadership of Claude Hutcherson, raised money to privately fund scholarships for a year. The trustees voted to reverse their position. The team was coached from 1955‚Äì56 through 1972‚Äì73 by Harley Redin. Redin served in the Marine Air Corp in WWII, logging 50 combat missions over the South Pacific. After the war, he became the athletic director of Wayland Baptist, and the coach of the men's basketball team. The men's teams were very successful, making the NAIA postseason tournament three separate years. However, he became the coach of the women's team in 1955, and was even more successful‚Äîin 1954, under Coach Caddo Matthews, they began a winning streak that would stretch to 131 games, including four consecutive AAU national championships. The winning streak would eclipse a prior winning streak of 102 games, held by Hanes Hosiery, which ended in 1954. For 18 years under the coaching leadership of Redin, the team won 431 games against only 66 losses. The team won six national AAU championships, and finished second six other times. Redin went on to coach the USA Women's Pan American Team in 1959 and 1971. He was inducted into the inaugural class of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2018, the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame presented Coach Redin the Bunn Lifetime Achievement award. Outside of enshrinement, this award is the most prestigious presented by the Hall of Fame. Wayland Baptist teams from 1946 to 1982 were later announced to receive enshrinement on April 6, 2019.https://www.nba.com/article/2019/04/06/2019-naismith-basketball-hall- fame-announcement Schools=School of Math and Sciences The School of Mathematics and Sciences at Wayland Baptist University administers all mathematics and science courses taught on the Plainview campus and also those taught online. Degrees are offered in math, math education, biology, molecular biology, chemistry, and geology, along with several preprofessional service course areas such as prenursing and pre-engineering. Currently, the school has 15 faculty members; 6 math and 9 sciences, with three emeritus faculty. The School serves over 400 students each semester. On average, 20 to 30 students graduate with degrees from the school each year. Initially, math and science courses were taught in several temporary locations on the WBU campus. Eventually, they, along with most other courses, were taught in Gates Hall, and later also in the library. The Division of Math and Science was formally designated in the 1940s. Science courses were moved to refurbished army barracks located on the north side of the campus in the 1960s. The Moody Science building was constructed in the early 1970s from a generous grant from the Moody Foundation. Several of the features in the new building were designed by faculty members. Since its completion, all Plainview campus math and science courses have been held there. In 2005, the university structure was reorganized, and the Division was redesignated as the School of Mathematics and Science.Estelle Owens (2009) History of Wayland Baptist University, 167 p.

An Ordnance Survey column marks the highest point of the Edge at Back Tor (538 metres, 1765 feet). North of Back Tor the edge extends into Howden Edge and enters the county of South Yorkshire.  Geography and geology  The Millstone Grit forms the edge of the high peat moorland plateau on the eastern side of the valley above Ladybower Reservoir, the edges being the last remains of the gritstone which originally covered all of the Peak District, most of which was scraped off by glaciers in the last ice age. The Edge itself is notable for its unusual gritstone tors and its views of the Derwent Valley and the Dark Peak landscape; these features along with its proximity to Sheffield have made it a popular venue for walkers. Its popularity has led to substantial path erosion and the most affected parts of the edge between The Salt Cellar and Lost Lad Hillend have been paved with natural stone slabs to reduce further damage as part of the Lottery Paths Project.  Tors  Derwent Edge has several examples of unusually shaped gritstone tors which have been formed by the actions of wind, rain and frost over many centuries. These tors have been named over the years by local residents and have now been officially titled on Ordnance Survey maps. These include the Cakes of Bread, the Coach and Horses and the Salt Cellar. The Coach and Horses (also known as the Wheel Stones and thus named on Ordnance Survey maps) resembles a coach and horses on the horizon when viewed from the A57 road to the south. Lost Lad Hillend is worth visiting as it has a stone built topographic indicator to aid identifying landmarks in the extensive view.  Walking  Derwent Edge is popular with walkers and is described in many walking guides. Mark Richards describes a 10.5 mile walk in his book ‚ÄúHigh Peak Walks‚Äù (), starting at the Fairholmes car park in the Upper Derwent Valley (Grid Reference ) at the northern end of Ladybower Reservoir; it is also possible to access the edge from Cutthroat Bridge (lay by parking) on the A57 () or from Strines Reservoir car park () near the Strines public house. The outcrops along Derwent Edge are popular with rock climbers , particularly the largest, Dovestone Tor, which has about 50 different routes ranging from difficult to Extremely Severe; however, it is not as well used as the nearby Stanage Edge.  Conservation  Much of the moorland around Derwent Edge has been declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) because of its special vegetation and rare birds and animals, such as the Eurasian golden plover, red grouse, ring ouzel and mountain hare. Rare species of plants such as common cottongrass, mountain strawberry, and crowberry grow in the area. It has been proposed as a Special Protection Area for birds under a European Directive. The edge is part of the National Trust's High Peak Estate and visitors are free to roam at will but are urged to keep to established routes to avoid disturbing breeding birds. There are occasional times that the moors are closed for management purposes and for grouse shooting ‚Äì signs are posted at these times.

Vikinglotto started in 1991 and was the first of its kind in Europe. Tickets and Draws Draws are held at 20:00 CET every Wednesday evening and they take place at Norsk Tipping in Hamar, Norway. Tickets can be purchased from authorised retailers in each of the nine participating countries, or online. The cost per combination varies in each member country, ranging from just ‚Ç¨0.80 in Latvia and 90kr. (approximately ‚Ç¨0.71) in Iceland up to ‚Ç¨1.10 in Slovenia. Play For every line, or combination, a player enters into the draw, they must select six main numbers which can be any distinct integers from 1 to 48. Then they must also pick one bonus number, known as the Viking number, from between 1 and 8. In the past, players had to select two additional numbers (Lucky Numbers) but these were replaced by the Viking number in May 2017. During the draw, six main numbers are drawn from 1 - 48 and the additional Viking number is drawn from a separate pool of 1 - 8. As the Viking number is drawn from a different pool, the same number could appear twice in a single draw - once as a main number and once as the Viking number. Prize Structure The Vikinglotto jackpot starts at ‚Ç¨3 million and can grow up to a maximum of ‚Ç¨35 million. The jackpot and the second prize are shared between all participating countries on a pari- mutuel basis, and all contribute to the prize fund for these two tiers. Smaller prizes are determined at a national level, using the remaining funds from ticket sales. This arrangement is different from EuroMillions where all prize categories are common to all participating countries. Lithuania offer the most prize tiers, with eight different ways to win.

The battle was referenced in the Annals of Ulster and the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba. The battle was fought between Norse-Gael leader Ragnall ua √çmair and his allies against the forces of Constant√≠n mac √Åeda, King of Scotland together with those of Ealdred I of Bamburgh who had previously been driven from his lands by Ragnall. The Historia de Sancto Cuthberto adds that English fought alongside Norsemen. The Annals of Ulster informs us that the Norse army divided itself into four columns, in one of which may have been Jarl Ottir Iarla, a long-time ally of Ragnall. The Scots destroyed the first three columns, but were ambushed by the last. This unit had remained hidden behind a hill and was commanded by Ragnall. The Scots, however, managed to escape without disaster. It seems that it was an indecisive engagement, although it did allow Ragnall to further establish himself in Northumbria. In 919, Ragnall descended on York where he took the city and had himself proclaimed king. The Bernicians remained under him, although Ealdred I of Bamburgh and Domnall I, king of Strathclyde, paid homage to the king of England. In 1950, F. T. Wainwright argued that there were two battles of Corbridge in 914 and 918, and his view was widely accepted for over fifty years, but since around 2006 historians have taken the view that there was only one battle in 918.

The resulting periodic potential may trap neutral atoms via the Stark shift.R. Grimm, M. Weidemuller, Y.B. Ovchinnikov (Feb 2000). \\"Optical dipole traps for neutral atoms.\\" Adv. in Atom. Mol. & Opt. Phys. 42 : 95-170. arxiv.org/abs/physics/9902072. doi.org/10.1016/S1049-250X(08)60186-X. Atoms are cooled and congregate in the locations of potential minima. The resulting arrangement of trapped atoms resembles a crystal lattice and can be used for quantum simulation. Atoms trapped in the optical lattice may move due to quantum tunneling, even if the potential well depth of the lattice points exceeds the kinetic energy of the atoms, which is similar to the electrons in a conductor. However, a superfluid‚ÄìMott insulator transition may occur, if the interaction energy between the atoms becomes larger than the hopping energy when the well depth is very large. In the Mott insulator phase, atoms will be trapped in the potential minima and cannot move freely, which is similar to the electrons in an insulator. In the case of Fermionic atoms, if the well depth is further increased the atoms are predicted to form an antiferromagnetic, i.e. N√©el state at sufficiently low temperatures.  Parameters  There are two important parameters of an optical lattice: the well depth and the periodicity. The well depth of the optical lattice can be tuned in real time by changing the power of the laser, which is normally controlled by an AOM (acousto-optic modulator). The periodicity of the optical lattice can be tuned by changing the wavelength of the laser or by changing the relative angle between the two laser beams. The real-time control of the periodicity of the lattice is still a challenging task. Because the wavelength of the laser cannot be varied over a large range in real time, the periodicity of the lattice is normally controlled by the relative angle between the laser beams. However, it is difficult to keep the lattice stable while changing the relative angles, since the interference is sensitive to the relative phase between the laser beams. Continuous control of the periodicity of a one- dimensional optical lattice while maintaining trapped atoms in-situ was first demonstrated in 2005 using a single-axis servo-controlled galvanometer. This \\"accordion lattice\\" was able to vary the lattice periodicity from 1.30 to 9.3 Œºm. More recently, a different method of real-time control of the lattice periodicity was demonstrated, in which the center fringe moved less than 2.7 Œºm while the lattice periodicity was changed from 0.96 to 11.2 Œºm. Keeping atoms (or other particles) trapped while changing the lattice periodicity remains to be tested more thoroughly experimentally. Such accordion lattices are useful for controlling ultracold atoms in optical lattices, where small spacing is essential for quantum tunneling, and large spacing enables single- site manipulation and spatially resolved detection. Site-resolved detection of the occupancy of lattice sites of both bosons and fermions within a high tunneling regime is regularly performed in quantum gas microscopes.  Uses  Besides trapping cold atoms, optical lattices have been widely used in creating gratings and photonic crystals. They are also useful for sorting microscopic particles, and may be useful for assembling cell arrays. Atoms in an optical lattice provide an ideal quantum system where all parameters can be controlled. Thus they can be used to study effects that are difficult to observe in real crystals. They are also promising candidates for quantum information processing. The best atomic clocks in the world use atoms trapped in optical lattices, to obtain narrow spectral lines that are unaffected by the Doppler effect and recoil.

After serving as Director of the Georgetown University Observatory he was called to Rome by Pope Pius X in 1906 to be the first Jesuit director of the new Vatican Observatory. Father Hagen was also the spiritual director of Maria Elizabeth Hesselblad (1870-1957), who was baptized by him on August 15 1902 and eventually was canonized on June 5 2016 by pope Francis. Early life Johann Georg Hagen was born in Bregenz, Austria. He was the son of a school teacher. Entering the Jesuit Order Johann entered the Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, in Gorheim, Germany in 1863. He attended the Jesuit College Stella Matutina in Feldkirch, Austria and also studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of Bonn and the University of M√ºnster. He volunteered for the ambulance service in the Franco-Prussian War, but was struck with typhoid fever. Expulsion On July 4, 1872, Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of Germany, expelled the Jesuits from the German Empire. Johann left for England where he was eventually ordained into the priesthood. Emigration to US In June 1880, he left England for the United States. There he began teaching at Sacred Heart College in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. There he cultivated his interest in astronomy and built a small observatory for making astronomical observations. In Wisconsin, he became a naturalized citizen. He was called to serve as the Director of the Georgetown University Observatory in 1888. There he continued his research and published numerous articles and texts. In mathematics, the Rothe‚ÄìHagen identity is named after him; it appears in his three-volume 1891 publication, Synopsis of Higher Mathematics. Vatican Observatory In 1906, John was called by Pope Pius X to take charge of the Vatican Observatory in Rome. He died in Rome in 1930.

The screenplay was written by Johnny Byrne; the director was Tom Clegg. Original titles were \\"Last of the Psychons\\"Exploring Space: 1999, McFarland & Company, Inc., 1997 and \\"Return of the Dorcons\\". The final shooting script is dated 17 November 1976. Live-action filming took place Tuesday 7 December 1976 through Thursday 23 December 1976.Destination: Moonbase Alpha, Telos Publications, 2010  Story  It is 2,409 days after leaving Earth orbit, and Moonbase Alpha is tracking an unidentified powered object following the Moon. Sensors detect no life forms and the craft is emitting an energy field highly sensitive to matter. The Alphans conclude the object to be a robot survey device. The object continues to close, the energy field making contact with the Moon surface. The instruments suddenly register a tremendous energy surge. As John Koenig orders defensive measures, the object projects a ray at Alpha that not only penetrates the defence screens but underground into Command Centre. As the light-beam appears in the room, all personnel are immobilised, with the exception of Maya. The ray's first action is to short-out the Main Computer input terminal. It then roams the room, briefly pausing on each person's face. When it encounters Maya, it focuses on her and the Psychon woman experiences horrible pain. With an agonised shriek, she collapses. Its goal achieved, the light disappears and the others are released from their paralysis. As attempts to contact the inert survey device fail, technicians examining Computer discover damage to its data-bank. Helena Russell tends to the unconscious Maya; her preliminary diagnosis is shock due to neurological trauma. To everyone's relief, Maya soon comes to. She tells them the ray was a mind-probe; after singling her out, it intensified and almost tore her mind apart. Concerned, Koenig questions the doctor about the possibility of brain damage. Sensors detect activity from the alien object‚Äîit is losing molecular cohesion, transforming into a gaseous mass of raw matter. As they watch, the mass expands and solidifies, becoming an impressive spacecraft. Maya is terrified at the sight of it, sobbing that the light was a Dorcon probe and that the ship is after her. She explains the Dorcons are the most powerful race in this galaxy and her people's most feared enemy. A scan of the vessel reveals a meson converter, a power system that can convert matter to energy, restructure it into any form and shift it through space instantaneously. Maya is right, aboard the Dorcon capital ship, a heated discussion over the best means to catch the Psychon is under way. In the presence of the Imperial Archon, supreme ruler of the Federated Worlds of Dorcon, His Excellency Malic‚Äîthe Archon's unstable nephew and heir apparent‚Äîproposes an armed invasion of the alien base to capture her. The Archon's chief advisor, Consul Varda, disagrees, arguing the Psychon might be killed in such a campaign. Knowing Maya's death would suit his ambitious nephew's desire to ascend to the throne, the Archon supports Varda's recommendation to employ diplomatic methods. Maya relates that, with their technology, the Dorcons can control of all the forces of nature except death. They have hunted her people for centuries as, through Psychons, they can achieve immortality. Her tale is interrupted by a signal from the Dorcon ship. It is Varda, presenting her credentials; Koenig is angered by the attack on Maya and the Dorcon woman offers a gracious apology. Varda officially requests, in the name of the Imperial Archon, that Maya be delivered into her custody. Koenig declines but a hysterical Maya warns him \\"Resistance is futile\\". Varda's final words are to heed the Psychon‚ÄîKoenig may be willing to die for his principles but is everyone on Alpha equally inclined? Alpha is at red alert; combat Eagles rise on the launch pads, laser batteries are deployed, non-combatants move to underground shelters and security forces guard the airlock stations. As they wait, Koenig asks Maya to explain how her people provide Dorcons with immortality. She informs him Dorcons do not die in the manner of most humanoid races: their brain-stems cease to function at an advanced age. They discovered Psychons possess brain-stems with regenerative properties that can last forever. If a Psychon brain-stem is surgically grafted to a Dorcon brain, the result is virtual immortality. On the Dorcon ship, Malic and Varda bicker over her failure. Outraged, the Archon silences them, then orders Varda to obtain the Psychon at any cost. The Dorcon crew selects targets for the assault and with reluctance, Varda gives the order to fire. A fusillade of energy bolts lay waste to perimeter buildings of the Alpha installation. Alpha's main batteries return fire but the laser beams bounce off the Dorcon ship's hull. The next Dorcon volley destroys the gun emplacements. Alan Carter's combat Eagle group lifts-off and converges on the alien battleship. Their weapons are also ineffective and they withdraw, though not before Eagle Four is picked off by Dorcon fire. As the bombardment continues, two hysterical operatives demand Koenig turn over Maya, one threatening him with a stun-gun. The man is disarmed but a desperate Maya pleads with Helena to use the weapon to kill her‚Äîif taken, the surgery will leave her nothing more than a living husk. The doctor briefly considers euthanising Maya but is unable to fire and passes the gun to Koenig. Pressing it to Maya's temple, he contacts Varda. Unless the attack is cancelled immediately, he will kill the last of the Psychons. Varda cannot risk calling his bluff and ceases fire. Moving fast, the Dorcons activate the meson converter. Varda and her personal guard transport into Command Centre. When the Dorcon stormtroopers effortlessly subdue all resistance, Koenig is forced to surrender. Maya is nowhere in sight (having disguised herself in the form of a co-worker) and Varda resorts to using the mind-probe ray to flush her out. They take the metamorph into custody and depart. Koenig leaps into the active transporter beam, arrives on the ship and is stunned on sight. The Archon is on hand to congratulate Varda on the success of her mission. He orders Maya taken to the medical unit, where she is placed under a paralysing beam while the Imperial surgeon prepares for the brain-stem transfer. The Archon orders Koenig killed but a guilty Varda persuades the ruler to spare his life. As the Archon withdraws, the Commander is secured in a force-field until the meson converter's antimatter coils recharge; the attack has temporarily drained its power. Malic approaches Varda with a sly proposal: allow his uncle to die and when he is named Archon, she may have anything she desires. The Consul's reply is blunt. The Archon fosters peace and stability, while Malic's ambitions will plunge the empire into war and misery. Now that Malic has shown his treasonous intent, she bars him from the Archon's presence. Returning to the operations area, she finds Koenig conscious and hostile. Varda reasons the security of thousands of worlds outweighs the life of one Psychon. He asks if this justification is for his benefit‚Äîor her own? The medical officer interrupts, stating she is ready for surgery. Varda leaves, ordering Koenig be transported when the converter is recharged. He resists and makes a break for the door‚Äîto be stopped by an armed Malic. Koenig is amazed when the Dorcon aristocrat shoots his own men, more so when he allows the Commander to go free. Once Koenig is out of sight, the scheming youth raises the alarm. Unaware of this intrigue, Varda escorts the Archon to the surgical transfer unit. Looking down at Maya, he reflects on who is the greater victim: she, destined to living death or he to eternal life. Unfamiliar with the layout of the vast Dorcon ship, Koenig has difficulty evading the stormtroopers. When the Commander is cornered, Malic again appears to shoot his own soldier. Koenig is suspicious but Malic taunts him with Maya's impending fate and directs him to the surgical area. Malic contacts Varda, telling her the escaped alien commander has gone berserk, killing soldiers in his search for her. Varda leaves the Archon unattended to lead the hunt for Koenig as Malic planned. Koenig's trail is soon picked up by Varda and her troops. When trapped in a blind alley with pursuers just around the corner, he pulls open a grille and hides in a ventilation duct. He realises the ducts will make travelling easier and he crawls off in search of Maya. Malic enters the surgical unit and shoots the medical officer. After waking his uncle to gloat on the end of his reign, he activates a surgical instrument that projects an intense energy beam on the Archon's forehead. The sociopathic youth enjoys watching his uncle beg for mercy as the beam slowly fries his brain. After the Archon expires, Malic releases Maya from her paralysis (intending to hide her until he can make use of her himself). Just then, Koenig jumps out of the air vent; in a scuffle, Maya transforms into a lizard beast to subdue Malic. After they leave in search of the transporter, the Dorcon heir recovers and announces the death of the Archon. As the new Archon, he orders the human murderer to be killed on sight‚Äîbut his Psychon accomplice must be captured alive. He removes the badge of office from his uncle and places the medallion around his own neck, mocking the corpse with a sarcastic salute. Arriving at the operations room, the Alphans are confronted by a vengeful Varda. She pledges to kill them and everyone on Alpha for their heinous crime. Malic enters to observe the execution. Koenig identifies the real murderer‚Äîthe new Archon, who decoyed Varda away so he could assassinate their leader. As the truth dawns on Varda, Malic orders the Consul placed under arrest. An enraged Varda attacks the youth, who shoots her. Her dying move is to fire her own weapon at the meson converter, intentionally damaging the magnetic shield to expose the antimatter coils. With the ship disintegrating around them, the Alphans jump into the transporter beam and return home. The insane Malic hysterically shouts for the converter to obey its Archon as the ship blows apart with a blast that seems to set space itself ablaze. On Alpha, repairs are well in hand and all casualties off the critical list. Resting after their ordeal, Koenig reflects that, all things considered, Consul Varda was quite a woman. Helena suggests taking care of Koenig's bandaged hands, and he asks if they should do that in his quarters or hers. She seductively says \\"medical center\\" and the two share a gentle laugh. Tony Verdeschi jokingly asks Maya if there is anything else in her Psychon past they should know about. With an air of mock pretension, she replies that is a highly improper question to ask any lady.

Production Notes  * The episode carried the working title \\"Return of the Dorcons\\" on a shooting script dated 19 October 1976. With much of the same scene structure and dialogue, several differences exist: (1) The script notes the title 'Archon' should be pronounced the same as 'march on' to avoid confusion with the episode title \\"The Mark of Archanon\\"; (2) Helena is relegated to the underground shelters with her patients before the attack and is not seen until the epilogue; (3) Maya transforms into a potted plant to hide from Varda and threatens to shoot herself with Verdeschi's gun when outed. Koenig talks her out of committing suicide; (4) A different epilogue was scripted where the six regular characters relax in Koenig's quarters. The question of her Psychon past caused Maya to recollect an encounter with a handsome Psychon boy during a holiday to her planet's Southern Flora Region. Jealous, Verdeschi sweeps her off her feet and out of the room. When left alone, Koenig and Helena reflect that 'What's in the past has gone...fate has played us some strange hands but we've won through in the end. As for the future...that starts right here and now,' and would close the scene with a kiss.\\"Return of the Dorcons\\" shooting script dated 19 October 1976 (This seems to acknowledge the staff's awareness this would be the programme's final installment.) * Many of the changes from the above version of the script would be motivated by the budgetary restrictions of this being the series' last episode. Scenes set in Medical Centre and Koenig's quarters would take place in Command Centre in the re-write. The scene showing Helena in an underground shelter was cut. Carter would have been shown coordinating Bill Fraser and the Eagle attack force on the Dorcon ship from Command; in the final draft, Fraser went unmentioned, and Carter himself was seen via TV monitor in the pilot's seat, leading the strike. The Dorcon vessel's sets were constructed out of pre-existing flats and set-dressings from previous episodes. Attentive viewers would recognise actor Laurence Harrington (playing Stewart) from his previous role as Tom Jackson in \\"Journey to Where\\". * This installment would fulfill first-season script editor Johnny Byrne's three-script commitment to producer Fred Freiberger. After seeing his scripts \\"The Biological Soul\\" and \\"The Face of Eden\\" (later \\"The Metamorph\\" and \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\") extensively re-worked (for the worse by his reckoning) for new series format, he gave the man a 'Freddie Freiberger/Johnny Byrne' action adventure story which would revolve around Maya, but done in such a way she would be rendered helpless. Tired of Maya being used to get out of every perilous situation, he created a race that hunted Psychons‚Äîas they would be able to control them. * Byrne would have preferred Freiberger to use his script \\"Children of the Gods\\" as the series finale. In it, the Alphans are terrorised by a pair of sociopathic children with formidable mental powers. The children are revealed to be their distant descendants, brought back in time by an alien race. The aliens have caused these children to be raised alone, without any human contact, to prove that Mankind is inherently amoral. They intend to destroy Alpha in the present to prevent the birth of these future Alphans.

Early life She was born in Chaibasa, Bihar in 1952 to a local coal-mine owner and had a privileged upbringing. She was educated at Loreto Convent School ‚Äì a premier Catholic School in the nearby city of Jamshedpur, before leaving India to continue her studies at Barnard College, New York City. Personal life She was briefly married and was divorced, after which she moved to Calcutta where she was wooed by a succession of men, allegedly rejecting an Indian Army Officer because of \\"the Punjabi accent\\" of his spoken English. She ultimately remarried a tea-plantation owner of Tibetan origin and moved to an estate high above Darjeeling in the embattled north-eastern state of Assam. She ran a hotel there and authored three novels: Daughters of the House, Cranes' Morning (1993) and Hold My Hand, I'm Dying, the last being published posthumouslySee: Khushwant Singh, Women and Men in my Life, 1995.

She mailed her first novel to him chapter-by-chapter, and he mentioned her to David Davidar, head of Penguin Books in India. Plagiarism scandal Soon after its publication, it became clear that her second novel, Cranes' Morning, had been plagiarised from The Rosemary Tree by the English novelist Elizabeth Goudge, which had been published in London by Hodder & Stoughton in 1956. Molly Moore of the Washington Post Foreign Service wrote: \\"Aikath-Gyaltsen recast the setting to an Indian village, changing the names and switching the religion to Hindu but often keeping the story word-for-word the same\\". When the plagiarism was uncovered, Crane's Morning had been published by Penguin Books in India and Ballantine Books in the U.S. but not yet in the UK. Suicide She died after consuming sodium phosphate (rat poison) in 1994 not long after the plagiarism was discovered. She had come back to her father's ancestral house where she was engaged in a contentious battle over property and assets against her own mother and sister, from whom she was estranged.

He was also Minister of Royal Court, President of Pahlavi University and Governor of Sistan and Baluchestan Provinces. Early life Alam was born on 24 July 1919 in Birjand and was educated at a British school in Iran. By a royal order from Reza Shah, Alam married Malektaj, the daughter of Qavam Al-Molk Shirazi. The son of Qavam ol-molk was then married to a sister of the Shah, Ashraf Pahlavi. Shortly after deposing the Qajar dynasty, Reza Shah intended to unite Iran's non-Qajar nobility through inter-marriage. At the age of 26, he was appointed governor of Sistan and Baluchistan provinces. At the age of 29, he became Minister of Agriculture in the cabinet of Mohammad Sa'ed. He early displayed what an American acquaintance describes as a combination of native toughness and Y.M.C.A. dedication.- The Reformer's Lot, Time (magazine), Friday, 27 July 1962 Assadollah Alam became the main landowner of Birjand after his father's death. He was one of Iran's first big landowners to distribute his holdings to the peasants, insisting that his servants eat the same food as his family. Once, when a would-be assassin was nabbed outside his door, Alam gave the man $40, then had him thrashed and sent into the street without his pants. Amir Asadollah Alam was the longest serving minister of the Pahlavi era. The title \\"Amir\\" (also transliterated \\"emir\\") is Arabic for ruler or governor. The name Alam means a banner or a flag in Arabic. Alam's father Amir Ebrahim Alam (AKA Shokat ol-molk) was the governor of the region of Qa'enaat. In the era of Reza Shah Pahlavi he was the minister of telecommunications. Prime ministership legislative election of 1961 In 1953, Alam helped organize the coup (also known as the CIA and MI6 backed Operation Ajax) that overthrew Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh.CIA finally admits it masterminded Iran's 1953 coup RT News Alam was subsequently made the director of the Pahlavi Foundation, a charitable trust worth at least $133 million, set up by the Shah to finance social-welfare plans out of the profits from royal holdings in banks, industries, hotels. In 1962, he became Prime Minister at the age of 43. As prime minister, Assadollah Alam pledged to undertake \\"an anticorruption campaign with great diligence and all severity.\\" Though the cynical snickered, Alam got free rein from the Shah, and carefully began building airtight cases against suspected grafters among Iran's leading bureaucrats and government leaders. His first major target was General Mohammed Ali Khazai, the Iranian army's chief of ordnance, who had parlayed his $6,000 salary into three houses in the suburbs of Tehran, four apartment houses in France, five automobiles, $100,000 in European banks and $200,000 in cash. A military court convicted Khazai of taking a cut out of government contracts and sentenced him to five years of solitary confinement.- No Longer for the Corrupt, Time (magazine), 24 May 1963 In May 1963, Alam's anti-corruption drive was in full swing. In Tehran, a military tribunal sentenced General Abdullah Hedayat, Iran's first four-star general and once a close advisor of the Shah, to two years in prison for embezzling money on military housing contracts, brushed aside his plea for appeal with the brusque explanation that \\"more charges are pending.\\" The former boss of the Tehran Electricity Board was in solitary confinement for five years; cases were in preparation against an ex-War Minister and twelve other generals for graft. Alam (second from left) with Queen Soraya Esfandiari Riots of 1963 The most important event in Alam's premiership were the riots that took place in June 1963 in response to some of the reforms enforced by the Shah and Alam. It was the clerics who triggered the riots during the Muharram holy days. As the faithful jammed the mosques, the clerics assailed \\"illegal\\" Cabinet decisions and urged their followers to \\"protect your religion.\\" Small-scale riots quickly broke out in the clerical capital of Qum, led by the Rouhollah Khomeini, and in several other cities. Police struck back, arrested Khomeini and some 15 other ringleaders. With that, both sides declared open war and the battle was on.- Progress at a Price, Time (magazine), Friday, 14 June 1963 Screaming \\"Down with the Shah,\\" 10,000 people, swept through the capital, carrying pictures of Khomeini. Though the whereabouts of the Shah was kept secret, rows of white-helmeted troops, backed by tanks, immediately sealed off access to royal palaces in the city and suburbs. In the heart of town green, they fired for 40 minutes. When the mobs entered government buildings, the troops opened up at point-blank range. The crowd fell back in confusion, regrouped, and raced down main avenues. Nearly 7,000 troops were called out by Alam's government to restore peace, albeit an uneasy one, in Tehran; by then damage was estimated in the millions, at least 1,000 were injured, and the officially reported death toll was 86. It was undoubtedly higher, but since the public cemetery was closed and under heavy guard to prevent further clashes at the gravesides, the real number remained unknown. In his memoirs, Alam notes the number of the dead to be about 200, saying that he immediately arranged for their families to receive a pension from the government.[- Yaddasht-haye Amir Assadollah-e Alam], Bethesda, 2003 For the first time in a decade, martial law was imposed on the city, along with a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Hoping to preserve quiet for a while, Alam also announced that troops would remain on emergency duty. Their orders: shoot to kill. Minister of the royal court Alam speaking with Mohammad-Reza Shah In 1964, he was appointed as Chancellor of Shiraz University and served host to the King of Belgium in his visit to Fars Province a few years later. Afterwards he was the minister of court for many years, beginning in December 1966. Furthermore, he was the head of the Pahlavi Foundation and bursar. He was also a supporter of the campaign of Richard Nixon, during the United States presidential elections. As the minister of the royal court he was the closest man to the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who now ran the country autocratically. Therefore, Alam became the channel through which most of the daily affairs of the country passed. Alam's memoirs, published posthumously, are exceptionally detailed documents on the life and the deeds of the Shah as perceived by an insider. List of positions held As written by Alam himself in his memoirs[- Yaddasht-haye Amir Assadollah-e Alam],, edited by Alinaqi Alikhani, Vol. 2, P. 398 .,Bethesda, 2003 in 1972. # Manager of Imam Reza's shrine in Mashad, AKA \\"Aastaan-e Qods-e Razavi\\" # The Shah's inspector of all universities # Chairman of the board of trustees of the Pahlavi University # Chairman of the board of trustees of the Aryamehr University # Chairman of the board of trustees of the Pars school for higher education (Madreseye Aalyi-e Pars) # The shah's special liaison with foreign ambassadors (for issues too confidential to pass through the foreign ministry) # Head of the board of trustees of the Mashad University # Indispensable member of the board of trustees of the University of Tehran # Indispensable member of the board of trustees of the University of Tabriz # Chairman of the Royal horse institute (The crown prince Reza Pahlavi was the honorary head) # Chairman of the royal institute of the rural culture houses (The crown prince Reza Pahlavi was the honorary head) # Chairman of the National Scouts committee # Head of \\"Kaanun-e Kaar\\" (Labor institute) # Deputy chairman of the Imperial Organization of Social Services (Princess Ashraf Pahlavi was the head) # Deputy chairman of the Red Lion and Sun Society (Princess Shams Pahlavi was the head) # Chairman of the Council for support of mothers and infants # Deputy chairman of the Kaanun-e Parvaresh-e Fekri-e Kudakaan va nojavaanaan (Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults).

That company then runs the risk of being sued for patent infringement. In this case, it is prudent for said company to commission a clearance opinion to at least show that they were diligent in making sure that they did not infringe the issued patent. If the opinion finds that the company is indeed infringing the patent, then the company can: *modify its products or processes so that they don't infringe (designing around), *seek a license from the patent holder, or *see if they can find evidence that the patent is not valid. A company might carry out a prior art search to determine if there is any prior art that would invalidate the patent that the patent office had not previously considered. If said prior art is discovered, the company may bring an opposition proceeding, or request a reexamination to have the patent declared invalid. Opposition proceedings are available in Europe and Japan. Reexaminations are available in the U.S. In the US, a company may also bring a lawsuit in Federal Court to have the patent declared invalid.

The Cullars Rotation experiment, which started in 1911, is the oldest ongoing cotton fertility experiment in the United States, the oldest soil fertility experiment in the Southern United States, and the second oldest continuous cotton experiment in the world. History In the late 19th century, the land on which the Cullars Rotation sits was used in a number of agricultural experiments, including one that established the disease cotton rust was caused by a deficiency of potassium. In 1911, the Alabama Legislature set aside money for an experiment to study the long-term effects of fertilization on a three-year rotation of cotton, corn, and wheat and soybeans. The Cullars site was chosen for this study and the experiment has continued unabated since. See also: In 1938, the site was purchased by the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, which administered the study. In 2001, the portion of the Cullars site not occupied by the Cullars Rotation was landscaped as the grounds of the Jule Collins Smith Museum of Fine Art; however, a 40-foot buffer is maintained between the museum grounds and the rotation to ensure experimental integrity. Experiment The Cullars Rotation consists of three sets of 14 soil treatments, with one set of treatments for each of the three crops (cotton, corn, and wheat and soybeans) in the rotation. Each treatment fills a roughly 2000 square foot (184 m¬≤) plot, with a two-foot (60 cm) buffer between plots. The 14 soil treatments are: # Legumes planted, but no nitrogen fertilizer # No legumes or nitrogen fertilizer # Nothing added to soil # Nitrogen fertilizer added, but no winter legumes # No phosphorus added # No micronutrients added # Excess potassium added # Rock phosphate added # No potassium added # Two-thirds of regular amount of potassium added # No lime added # No sulfur added # Complete fertilization with micronutrients # One-third of regular amount of potassium added Continuous farming of the plots which have not been given treatments have made certain sections of the Cullars Rotation some of the most nutrient poor soil in the United States. Miscellaneous The Cullars Rotation is located east of the grounds of the Jule Collins Smith Museum of Fine Art at the corner of College Street and Woodfield Drive in Auburn. As an ongoing experiment, the Rotation is not open to the public, but can be viewed from the museum grounds. The Rotation was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 18, 2003.

Scott Washington first appeared in The New Warriors #21 (March 1992) by writer Fabian Nicieza and penciller Mark Bagley. The Hybrid symbiote first appeared in Venom: Along Came A Spider #1 (January 1996) by writer Evan Skolnick and penciller Patrick Zircher. Publication history Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and penciller Mark Bagley, Scott Washington appears in The New Warriors #21 (March 1992), #25-26 and #36. In 1996, he is the main character Hybrid in the back-up stories in two miniseries Venom: Along Came a Spider and Venom: The Hunted, all written by Evan Skolnick. In 2007, he is mentioned in Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1. Hybrid is also mentioned at the conclusion of the first issue of Carnage U.S.A. (2011), along with Venom, Anti-Venom, Toxin, and Scorn, as being the next option to stop Carnage's rampage in the Mid-west after the Avengers are defeated.Carnage U.S.A. #1Carnage U.S.A., Marvel.com He has an entry in All- New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #5 - 'Gorgon to Jury' (2006) and an entry in Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z HC vol. 05 - 'Guardsmen to Jackal (Warren)' (2008). Fictional character biography Scott Washington was an African-American Guardsman involved in guarding and transporting Justice who had been arrested and sentenced to the Vault prison for supervillains.New Warriors #21 The Hybrid symbiote is an amalgamation of four symbiotes (Riot, Phage, Lasher and Agony) into a single symbiote entity. The fused symbiote then sought out Washington in the Vault's lab facility. While guarding the symbiotes, Scott realized that they were not evil, not a threat, and the experiments were causing the organism terrible pain, so he let it go.Evan Skolnick (w), Patrick Zircher (p), Greg Adams (i), \\"First Touch\\", Venom: Along Came a Spider #1 When his superiors discovered that Scott had released the aliens he was supposed to guard, Scott was fired. He returned to the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, the gang-torn neighborhood in which he grew up. Following a basketball court scuffle with the Eazy X gang, Scott and his brother Derek were shot: Derek was killed while Scott became crippled, losing the use of his legs.Evan Skolnick (w), Patrick Zircher (p), Greg Adams (i), \\"Fusion\\", Venom: Along Came a Spider #2 The Hybrid symbiote afterwards located and bonded with Scott, which resulted in Scott regaining the ability to walk, and more since Scott has a lot of anger, so often the symbiotes hold him back from acts of violence, not the other way around. Since the Hybrid symbiote was originally four different entities, Scott has to contend with four different voices/personalities in his head besides his own. As Hybrid, Scott got revenge on the Eazy Xs gang that had crippled him.Venom: Along Came a Spider #3-4 Hybrid began to get a lot of press attention. While most of Hybrid's publicity was positive, The Jury's attention got drawn anyway. Despite Scott and Curtis Elkins (Sentry) being former co-workers, Hybrid would've been executed by these self-appointed guardians of justice just for being a symbiote host but was rescued by the New Warriors. Justice offered membership in the group but Scott declined, citing more important work to do in his home neighborhood.Venom: The Hunted #1-3 Scott Washington was considered as a \\"potential recruit\\" for the Initiative program. Scott is hunted down and murdered by Eddie Brock as part of a goal to eliminate the symbiotes' \\"evil\\" from Earth.Venom (2011) #15 The Hybrid symbiote is later separated into the four symbiotes by a clandestine military group to be used by the U.S. Government.Carnage U.S.A. #2-5 Powers and abilities Like Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote, Hybrid has wall-crawling and web-slinging abilities, and can form pseudopodia or tendrils to create snares and bladed weapons. Hybrid also has the ability to camouflage, such as its ability to mimic clothes on the person it has bonded with. It also has a border-line warning sense and can \\"see\\" through symbiote itself. Hybrid can also detach a piece of itself to send messages to allies, and can change shape to form a membrane that allows it to glide through the air. The Hybrid symbiote can also absorb various materials and chemicals, such as Spider-Man's synthetic webbing. Like the Venom and Carnage symbiotes, the Hybrid symbiote has superhuman strength. With Scott Washington as its host, he regained his ability to walk which he had lost during a gang fight. After Washington's death and being forcibly separated, the symbiotes became catatonic and no longer retain sentience.

She travels to Japan in order to find a professor said to have rare footage of the massacre detailing an event that she could not otherwise prove occurred.

It is the largest noctuid in the continental United States. In the folklore of many Central American cultures, it is associated with death or misfortune. Physical description Female moths can attain a wingspan of 17 cm. The dorsal surfaces of their wings are mottled brown with hints of iridescent purple and pink, and, in females, crossed by a white bar. The diagnostic marking is a small spot on each forewing shaped like a number nine or a comma. This spot is often green with orange highlights. Males are somewhat smaller, reaching 12 cm in width, darker in color and lacking the white bar crossing the wings. The larva is a large caterpillar up to 7 cm in length with intricate patterns of black and greenish-brown spots and stripes. Geographical range The black witch lives from the southern United States, Mexico and Central America to as south as Buenos Aires province in Argentina.Janzen, D. H. (Ed.). (1983). Costa Rican Natural History. Chicago: Univ. Chicago Press. Adults feed on overripe rainforest fruit, especially bananas, and larvae consume the leaves of plants. Most of its host plants are legumes. It favors Acacia species, Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus), and candle bush (Senna alata). It attacks mesquite and ficus, and can be an agricultural pest. The black witch flies north during late spring and summer, as far as Hawaii. One was caught during an owl banding project at the Whitefish Point lighthouse on the shoreline of Lake Superior in July 2020. Folklore and mythology The black witch is considered a harbinger of death in Mexican and Caribbean folklore. In many cultures, one of these moths flying into the house is considered bad luck: e.g., in Mexico, when there is sickness in a house and this moth enters, it is believed the sick person will die, though a variation on this theme (in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas) is that death only occurs if the moth flies in and visits all four corners of one's house (in Mesoamerica, from the pre- Hispanic era until the present time, moths have been associated with death and the number four). In some parts of Mexico, people joke that if one flies over someone's head, the person will lose his hair. In Jamaica, under the name duppy bat, the black witch is seen as the embodiment of a lost soul or a soul not at rest. In Jamaican English, the word duppy is associated with malevolent spirits returning to inflict harm upon the livingFrederic Gomes Cassidy, Robert Brock Le Page, A Dictionary of Jamaican English Page 164, University of the West Indies press, 2002 Accessed via GoogleBooks September 5, 2008 and bat refers to anything other than a bird that flies.John Holmes Agnew, Walter Hilliard Bidwell, The Eclectic Magazine Leavitt, Trow & Co., 1844 Page 128, Original from the University of Michigan Digitized Sep 6, 2005 Accessed via GoogleBooks September 7, 2008Frederic Gomes Cassidy, Robert Brock Le Page, A Dictionary of Jamaican English Page 32, University of the West Indies press, 2002 Accessed via GoogleBooks September 5, 2008 The word \\"duppy\\" (also: \\"duppie\\") is also used in other West Indian countries, generally meaning \\"ghost\\". In Hawaii, black witch mythology, though associated with death, has a happier note in that if a loved one has just died, the moth is an embodiment of the person's soul returning to say goodbye. In the Bahamas, where they are locally known as money moths or money bats, the legend is that if they land on you, you will come into money, and similarly, in South Texas, if a black witch lands above your door and stays there for a while, you will supposedly win the lottery. The Black Witch Moth: Its Natural & Cultural History, by Mike Quinn In Paraguay, people are afraid of the black witch, as there is a mistaken belief about the moth urinating over their human \\"victims\\" and thereby inoculating their eggs, which then develop into maggots developing under the skin. Some also believe, if it touches your eyes, you can go blind. The maggots referred to are the myiasis-causing larvae of the human botfly (Dermatobia hominis). As a consequence of that belief, both the moth and the maggot are called with the common name \\"ura\\". Both the name and folk belief are of unknown origin. In Spanish, the black witch is known as \\"mariposa de la muerte\\" (Mexico and Costa Rica),Daniel H.

Faure's improvements greatly increased the capacity of such batteries and led directly to their manufacture on an industrial scale. The patents were assigned to the Soci√©t√© La Force et la Lumi√®re. The right to use these patents in the British Isles were sold to the Faure Electric Accumulator Company on 29 March 1881. Faure was a consultant engineer with William Edward Ayrton for this company. Biography He was born at Vizille and trained at the Ecole des Arts et M√©tiers at Aix.Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology / ed. by Lance Day and Ian McNeil. London; New York: Routledge, 1996 From 1874 until about 1880, he worked as a chemist at the new factory of the Cotton Powder Company at Uplees, Faversham, Kent, England.Breeze, John (2008), Faversham Explosives Personnel Register 1841-1934, Part 1, Faversham Society, While there, he and the factory manager, George Trench, took out patents for Tonite (a new high explosive) (1874), and an improved dynamite detonator (1878).Patent Nos 106148 and 125752: copies in Bibliotheque Nationale de France In 1880, Faure patented a method of coating lead plates with a paste of lead oxides, sulphuric acid and water, which was then cured by being gently warmed in a humid atmosphere. The curing process caused the paste to change to a mixture of lead sulphates which adhered to the lead plate. During charging the cured paste was converted into electrochemically active material (the \\"active mass\\") and gave a substantial increase in capacity compared with Plant√©'s battery. This was a significant breakthrough that led to the industrial manufacture of lead-acid batteries, as now used for starting motor cars. Towards the end of his life Faure was granted further patents,Swiss Patent Nos 3698 (1891) and 3855 (1891) and UK Patent Nos 15152 (1894), 11341 (1896), 11342 (1896), and 21587 (1896) among them ones for the manufacture of aluminium alloys and improvements to hot air engines and motor vehicle steering mechanisms.

He served during the White Revolution of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and was assassinated by a member of the Fadayan-e Islam. Early life and education  Hassan Ali was born in Tehran on 13 April 1923 https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=148667202 to Prime Minister Ali Mansur (Mansour-al- Molk) and daughter of Zahir-ol-Molk Raiss. He received primary education in Tehran and graduated from Firooz-Bahram High School. During the World War II era, he entered Law School at the University of Tehran and graduated with a degree in political science.  Career  In the post World War II era, Mansour started his political career by entering the foreign ministry and completed several internal and foreign assignments including tours of Germany and France. In the 1950s, this thirty-year-old was twice appointed chief of prime minister's office, first for a brief period because of change in government, and second lasted for 2 years. In 1957, prime minister Manuchehr Eghbal appointed him as chairman of the economics council and vice prime minister. He also held the positions of minister of labor, and minister of trade. Prime minister Asadollah Alam appointed him as chairman of \\"Bimeh Iran\\" insurance company. The Progressive Party or \\"Kanoon Motaraghion\\" was founded by Mansour to conduct economic policy research as well as the launching pad for his future prime ministership. In 1962 Mansour ran for the 21st Majlis and was elected as the second representative from Tehran, after Abdollah Riazi, speaker of the Majlis. A few dozen of his party members were also elected to Majlis, with the exception of Hoveyda and Kashefian who were more interested in executive branch. Mansour then expanded his power base by forming a coalition and founded \\"IRAN NOVIN\\" party with a majority of 175 out of 230 deputies, and was elected the Majority Leader of Parliament. Cabinet of Mansur After Alam resigned his premiership in 1963, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi appointed Mansur prime minister. He introduced many young new faces, such as Amir Abbas Hoveyda, Jamshid Amuzegar, Ataollah Khosravani, Nahavandi, Alinaghi Alikhani, Manouchehr Rohani, and many other Iran Novin members. Since most of his cabinet were young and American/European educated, Mansour had pro-American tendencies in his politics and enjoyed the support of American government. Clearly the Shah now felt more comfortable working with people from his own generation than older generation who also served his father and called him \\"Shah Javan\\" or the \\"Young Shah\\". The torch was passed from the old war heroes to younger educated technocrats to carry out the \\"White Revolution\\" and an explosive decade of growth. Mansur passed the Geneva Convention American Force Protection Act, also known as the highly controversial Capitulation Law. This led to a fiery attack by Ayatollah Khomeini from Qom, and resulted in his historical exile to Turkey, and many subsequent riots. Mansur also raised the price of gasoline from 5 to 10 Rials to meet budget deficits, but later retreated after strikes by taxi drivers. Personal life Mansur was briefly engaged to Noushie Teymourtash, but subsequently married Farideh Emami. He was survived by a son, the jazz guitarist Ahmad Mansur (1960‚Äì2011) and a daughter, the journalist Fati Mansur (1964). Farideh's sister Leyla Emami, later married prime minister Amir Abbas Hoveyda. Javad Mansur, his brother, also served as a consultant to prime minister Hoveyda. His sister Touran was briefly engaged to Fereydoun Hoveyda but subsequently married Manouchehr Teymourtash.  Assassination  At 10am on 21 January 1965,Chicago Tribune, January 22, 1965, p1A-11 a few days before the first anniversary of the White Revolution, Mansour was entering the gates of Majlis to present his first State-of-the- Union speech. After he stepped out of his car in Baharestan Square, he was shot three times by 17-year-old Mohammad Bokharaei, a member of Fada'iyan-e Islam. Bokharaei was later executed, along with three others implicated in the assassination ‚Äì Reza Saffar Harandi, Haaj Sadegh Amani, and Morteza Niknejad. Mansour was put back into the car and rushed to the hospital, where he remained in critical condition for 5 days before he finally died. During the crisis, the Shah quickly appointed Mansur's friend, Amir-Abbas Hoveida as the acting prime minister, in which role he continued for the next thirteen years. Mansour's assassination occurred a few years after the assassination of prime minister Ali Razmara. Mansour was buried in \\"Shah-Abdol-Azim\\" near Reza Shah's mausoleum, and a Kennedy-like Black Granite Eternal Flame was constructed at his grave site. After the Islamic Revolution, the Mansur gravesite was destroyed by Ayatollah Khalkhali, and his remains were dug up and scattered.

Since 1984, IMEC has been led by Roger Van Overstraeten, Gilbert Declerck (as of June 1999), and Luc Van den Hove (as of July 2009). Merger with iMinds In February 2016, it was announced that IMEC would be merging with the Flemish digital research center, iMinds. The goal was to strengthen Flanders‚Äô international authority as a technology hub. Luc Van den hove lead the merger between IMEC and digital research center iMinds in 2016, intending to combine IMEC‚Äôs background in developing cutting-edge chip technology with iMinds‚Äô artificial intelligence and security expertise. Van den hove‚Äôs objective was \\"to turn IMEC into a unique and world-class research center to develop disruptive technologies and solutions in a broad range of application areas such as health, smart cities and mobility, logistics and manufacturing, energy, education and infotainment.\\" Van den hove also claimed that by combining iMinds‚Äô expertise in software, A.I. and ICT with the miniaturization power of chip technology would allow IMEC to offer ‚Äòtotal solutions‚Äô to virtually every industrial market. Philippe Muyters, the then Flemish Minister of Innovation, stated: ‚ÄúWhen [IMEC and iMinds] were founded, the line between hardware and software was still very clear. Today, and especially in the future, this line is increasingly blurring ‚Äì with technology, systems and applications being developed in close conjunction. The merger anticipates this trend and creates a high-tech research center for the digital economy that keeps Flanders on the world map.‚Äù The merger was finalized on September 21, 2016. Campus The IMEC campus in Leuven, Belgium consists of 24,400m¬≤ of office space, laboratories, training facilities, technical support rooms, and 2 cleanrooms which run a semi-industrial operation (24/7). There is a 300mm cleanroom (450mm ready) that focuses on R&D; towards (sub-)3 nm process technology and a 200mm cleanroom for R&D;, development-on-demand, prototyping and low volume manufacturing on more-than-Moore technologies (sensors, actuators, and MEMS, NEMS etc.). IMEC has, among others, a pilot line for silicon and organic solar cells, unique laboratories for bioelectronics research, and equipment for materials characterization and reliability testing. For research on technologies for the intuitive internet of things, IMEC has dedicated labs for sensor and imaging technologies, wireless connectivity. Research domains IMEC‚Äôs research covers various aspects of nanoelectronics such as advanced semiconductor scaling, low power sensing and actuating, radar and radio technology, and digital technologies including data and security expertise and AI. By setting up local and global ecosystems of partners across a multitude of industries, IMEC creates technology solutions enabling innovation in various domains, such as healthcare, smart cities and mobility, logistics and manufacturing, sustainable energy and smart education. Among its fields of expertise, IMEC lists: IMEC groups its work around smart mobility, smart health, smart industries, smart energy, smart cities, and smart education. Advanced Semiconductor Scaling IMEC is well-known for its expertise in shrinking circuitry to boost computing and memory power and for the applicability of nanotechnology in novel industries, extending Moore‚Äôs law. In 2015 The New York Times stated that IMEC has helped pioneer techniques to produce some of the world‚Äôs smallest and most sophisticated chips and the centre is considered to be a world-leader in nanoelectronics research. In 2018, IMEC‚Äôs CEO Luc van den hove claimed that IMEC‚Äôs research was present in virtually every modern-day chip. Quantum Computing, Supercomputing and Exascale Computing IMEC performs research on quantum computing, supercomputing and exascale computing. IMEC‚Äôs platform for CMOS processing is a unique basis for a quantum computer. It is one of the world‚Äôs most advanced platforms to scale CMOS technology beyond 5 nm technology. In 2018, IMEC CEO Luc Van den hove declared he was working on the creation of a quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and supercomputing hub. In 2019, IMEC reported it is working on a quantum cryptography program which aims to develop scalable, robust, and cost-effective quantum cryptographic systems secure against quantum-based threats, as research in quantum information science has indicated that large-scale quantum computers (when realized) will render most of today‚Äôs encryption techniques insecure. Energy IMEC performs research in smart energy, ranging from developing ways to actively and cost-effectively plan, deploy and manage smart grid networks up to improving the efficiency, production and storage cost of (solar) energy. Considerable advances have been made in solar cell and solid state battery technologies. Together with KU Leuven, VITO, and UHasselt, IMEC set up a separate R&D; hub to perform research into sustainable energy and intelligent energy systems. The project is named EnergyVille and employs 400 researchers whose work centers around six interdisciplinary domains: photovoltaics, electrical and thermal storage, power control and conversion, electrical and thermal networks, buildings and districts, strategies and markets. Artificial Intelligence IMEC performs advanced research on artificial intelligence and was awarded 750.000 USD twice in 2019 by DARPA in a machine-learning competition . In a 2017 report, The Financial Times named IMEC‚Äôs self-learning neuromorphic chip one of the fifty ideas that will change the world and was described by the newspaper as having the potential to revolutionize computing. Smart Cities In 2017, the Flemish government commissioned IMEC to support the 13 leading Flemish cities and the Flemish community in Brussels in their transition to becoming smart cities. IMEC was also commissioned by the Flemish government and the City of Antwerp to create Europe‚Äôs largest lab for Internet of Things applications. Image Sensors and Vision Systems IMEC works on developing advanced image sensors and vision systems. It claims to have unique expertise in the development of CMOS and photonics-based image sensors and integrated imaging vision systems with beyond standard solutions. Its research domains include industrial inspection, aerial photogrammetry, security, spectroscopy, medical fluorescence and astronomy. In 2019, the state of Florida declared a partnership with IMEC to develop hyperspectral technology that is able to better detect invasive Burmese and rock pythons, which have been permanently damaging the Everglades‚Äô eco-systems. Life Sciences In recent years, IMEC has expanded its activity into domains where researchers typically do not have processor expertise . One such area is the life sciences, where nanotechnology, supercomputers and machine learning are used to innovate blood tests, DNA sequencing, health monitoring and drug discovery. In 2016, when the merger between iMinds and IMEC was completed, Van den hove announced that one of IMEC‚Äôs top goals would be the advancement of the life sciences by combining biological research with chip technology and artificial intelligence. By doing so, Van den hove claimed he would drive scientific research on brain and neurodegenerative diseases whilst providing solutions for more effective diagnosis and treatments of diseases such as cancer and diabetes. =Genome Sequencing= IMEC uses supercomputing to accelerate the processing of entire genome sequences and to examine the use of computer simulations in its life sciences research. In 2019, IMEC stated that it created a unique platform that can perform a full genome analysis of 48 samples in only 48 hours and at an acceptable cost. The platform was reported to pave the way to genome sequencing as a daily practice in hospitals, for diagnosing and treating genetic diseases, including cancer and rare diseases, and for better treating newborns with complex disorders. =Neuropixel Technology= In 2017, IMEC designed and fabricated the world‚Äôs first miniature neural probe for simultaneous recording of multiple brain regions at neuronal resolution. The project was a collaboration with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute‚Äôs Janelia Research Campus, the Wellcome Trust, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and University College London. The performance of the Neuropixels probes and their potential for transformational neuroscience experiments was described in a November 9, 2017 paper published in Nature Scientific Reports. In 2019, The New York Times reported that IMEC's neuropixel technology is widely recognized as the most advanced method of gathering data from brain cells and Nobel prize winner John O'Keefe called the technology a giant step forwards for systems neuroscience. =Brain-On-Chip Research= In 2018, IMEC announced the creation of a research venture together with KU Leuven, UZ Leuven and VIB, called Mission Lucidity. The venture‚Äôs aim is to decode dementia. IMEC is creating human-specific living brain models, so called 'brains-on-chips‚Äô which automate and miniaturize human stem cell manipulations, and developing technology to generate programmable, instrumented 3D brain models with single-cell precision. The project was supported by a Collaborative Science Award of one million dollars by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. =Lab-On-Chip (NASA, Johns Hopkins University & miDiagnostics)= At the end of May 2015, IMEC and Johns Hopkins University announced the launch of a joint venture, miDiagnostics, which aimed at developing medical chips and diagnostic devices that will assist doctors and patients in getting quick diagnoses. Peter Peumans, in charge of IMEC‚Äôs life science technologies program, helped found miDiagnostics and was appointed CTO. In 2019, NASA awarded funding to miDiagnostics to test a technology for monitoring astronauts‚Äô health status under zero gravity conditions, with the aim of advancing space health diagnostics. =Wearables= IMEC develops wearable devices and other health monitoring technologies, such as EEG electrodes, implantable devices, and ingestible sensors. Its technologies have gained several approvals by regulatory agencies such as the FDA and PMDA and have made contributions to studies published in Nature . The clinical areas of IMEC‚Äôs monitoring technologies include: gait analysis, neurotechnology, ophthalmology, sleep monitoring technology, vital sign monitoring, and technology for respiratory care. Through its spinoff Bloomlife IMEC develops pregnancy monitoring technology that tracks fetal health and fetal mobility , with the aim of giving pregnant women and their doctors better access to key details about fetal development. Other applications include ingestible gut sensors designed to capture mechanical, electrical, and chemical changes that occur during digestion, flagging abnormalities and problems while also delivering personalized nutrition advice. Affiliated Partners IMEC works with many different partners, ranging from governments and governmental agencies such as NASA and DARPA, to industrial partners such as ASML, Sony, Intel and Samsung and universities such as Johns Hopkins University. IMEC has a network of over 600 partner companies. Venture Capital IMEC offers a business accelerator program, called imec.istart, through which it offers an initial financial injection (50,000 EUR pre-seed funding), professional coaching and mentoring, access to technology and working facilities, access to its network of partners and investors. Since its launch in 2011, imec.istart helped more than 198 tech start-ups in diverse fields, ranging from multimedia and logistics to the healthcare sector, to develop into sustainable ventures. In 2019, imec.istart was granted first place in the European ‚ÄòTop University Business Accelerators' ranking by UBI Global and was ranked fourth best in the world. As underfunding remains the main cause of failure of hardware startups in Europe, IMEC CEO Luc Van den hove raised $117 million in 2018 for the creation of imec.xpand, a venture capital fund that invests in innovative semiconductor and hardware research spinouts and startups.

The novel is based around the theme of pedophilia. It features her protagonist DI Jack Caffery.  Plot  A husband and wife are discovered imprisoned in their own home near Brockwell Park in South London. It is a hot summer and they are badly dehydrated, they've been bound and beaten, and the husband seems close to death. Rory Peach, their 8-year-old son, is missing. Detective Inspector (DI) Jack Caffery is one of the police team. The disappearance of the boy rekindles memories of his brother Ewan, who was abducted as a 9-year-old and never seen again. Caffery tries to find the boy at the same time as helping his girl friend cope with a sexual attack. He follows clues that might allow him to find out Ewan's fate. Patterns of child sexual abuse start to emerge, and Caffery tracks down a young man who was abused in the same park many years earlier as a child. The DI is convinced the attacker will be targeting another family. Rory's body is discovered, with evidence of sexual attack, but the DNA from semen is found to be that of Rory's father Alek. The case is turned on its head, and confusion is added when bite marks on the boy's shoulder do not match Alek's dental pattern. Caffery understands that Peach was forced to sodomise his son. Another family with a young boy, 8-year-old Josh, has been imprisoned. Caffery slowly pieces together the clues to find out who they are. He gets very close to discovering that his brother is still alive, having suffered brain damage at the hands of a child molester. He was a member of a paedophile ring, who managed children for abuse by adults and made child pornography videos.

It crosses the Thames on the reach between Cleeve Lock and Benson Lock. The bridge is long and has 19 arches.https://thames.me.uk/s01330.htm Since the construction of the southern Wallingford bypass in 1993, most traffic crossing the Thames at the town uses Winterbrook Bridge. History The first reference to a bridge across the Thames between Wallingford and Crowmarsh Gifford is from 1141, when King Stephen besieged Wallingford Castle. The first stone bridge is credited to Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, and four remaining arches are believed to contain 13th century elements. Major repairs used stone from the dissolved Holy Trinity Priory in 1530. Four arches were removed so a drawbridge could be inserted during the siege of the castle in the Civil War of 1646, and these were replaced with timber structures until repair in 1751. Following a flood, three arches were rebuilt by Richard Clarke from 1810‚Äì1812 to a design by John Treacher (1760‚Äì1836) developed in 1809, and a parapet and balustrade added. Bench marks There are three Ordnance Survey bench marks on the bridge. A cut mark over the centre of the river on the south parapet, another cut mark near the east end of the bridge on the north parapet and a flush bracket numbered 11 used during the second geodetic levelling of England and Wales close to the river bank on the south side of the bridge.

Romania's Queen Elisabeth knighted him after he sculpted a marble bust of her in the early 1900s. His student and first wife, Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson was a sculptor as well, and his brothers, John William Kitson, Samuel James Kitson, and Robert Lewellen Kitson, also had art careers in the United States. He is perhaps best known in the U.S. for his sculpture of the \\"Minute Man\\" on Lexington Green, in Lexington, Massachusetts. Life Harry, as he was known by his numerous brothers and sisters, migrated to the United States about 1877/8 where he apprenticed with his oldest brother John William Kitson. William Kitson was in business with another Englishman Robert Ellin; their firm, Ellin & Kitson, were identified as architectural sculptors. They specialized in interior carving and wood work in commercial structures and churches. Some buildings they worked on were the Equitable Building, the Tilden Mansion, the Astor Memorial Redos and the William K. Vanderbilt House. Harry and Samuel James Kitson the next oldest brother were both associated with Ellin & Kitson doing sculptural work. According to family oral history, William now quite successful encouraged and financially provided for Harry Kitson to move to Paris 1n 1882 where he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts under the sculptor Jean-Marie Bonnassieux and sculptor Dumont. Kitson also was enrolled in the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs studying under Millet and Ganter. He returned first in 1884/5 to NYC to his eldest brother William's business but in 1886 removed to Boston where his sculptor brother Sam had established a studio. Once there Kitson received numerous commissions and began teaching. His students included portrait sculptor Leila Usher. John William Kitson died in 1888 and Samuel James had returned to Boston after a stay in Washington, DC. The youngest brother, Robert Lewellen Kitson, a water- colorist, joined his older brothers in Boston about 1902. In 1893, Henry married Theo Alice Ruggles, a former student of his, who went on to have a successful career of her own as Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson. Theo and Harry had three children: Theo (called Babs), John, who became a civil engineer, and Dorothy. None of the children had issue. The noted sculptor Gaston Lachaise worked in his atelier. Many of Henry Hudson Kitson papers are in the Archives of American Art in Washington, D.C., as well as the New York Historical Society. Kitson only carried a British passport. He was the author of numerous public monuments, and left behind his home, Santarella, in Tyringham. The home, which Kitson modified extensively, was recently restored and now operates as a special events venue as well as providing overnight accommodation.

He was the elder son of Abraham Samuda, an East and West India merchant of London, and Joy, daughter of H. d'Aguilar of Enfield Chase, Middlesex. Jacob's cousin married Hanna Ricardo, the sister of David Ricardo, the economist. After his apprenticeship with John Hague, an engineer, Jacob went into partnership with his brother Joseph d'Aguilar Samuda setting up the firm Samuda Brothers, a major London shipbuilder in the mid to late 19th century. Jacob was an ingenious inventor and made a number of important discoveries. One of these, the atmospheric railway, received at first with considerable opposition, was subsequently adopted as a means of transit by several important companies, the first being Dublin and Kingstown Railway in 1842. Sir Robert Peel later recommended its adoption to the House of Commons and the Board of Trade. The first line to use it in England was from Epsom to London; and later the South Devon Railway adopted the principle of the new invention. Jacob also made significant improvements in marine engines. In 1843, he contracted to build the Gypsy Queen, an iron boat to be fitted with his improved engine. On the trial trip, the ship exploded and he met his death along with six other persons.

On August 11, 2006, it was announced that the show would not be renewed for the 2006‚Äì2007 season due to low ratings, and the show went out of syndication after September 5, 2006.  Information  The syndicated program premiered on 17 September 2001 and was produced by Dawn Syndicated Productions in association with Telepictures Productions, and distributed by Telepictures Distribution (2001‚Äì2003), and Warner Bros. Television Distribution (2003‚Äì2006). The show was produced by Alex Duda. The narrator was Dale Inghram. Nationwide in the United States, it was broadcast on cable late nights on Superstation WGN. ElimiDate was also available on AOL's free video-streaming channel, In2TV until it was shut down. The show was popular due to it being designed to be aired around or past midnight, when their target audience was just coming home from being out or ending their studies for the evening. It developed a cult following of sorts among college students nationwide. On 11 August 2006, it was announced that the show would not be renewed for the 2006‚Äì2007 season due to low ratings, and the show went out of syndication after 5 September 2006.  Format  The reality television dating show features one contestant who chooses between four contestants of the opposite sex by eliminating them one by one in three total rounds. The contestant (sometimes female, but usually male) meets their four dates one by one, and then give their first impression in a confessional- style cut scene. The other four contestants then size each other up along with the contestant within their own confessional scenes. The group of five is cut one-by-one each round, and in each round the group usually goes to a different place. The show starts out in the late afternoon at a public place (e.g. a city park or restaurant). Then, when there are only two suitors left, the setting moves to a hot tub or VIP area of a club where different sexual actions are apt to happen. Typically, the contestants are very competitive and direct insulting comments towards one another many times during an episode. There are rare cases of fighting, but \\"catty\\" bickering is the major draw of the show. The extremity of some of the cattiness suggests handling and line- feeding from producers, and contestants respond to these situations in interview sequences filmed after the fact. Most eliminations are preceded by some variation of the phrase I liked everybody but unfortunately the name of the game is 'ElimiDate', so I have to make a cut. So I decided to cut.... Contestants who are cut have the opportunity to react to their dismissal. Many eliminated contestants, who are often visibly intoxicated, insult the contestant who eliminated them, claiming He/she wasn't my type, anyway. Initially, episodes rotated between Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City, but the popularity of the program encouraged the producers to film episodes in other cities. Episodes were filmed in over three dozen cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Columbus, Little Rock, St. Paul, Jacksonville, Phoenix, Raleigh and Sacramento, and the syndicators usually received strong support from their affiliate stations to find contestants for the series within their cities through casting calls.  ElimiDate Deluxe  A network version of ElimiDate aired concurrently with the syndicated run called ElimiDate Deluxe on the WB for the 2001‚Äì2002 season, but was dropped after just a few airings.  British version  In 2002, a short lived British version aired on ITV, presented by former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona. It generated some controversy when contestant Donovan Russell lodged a complaint with the Broadcasting Standards Commission alleging that the programme was \\"fixed\\" and contestants were told in advance who to pick.

It is a popular pastime in China and dates back more than 1,000 years to the Tang Dynasty. However, the sport has been losing its popularity in China. History Cricket fighting was nurtured by Tang Dynasty emperors more than 1,000 years ago, and later popularized by commoners. In the thirteenth century, the Southern Song Dynasty prime minister Jia Sidao wrote a how-to guide for the blood sport. Jia's obsession with cricket fighting is believed to have contributed to the fall of the empire. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) China's Communist government banned cricket fighting as a bourgeois predilection, but it is now undergoing a revival among a younger generation eager to embrace traditional Chinese pastimes. Culture A coffin for a prized and loved cricket on display at the Museum of Macau Many famous hotels around Macau hold cricket fights where bets up to thousands of patacas would be waged on a single fight. Prized crickets become famous and actual funeral services would be held for them. Cricket season begins in summer and championships take place after the autumn equinox in late September. In Beijing, the Association for Cricket Fighting organizes cricket fighting events and championships. While it is illegal in China to gamble on cricket fights,HK feds bust illegal cricket fighting ring the fights themselves are legal and occur in most big cities in China. Crickets are sold openly in street markets, with more than a dozen cricket markets in Shanghai alone. In 2010 more than 400 million yuan (US$63 million) were spent in China on crickets. Care and breeding The best crickets are from a few counties in northeastern Shandong Province. Crickets have pedigrees and would be carefully bred by knowledgeable keepers. Each cricket must be kept in its own clay pot and their diets include ground shrimp, red beans, goat liver, and maggots. Before fight night, female crickets are dropped in the pot to increase the male's fighting spirit. Flight and anger Crickets fights are arranged according to weight class. In a fighting container, handlers stimulate their cricket's antennae using a straw stick, causing the crickets to become aggressive. When both crickets are sufficiently agitated, a divider separating the pair will be lifted, and the two crickets will begin the match. The loser is the cricket that first begins avoiding contact, runs away from battle, stops chirping, or is thrown from the fighting container. Studies done indicate that the sense of \\"flying\\" encourages a cricket's fighting spirit. In one such study, a losing cricket put back into the ring will only go back to fight one out of ten times. If crickets are shaken and thrown in the air repeatedly, they will fight again six out of ten times. Tournaments The Yu Sheng Cup,Kaushik \\"Cricket Fighting Contests in China\\".

It is usually said before bedtime, to give thanks for a meal, or as a nursery rhyme. Many of these prayers are either quotes from the Bible, or set traditional texts. While termed \\"Christian child's prayer\\", the examples here are almost exclusively used and promoted by Protestants. Catholic and Orthodox Christians have their own set of children's prayers, often invoking Mary, Mother of Jesus, angels, or the saints, and including a remembrance of the dead. Some adult prayers are equally popular with children, such as the Golden Rule (, Matthew 7:12), the Doxology, the Serenity Prayer, John 3:16, , , and for older children, The Lord's Prayer and Psalm 23.

Patents=European Patent Organisation In the context of the proceedings at the European Patent Office (EPO), third parties may dispute the validity of a granted European patent by filing a post-grant opposition under the European Patent Convention (EPC). The term for filing an opposition with the EPO is nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin. France As of April 1, 2020, opposition proceedings will also be available in France. The term for filing an opposition with the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) will be nine months from the grant of the French patent.

Post-grant review provisions of the new patent law may affect a potential patent infringement defendant's strategies in filing a declaratory judgment action. Subsequent to the Leahy‚ÄìSmith America Invents Act (2011), any third party can challenge the validity of an issued patent using either post-grant review under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 321 or inter partes review under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 311.

From 1757 to 1762 he led an Anglo-German army in Western Germany which successfully repelled French attempts to occupy Hanover. Early life The fourth son of Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, Ferdinand joined the Prussian army as a colonel in 1740. He was present in the battles of Mollwitz and Chotusitz. After Margrave Wilhelm of Brandenburg was killed at Prague in 1744, Ferdinand received command of Frederick the Great's Leibgarde battalion, and at the Battle of Soor (1745) he distinguished himself greatly, especially in the assault of a steep hill, that incidentally was defended by his older brother duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick- L√ºneburg.Frederick the Great, A history of my own times Part II, p. 232 in Posthumous Works, vol 1, 1789. Translated by Thomas Holcroft. Text available at Google Books He took part in the Second Silesian War before leading part of the invasion of Saxony and Bohemia in 1756 during the Seven Years' War. He participated in the Battle of Rossbach, and then became commander of the allied Hanoverian army. He also was a freemason, initiated in 1740 into the Lodge of The Three Globes in Berlin, and received the degree of Master Mason in 1743 at Breslau. During ten years of peace, he was in the closest touch with the military work of Frederick the Great, who supervised the instruction of the guard battalion, and sought to make it a model of the whole Prussian army. Ferdinand was, moreover, one of the most intimate friends of the king, and thus he was peculiarly fitted for the tasks which afterwards fell to his lot. In this time, he was promoted to major-general and then lieutenant- general. Seven Years' War In the first campaign of the Seven Years' War, Ferdinand commanded one of the Prussian columns which converged upon Dresden, and in the operations which led up to the surrender of the Saxon army at Pirna (1756). At the Battle of Lobositz, he led the right wing of the Prussian infantry. In 1757, he distinguished himself at Prague, and served also in the Rossbach campaign. Hanover Shortly after this, he was appointed to command the Hanoverian Army of Observation which had been raised and funded by Britain to protect western Germany, but had recently failed to prevent the French Invasion of Hanover under the previous commander the Duke of Cumberland. Ferdinand accepted this appointment on the condition that he would have direct access to George II ruler of Hanover and Britain.McLynn p.259-60 His new commission placed him in Hanoverian service, rather than Prussian or British. Despite this Frederick continued to communicate with him as though he were under his direct command. Ferdinand's best known victory the Battle of Minden (1759). He found this army dejected by a reverse and a capitulation, yet within a week of his taking up the command, he assumed the offensive, and thus began the career of victory which made his reputation as a soldier. He tried to raise Hanoverian support for the war effort by highlighting various atrocities committed by French troops during their occupation.McLynn p.260 By Spring 1758 he had driven the French out of Hanover and back across the River Rhine which gave him a reputation in Britain as a talented General, and helped boost support for British involvement in the German war. From June 1758, following the Capture of Emden, British troops arrived on the continent and directly added to Ferdinand's forces. The number of British troops was increased throughout the war. Offensive across the Rhine Ferdinand followed up his success in driving the French back by crossing the Rhine himself as part of a fresh offensive. This caused alarm in France, as it was feared that a naval descent by large number of British reinforcements was intended to be co-ordinated with Ferdinand's advance, although the destination of the descent soon turned out to be St Malo in Brittany rather than the Low Countries. In spite of this Ferdinand still posed a not insignificant threat and it was believed he was poised to attack the Austrian Netherlands or even northern Italy. On 12 June 1758 he fought an indecisive Battle of Rheinberg before he won the Battle of Krefeld but could not easily maintain so advanced a position and fell back to the River Lippe. Minden He resumed a bold offensive in 1759, only to be repulsed at Bergen where he was defeated by France in the Battle of Bergen on 13 April 1759. Following the battle Ferdinand retreated in the face of a French advance, but managed to check them with a decisive victory at the Battle of Minden. This ended the immediate French threat to Hanover, as the French army was in no condition to continue its advance. Villinghausen, Wilhelmsthal, Warburg and other victories attested the increasing power of Ferdinand in the following campaigns, and Frederick, hard pressed in the eastern theatre of war, owed much of his success in an almost hopeless task to the continued pressure exerted by Ferdinand in the west. In promoting him to Field Marshal in November 1758, Frederick acknowledged his debt in the words, Je n'ai fait que ce que je dois, mon cher Ferdinand. After Minden, King George II of Great Britain gave the duke the Order of the Garter, and the thanks of the British parliament were voted on the same occasion to the victor of Minden. Later career After the war, he was honored by other sovereigns, and he received the rank of field marshal and a regiment from the Austrians. During the War of American Independence, there was a suggestion, which came to nothing, of offering him the command of the British forces. He devoted most of the small income he received from his various offices and the rewards given to him by the allied princes to compensate those who had suffered in the Seven Years' War. The estrangement of Frederick and Ferdinand in 1766 led to the duke's retirement from Prussian service, but there was no open breach between the old friends, and Ferdinand visited the king in 1772, 1777, 1779 and 1782. Ferdinand retired to Brunswick and his castle of Vechelde, where he occupied himself in building and other improvements. He became a patron of learning and art, and a great benefactor of the poor. He died on 3 July 1792. The merits, civil and military, of the prince were recognized by memorials not only in Prussia and Hanover, but also in Denmark, the states of western Germany and England. The Prussian memorials include an equestrian statue at Berlin 1863.

The disease causes a gradual loss of vision, starting with childhood night blindness, followed by peripheral vision loss and progressing to loss of central vision later in life. Progression continues throughout the individual's life, but both the rate of change and the degree of visual loss are variable among those affected, even within the same family. Choroideremia is caused by a loss-of- function mutation in the CHM gene which encodes Rab escort protein 1 (REP1), a protein involved in lipid modification of Rab proteins. While the complete mechanism of disease is not fully understood, the lack of a functional protein in the retina results in cell death and the gradual deterioration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors and the choroid. As of 2019, there is no treatment for choroideremia; however, retinal gene therapy clinical trials have demonstrated a possible treatment.Abigail Beall, 2014, \\"Gene therapy restores sight in people with eye disease,\\" New Scientist (online), January 16, 2014, see , accessed 21 January 2017.

While there are a few exceptions, female carriers have a noticeable lack of pigmentation in the RPE but do not experience any symptoms. Female carriers have a 50% chance of having either an affected son or a carrier daughter, while a male with choroideremia will have all carrier daughters and unaffected sons. Even though the disease progression can vary significantly, there are general trends. The first symptom many individuals with choroideremia notice is a significant loss of night vision, which begins in youth. Peripheral vision loss occurs gradually, starting as a ring of vision loss, and continuing on to \\"tunnel vision\\" in adulthood. Individuals with choroideremia tend to maintain good visual acuity into their 40s, but eventually lose all sight at some point in the 50‚Äì70 age range. A study of 115 individuals with choroideremia found that 84% of patients under the age of 60 had a visual acuity of 20/40 or better, while 33% of patients over 60 years old had a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. The most severe visual acuity impairment (only being able to count fingers or worse) did not occur until the seventh decade of life. The same study found the mean rate of visual acuity loss to be about 0.09 logMAR per 5 years, which is roughly 1 row on a Snellen chart. Diagnosis A diagnosis of choroideremia can be made based on family history, symptoms and the characteristic appearance of the fundus. However, choroideremia shares several clinical features with retinitis pigmentosa, a similar but broader group of retinal degenerative diseases, making a specific diagnosis difficult without genetic testing. Because of this choroideremia is often initially misdiagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa. A variety of different genetic testing techniques can be used to make a differential diagnosis. Management While nothing currently can be done to stop or reverse the retinal degeneration, there are steps that can be taken to slow the rate of vision loss. UV-blocking sunglasses for outdoors, appropriate dietary intake of fresh fruit and leafy green vegetables, antioxidant vitamin supplements, and regular intake of dietary omega-3 very-long-chain fatty acids are all recommended. One study found that a dietary supplement of lutein increases macular pigment levels in patients with choroideremia. Over a long period of time, these elevated levels of pigmentation \\"could\\" slow retinal degeneration. Additional interventions that may be needed include surgical correction of retinal detachment and cataracts, low vision services, and counseling to help cope with depression, loss of independence, and anxiety over job loss. Gene therapy Gene therapy is currently not a treatment option, however human clinical trials for both choroideremia and Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) have produced somewhat promising results.Pallab Ghosh, 2011, \\"Health: Gene therapy used in a bid to save a man's sight,\\" at BBC News (online), October 27, 2011, see , accessed 23 April 2015. Clinical trials of gene therapy for patients with LCA began in 2008 at three different sites. In general, these studies found the therapy to be safe, somewhat effective, and promising as a future treatment for similar retinal diseases. In 2011, the first gene therapy treatment for choroideremia was administered. The surgery was performed by Robert MacLaren, Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford and leader of the Clinical Ophthalmology Research Group at the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology (NLO).Abigail Beall, 2014, \\"Gene therapy restores sight in people with eye disease,\\" New Scientist (online), January 16, 2014, see , accessed 23 April 2015.Ewen Callaway, 2008, \\"Gene therapy success 'reverses' blindness,\\" New Scientist (online), April 28, 2008, see and and , accessed 23 April 2015. In the study, 2 doses of the AAV.REP1 vector were injected subretinally in 12 patients with choroideremia. There study had 2 objectives: * to assess the safety and tolerability of the AAV.REP1 vector * to observe the therapeutic benefit, or slowing of the retinal degeneration, of the gene therapy during the study and at a 24-month post-treatment time point CT.gov, 2014, \\"Gene Therapy for Blindness Caused by Choroideremia (Sponsor:University of Oxford): NCT01461213,\\" at ClinicalTrials.gov, see , accessed 23 April 2015. Despite retinal detachment caused by the injection, the study observed initial improved rod and cone function, warranting further study. In 2016, researchers were optimistic that the positive results of 32 choroideremia patients treated over four and a half years with gene therapy in four countries could be long- lasting. Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis For women who carry a mutation in the CHM gene, preimplantation genetic diagnosis can be used during the in-vitro fertilization process to select unaffected embryos to implant. This process call be applied to any monogenic disease. Other potential therapies While choroideremia is an ideal candidate for gene therapy there are other potential therapies that could restore vision after it has been lost later in life. Foremost of these is stem cell therapy. A clinical trial published in 2014 found that a subretinal injection of human embryonic stem cells in patients with age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease was safe and improved vision in most patients. Out of 18 patients, vision improved in 10, improved or remained the same in 7, and decreased in 1 patient, while no improvement was seen in the untreated eyes. The study found \\"no evidence of adverse proliferation, rejection, or serious ocular or systemic safety issues related to the transplanted tissue.\\" A 2015 study used CRISPR/Cas9 to repair mutations in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells that cause X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. This study suggests that a patient's own repaired cells could be used for therapy, reducing the risk of immune rejection and ethical issues that come with the use of embryonic stem cells. Research=History Choroideremia was first described in 1872 by an Austrian ophthalmologist, Ludwig Mauthner. Initially, the condition was thought to be a developmental disorder which caused the absence of a majority of the choroid (hence the probable use of the ancient Greek suffix ‚Äúeremia,‚Äù meaning barren land or desert). After several decades, the non-progressive nature of the disease was called into doubt, eventually being rejected by Paymerer et al. in 1960. The CHM gene was identified and cloned in 1990 by Frans P.M. Cremers. Basic research In many inherited retinal diseases the protein affected by the mutation is directly involved in the light sensing function of the eye, however this is not the case in choroideremia. REP1 assists the prenylation of Rab G-proteins by binding and presenting them to the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase subunit. REP1 also escorts prenylated Rabs through the cytoplasm by binding the hydrophobic prenyl groups and carrying them to a specific destination membrane. In healthy individuals, REP1 is found throughout all of the cells of the body, however patients with choroideremia only experience vision loss, and not broader, systemic symptoms (with the exception of a study that found crystals and fatty acid abnormalities in leukocytes). REP2, a protein that is 75% identical and 90% similar to REP1, is able to significantly compensate for the loss of REP1 outside the eye. It is thought that REP2 is not able to fully compensate for the loss of REP1 in the retina. RAB27A, a Rab that has essential functions in the retina, has been shown to be preferentially prenylated by REP1. Additionally, the Rab27a-REP1 and Rab27a-REP2 complexes have different affinities for the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase enzyme, possibly explaining REP2's inability to fully compensate for REP1 in the retina. Culture A number of individuals in public roles are living with choroidermia, and some have been involved in fundraising efforts for the disease. The former UK Labour Member of Parliament Si√¥n Simon is a known to have the condition. Comic and activist E.J. Scott, partner of Daredevil actress Deborah Ann Woll, also has choroideremia, and is involved in regular fundraising efforts.Bill Dwyre, 2013, \\"Though going blind, E.J.

Namely, it is associated to a contact manifold and one of its Legendrian submanifolds. It is a part of a more general invariant known as symplectic field theory, and is defined using pseudoholomorphic curves. Legendrian knots The simplest case yields invariants of Legendrian knots inside contact three-manifolds. The relative contact homology has been shown to be a strictly more powerful invariant than the \\"classical invariants\\", namely Thurston-Bennequin number and rotation number (within a class of smooth knots). Yuri Chekanov developed a purely combinatorial version of relative contact homology for Legendrian knots, i.e. a combinatorially defined invariant that reproduces the results of relative contact homology. Tamas Kalman developed a combinatorial invariant for loops of Legendrian knots, with which he detected differences between the fundamental groups of the space of smooth knots and of the space of Legendrian knots. Higher-dimensional legendrian submanifolds In the work of Lenhard Ng, relative SFT is used to obtain invariants of smooth knots: a knot or link inside a topological three-manifold gives rise to a Legendrian torus inside a contact five-manifold, consisisting of the unit conormal bundle to the knot inside the unit cotangent bundle of the ambient three-manifold. The relative SFT of this pair is a differential graded algebra; Ng derives a powerful knot invariant from a combinatorial version of the zero-th degree part of the homology. It has the form of a finitely presented tensor algebra over a certain ring of multivariable Laurent polynomials with integer coefficients. This invariant assigns distinct invariants to (at least) knots of at most ten crossings, and dominates the Alexander polynomial and the A-polynomial (and thus distinguishes the unknot).

To have a patent reexamined, an interested party must submit prior art, in the form of patents or printed publications, that raises a \\"substantial new question of patentability\\". The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act makes substantial changes to the U.S. patent system, including new mechanisms for challenging patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. One of the new mechanisms is a post- grant review proceeding, which will provide patent challengers expanded bases on which to attack patents. Process A request for a reexamination can be filed by anyone at any time during the period of enforceability of a patent. To request a reexamination, one must submit a \\"request for reexamination\\" which includes (1) a statement pointing out each \\"substantial new question of patentability based on prior patents and printed publications; (2) an identification and explanation for every claim for which reexamination is requested; (3) a copy of every patent or printed publication relied upon; (4) a copy of the entire patent at issue; (5) a certification that a copy of the request for reexamination has been served on the patent owner if the requester is not the patent owner; and (6) a certification by the third-party requester that the statutory estoppel provisions of 35 U.S.C. 351(e)(1) or 35 U.S.C. 325(e)(1) do not prohibit the requester from filing the request for reexamination. If the USPTO finds that the request indeed raises a substantial new question of patentability, the USPTO orders a reexamination. Requests for reexamination are often filed by third parties, who are already involved in an infringement lawsuit concerning the patent at issue. By filing for a reexamination, such parties seek to invalidate the patent while keeping legal fees low. If the judge agrees, the trial proceedings may be put on hold pending the outcome of the reexamination. Inventors themselves also file requests for reexamination. Such requests may be filed before the inventors sue another party for infringing the patent, to make sure that the patent is valid in light of any prior art they may have discovered since the issuance of the patent. The patent office itself may initiate \\"director initiated\\" reexaminations, for example, when there is reason to question the validity of the patent. The director, for example, ordered reexaminations of the NTP, Inc. patents which covered BlackBerry mobile e-mail technology. Once a reexamination is ordered, a new examiner is assigned to the case, and the patent goes through another examination similar to the examination it received the first time around. If any claims are rejected in light of the new questions raised, then the patent owner can narrow or cancel those claims. The patent owner can also submit new claims, provided they are not broader than the claims in the original patent. If the examiner makes a rejection \\"final\\", the patent owner can appeal the decision to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI) at the USPTO. The patent owner can file an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and even to the US Supreme Court, if permitted. Once the reexamination has been concluded, a \\"certificate of reexamination\\" is issued. The certificate makes any corrections to a patent as are required under the reexamination. If all the claims in the patent are rejected, the patent gets nullified. Public notice The proceedings of all reexaminations are made available to the public on the USPTO's public PAIR (Patent Application Information Retrieval) web site.USPTO‚Äôs public PAIR (Patent Application Information Retrieval) Reexaminations are assigned serial numbers and cross referenced as child applications of originally issued patents. The process of reexamination has the potential to increase the quality of patents issued and to encourage public input in the process. Ex parte and inter partes reexaminations Ex parte reexaminations are initiated by members of the public, but once said members submit their request, they no longer actively participate in the proceedings. The correspondence is strictly between the examiner and the patent owner. The fee for filing a request for an ex parte reexamination is $6,000 as of January 16, 2018.USPTO Fee Schedule Inter partes reexaminations were initiated by members of the public, and said members of the public then participated in the proceedings. On September 16, 2012, Leahy-Smith America Invents Act eliminated these proceedings and replaced them with two new post grant proceedings (Post-Grant Review and Inter Partes Review).

Accessed July 3, 2008. Statistics 747 requests for ex parte reexaminations were filed in FY2012 (corresponding to about 0.28% of the total number of patents issued that year), though roughly 90% of these requests were made by the patent owner.USPTO FY2012 Performance and Accountability Report, Tables 14A and 6 Some 640 requests for inter partes reexaminations were filed during FY2012, a figure that has been rising susbstantially every year and a fourfold increase since FY2008.USPTO FY2012 Performance and Accountability Report, Table 14B Statistics released by the USPTO for reexaminations for the period of 1981 to 2007 showed that for ex parte reexaminations, claims were changed in average 64% of the cases. In 26% of the cases, all claims are confirmed with no changes, while in 10% of the cases, all claims were invalidated. For inter partes reexaminations, claims were changed in seven of the eight cases that had been completed by the time the statistics were released.Robert A. Saltzberg and Mehran Arjomand, Reexaminations Increase in Popularity, Morrison and Foerster, September 2007 Notable reexaminations= NTP patents  The NTP patents covering BlackBerry technology are currently undergoing a number of reexaminations because new prior art has been discovered which had not been considered by the patent office when the patent applications were first examined. Some of these reexaminations are inter partes, some of them are ex parte, some of them were initiated by the director. Some of the patents have had a number of reexaminations filed. These multiple reexaminations have been merged into single reexaminations, each for the patent in question. As of April 2006, all of the NTP claims that have been acted upon have been rejected on the basis of the substantial new questions of patentability. It is not yet known whether NTP will narrow its claims to get around the rejections, or succeed in an appeal. Blackberry agreed, on March 3, 2006, to settle its patent dispute with NTP for more than 600 million US$.  Method for swinging on a swing  entitled \\"Method of swinging on a swing\\" was issued in 2002 to applicant Steven Olson, the young son of a patent attorney who applied for the patent to teach his son about the patent system. This patent was filed shortly after business method patents became allowable under the US patent law due to the 1998 State Street decision; it was not, however, a business method, but rather simply a method or process patent. The patent claimed an improved method for a child to swing on a swing. The PTO director ordered a reexamination, and the claims were subsequently rejected. The patent owner elected not to appeal. A reexamination certificate was issued canceling all the claims.  Crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich  entitled \\"Sealed crustless sandwich\\" was issued in 1999 to applicants Len Kretchman and David Gesked. The patent claimed an improved crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which could be mass-produced and sold in stores. The patent was licensed to Smuckers, which then introduced the Uncrustables brand of frozen no-crust sandwiches. Uncrustables sandwiches, The J.M. Smucker Co., retrieved on June 16, 2006.

While at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, he was said to be \\"the country's foremost expert on Plato and Aristotle.\\"Quoting from IAS histories: Linda G. Arntzenius, 'Institute for Advanced Study' (Images of America Series) (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2011), p. 81. According to Tar√°n, Cherniss's \\"greatest contribution to scholarship is doubtless his two books on Aristotle, supplemented by The Riddle of the Early Academy ... his published works on Plato, Aristotle, and the Academy are among the very few publications that revolutionized the field... His significance was recognized all over the world not only by classicists and philosophers but by the learned societies of which he was a member and the various universities that awarded him honorary degrees.\\" Cherniss's scholarship continues to shape the study of ancient Greek philosophy in several significant ways (see Work below): * Cherniss is remembered as a champion of Platonic unitarianism, the contention that Plato's dialogues present a single, consistent and unchanging philosophical system. * Cherniss \\"revolutionized the study of Presocratic philosophy\\"Paul A. Vander Waerdt in Ward W. Briggs, ed., Biographical Dictionary of North American Classicists (American Philological Association), p. 94. and stimulated revisionist histories of the earliest beginnings of European thought by showing that Aristotle's extensive reports were often unreliable and distorted by his own polemical aims. * Cherniss attacked Aristotle's claims that Plato had esoteric \\"unwritten doctrines\\" and developed a mathematical ontology based on two opposing principles. This esoteric interpretation of Plato was later resurrected by the so-called T√ºbingen School, which was denounced in an influential review by Gregory Vlastos that repeatedly cited Cherniss. The skepticism of Cherniss and Vlastos towards the esoteric Plato remains dominant among English-speaking scholars, and contributed to the continuing split with much European Plato scholarship. * Cherniss mocked other scholars' fanciful and aggrandizing reconstructions of the supposed lectures and the curriculum within Plato's Academy, and created an enduring restraint in scholarly images of the early Academy. Before and after World War II, various circumstances intertwined the careers of Cherniss and his friend Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project that developed the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer was later suspected of being a Soviet spy and lost his security clearance in the ensuing national scandal. Cherniss played a key role in helping Oppenheimer keep his job as director of the Institute for Advanced Study.

The first pogrom in Russia had occurred in Ukraine the preceding year, at the end of April 1881, and spread through the provinces of Ukraine. The Russian government then adopted a systematic policy of excluding Jews from their economic and public roles, and this provoked a mass emigration of Jewish refugees from Russia to the United States and other countries.Jewish Virtual Library, online, accessed on January 6, 2016, at http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/pogroms.html.

Cherniss, and studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received an A.B. in 1925.

In the summer of 1926, he studied with Paul Shorey, a prominent Plato scholar, at the University of Chicago.Tar√°n (2001), p. 667 A crucial year in Germany The University of Berlin From 1927 to 1928, Cherniss studied with some of the leading classicists in Germany: in G√∂ttingen with Hermann Fr√§nkel and in Berlin with Werner Jaeger and Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. Cherniss thus arrived in the middle of a period (1924‚Äì1929) known in Germany as the Golden Era (German: Goldene Zwanziger) of the left-leaning Weimar Republic during which the economy was growing and there was a consequent decrease in civil unrest.See Weimar Republic. These were relatively uneventful years between the hyperinflation of 1921-24 and the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. The 1920s saw a remarkable cultural renaissance in Germany.This paragraph is borrowed from Weimar Republic. Influenced by the brief cultural explosion in the Soviet Union, German literature, cinema, theater, jazz, art, and architecture were in the midst of a phase of great creativity. This was also a revolutionary time in classical studies and philosophy. Jaeger had published his famous work Aristotle: Fundamentals of the History of His Development in 1923.Aristoteles: Grundlegung einer Geschichte seiner Entwicklung 1923; English trans. by Richard Robinson in 1934. Martin Heidegger published Being and Time in 1927. Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff While Cherniss was studying in Germany, a crucial election campaign splintered the moderate and centrist forces. In 1927, the governing coalition that included the right-wing and anti-semitic German National People's Party, a precursor to Hitler's National Socialist Party, broke apart and precipitated a new election that the left-wing, democratic parties appeared to win.According to Eberhard Kolb, The Weimar Republic (London: Routledge, 1988), p. 76-77: '‚Ä¶ towards the end of 1927 the will and the ability to reconcile divergent interests became increasingly weaker in all the parties concerned. This was the basic reason for the break- up of the coalition ‚Ä¶ the election of 20 May 1928 was a clear success for the left-wing ‚Ä¶ [the DNVP's] strength in the Reichstag fell from 103 to 73.' Although the implications were not all apparent during Cherniss's time in Germany, the election he witnessed proved to be a key turning point that fatally weakened the moderate and democratic forces in Germany and paved the way for the rise of Nazism a few years later.According to Eberhard Kolb,The Weimar Republic (London: Routledge, 1988), p. 77: 'Despite the defeat of the right wing, however, it would be very superficial to interpret the election of May 1928 as a victory for democratic and republican forces. In the first place, the drift away from middle-ground parties to splinter groups with narrow interests showed to what an extent the former's integrative power had diminished ‚Ä¶ many voters who moved away from the middle ground in 1928 ‚Ä¶ were to vote for the Nazis at the next Reichstag election in 1930, and a great many more in 1932‚Ä¶ The right-wing of the DNVP ‚Ä¶ now went over to the offensive and gained the upper-hand within the party ‚Ä¶ and the party pursued a course of unremitting opposition and obstruction, its anti-democratic sentiments attaining a hitherto unknown pitch of ferocity.' A visitor to Princeton met with Cherniss many years later and reported that: > ‚Ä¶ we somehow got around to taking about Wilamowitz ‚Ä¶ [Cherniss] said that > Wilamowitz would pepper his lectures with remarks about the political > situation in Germany and that his students would applaud by loudly stamping > their feet on the floor. The remarks were of such a nature that they caused > Cherniss to develop an intense dislike for the man. I don't recall how he > characterized the remarks, but Solmsen's description of the antidemocratic, > anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic Prussian lens through which Wilamowitz viewed > Weimar Germany would explain Cherniss's antipathy.D.

Lovejoy The University of California at Berkeley is marked by Sather Tower (1914) in the foreground. The bridge leads across the bay to San Francisco. Cherniss received his doctorate from Berkeley in Greek, Latin and Sanskrit in 1930. He then taught Greek at Cornell University from 1930-3, followed by ten years teaching at Johns Hopkins University and a return to the University of California before the war. A colleague at Berkeley remarked \\"He is a Platonist both as scholar and as thinker ...\\"Fontenrose, op. cit., p. 37. He married Ruth Meyer, who had been a fellow student at Berkeley.Tar√°n (2001), p. 669. Cherniss was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1941‚Äì1942.See, accessed January 9, 2016, http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/harold-f-cherniss/. While Cherniss was writing his three monographs at Johns Hopkins, the prominent philosopher Arthur O. Lovejoy was promoting an influential \\"history of ideas\\" approach to studying philosophical ideas that emphasized tracing their descent through successive historical periods. Lovejoy founded a \\"History of Ideas Club\\" at Johns Hopkins that included Cherniss, his friends Ludwig Edelstein and George Boas, and others: > Like the Cambridge Apostles and the Metaphysical Society of the last > century, the History of Ideas Club has set itself the threefold aim of > intellectual stock-taking, the pursuit of new truth, and the \\"cross- > fertilization\\" of the various academic departments and disciplines. > Specifically, it originated in the need of American thinkers after the First > World War to become more conscious of the cultural heritage of which they > then began to feel themselves the custodians.Review of English Studies, > 1954, v. 20, pp. 432-434. Cherniss delivered papers at its meetings and the preface of Lovejoy's most well-known work, The Great Chain of Being (1936), thanks Cherniss for his contributions. Service with British military intelligence in Europe Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. In September 1941, groups of Nazi commandos tasked with eliminating the Jewish population of Ukraine massacred some 50,000 people in Vinnytsia, where Cherniss's father was born. Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. In April 1942, Cherniss gave the Sather Lectures at Berkeley and soon afterwards volunteered for military service. He entered the United States Army as a private and was abroad by November 1942,Fontenrose, Joseph E, 'Classics at Berkeley: The First Century 1869-1970,' 1982, p. 37, online, accessed January 10, 2016, at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5066c75h. This is confirmed by the prefatory note to Cherniss, Riddle of the Early Academy(below). Cherniss put 'October 1942, Baltimore' at the end of the preface of his Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy(1944). where he worked in military intelligence. He was assigned to a British intelligence unit in England, France and Belgium, and rose to the rank of captain in three years.Fontenrose, p. 37, and Obituary, New York Times, July 12, 1987, online, accessed January 10, 2016, at https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/obituaries/harold-f-cherniss-an-expert-in- greek-philosophy-is-dead.html. According to George Watt, Cherniss was working in Belgium immediately after the war and sought information from Aline Dumon (nicknamed \\"Michou\\"), who won medals for her clandestine work in the so-called Comet Line resistance network. Cherniss was seeking a young man who had betrayed scores in the Belgian and French undergrounds to the German occupation. In a 1985 interview, she remembered: > After the war, ‚Ä¶ Lt. Harold Cherniss, the American intelligence officer, > telephoned me and said \\"Michou, you must come quickly.\\" I went to Harold's > office and he showed me twelve little pictures of identity cards and asked > \\"Do you know that boy?\\" I said \\"Yes, [that's him] ‚Ä¶\\" He said, \\"Michou, this > is very important.

Cold War anxiety at Berkeley Oppeneheimer and General Groves examine the site of the first test of an atomic bomb in New Mexico in 1945. In 1946, while still in Europe, Cherniss accepted an offer to return to Berkeley as a Professor of Greek.Tar√°n (2001), p. 671. With the Berlin blockade of 1948‚Äì1949 and the Communist victory in China and first Soviet atomic bomb in 1949, America and Berkeley were soon caught up in Cold War tensions. In the rising anxiety stoked by Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee, fears grew that communists were infiltrating American universities. These were acute at Berkeley where the Radiation Laboratory situated in the hills above campus had been heavily involved in developing the atomic bomb. In September 1949, McCarthy's committee commenced a hearing on alleged communist infiltration of the \\"Rad Lab.\\"John David Jackson, 'Panofsky agonistes: The 1950 loyalty oath at Berkeley,' Physics Today, January 2009. PDF at the author's website. The University of California soon began requiring its faculty to sign an anti-communist loyalty oath.Jackson, 'Panofsky agonistes.' As these tensions mounted, Cherniss accepted an offer from the Institute of Advanced Study and resigned from his post at Berkeley: \\"his tenure there was cut short by the controversy which arose from the California Legislature's demand that state employees swear loyalty oaths.\\"Paul vander Waerdt, Harold Cherniss, in Ward W. Briggs, ed., Biographical Dictionary of North American Classicists (American Philological Association), p. 94. Back on the East Coast, Cherniss remained involved in what quickly became a national debate over Berkeley's loyalty oaths and academic Freedom. By 1950, faculty resistance at Berkeley hardened and ultimately some 31 faculty members were fired.Jackson. Recent immigrants among the faculty were particularly opposed: \\"persecuted by the Nazis and forced to leave Germany, they were rightly suspicious of the loyalty oath as a cold war demand for conformity or worse, inimical to the freedoms necessary at any institution of higher learning.\\"Jackson. Cherniss organized a public letter from the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study in support of academic freedom that was distributed to the faculty at Berkeley and published:Edward B.

Later, in 1951, Cherniss suggested he apply to the Institute for Advanced Study and he secured a permanent position there.See Kantorowicz's German Wikipedia page. Cherniss's old colleague at Johns Hopkins, the classicist Ludwig Edelstein, had also moved to Berkeley after the war but refused to sign the loyalty oath and lost his job.

Institute for Advanced Study and Robert Oppenheimer The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1948 Cherniss resigned from Berkeley and was appointed as a faculty member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Anti-semitism was still widespread at this time in America even at universities like Princeton, but the Institute \\"employed scholars with absolutely no regard to religious persuasion or ethnicity.\\"Keenan, Daniel, Kultur and acculturation: Erwin Panofsky in the United States of America, PhD thesis, University of Glasgow, 2014, p. 71. Online, accessed January 9, 2016, at http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5238/ Cherniss was appointed by his old friend Robert Oppenheimer who is sometimes known as the \\"father of the atomic bomb.\\" Cherniss first met Oppenheimer at Berkeley in 1929. Cherniss had just married Ruth Meyer who had been in high school with Oppenheimer at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York City. (Oppenheimer studied in G√∂ttingen until July 1927 and Cherniss studied there in 1927-28.) Bird, Kai, and Sherwin, Martin J, American Prometheus: the Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer (London: Atlantic Books, 2005), pp. 68 and 93. After the war, there was a national scandal over suspicions that Oppenheimer was secretly a communist sympathizer. Cherniss recalled in a later interview there was some pre-war evidence of Oppenheimer's interest in Marxism but made light of it: > In fact, [Oppenheimer's] exposure to Marx occurred several years earlier, > probably in the Spring of 1932. His friend Harold Cherniss remembered Oppie > visiting him in Ithaca, New York, that Spring and boasting that he had read > Das Kapital. Cherniss just laughed; he didn't think of Oppie as political > but he knew his friend read widely: \\"I suppose somewhere someone said to him > You don't know about this? You haven't seen it? So he got this wretched book > and read it!\\"Bird and Sherwin, p. 117. Einstein and Oppenheimer at the Institute for Advanced Study circa 1950 In July, 1945, when the world's first atomic bomb was exploded in the Trinity Test, Oppenheimer was famously supposed to have quoted a saying from the Bhagavad-Gita: \\"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.\\" Oppenheimer had studied Sanskrit at Berkeley and it was Cherniss who introduced Oppenheimer to his Sanskrit teacher, Arthur W. Ryder. Oppenheimer later claimed to have said those words but there is no contemporary evidence.Bird and Sherwin, pp. 117 and 309 In 1945, after Hiroshima and Nagasaki when Oppenheimer had become one of the world's most famous scientists, Cherniss saw him at Berkeley.Bird and Sherwin, p. 324. In 1947, Oppenheimer accepted an offer to take up the directorship of the Institute for Advanced Study. Cherniss was the first member of faculty Oppenheimer appointed to the Institute.Linda G. Arntzenius, 'Institute for Advanced Study'(Images of America Series) (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing,2011), p. 81. See also Linda G. Arntzenius, 'Institute for Advanced Study: An Introduction' (Princeton: Institute for Advanced Study, 2013), p. 26. Cherniss and the Oppenheimer Affair Oppenheimer was disgraced in a controversial four-week hearing in 1954. Despite his fame, Oppenheimer had made many enemies who suspected he was a communist sympathizer or even a spy. These included Lewis Strauss who was both a commissioner on the new Atomic Energy Commission, which had control of the plants and personnel assembled during the war to produce the atomic bomb, and chairman of the board of trustees of the Institute of Advanced Study. Oppenheimer was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1949. Strauss and others pushed President Eisenhower to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance. A hearing followed in April‚ÄìMay 1954 and Oppenheimer lost his security clearance. This national scandal produced a lasting rift between American scientists and the military. Historians with access to the American and Russian evidence have since concluded Oppenheimer was never involved in espionage for the Soviet Union and did not betray the United States, though in the late 1930s he had been a supporter of the Communist Party.See J. Robert Oppenheimer. After Oppenheimer's downfall, Cherniss was instrumental in preventing his dismissal from the Institute. Lewis Strauss sought to have Oppenheimer fired: > In July, Strauss told the FBI that he believed eight of the Institute's > thirteen trustees were ready to dismiss Oppenheimer ‚Äì but he decided to > postpone a vote on the matter until Autumn so that it would not appear that > Strauss as chairman was acting out of personal vindictiveness. This proved > to be a miscalculation, because the delay gave members of the faculty time > to organize an open letter in support of Oppenheimer‚Ä¶ Strauss was forced to > back off, and later that Autumn the trustees voted to keep Oppie as > director.Bird and Sherwin, pp. 552-3. According to Bird and Sherwin, \\"Oppenheimer's old friend Harold Cherniss took a lead in organizing the effort. After talking with a few trustees, Cherniss had realized that Oppenheimer's job was in doubt.\\"Bird and Sherwin, p. 678. Cherniss and other faculty members of the Institute for Advanced Study published an open letter affirming his loyalty on Thursday July 1, 1954 in both The New York Times and The Herald Tribune'Colleagues Back Dr Oppenheimer,' The New York Times, p. 14. and in the September Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: > We, who have known [Dr. Oppenheimer] as a colleague, as director of our own > institute, and as a neighbor in a small and intimate community, had from the > first complete confidence in his loyalty to the United States, his > discretion in guarding its secrets, and his deep concern for its safety, > strength, and welfare.

The letter was signed by H. F. Cherniss, A. Einstein, F. J. Dyson, K. G√∂del, E. Panofsky, J. von Neumann, Hermann Weyl, Chen Ning Yang, and others. Cherniss's close friend and colleague, the art historian Erwin Panofsky, \\"considered the case a symbolic and sorry indictment of American society. In Panofsky's eyes Oppenheimer had been attacked for assuming the responsibility and for having the courage to proffer an independent voice of reason in response to the mindless conformism of the day. Though never formally prosecuted for any wrongdoing, this once-celebrated scientist was widely discredited in the public sphere for his 'humanistic' viewpoint. For Panofsky the case spoke volumes in regards to the anti-intellectualism and the narrowness of the national-political consensus in America at the time.\\"Keenan, Daniel, Kultur and acculturation: Erwin Panofsky in the United States of America, PhD thesis, University of Glasgow, 2014. Online, accessed January 9, 2016, at http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5238/ Controversy over John von Neumann's computers John von Neumann and others developed the architecture of modern computers (the concept of a \\"stored program computer\\") while working at the Manhattan Project. After the war, his team built some of the very first computers at the Institute for Advanced Study. This was controversial and Cherniss later recounted that he was one of the humanists who opposed von Neumann's project: \\"In hindsight, there were certainly very good reasons for building the machine. I was nonetheless against it. The computer had nothing to do with the purpose for which the Institute was founded. The computer was a practical undertaking but the Institute was not conceived of as a place for anything practical.\\"Ed Regis, 'Who Got Einstein's Office? Eccentricity and Genius at the Institute for Advanced Study' (Basic Books, 1988), p. 113. After von Neumann's death in 1957, the faculty organized a committee to terminate the project. All the permanent faculty met in Oppenheimer's living room. As Cherniss explained, \\"This was back when we used to do things right. Everything was informal.\\" After the final decision was made, Cherniss elaborated \\"But we passed a more general motion. It was a declaration to have no experimental science, no laboratories of any kind at the Institute.\\" In his history, Regis remarked \\"And so it has been ever since. The Platonic-heavenly fathers [i.e., advocates of the Institute's abstract and theoretical approach] had triumphed.\\" Another faculty member, the physicist Freeman Dyson, said simply \\"The snobs took revenge.\\"Regis, p. 114 Later years The literary theorist George Steiner recalled an anecdote about his visit to the Institute for Advanced Study that gives insight into Cherniss's years there: > So I went to lunch with [the diplomat] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky and > the great Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited me to > his beautiful office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer came into the > room and sat on the table behind us.

Harold Cherniss's father, David Benjamin Cherniss was born on May 19, 1872 in Vinnytsia, and died on December 19, 1936 in Los Angeles. His second wife was Millie B. Cherniss. Harold Cherniss's mother Theresa Cherniss (n√©e Hart) was born on August 19, 1878, in Iowa.

Harold Cherniss had a brother named Edward Hart Cherniss (1909‚Äì1993) and a sister named Lillian Blanche Cherniss. Cherniss's assistant at the Institute was Gwendolyn Groves Robinson.She is referred to in a letter of E. H. Kantowriciz to R. E. Giesey of October 5, 1956.

She was the daughter of General Leslie Groves, who served as the military supervisor of the Manhattan Project. Work=Advocate of Platonic unitarianism Professor Paul Shorey (here, circa 1909) taught Cherniss that Plato's philosophy remained consistent through all the dialogues. In Plato studies, \\"unitarianism\\" is the view that Plato's dialogues contain a unified and systematic philosophy. It is opposed, for example, to \\"developmentalism\\" that holds Plato's doctrines evolved through the decades in which he wrote the dialogues. Cherniss studied at Berkeley with Roger Jones. According to Fontenrose, > Jones had been a ... graduate student at Chicago and had taken his doctorate > under Paul Shorey. He was perhaps Shorey's most able and promising student > in Greek philosophy, especially in Platonism. Jones readily adopted Shorey's > views of Plato's teachings, stressing the unity of Plato's thought from the > Apology and Crito down to the Laws, and opposing the Burnet-Taylor school, > which saw a significant change in Plato's thought after the Republic ... > Jones passed Shorey's doctrine on to Harold Cherniss, his most brilliant > student.Fontenrose, Joseph E, 'Classics at Berkeley: The First Century > 1869-1970,' 1982, online, accessed January 10, 2016, at > http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5066c75h. Cherniss was thus said to be \\"the heir and apologist of Shorey's interpretation of the unity of Plato's thought.\\" Cherniss continues to be regarded as an influential advocate of unitarianism: \\"One of the most important versions of unitarianism is represented by the likes of Paul Shorey, Harold Cherniss, and their disciples.\\"Lloyd Gerson, 'Plato's Development and the Development of the Theory of Forms,' in William A. Welton, ed., Plato's Forms (2002) (see Readings below).  Aristotle's Criticism of his Predecessors (1935) Cherniss's landmark monograph transformed studies of Pre-Socratic philosophy by forcing scholars to re-evaluate their sources and raise the rigor of their arguments. This contributed to a wave of creative revisionism about the origins of European thought. Aristotle's treatises contain more quotations from and reports about Pre-Socratic philosophy than any other early source. After these, historians must rely on commentators and Neo-Platonists who often come half a millennium later. Until Cherniss, therefore, Aristotle was thought our best and most reliable guide to Pre- Socratic philosophy because he was so early. Cherniss demonstrated \\"in detail how much of the conceptual apparatus often attributed to Presocratic thinkers in fact represents Aristotle's own reformulation of their theories in terms of his own philosophy.\\" This created skepticism about Aristotle's reports and forced later historians to be more selective and to justify their use of them deliberately and rigorously. Writing in the 2008 Oxford Handbook of Presocratic Philosophy, Patricia Curd and Daniel W. Graham said that Cherniss > ‚Ä¶ found multiple sources of error in Aristotle's treatments of the > Presocratics‚Ä¶ Since Cherniss's book was published, scholars have been > cautious of Aristotelian interpretations of the Presocratics; they cannot be > used as uncritical data for reconstructing Presocratic theory. There have > been some attempts to rehabilitate Aristotle‚Ä¶ Overall, however, Cherniss > showed that modern reconstructions of the Presocratics could improve on and > correct ancient ones. Cherniss wrote his three, pre-war books at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland \\"The Philosophical Economy of the Theory of Ideas\\" (1936) This well-known article was first published in The American Journal of Philology and gives a positive overview of Plato's system. It was reprinted in Vlastos' 1971 anthology Plato I: Metaphysics and Epistemology and Allen's 1965 anthology Studies in Plato's Metaphysics. Here Cherniss argues that Plato's Theory of Forms at once served as the foundation of Plato's ethics, epistemology, and ontology, and resolved skeptical problems in all three areas: > The phenomena for which Plato had to account were of three kinds, ethical, > epistemological, and ontological. In each of these spheres there had been > developed by the end of the fifth century doctrines so extremely paradoxical > that there seemed to be no possibility of reconciling them with one another > or any one of them with the observable facts of human experience. The > dialogues of Plato, I believe, will furnish evidence to show that he > considered it necessary to find a single hypothesis which would at once > solve the problems of these several spheres and also create a rationally > unified cosmos by establishing the connection among the separate phases of > experience.Cherniss (1936), pp. 445-6. After establishing that the Theory of Forms was the common root of Plato's system, Cherniss argued in the second place that, by a principle of \\"economy,\\" the effectiveness of the theory in three disparate areas justified Plato's assertion of the existence of the Forms. Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy (1944) This monumental, massive, and dense (600 pp.) tome aims to be a comprehensive assessment of whether or not Aristotle generally understood Plato's doctrines and whether or not Aristotle's much debated reports of Plato's mathematical ontology are credible. Cherniss treats the following topics in turn: diaeresis, matter, the origin and nature of the Platonic Forms, the arguments for the Forms, the relation of Plato's Forms and Substances, and the relation of Forms and Particulars. In each case, Cherniss finds that Aristotle has rather grossly and willfully misunderstood Plato. The chapter on diaeresis, for example, concludes: > From the passages thus far considered there emerge certain general > tendencies of Aristotle's critical method ‚Ä¶ Essential distinctions among > various Academic theories are likely to be disregarded, and a criticism > pertinent to one form of a given doctrine may be applied to all of its > variations ‚Ä¶ and, finally, a doctrine may be attacked in a form which is the > result of Aristotle's own interpretation and formulation ‚Ä¶P. 80. Cherniss's pre-war preface announces this as the first as two volumes, but after the war he never published the sequel on Plato's supposed mathematical ontology. Cherniss's views on this question, however, are summarized in The Riddle of the Early Academy. The Riddle of the Early Academy (1945) Harold Cherniss, Riddle of the Early Academy The vigorous polemic contained in this small volume (109 pp.) significantly shaped later Plato scholarship and began the process that split much of English-language and Continental Plato research into two communities.See section on Legacy below. The unitarianism of Shorey and Cherniss holds that Plato's dialogues are both a consistent and complete exposition of Plato's system. Cherniss saw both contentions under attack by the \\"higher critics\\" of Plato scholarship in his day. Burnet, Taylor, and others argued for radical changes in Plato's theories and an esoteric mathematical ontology taught orally in the Academy. According to Cherniss: > ‚Ä¶ although few if any of the \\"higher critics\\" of Platonism accept the > Burnet-Taylor hypothesis, all of them adopt explanations which differ from > that hypothesis only in degree‚Ä¶ accepting Aristotle's testimony concerning > the idea-numbers, they find themselves constrained to assert that the theory > of ideas underwent at Plato's hands a radical alteration or a radical > development and that this new form of the theory ‚Ä¶ was never committed to > writing by Plato and can be recovered only from the reports of Aristotle ‚Ä¶P. > 10. The first of Cherniss's three Sather Lectures defended the completeness of the dialogues as an account of Plato's philosophy by attacking the external evidence for Plato's \\"Lecture on the Good\\" and his supposed \\"unwritten doctrines\\": > The riddle of the early Academy is epitomized in the discrepancy between > Aristotle's account of Plato's theory of ideas and that theory as we know it > from Plato's writings. To explain that discrepancy, scholars have > constructed the hypothesis of an oral Platonic doctrine. I have tried to > show that that hypothesis is unsatisfactory not only because the evidence > for Plato's one attested lecture fails to support it, but also because the > inconsistency in Aristotle's testimony itself appears to contradict it‚Ä¶P. > 31. In Lecture II, Cherniss defended the consistency of the dialogues by arguing that Plato's supposed late development of a mathematical ontology is a misinterpretation imposed by Aristotle on material found in the dialogues: \\"‚Ä¶ the theory of idea-numbers which Aristotle ascribes to Plato is just Aristotle's own interpretation of the necessary consequences [he finds] implied in the doctrine of the Platonic dialogues ‚Ä¶\\"P. 60. Thus there is no reason, for example, to see a critique of an \\"early\\" Theory of Forms in the dialogues that was remedied by a later mathematical theory. Lecture III was a broad attack on the notion of oral teaching in the Academy: > ‚Ä¶ the inconsistency of Aristotle's own testimony and the discordant opinions > of the different members of the Academy show definitely that Plato did not > himself \\"teach\\" his pupils or associates a doctrine of mathematical objects > at all and did not even resolve their disagreement about the meaning of what > he had written on the subject by laying down an authoritative > interpretation‚Ä¶ All the evidence points unmistakably to the same conclusion: > the Academy was not a school in which an orthodox metaphysical doctrine was > taught, or an association the members of which were expected to subscribe to > the theory of ideas.Pp. 79 and 81. In the course of his lectures, Cherniss also mocked scholars' aggrandizing myths about the nature of Plato's Academy: > ‚Ä¶ in most of the authoritative treatments of Plato, after a scholarly > reference to [Plato's single attested public] lecture on the Good, the > singular becomes an unexplained plural within the paragraph, the lecture a > whole series of lectures, and before the section has been finished we are > being told that Plato gave \\"regular lectures,\\" \\"systematic and continuous > expositions in lecture form on some of the most important points in his > doctrine.\\" This \\"expansion\\" of the evidence -- if I may use the term -- has > been embellished by the different expositors with different details, a > comparison of which would afford a certain cynical amusement to the > historian of critical scholarship.P. 2. Cherniss concluded: \\"The external evidence for the nature of the Academy in Plato's time is extremely slight ‚Ä¶\\"P. 62. Post-War work and the Cherniss‚ÄìOwen Debate Taran summarized Cherniss's later work: > Cherniss's own work after the Second World War was in breadth and quality as > exact, remarkable, and original as his earlier work. Part of it took the > form of long and detailed book-reviews which constitute short monographs > containing important and original research. He also published several long > and masterly articles.

Herm of Plato. The Greek inscription reads 'Plato [son] of Ariston, Athenian' (Rome, Capotiline Museum, 288). The most well-known of Cherniss's post-war publications was his rebuttal of a new attack on Platonic unitarianism that arose in 1953. In a famous paper that explicitly criticized Cherniss, the Oxford philosopher G. E. L. Owen argued that Plato's Parmenides marked a radical change in the Theory of Forms.'The Place of the Timaeus in Plato's Dialogues,' Classical Quarterly, new series, n. 3, 1957 pp. 79 ‚Äì 95, see esp. p. 83. Reprinted in G. E. L. Owen, Science, Logic, and Dialectic (London: Duckworth, 1986), pp. 65 ‚Äì 84. He claimed that Plato did not entirely reject his own theory but instead rejected a symmetrical resemblance relation between particulars and Forms (paradeigmata) as well as the sharp dichotomy between being and becoming. These two doctrines are propounded in the Timaeus, which was then widely considered one of Plato's latest dialogues. Owen, therefore, \\"sought to make his view plausible by proposing to remove the Timaeus from the late group and place it among the middle dialogues, after the Republic but before the Parmenides. Owen launched a many-pronged attack on the traditional late dating of the Timaeus‚Ä¶ [and] attempted to undermine the credibility of the stylometric evidence for the late date of the Timaeus ‚Ä¶\\"William J. Prior, Unity and Development in Plato's Metaphysics (London: Routledge, 1985), p. 3-4. Cherniss's magisterial reply appeared in 1957 and provoked a large and controversial literature on the question.Harold Cherniss, 'The Relation of the Timaeus to Plato's Later Dialogues,' The American Journal of Philology, v. 78, n. 3, 1957, pp. 225-266. According to William J. Prior in 1985, > The exchange between Cherniss and Owen initiated a debate which has > continued to this day. Both positions have won some support, but neither has > emerged victorious from the fray. The work of Ryle and Owen has effectively > destroyed the consensus of scholars on the development of Plato's > metaphysics and the date of the Timaeus, but it has not produced a new > consensus.

Ausland in The Continuum Companion to Plato (London: Continuum International, 2012), p. 286. Controversial legacy * See also Allegorical interpretations of Plato, surveys claims about Plato's esotericism * See also Plato's unwritten doctrines, for a history of the debate One of Cherniss's most lasting influences has been in the debates over the evidence in Aristotle for esoteric interpretations of Plato. Cherniss attacked this evidence directly in his Riddle and broadly aimed to discredit Aristotle's interpretations of Plato in his 1945 book. In the Fifties, however, the so-called T√ºbingen School, initiated by the German scholars Hans Kr√§mer and Konrad Gaiser, resurrected esoteric interpretations of Plato.For a recent introduction and overview, see Dmitri Nikulin, ed., The Other Plato: The T√ºbingen Interpretation of Plato's Inner-Academic Teachings (Albany: SUNY, 2012). For a brief overview, see David J. Murphy's review (which lists the main texts of the T√ºbingen School) of Thomas A. Szlez√°k and Karl-Heinz Stanzel, Platonisches Philosophieren. Zehn Vortr√§ge zu Ehren von Hans Joachim Kr√§mer in the Bryn Mawr Classical Review, http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2002/2002-08-06.html. The T√ºbingen School was famously denounced by Gregory Vlastos in a 1963 review that repeatedly cited Cherniss's earlier work.Gregory Vlastos, review of H. J. Kraemer, Arete bei Platon und Aristoteles, in Gnomon, v. 35, 1963, pp. 641-655. Reprinted with a further appendix in: Platonic Studies (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981, 2nd ed.), pp. 379-403. English-speaking scholars thereafter tended to be skeptical about esoteric interpretations of Plato. Adherents of the T√ºbingen School are common in Germany and Italy but in 2012 Nikulin remarked \\"... the majority of the scholars in the Anglo-American world remain unconvinced that the T√ºbingen interpretation offered a glimpse into the historical Plato.\\"Dmitri Nikulin, ed., The Other Plato: The T√ºbingen Interpretation of Plato's Inner-Academic Teachings (Albany: SUNY, 2012), preface. In a 2014 article entitled \\"Harold Cherniss and the Study of Plato Today,\\" the leading Plato scholar Lloyd Gerson argued that the approaches to Plato shaped by the work of Cherniss and Vlastos have come to dominate contemporary Plato scholarship in the English-speaking world and (wrongly, he argues) led to the dismissal of the T√ºbingen approach that dominates in continental Europe: > While acknowledging the highest level of scholarship in Cherniss's book > Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy, I think the influence of > this book has been largely baleful. Vlastos's review in Gnomon inadvertently > made matters worse ‚Ä¶ The divergence in the work of much European and North > American Plato scholarship since 1950 can be traced, I believe, to the > respect paid or not paid to Aristotle's testimony about Plato's > philosophy.Lloyd P.

He was the father of Felix Mendelssohn, Rebecka Mendelssohn, Paul Mendelssohn and Fanny Mendelssohn. Early life Mendelssohn was born and died in Berlin. The son of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, Abraham is supposed to have complained to a friend, \\"Once I was the son of a famous father, now I am the father of a famous son.\\" By the time of Moses's death in 1786 the Mendelssohn family was well established and wealthy. In line with Moses's ideas that German Jews should participate in German as well as Jewish culture Abraham had a liberal education. He was one of the founding members of the Jewish liberal society Gesellschaft der Freunde in 1792, but also of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin founded in 1793. In 1796 his future wife Lea Salomon, a granddaughter of Daniel Itzig, also joined the Akademie; but they had probably met before that. In 1797 Abraham went to study banking in Paris at the behest of his brother Joseph, who had formed the banking house of Mendelssohn and Friedlaender in association with Daniel Itzig's grandson, Moses Friedlander. French life did not appeal to him. In 1804 Abraham married Lea in Hamburg, where he managed an office of the family bank. Somewhere around this time he seems to have acquired from Lea's acquaintance with the musician Georg Poelchau a number of manuscripts of C. P. E. Bach (of whom Poelchau was the executor), which he gave to his aunt, the musician Sara Levy, who subsequently donated them to the Singakademie. Memorial plaque on the site of the Mendelssohn Bank at J√§gerstra√üe 51, Berlin In 1804, Abraham Mendelssohn became a partner in his brother Joseph's banking company. The cooperation lasted until 1822. The private bank which later was renamed into Mendelssohn & Co., existed on the J√§gerstra√üe in Berlin from 1815 until the end of 1938, when it was liquidated under Nazi pressure. Life in Berlin In 1811 the French occupation of Hamburg and decline of trade caused Abraham and his family to return to Berlin. Both Felix, born 1809, and his elder sister Fanny, born 1805, showed signs of remarkable musical talent and this was encouraged in both of them, although Abraham felt, conventionally, that whilst it might lead to a career for Felix it could only be a pastime for Fanny. He entrusted Felix to the tuition of Carl Friedrich Zelter, who in 1801 had taken over the direction of the Singakademie. He later engaged the pianist Ignaz Moscheles to give his children some lessons, and this led to a lasting association between Moscheles and the family. When Felix made his first visit to England in 1829 Abraham entrusted him to Moscheles's care; and when Abraham himself later visited London he stayed with Moscheles. The Mendelssohn household in Berlin was often the setting for concerts and at many of these semi-domestic occasions the early music of Felix was performed and Felix and Fanny themselves played. Abraham and Lea had two other children: Rebecka (b. 1811), who married the mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and the banker Paul (b. 1812). In 1825 Abraham was elected a town councillor in Berlin. Grave of Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn Bartholdy Abraham and his wife are buried close to three of their children and their graves are preserved in the Trinity Church Cemetery No. 1 in Berlin. Attitude to Judaism Abraham took an uncompromising attitude towards his Jewish origins. He felt that the day of Judaism was over and that it was necessary to take practical steps to assimilate with German society. To this end he and Lea took the (then) daring decision not to have their sons Felix and Paul circumcised after their births in 1809 and 1812 respectively, although this led to arguments with Lea's mother. He further took the advice of Lea's brother Jakob to change his surname. Jakob had adopted the name Bartholdy after a property which he had acquired, and Abraham, too, chose to take this name. As he was to write later to Felix, urging his son to drop the Mendelssohn name and use only Bartholdy because of the fame of Moses Mendelssohn, \\"there can no more be a Christian Mendelssohn than a Jewish Confucius.\\" Despite this, Felix continued to use both names himself, and his public tended to use only 'Mendelssohn'. Abraham's children were brought up at first without any religious education; they were baptised in 1816, and Abraham and Lea were baptised on 4 October 1822 in Frankfurt am Main in the Calvinist French Reformed Church, that is, well away from their friends and relatives in Berlin. Their son Felix later married the daughter of the former minister of that church. NotesSources * Sebastian Hensel, tr.

The choriocapillaris was first described in man by Hovius in 1702, although it was not so named until 1838, by Eschricht. Passera (1896) described its form as star-shaped, radiating capillaries beneath the pigment epithelium of the retina, and Duke-Elder and Wybar (1961) have emphasized its nature as a network of capillaries in one plane. The choriocapillaris serves multiple functions that include sustaining the photoreceptors, filtering waste produced in the outer retina and regulating the temperature of macula. The capillary wall is permeable to plasma proteins which is probably of great importance for the supply of vitamin A to the pigment epithelium . The choroidal blood vessels can be divided into two categories: the choriocapillaris, and the larger caliber arteries and veins that lie just posterior to the choriocapillaris (these can easily be seen in an albino fundus because there is minimal pigment obscuring the vessels).. The choriocapillaris forms a single layer of anastomosing, fenestrated capillaries having wide lumina with most of the fenestrations facing toward the retina. The lumen is approximately three to four times that of ordinary capillaries, such that two or three red blood cells can pass through the capillary abreast, whereas in ordinary capillaries the cells usually course single file. The cell membrane is reduced to a single layer at the fenestrations, facilitating the movement of material through the vessel walls. Occasional (pericyte)s (Rouget cells), which may have a contractile function, are found around the capillary wall. Pericytes have the ability to alter local blood flow. The choriocapillaris is densest in the macular area, where it is the sole blood supply for a small region of the retina. The choriocapillaris is unique to the choroid and does not continue into the ciliary body.

The Court held that the right imposed a duty upon the police to provide information and access to a legal aid lawyer if needed. From this case came the term \\"Brydges Counsel\\" to refer to legal aid lawyers that assist recently arrested individuals. Background William Brydges was arrested in Manitoba in relation to a murder in Edmonton. Upon arriving at the police station Brydges was informed of his right to retain and instruct counsel and gave him the opportunity to contact a lawyer. He was put in an interview room and again was given another chance to contact a lawyer. Brydges asked one of the officers if Manitoba had a Legal Aid service. The officer said that he imagined so, to which Brydges replied \\"won't be able to afford anyone, hey? That's the main thing.\\" The officer asked Brydges if he had a reason to contact a lawyer. Brydges replied \\"Not right now, no\\". After some time in interrogation the accused asked for a Legal Aid lawyer. Once he got in touch with one he was advised not to say anything. At trial, the judge found that Brydges had made a request for a lawyer at the beginning of the questioning, and that the police did not adequately help Brydges in contacting a lawyer when he first asked about Legal Aid. Thus, it was held that the police violated Brydges' right to counsel under section 10(b) of the Charter, and that the statements he made in the interrogation should be excluded under section 24(2). On appeal, the Court set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether there was a violation of section 10(b). Opinion of the Court In a four to three decision, the Court held that there was a violation of section 10(b). Lamer, writing for the majority, held that the police have both a duty to inform an accused of their right as well as provide sufficient information on obtaining advice from duty counsel.

The verse also occurs in the choral lyric of tragedy and comedy, with the same caesura as in the example from Archilochus, as a rule.Aeschylus, Seven Against Thebes 756-7 ~ 764-5, Sophocles, Oedipus Rex 196-7 ~ 209-10, Euripides, Medea 989-90 ~ 996-7, Iphigenia in Tauris 403 ~ 417, Aristophanes, Assemblywomen 580-1. Sicking, Griechische Verslehre, p. 128. Trichas used the name archilocheion for the trochaic trimeter catalectic, ‚Äì u ‚Äì x ‚Äì u ‚Äì x ‚Äì u ‚Äì, seen in Archilochus, fr. 197 West, and used stichically by Callimachus (fr. 202 Pfeiffer).Sicking, Griechische Verslehre, p. 111 In Latin verse In discussion of Horace's poetry, the Greater Archilochian verse (or Archilochian heptameter) consists of four dactyls (or alternatively spondees) followed after a caesura by three trochees, producing the seven-foot scheme ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u  ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì, as in the first line of Horace's Odes 1.4: :Solvitur acris hiems grƒÅtƒÅ vice  vƒìris et Fav≈çni.Allen and Greenough, New Latin Grammar, section 622 As in that ode, Archilochian verses were usually used in distichs with the iambic trimeter catalectic, in which a caesura marked off the identical ending rhythm of the two verses (the trochaic tripody): :Solvitur acris hiems grata vice  veris et Favoni ::trahuntque siccas  machinae carinas, :ac neque iam stabulis gaudet pecus  aut arator igni ::nec prata canis  albicant pruinis.Allen and Greenough, New Latin Grammar, section 626.11 The distich's name reflects the precedent in Archilochus (for example, fr. 188 West). The name Archilochian is also applied to similar combinations of dactylic and trochaic rhythms elsewhere in Horace (Epodes 15, 16, cf. Archilochus fr. 193 West; Epode 11, cf. Archilochus fr. 196 West).D.S. Raven, Greek Metre: An Introduction, London, 1962, pp. 48-50 The minor Archilochian is equivalent to the hemiepes.

In a synchronous system, operations (instructions, calculations, logic, etc.) are coordinated by one, or more, centralized clock signals. An asynchronous system, in contrast, has no global clock. Asynchronous systems do not depend on strict arrival times of signals or messages for reliable operation. Coordination is achieved using event-driven architecture triggered by network packet arrival, changes (transitions) of signals, handshake protocols, and other methods. Modularity Asynchronous systems ‚Äì much like object-oriented software ‚Äì are typically constructed out of modular 'hardware objects', each with well-defined communication interfaces. These modules may operate at variable speeds, whether due to data- dependent processing, dynamic voltage scaling, or process variation. The modules can then be combined together to form a correct working system, without reference to a global clock signal. Typically, low power is obtained since components are activated only on demand. Furthermore, several asynchronous styles have been shown to accommodate clocked interfaces, and thereby support mixed-timing design. Hence, asynchronous systems match well the need for correct-by-construction methodologies in assembling large-scale heterogeneous and scalable systems. Design styles There is a large spectrum of asynchronous design styles, with tradeoffs between robustness and performance (and other parameters such as power). The choice of design style depends on the application target: reliability/ease-of-design vs. speed. The most robust designs use 'delay-insensitive circuits', whose operation is correct regardless of gate and wire delays; however, only limited useful systems can be designed with this style. Slightly less robust, but much more useful, are quasi-delay-insensitive circuits (also known as speed-independent circuits), such as delay-insensitive minterm synthesis, which operate correctly regardless of gate delays; however, wires at each fanout point must be tuned for roughly equal delays. Less robust but faster circuits, requiring simple localized one-sided timing constraints, include controllers using fundamental-mode operation (i.e. with setup/hold requirements on when new inputs can be received), and bundled datapaths using matched delays (see below). At the extreme, high-performance \\"timed circuits\\" have been proposed, which use tight two-side timing constraints, where the clock can still be avoided but careful physical delay tuning is required, such as for some high- speed pipeline applications. Asynchronous communication Asynchronous communication is typically performed on communication channels. Communication is used both to synchronize operations of the concurrent system as well as to pass data. A simple channel typically consists of two wires: a request and an acknowledge. In a '4-phase handshaking protocol' (or return-to-zero), the request is asserted by the sender component, and the receiver responds by asserting the acknowledge; then both signals are de-asserted in turn. In a '2-phase handshaking protocol' (or transition-signalling), the requester simply toggles the value on the request wire (once), and the receiver responds by toggling the value on the acknowledge wire. Channels can also be extended to communicate data. Asynchronous datapaths Asynchronous datapaths are typically encoded using several schemes. Robust schemes use two wires or 'rails' for each bit, called 'dual-rail encoding'. In this case, first rail is asserted to transmit a 0 value, or the second rail is asserted to transmit a 1 value. The asserted rail is then reset to zero before the next data value is transmitted, thereby indicating 'no data' or a 'spacer' state. A less robust, but widely used and practical scheme, is called 'single-rail bundled data'. Here, a single-rail (i.e. synchronous-style) function block can be used, with an accompanying worst-case matched delay. After valid data inputs arrive, a request signal is asserted as the input to the matched delay. When the matched delay produces a 'done' output, the block guaranteed to have completed computation. While this scheme has timing constraints, they are simple, localized (unlike in synchronous systems), and one-sided, hence are usually easy to validate. Literature The literature in this field exists in a variety of conference and journal proceedings. The leading symposium is the IEEE Async Symposium (International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems), founded in 1994. A variety of asynchronous papers have also been published since the mid-1980s in such conferences as IEEE/ACM Design Automation Conference, IEEE International Conference on Computer Design, IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, International Solid-State Circuits Conference, and Advanced Research in VLSI, as well as in leading journals such as IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems, IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, and Transactions on Distributed Computing.

At 175 metres in length, it became the world's largest submarine, a record held along with other Typhoon-class submarines. 1990‚Äìpresent In 1990, it entered the dry dock in Severodvinsk for upgrades and repairs. Due to both economic and technological problems, the completion was severely postponed. In 2000, work on the submarine was intensified. In June 2002, now serving in the Russian Navy, TK-208 finally left the Severodvinsk dry dock. After 12 years of overhaul and modifications, it had now received the name Dmitriy Donskoy, named after the Grand Duke of Moscow Dmitry Donskoy (1359‚Äì1389), the reputed founder of Moscow. The twenty launchers for the R-39 missiles it originally carried were replaced with launchers for the most advanced submarine-launched ballistic missile to date, the RSM-56 Bulava. Although it was built as a third generation submarine, the vessel is now referred to as a fourth-generation submarine due to its extensive modifications. The first launch of a Bulava missile was carried out by Dmitriy Donskoy on 27 September 2005. The vessel was surfaced and fired the missile from a point in the White Sea. On 21 December 2005, the new missile system was tested underwater for the first time. It successfully hit a target on the Kura Test Range on the Kamchatka Peninsula. In August 2009, Patriarch Kirill visited the submarine and met his crewmen. On 9 December 2009, Dmitriy Donskoy launched a Bulava missile. The third stage of the missile failed, and it was visible in Norway making a glowing spiral in the sky. On 7 October 2010, the submarine launched another Bulava ballistic missile from the White Sea. Targets at the Kura Test Range in the Russian Far East were successfully hit.

He was born in London the younger son of Abraham Samuda, and brother of Jacob Samuda. He started out in his father's counting-house, but in 1832 he joined his elder brother to set up Samuda Brothers. Marine Engineering and Shipbuilding Joseph and his brother Jacob set themselves up as marine and general engineers and shipbuilders on the Isle of Dogs. For the first ten years the company principally confined itself to the building of marine engines. In 1843 they entered the ship-building business, and from that time onward, notwithstanding the death of Jacob in an accident on the Thames, the firm was continuously engaged in constructing iron steamships for the Royal Navy, merchant marine, and passenger and mail services, besides royal yachts and river-boats. Many of these vessels were built under Samuda's personal superintendence. In 1860 Joseph helped to establish the Institute of Naval Architects, of which he was the first treasurer and subsequently a vice-president. He frequently contributed to its Transactions. In 1862 he became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, to whose Proceedings he likewise contributed. Atmospheric Railways In 1841 Joseph published A Treatise on the Adaptation of Atmospheric Pressure to the Purposes of Locomotion on Railways Samuda, J. D'A (1841). A Treatise on the Adaptation of Atmospheric Pressure to the Purposes of Locomotion on Railways. London: John Weale, 59 High Holburn. As a result, he was invited by the directors of the London and Croydon Railway to supply equipment to operate their trains on this principle between London Bridge and Epsom. p.5-8. The first stage of this project (between Croydon and Forest Hill) opened in January 1846, but the system of propulsion encountered many problems. The London and Croydon Railway became a part of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway in July, and the new board of directors invited Samuda to operate the new atmospheric railway in return for a fixed fee. However, once further propulsion problems became apparent in the second section of line to be equipped (between Forest Hill and New Cross during 1847 the atmospheric method of propulsion was abandoned and the equipment sold. Political career Joseph Samuda also had an important parliamentary career. He was a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works from 1860 to 1865, whereupon he entered Parliament as the Liberal MP for Tavistock. He sat for that constituency until 1868, when he was returned for the Tower Hamlets, which he represented until 1880. Then he lost his seat owing to his support for Benjamin Disraeli's foreign policy. While in the House he spoke with much authority on all matters connected with his profession. Some of his speeches are described as \\"treasure-houses of technical and political knowledge.\\" He abandoned Judaism and was interred in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. In 1837 he married Louisa Ballin, daughter of Samuel Ballin of Holloway. The Samuda Estate, on the site of his shipyard, in Cubitt Town, is named after him and his brother, and includes Ballin Court, named after his wife, Louisa. They lived at 7 Gloucester Square, Bayswater and had a daughter called Ada. He was one of the original officers of the 2nd Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Corps raised in the East End of London in April 1861, when he was commissioned as a captain.Army Lists.Ray Westlake, Tracing the Rifle Volunteers, Barnsley: Pen and Sword, 2010, , pp. 238‚Äì9.

The conveyor belt ignited on the morning of January 19, 2006, pouring smoke through the gaps in the wall and into the fresh air passageway that the miners were supposed to use for their escape, obscuring their vision and ultimately leading to the death of two of them. The two men, Ellery Hatfield, 47 and Don Bragg, 33, died of carbon monoxide poisoning when they became separated from 10 other members of their crew. The others held hands and edged through the air intake amid dense smoke. At the time of the fire, the mine was owned by Aracoma Coal Company, Inc., which was a Massey Energy affiliated company. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration issued an advisory to its 11 District Offices to check for any missing stoppings in other mines. Inspectors were advised that two such walls‚Äîeach long and high‚Äîwere missing in the Alma mine when investigators arrived. If the wall sections had been in place, they would have prevented any exchange of air between the conveyor belt and the fresh air intake, the primary source of air for workers inside the mine. Instead, investigators now believe, smoke flooded into the air intake, which also serves as an escape route, disorienting two of the miners, who became lost and died in the fire. The accident followed national media attention of the Sago Mine disaster, which occurred earlier in the month. On Jan. 15, 2009, the Charleston Gazette reported that Aracoma widows Delorice Bragg and Freda Hatfield urged Federal District Judge Judge John T. Copenhaver to reject Massey Energy's plea bargain and record-setting $2.5 million fine for criminal charges, the highest fine ever for a mine safety violation. Widow Bragg stated that it was clear \\"that Massey executives much farther up the line expected the Alma Mine to emphasize production over the safety of the coal miners inside.\\" Massey is also required to pay $1.7 million in civil fines for the accident.Aracoma widows oppose Massey plea deal Original link no longer active; article available through Charleston Newspapers archive (fee required). On July 20, 2010, West Virginia residents Michael Plumley, 38, of Delbarton, Donald Hagy Jr., 47, of Gilbert; Edward Ellis Jr., 38, of Justice; and Terry Shadd, 27, of Chapmanville, pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the accident. All four were foremen at the mine and each was charged with failing to conduct escapeway drills as mandated under ¬ß75.383(b). Plumley‚Äôs charge states that, as a section foreman, he did not conduct escapeway drills in the No. 2 Section of the Alma Mine from October 2005 to January 19, 2006. Ellis, a longwall section foreman, was charged with failing to conduct escapeway drills in the longwall section during this same time period. Hagy‚Äôs charge is that, as a foreman, he failed to conduct escapeway drills from June 2005 to October 2005. Shadd‚Äôs charges stem from failing to conduct escapeway drills in the No. 2 Section of the mine from May 2005 to July 2005. On December 9, 2010, Plumley, Hagy, Ellis, and Shadd were each sentenced to one year probation and each was ordered to pay a fine.http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/98286214.html On July 11, 2014, the families of Don Israel Bragg and Ellery Hatfield settled a Federal Tort Claims Act Lawsuit for $1 million with the U.S. government. In addition to the monetary considerations, the United States government and families agreed to the following: 1) The Mine Safety and Health Administration (\\"MSHA\\") will provide plaintiffs with an unredacted copy of the independent review interview given by Richard E. Stickler on November 9, 2007, and Kevin Stricklin on November 7, 2007, as part of the Crandall Canyon Investigation, insofar as they were speaking about Aracoma, but subject to the protective order entered in this action. 2) MSHA will provide plaintiffs with hard copies of and electronic links to Congressional statements and news releases concerning the implementation of the Miner Act for the years 2006 and 2007. 3) MSHA will develop a course at the National Mine Safety and Health Academy open to the nationwide mining community on fire prevention in underground Coal and Non- Metal Mines. On the first day of the class, the Bragg and Hatfield families will be invited as honored guests. During the opening remarks by the Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety & Health, the victims of the Aracoma Fire will be remembered and mentioned as an example of the lives that can possibly be saved through proper fire prevention and fire escape techniques and the reason this course is being offered. The course will highlight innovative techniques, as well as existing safe practices to enhance fire prevention and fire escape and response. 4) MSHA will dedicate a plaque in honor of Bragg and Hatfield; the plaque will be located at the Firefighting Training Pad at the National Mine Academy. The families will be invited to the dedication, which may be done at the same time as the first day of the training class on fire prevention. As further consideration hereof, the plaintiffs hereby agree to dismiss with prejudice all claims asserted by them in Civil Action No. 2:10-cv-0683 pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, and to execute a dismissal order relative to the same, dismissing all claims and causes of action, with prejudice, and with the parties bearing their respective costs and attorney s ' fees.\\"  See also  *2006 Sago Mine disaster *Buffalo Creek flood *Logan Coalfield *Upper Big Branch Mine disaster  References      External links  *2 coal miners found dead.

The firm was the prime focus of the \\"Winebox Inquiry\\" which dealt with, among other things, tax-avoidance arrangements in the Cook Islands. The publicity surrounding the inquiry generated considerable public ill-feeling towards Fay and Richwhite, and was one of the principal reasons for their emigration to Geneva. Fay, Richwhite were investors in the Bank of New Zealand, which was sold to National Australia Bank in 1992. Fay and Richwhite were also involved in a series of transactions between 1986 and 1993 involving their companies European Pacific Investments; Capital Markets; Fay, Richwhite; the Bank of New Zealand; Tranz Rail; and Telecom New Zealand, transactions in which they personally gained over half a billion dollars at the same time as their minority shareholders lost NZD$277 million. Fay and Richwhite also made NZD$274 million from sales of Telecom New Zealand share options in September 1993 without having to put up any capital in advance. Both men relocated to Geneva in the late 1990s and Richwhite has since moved to London. Tranz Rail Fay and Richwhite were advisers to the New Zealand Government on New Zealand Rail Limited from 1990 to 1993 and then distanced themselves from the arrangement to sell the SOE.

The station was originally launched on 873 AM frequency as a local station operated by the government owned Radio New Zealand, the station was originally branded as its callsign 3ZE. The station operated out of the second floor of the former Loan Society Building on Tancred Street, before moving across the road to Highgate House in the early 1990s. Change of ownership In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, the sale included 3ZE. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. In 1998 The Radio Network grouped all their local stations in smaller markets together to form the Community Radio Network. 3ZE continued to run a local breakfast show between 6am and 10am but outside breakfast all stations part of the Community Radio Network took network programming from a central studio based in Taupo. The station added an FM frequency which improved reception and suited the inclusion of a significant amount of music within its programme, becoming 92.5 3ZE FM. 3ZE's AM frequency is now used to re-broadcast Newstalk ZB. Rebranding to Classic Hits 92.5 ZEFM In 2001 the Community Radio Network was discontinued and all stations become part of the Classic Hits FM network, as a result 3ZE was rebranded as Classic Hits 92.5 ZEFM. The station continued to run a local breakfast but now outside breakfast all programming originated from the Classic Hits studios in Auckland. In the early 2010s the station moved to the newly redeveloped Somerset House. Rebranding to The Hits On April 28, 2014 all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm. At this stage breakfast presenter, Phill Hooper, was moved to the 9am-3pm timeslot. Replacement with Hokonui When the station was branded from Classic Hits to The Hits feedback from local listeners in the Ashburton region was not positive, both with the removal of the local breakfast and change in music format. A decision was made later in 2014 to network Gore based radio station Hokonui into the Ashburton market using the 92.5FM frequency and have Phill Hooper present a local breakfast on this station to Ashburton listeners.

The swim ring was derived from the inner tube, the inner, enclosed, inflatable part of older vehicle tires. The inner tube, when inflated, was used as a water toy, and as a floating object to lounge on. The swim ring is not designed to save individuals from drowning. Structure A swim ring consists of two identically-sized layers of flat plastic, one of which contains a valve. The shape of each layer is like a large circle with a smaller, concentric circle removed. The two layers are joined at their inner and outer edges, sealing an air chamber inside. Swim rings (also called \\"swimming rings\\", \\"swimrings\\", \\"inner tubes\\", \\"innertubes\\", \\"rubber rings\\" or \\"floaty/floaties\\") are inflated with air and worn around the user's torso, usually just under the arms or sat upon, to hold the user above the water. They come in a variety of sizes to fit children through adults, though the larger sizes are often called \\"swim tubes\\" or just \\"tubes\\". Classic variants of the swim ring include the ever-popular animal-shaped rings, which include an additional air chamber in the shape of a forward-facing animal head on the upper side of the ring. It may be either an air chamber that directly communicates with the ring, or an independent air chamber with its own contained valve, and a variety of colorful shapes and designs have been produced over the time, ranging from popular characters to water-related animals (flamingos, swans, sea creatures...) or otherwise, and even fantasy creatures such as dragons and unicorns, sometimes featuring additional chambers besides the head one to represent limbs, tails, wings, etc. Although usually small and mostly popular among children, these animal-shaped swim rings have also started appearing in much larger, adult-size designs since 2015. There are also variant forms of tubes like boat and fish available. Other swim ring designs include baby swim neck rings. Use At water parks, these are commonly used on water slides, with a person sitting in the center of the ring, legs and body leaning over the sides. Some designs even appear as more than one tube sewn together, and include 2 or 4 holes so that more than one rider can fit comfortably.

The company is owned by SGO Products Ltd and is a sister company to Pearl and Dean, the worlds longest established cinema advertising sales company. History The company, as Carlton Screen Advertising, was established in 1996 when Carlton Communications purchased the cinema advertising company Cinema Media (formerly RSA), then owned by a venture capital company backed by Shroeders who had bought Rank Screen Advertising from the then beleaguered Rank Group and renamed it eponymously. The Rank Organisation, smarting from a disastrous deal to buy Mecca Bingo Halls, was forced to sell the family silver and first Rank Screen Advertising then Rank Films were sold off followed later by even their prized Odeon circuit itself. Shroeders did spectacularly well out of the deal to buy Rank Screen Advertising as they netted a multi-million pound profit in just three years. However the high purchase price and the increasingly onerous terms of business with the cinema exhibitors led to its eventual sale by ITV to Cineworld and Odeon. On 2 February 2004, Carlton Communications merged with Granada plc to create ITV plc, following which the Carlton name was dropped from all other uses. Until its break-up in 2008, Carlton Screen Advertising was the largest cinema advertising company in the UK. A tough advertising climate in the mid-2000s saw it struggle to make a profit and it was sold on when ITV made the decision to focus on core assets. Break-up and sale The company's UK and Irish operations were separated in mid-2008, when Cineworld Group plc and Odeon Cinemas acquired a 65% majority stake in the UK operation. On 1 January 2009, this was rebranded as Digital Cinema Media. The Irish operation remained as Carlton Screen Advertising, and continued to be wholly owned by ITV plc until May 2009, when it was sold to an Irish Media group with Media Entrepreneur Dermot Hanrahan becoming the Chairman. It continued to use the Carlton branding and on-screen ident until 6 March 2014. Rebranding On 6 March 2014, as part of a ‚Ç¨2 million investment, Carlton Screen Advertising rebranded themselves as Wide Eye Media, which uses digital technology instead of 35mm, which will be used in their 643 screens across Ireland In July 2015 the parent of Wide Eye Media purchased London based Pearl and Dean, with Dermot Hanrahan assuming the position of Chairman. Both companies now control 28% of the cinema market in Ireland and the UK and the only operator active in both Ireland and the UK.  Ident  The ident for Carlton Screen Advertising was usually the first clip to play in a cinema, and consisted of the trademark Carlton star as a brand being put into flames for a few moments, before being removed and thrusted at the screen. Unlike Carlton's TV idents at the time, this was often considered frightening due to its loud, powerful sounds and visuals of flames. The closing ident at the end of the advertising reel would simply display the Carlton star with its flames fizzling out into smoke. Wide Eye Media features a journey through an eye before the slogan \\"See it. Hear it. Feel it.\\" would appear.

Designed by Unceta y Cia, it was a shortened version of the Astra 400 manufactured to fire 9√ó19mm Parabellum, which was the standard pistol ammunition for Germany at the time. The Astra 600 was designated the Pistole Astra 600/43 when used by the German Military during World War II. Approximately 59,400 Astra 600s were manufactured before production ceased. History In 1943 the German government requested Unceta y Cia redesign the Astra 400 to fire the 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridge. In late 1943, fifty examples of the newly designed Astra 600 were sent to Germany and were approved for issue to German armed forces,Gangarosa Jr, GeneSpanish Handguns The History of Spanish Pistols & Revolvers (2001) pp.139 receiving the designation Pistole Astra 600/43.Kinard, JeffPistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact (2003) pp.250 Approximately 50,000 were ordered by Germany, with the first delivery of 2,950 pistols taking place on 16 May 1944. A second shipment of 5,000 pistols reached Germany on 23 June, and a final shipment of 2,500 pistols were shipped to Germany on 16 July 1944.

Those pistols were extensively used by West German police forces until the late 1960s when Interarms purchased the remaining pistols for export to the United States civilian market. Design Modeled off the Astra 400, the Astra 600 had a similar design and internal mechanism to its predecessor. The Model 600 had a hammerless design and fired with an unlocked breech, blowback mechanism. It had an unusually strong recoil spring that caused a stiff trigger pull. The strong spring could make it difficult for individuals with weak hands to retract the slide making disassembly and cleaning difficult. Around fifteen pistols were manufactured to fire .32 ACP.

It is often compared to other judicial philosophies such as judicial activism, judicial originalism, and judicial textualism. Judicial minimalism takes its approach from a limited method of decision-making conceived by Edmund Burke. The minimalist viewpoint Minimalists offer very small, case-specific interpretations of Constitutional Law as an alternative to what they see as the excesses of extremists on both sides. They believe that a stable Constitutional Law is in everybody's interest, and place great importance on the concept of precedent and stare decisis. They argue that only very small interpretations away from precedent, narrowly applied, and based on the general direction of society constitute true judicial restraint rather than any originalist or strict constructionist viewpoint (in opposition to conservatives), while still allowing for a Living Constitution (albeit one with a much slower adaptation than many liberals would like). Depending on the minimalist's particular preferences, a minimalist on the court would be likely to either very slowly bolster or chip away at abortion precedents rather than proclaim a lasting ban on or legalization of abortion via Constitutional rulings. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is often hailed by minimalists as their ideal Justice.Sunstein, Cass (2006). Stanford Law Review, Volume 58, Issue 6 - April 2006, \\"Problems with Minimalism.\\" In a concurring opinion in the 2011 Supreme Court case NASA v. Nelson, Justice Antonin Scalia derided minimalism as a \\"never-say-never disposition [which] does damage for several reasons\\".Volokh, Eugene (2011-01-19) ‚ÄúJudicial Minimalism‚Äù (at Least of One Sort), Pro and Con, Volokh Conspiracy Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, defended the Court's minimalist approach in choosing to \\"decide the case before us and leave broader issues for another day\\". Chief Justice John G. Roberts has been said to operate under an approach of judicial minimalism in his decisions, having stated, \\"[i]f it is not necessary to decide more to a case, then in my view it is necessary not to decide more to a case.\\" Summary and complaints against \\"judicial extremism\\" Largely associated with Cass R. Sunstein, it is a viewpoint which criticizes the more conservative stance of originalism as being judicial activism in disguise. Minimalists believe that a faithful application of originalist theory would result in a system of constitutional law in which modern societal standards would be ignored, in favor of the now- antiquated opinions held by the Founding Fathers, probably including their views on gender equality, racism, and other things, which modern society would find objectionable. Minimalists claim that conservatives who subscribe to originalism are likely to ignore precedent where it is convenient for conservative political aims. Minimalists also criticize traditional liberal judicial activism as overexpansive and as ignorant of precedent when it is convenient to liberal political aims.

It operated from 1911 until 1933 and linked the city of WhangƒÅrei to the nearby harbour in Onerahi.  History  In the early 1880s, a wharf near the city of WhangƒÅrei had been established in the upper reaches of WhangƒÅrei Harbour. Roughly 20 years later the maintenance bill was rising and the wharf's inadequacies were being revealed as it was too shallow for some vessels to access. The deep-water wharves in nearby Onerahi were considerably more desirable, and in 1899 approval was granted to extend the railway from WhangƒÅrei to Onerahi. It took until July 1901 for construction to get underway, and in May 1902 a contract was let to build a bridge across WhangƒÅrei Harbour. It was 323 metres long with a central lifting span, and completed in 1904. It was not long before the bridge was nicknamed the Gull Roost, for obvious reasons. Some work continued for two years after the bridge was finished, but construction ground to a halt in 1906 and no more work was done for four years. It recommenced during 1910 and the line was finished the next year. It came into the possession of the Railways Department on 2 October 1911. At this time, it was the southern end of the isolated WhangƒÅrei railway network, which extended northwards to ≈åkaihau and Opua, and construction of the North Auckland Line that would link the isolated section to Auckland and the national rail network was underway.  Operation  For over a decade, the Onerahi Branch was a very busy line. When it opened, the primary method of transport between Auckland and Whangarei for both passengers and freight involved a steamer between Auckland and Onerahi and the train from Onerahi to WhangƒÅrei. Trains ran to connect with the steamers, with both dedicated goods services and \\"mixed\\" trains for both passengers and freight operating. In 1925, the North Auckland Line was completed, establishing a direct railway link from WhangƒÅrei to Auckland. This was far superior to the coastal steamers and both passenger and freight traffic on the Onerahi Branch rapidly spiralled downwards. The condition of the wharf was also declining, and when the Great Depression set in there was no reason to continue operating the railway. It closed on 30 June 1933. In 1937, the wharf was removed.  The branch today  Unfortunately, the Gull Roost bridge no longer exists, but some of the track has been converted into a public walking track, the Waimahanga Walkway. It includes footbridges over two creeks using the former railway bridge piers. Some formation not used by the walkway is also visible.  Similar proposals  In the 1970s, two proposals to build a similar branch line from WhangƒÅrei to a deepwater port were made. This line was to closely follow the route of a much earlier proposed line that was nearly built. In 1914, a railway was surveyed to run south from WhangƒÅrei to Waipu, and although World War I delayed the start of any work, the construction of formation was in progress in 1920. However, in 1924, construction was abandoned without any track being laid as road transport was beginning to compete with rail and an insignificant branch to serve local farming interests was no longer seen as necessary. Many years later, a deepwater harbour was established at nearby Marsden Point as an oil port, and after the 1973 oil crisis it was proposed to convert the nearby Marsden B Power Station to use coal from the Waikato. The railways have always carried significant tonnages of Waikato coal, and this proposal would have certainly required a railway link had it come to fruition. In 1979 it was suggested that Marsden Point could be used for forestry export, and a 14-kilometre branch from the North Auckland Line was proposed, but it was not built. In 2007, however, the proposal was revived, and the Northland Regional Council is currently negotiating land purchases which would allow the link to be constructed.Northland Regional Council Notes and references= Notes  References  * * Leitch, David, and Scott, Brian; Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, Grantham House, 1998 revised edition  Further reading  * Hermann, Bruce J; North Island Branch Lines p 5 (2007, New Zealand Railway & Locomotive Society, Wellington) Category:Railway lines in New Zealand Category:WhangƒÅrei Category:Rail transport in the Northland Region Category:Railway lines opened in 1911 Category:Railway lines closed in 1933 Category:1911 establishments in New Zealand Category:Closed railway lines in New Zealand ","title":"Onerahi Branch"},{"id":"3801305","text":"Adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency is a result of a decreased or absent production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland.It can be associated with TBX19.

Educated at King's College, Auckland and the University of Otago, where he graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree, Richwhite's personal wealth was largely acquired during the late 1980s and early 1990s. During this period he had a significant and controversial role in the structural adjustment of the New Zealand economy undertaken by the Fourth Labour Government. Fay, Richwhite & Company was the prime focus of the \\"Winebox Inquiry\\" which dealt with, among other things, tax-avoidance arrangements in the Cook Islands. The publicity surrounding the inquiry generated considerable public ill-feeling towards Fay and Richwhite. Based in Geneva from 1998‚Äì2003, Richwhite now lives with his family in London. Fay Richwhite David Richwhite and Sir Michael Fay formed Fay Richwhite in 1973 which grew to become one of the leading merchant banks in Australasia during the 1980s and 1990s, with offices in New Zealand, Australia and London. Whilst their business encompassed the full range of investment banking and trading services across many sectors, Fay Richwhite became most well known for its role in the privatisation of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in New Zealand. During the late 1980s Fay Richwhite advised the New Zealand government on a number of asset sales and ultimately organised and co-invested in consortia which purchased some of these assets including: * The Bank of New Zealand in 1989, in which Fay Richwhite purchased a 32% share via their company Capital Markets * Telecom New Zealand in 1991 for NZD$4.5 billion with Ameritech * Bell Atlantic and Freightways * New Zealand Rail in 1993 for NZD$410 million with Wisconsin Central and Berkshire Partners. Fay Richwhite went on to invest alongside Wisconsin Central, Berkshire Partners and Goldman Sachs in the purchase of four of the five United Kingdom national rail companies being privatised in 1996.Wisconsin Central decides: It's the English Welsh & Scottish Railway The Railway Magazine issue 1142 June 1996 page 8 Forming English, Welsh & Scottish Railway, the company ran 95% of British rail freight until it was sold to Deutsche Bahn in 2007.EWS sold to German Railways The Railway Magazine issue 1276 August 2007 page 6 Fay Richwhite was active throughout the 1980s and 1990s in other business activities including: * Early-stage financing of the New Zealand film industry * Oil exploration off the Taranaki coast (floating Cultus Petroleum) * Early- stage financing of New Zealand's kiwifruit, apricot and deer farming industries * Pioneering of the Eurokiwi bond market * Acting as government advisor on forestry assets, the Tourist Hotel Corporation, the Government Printing Office, and Housing Corporation assets. Richwhite personally chaired a steering committee which advised the New Zealand government on the sale of the state-owned Post Bank and was Deputy Chairman of the New Zealand Business Round Table from 1990 to 1997. In the late 1990s Fay Richwhite was sold to various partners. Throughout the 1990s Richwhite was consistently listed as one of New Zealand's wealthiest businessmen with an estimated personal wealth of NZD$660 million. He now co-owns Great Mercury Island with business partner Sir Michael Fay. The Winebox Inquiry: Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters relating to Taxation In 1994, a Commission of Inquiry was undertaken in New Zealand to investigate claims of corruption and incompetence in two government entities: the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and Inland Revenue Department (IRD). The inquiry centred on a transaction carried out between a subsidiary of European Pacific Investments (EPI), a company directed by Richwhite and three others, and the Cook Islands Government. In September 1986 European Pacific Investments was incorporated. One of its directors, David Lloyd, was responsible for convincing the Cook Islands Government to establish a tax haven. EPI's subsidiary company, Magnum, paid the Cook Islands Government NZD$2 million and received a tax certificate which was presented to the tax office in New Zealand. Once presented, EPI received a rebate of the same amount (NZD$2 million). The net effect of the transaction was that the EPI group effectively paid the Cook Islands Government NZD$50,000 but received a New Zealand tax credit of NZD$2 million. The transaction at the centre of the inquiry was named the \\"Magnum\\" transaction after the EPI company involved. The subsequent inquiry was spearheaded by politician Winston Peters and is commonly referred to as the \\"Winebox Inquiry\\" in reference to Winston Peters' delivery of the documents central to the allegations to Parliament in a winebox. Although the Commission concluded that there was no fraud or incompetence, controversy surrounded the ruling. Changes to the New Zealand tax laws relating to the claiming of foreign tax credits were made and new rules relating to disclosure to the Inland Revenue Department and penalties for non-compliance were introduced. Securities Commission case In June 2007, Richwhite and Midavia Rail Investments, a company he co-owned with Michael Fay, were investigated by Securities Commission of New Zealand for accusations of insider trading relating to Tranz Rail. Richwhite and Fay settled with the Commission out of court for NZD$20million without admission of liability. Their joint statement read: \\"While they consider the settlement amount does not properly reflect the lack of merit in the Commission‚Äôs proceedings, the settlement payment is only a little over half the amount claimed by the Commission, including interests and costs. It is less than 1/5 of the Commission‚Äôs maximum claim at the time it commenced proceedings. It is also at a proportionately lower level than the settlements the Commission reached with all the other defendants. Importantly, it is also reached without any admission of liability. The fact that the Commission was prepared to settle for substantially less than the full claim and without any admission of liability no doubt reflects the Commission‚Äôs recognition that it faced a risk of losing if the claim went to trial\\".http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0706/S00263.htm America‚Äôs Cup and other sporting interests Sir Michael Fay and David Richwhite backed and led the first three New Zealand challenges for the coveted America's Cup sailing trophy in 1987, 1988, 1992. They personally invested over $100 million toward the cause. Following the 1988 \\"Big Boat\\" challenge they briefly won the cup, later losing it in the courts to the San Diego Yacht Club. New Zealand went on to win the trophy in 1995, a campaign in which Fay and Richwite were not involved. In 1988 the pair led a team to San Francisco for the World One Ton Cup which they won in Bruce Farr designed \\"Propaganda\\" (KZ 6161). Fay and Richwhite also funded the Manu Samoa Rugby Team for several years following the team running into financial difficulty. The ownership and control of the team has now been handed back to the Samoa Rugby Union.http://www.eventpolynesia.com/news&info;/nz/galleryarchive/NZ2_page_gal18mar07.htm Philanthropy Richwhite has been active in his support for and participation in numerous not-for-profit, cultural and community initiatives, including: * Being a benefactor of the \\"Play it Strange\\" Trust for which the David Richwhite Lyric Award was created * Sponsoring a new high-performance rowing centre at University of Otago * Founding and sponsoring the Fay Richwhite Corporate triathlon series in New Zealand and Australia * Patronising New Zealand's exhibition at the Venice Biennale in 2009 * Formerly acting as Chair of the Ellerslie Flower Show * Gifting a KZ1 (yacht) to the Auckland Maritime Museum * Donating to Women's Refuge, the Salvation Army, Starship Hospital and Westpac Rescue Helicopter. Great Mercury Island In 1978, Fay and Richwhite purchased Great Mercury Island, which lies eight kilometres off the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula. The island's northern half is primarily farmland which supports both sheep and beef farming operations. Its southern half has been re-vegetated with pine and native trees. Richwhite's wife Libby has overseen the planting of over 600,000 native trees on the island as well as a conservation programme to preserve many of the island's rich historic and archaeologically significant MƒÅori Pa and heritage sites. Groups helping children at risk are often invited to make use of the island's facilities for their camps. Given the island's isolation, land has also made available for a team of scientists breeding a strain of bee immune to the destructive Varroa mite infestation currently affecting the worldwide bee industry. On 30 November 2009, Great Mercury Island hosted the first successful launch of Rocket Lab's suborbital Atea-1 sounding rocket.

A. R. Kitson and Theo Alice Ruggles, was an American sculptor.  Life  Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson, a woman of the century Kitson was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Cyrus W. and Anna H. Ruggles. As a young child she displayed artistic talent, but when her mother attempted to enroll her in the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, she was informed that she was too young to be admitted. Her mother then approached other schools, which gave her the same advice. One of the school directors, however, suggested that she find a tutor for her and pointed her in the direction of a rising star, Henry Hudson Kitson. She began studying with sculptor Henry Hudson Kitson in 1886, and married him in Boston in 1893 in the social event of the season. They had three children together, sons Theo and John and daughter Dorothy. In 1888, she won honorable mention at the Salon des Artistes Francais, becoming the youngest woman, and the first American woman, ever to receive the honor. She was lionized when she returned to the United States for this award and was asked to comment on everything from the state of American art to men's fashions. In 1895 she was the first woman to be admitted to the National Sculpture Society. In the early 1900s, she designed seventy-three sculptures now located at various sites within Vicksburg National Military Park. Predominantly busts and portrait reliefs honoring the general officers from both sides that fought there, Kitson is the most prolific of the artists represented there. The Massachusetts state monument, dedicated on November 14, 1903, was the first state monument to be placed and dedicated in the park. After the Kitsons separated in 1909, she moved to Farmington, where she maintained a studio until her 1932 death in Boston, Massachusetts. Her work is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. In the course of her career she created many public monuments, both in conjunction with her husband and on her own. Her best known statue is The Hiker, a monument commemorating the soldiers who fought in the wars of the United States' turn of the 20th Century Manifest Destiny territorial expansion, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and the Boxer Rebellion. Around 50 versions of this work can be discovered spread over much of the United States.  World's Fairs  Kitson exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. She was one of four female painters or sculptors who exhibited more than three works of art, including: A New England Fisherman (1892); On the Banks of the Oise (1889); Portrait Bust of an Italian Child (ca. 1887); and Young Orpheus (ca. 1890).National Museum of American Art; National Portrait Gallery (Smithsonian Institution) (1993).

The Shuvalov brothers were two sons of a general who commanded the castle of Vyborg and governed Arkhangelsk during the reign of Empress Anna. They were the closest aides to Elizabeth Petrovna during the 1741 coup d'etat that brought her to the throne. Alexander, in particular, persuaded many of his fellow imperial guards to join Elizabeth's cause. He was rewarded for his allegiance with the rank of Chamberlain in 1741 and the title of count in 1746. For many years Shuvalov presided over the Secret Chancellory, a sort of political police whose victims included his personal enemies, Field-Marshals Bestuzhev and Apraksin. By the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Shuvalovs successfully eliminated all their political rivals and virtually monopolized state power. They also flirted with the future Peter III of Russia, hoping to retain their positions after his eventual accession to the throne. Their intrigues succeeded in 1761 when Peter III assumed the throne and promoted both Shuvalovs to Field Marshals, although they had never taken part in any war. But their careers were undone within a year, as the throne was usurped by Peter's wife Catherine, who detested the Shuvalovs for their pernicious influence on her husband and even accused in her memoirs Alexander Shuvalov of plotting to murder her. Thereupon Shuvalov retired from service and withdrew to his villages. His only daughter was the wife of Count Golovkin.

It was founded by a British brewer, Samuel Smith, who emigrated to Australia with his family from Wareham, Dorset in August 1847 aboard the ship China. Upon arriving in Australia in December, Smith built a small house on the banks of the River Torrens. He lived there less than a year before moving north to Angaston where he purchased a block of land on the settlement's south eastern boundary.

There is a radio mast on the roof, which increases the height of the tower to 105 meters (350 feet). , Cibona Tower is ranked 3rd by height (2nd when you include the antenna) in Croatia. The tower is a part of the complex that comprises lower business objects, a 5,400-seat basketball hall, and an art installation. The skyscraper is a cylinder, 25 meters (83 ft) in diameter, which reduces its diameter in four stages, and ends up with a radio mast. The facade is derived in dark steel, totally reflective glass, and black granite. The windows are not fixed. The first stage ends up on the 21st floor, second on the 23rd floor, third on the 24th floor, and the fourth on the 25th floor. The rim of the tower is held by the 26 reinforced concrete pylons, which make it resistant to a 7¬∞ Richter scale earthquake, and the impact of a smaller airplane.  History  The tower was built in 1987 because of the Universiade that was held in Zagreb that year. The architect responsible for its design is Marijan Hr≈æiƒá.

He was elected to the Iraqi Council of Representatives as an independent in the December 2005 election and was once again elected in the 2014 Iraqi parliamentary election as part of the Civil Democratic Alliance which is an Iraqi political coalition formed by various liberal and civil figures and his party one seat, represented by himself. He arrived fifth place in Baghdad out of seventy-one seats. He is a Sunni Muslim Arab politician and supports a close alliance with the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Turkey and Israel.Iraqi's warmth to Israel exacts a heavy price, International herald Tribune, 2008-09-21 Early life Alusi was born on the 23 May 1953 in Alus, a small village near Haditha, in Al Anbar Governorate.Dissident Watch: Mithal al-Alusi The Middle East Quarterly Al-Alusi hails from a very prominent Iraqi Sunni family from Anbar, and his father was a renowned scholar and Baghdad University professor of Classical Arabic literature. Life in exile In 1976, he was sentenced to death in absentia while studying in Cairo for trying to undermine Saddam Hussein. Alusi was then a member of the Ba'ath Party, but had been aligned with opponents of Saddam within the party such as Abdel- Khaliq Al-Samara'i, who was himself killed by the security services. Alusi went into exile in Germany and worked as a businessman. In December 2002, he was involved in the takeover of the Iraqi embassy in Berlin to protest Saddam's tyranny, and was convicted of hostage taking by a German court and sentenced to three years in jail. His sentence was later reduced to house arrest. He returned to Iraq in October 2003 and joined the Iraqi National Congress.http://www.nysun.com/article/8374?page_no=3 Return to Iraq After the invasion of Iraq, Alusi was appointed the General Director of Culture and Media at the Supreme National De-Baathification Commission. In September 2004, after making a public visit to Israel, al-Alusi was expelled from the Iraqi National Congress and sacked from his job at the De-Baathification Commission. He was indicted by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq for \\"having contacts with enemy states\\", a crime under a 1969 Baathist law.Iraqi Indicted for Proposal to Open Talks With Israel, New York Times, 2004-10-06, accessed on 2008-09-15 He was subsequently released after the Iraq's Federal Supreme Court, Iraq's highest court, ruled in his favour on 24 November 2008, stating it was no longer a crime to travel to Israel, and that Iraqis could travel to wherever they wanted. This led him to establish the Democratic Party of the Iraqi Nation, which ran in the January 2005 election. It received only 4,500 votes, far from enough to gain a seat in the Council of Representatives. However, his list won 36,000 votes, enough to obtain one seat for Baghdad Province, in the December 2005 election. On February 19, 2005, Al-Alusi's car was ambushed by armed assailants in the Hayy Al-Jami'a neighborhood of Baghdad. His two sons Ayman, 29, and Jamal, 24, were killed in the attack, as well as one of his bodyguards.

He praised Israel, saying \\"In Israel, there is no occupation, there is liberalism\\" and criticised Iran, saying it was continually meddling in Iraq. He called for intelligence sharing between Iraq, Israel, the United States, Jordan, Turkey, and Kuwait. When he returned, the National Assembly of Iraq voted to remove his parliamentary immunities and ban him from travelling. The Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Safaaeddine al-Safi, said he would seek a prosecution for \\"visiting a country that Iraq considers an enemy\\". Such a crime can carry the death penalty.Iraq may execute MP for Israel visit, Jerusalem Post, 2008-09-22 Alusi appealed to the Supreme Federal Court who overturned the lifting of his immunity, ruling that it was unconstitutional as no crime had been committed.Iraqi court clears lawmaker of charge of visiting Israel: his lawyer, Xinhua, 2008-11-24 In a series of interviews from September to December 2009 he stated that \\"We are receiving information which says Iran is so close to producing an atom bomb\\" and that \\"the international community, don't realize how close [the Iranians] are to the goal\\". However, al-Alusi, asked whether his sources are members of the Iranian government, or Iranian nuclear scientists, said that he could not be more specific, but that they are \\"people who are part of the system in Iran.\\" He further stated, that a military operation is the best solution to face the Iranians and that an attack should better happen sooner than late.Maverick Iraqi politician claims Iran could go nuclear within weeks, JPost.com (December 25,2009) After the 2010 Iraqi parliamentary elections, the Mithal al-Alusi List which had won one seat during the December 2005 elections for Mithal al-Alusi himself, claimed the elections were rigged against liberals like himself, by Iran and Saudi Arabia as he lost his seat in parliament. Alusi claimed there were major discrepancies between the vote count according to the IHEC and his own monitors. He also claimed village directors prevented women from voting in rural areas. He called on the United States to launch an investigation to the allegedly fixed election results. A recount of the votes in Baghdad was ordered by the Supreme Court on 19 April 2010. The recount began on 3 May 2010. On 14 May IHEC announced that after 11,298 ballot boxes had been recounted, there was no sign of fraud or violations. The Supreme Court later ratified the results and as a result Mithal al-Alusi lost his seat. In August 2012 he received a letter informing him that he was to be dispossessed of his home in the Baghdad Green Zone, so that the house could go to the Minister of Environmental Affairs.Exclusive: Iraqi Ally of Israel Dispossessed of his Home, he Says by Iraqi PM Maliki The Algemeiner 2014 Parliamentary election The party participated in the April 2014 Iraqi parliamentary election, as part of the Civil Democratic Alliance which is an Iraqi political coalition formed by various liberal and civil figures.

The game has been indexed by the German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons which means that it is forbidden to distribute the game in Germany.  Gameplay  The goal of the game is to keep the camp functioning by keeping the \\"public opinion\\" or other important resources and gauges over or under a certain threshold. In one version, public opinion rises when the \\"manager\\" executes a number of prisoners with Zyklon B. However, ordering said gas costs money, which can be gathered by forcing the prisoners to work. Spending too much time without a \\"sufficient\\" number of executions makes \\"public satisfaction\\" drop, and having too few working prisoners will soon drive to a resource shortage, and closing of the camp, thus losing the game. Also, prisoners must be \\"purchased\\" by the camp's \\"manager\\", and the corpses of the deceased prisoners must be disposed of (the game describes them as \\"M√ºllberg\\", German for \\"garbage mountain \\" or \\"pile of garbage\\"), an operation which also has an associated cost. Like other resource management games, this means that ultimately the goal of the game is trying to find an optimal balance and timing between expenses, income, actions and \\"production goals\\", although with a highly controversial twist.  History  In 1991, The New York Times reported that \\"KZ Manager,\\" was one of about 140 games with similar themes. Austrian newspapers reported that a poll of students in one city found 39 percent knew of the games and 22 percent had encountered them. \\"KZ\\" is the German shorthand for concentration camp.  Versions  Each game version was released several times and began to circulate in Austria and Germany during the 1990s; the earliest versions being DOS, text mode games, graphical DOS versions as well as a Windows version called \\"KZ manager millennium\\". According to a 1991 article written by Linda Rohrbough, an Amiga version has been found to exist. Gameplay and graphics of the Amiga version and its 256 color DOS port were far more advanced than in the original C64 game.

All types may be highly decorated, most characteristically with reliefs in bands or friezes running round the vessel. Decorated Iron Age situlae in bronze are a distinctive feature of Etruscan art in burials from the northern part of the Etruscan regions, from which the style spread north to some cultures in Northern Italy, Slovenia, and adjacent areas, where terms such as situla culture and situla art may be used. Situla is also the term for types of bucket-shaped Ancient Greek vases, some very finely painted.MFA Boston, Attic vase situla More utilitarian pottery situlae are also found, and some in silver or other materials,Kipfer, 518 such as two glass ones from late antiquity in St Mark's, Venice. Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern shapes tend to have a pointed bottom, so that they must rest on a stand or on their side. The practical wider shape is a European invention, first seen in the European Bronze Age. Iron Age Europe Typical Iron Age situlae are bronze, as in the types of libation vessels found as grave goods in Etruscan graves, the Este culture (example, the Situla Benvenuti) and neighbouring Golasecca culture, and the eastern zone of the Hallstatt culture of Central and Southeast Europe. Here they have a distinctive style, often without a handle; the Vaƒçe situla is a Slovenian example. These usually have sides sloping outwards, then a sharp turn in at the shoulder, and outside Etruria often a short narrower neck. The shape has similarities with the narrower spouted Etruscan shape of flagon that was also copied to the north, as in the 5th- century Basse Yutz Flagons found in France. They are often decorated, in the most elaborate examples with several bands of figures running round the vessel. They may or may not have handles, and sometimes have lids.Megaw, 34-39 Many are made of several sheets held together with rivets.Sandars, 223 The Etruscan examples are most characteristic in the 7th century BC, though continuing well afterwards. They are in various materials, from pottery to bronze, and sometimes silver. The Situla of the Pania is an unusual luxury Etruscan example in ivory, and the Bocchoris vase a ceramic import from Egypt from an Etruscan burial. The Este and Hallstatt examples are later, with the Slovenian production reaching a peak in quality in the 5th century, up to about 400 BC, well after the Hallstatt period had ended over much of its area.Megaw, 34-39 Some were found containing cremated ashes, but they were essentially luxury vessels used at feasts.Sandars, 224 Numerous Hallstatt situlae were found in Slovenia, mainly (19 of them) in the area of Novo Mesto in Lower Carniola, which has been named the \\"City of Situlae\\" due to this. Japodian burial urns made by the Japodes tribe of Illyrians are a 5th-century BC extension into modern Bosnia of this style. Later Etruscan and then Roman styles favoured a simple shape curving from the base, becoming vertical at the top, with a wide mouth and no shoulder, but sometimes a projecting rim. These had a variety of uses, including for washing and bathing. Any decoration was often concentrated on the upper part of the sides. Situla art Situla art was an important means of transition of Greek-derived motifs from the Etruscans through the regions to the north to the emerging La T√®ne culture further west.Sandars, 223-225; Megaw, 34-39 According to Ruth and Vincent Megaw, \\"Situla art depicts life as seen from a masculine viewpoint, in which women are servants or sex objects; most of the scenes which include humans are of the feasts in which the situlae themselves figure, of the hunt or of war\\".Megaw, 37 Similar scenes are found on other vessel shapes, as well as bronze belt-plaques.Sandars, 223-224 The processions of animals, typical of earlier examples, or humans derive from the Near East and Mediterranean, and Nancy Sandars finds the style shows \\"a gaucherie that betrays the artist working in a way that is uncongenial, too much at variance with the temper of the craftsmen and the craft\\". Compared to earlier styles that arose organically in Europe \\"situla art is weak and sometimes quaint\\", and \\"in essence not of Europe\\".Sandars, 225, quoted Except for the Benvenuti Situla, men are hairless, with \\"funny hats, dumpy bodies and big heads\\", though often shown looking cheerful in an engaging way. The Benevenuti Situla is also unusual in that it seems to show a specific story.Sandars, 224 File:S√≠tula de bronze, vaixella per a beure, tomba 504 de Hallstatt.JPGImported (?) bronze from Hallstatt, 800-750 BC File:Situla da tomba dei flabelli a poggio della porcareccia (populonia), 700-550 ac ca..JPGEtruscan with geometric ornament, 700-550 BC File:Museo archeologico di Firenze, pisside da Chiusi, terzo quarto del VII sec. a.c..JPGEtruscan \\"Situla della Pania\\", 7th century BC File:Situla in argento placcata oro con iscrizione plikasnas, da chiusi, 650 ac ca. 01.JPGEtruscan, silver, Chiusi, c. 650 BC File:Situla con lamine d'argento stampate, da tomba regolini-galassi di cerveteri, 650 ac ca. 02.JPGEtruscan, with silver mounts, Cerveteri c. 650 BC File:K√§rl af brons (situla) med drifna ornament, Nordisk familjebok.jpgClearer reproduction of the Etruscan bronze situla at the top of the page.

This rounded shape, often with a \\"nipple\\" at the bottom (see Luristan example in gallery), is believed to have represented the female breast.Witt, 55. Isis situla These were also donated to temples as votive offerings by devotees. Christian situlae Elaborate early medieval situlae were Christian liturgical objects used to hold holy water, also usually of bronze, and straight-sided with a handle. An aspergillum was dipped in the situla to collect water with which to sprinkle the congregation or other objects. Four richly carved ivory examples from the 10th century are known: the Basilewsky Situla of 920 in the Victoria & Albert Museum, decorated with twelve scenes from the Life of Christ on two levels (it contains one of the very few depictions of Judas Iscariot showing remorse and throwing the thirty silver coins on the floor of the Temple),Basilewsky Situla V&A; Museum the \\"Situla of Gotofredo\\" of c. 980 in Milan Cathedral,image of Milan situla one in the Aachen Cathedral Treasury,Image of Aachen situla and one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Metropolitan Museum example All came from the milieu of the Ottonian court: an inscription says that Archbishop Gotfredus presented the Milan example in anticipation of a visit by the Emperor,Lasko, 92-3 also referred to in the London example which was possibly from the same workshop.Though Lasko, 92 disagrees with this. The latest and most lavish is the Aachen example, which is studded with jewels and shows an enthroned Emperor, surrounded by a pope and archbishops. This was probably made in Trier about 1000.All except the New York situla are illustrated and discussed in Beckwith, pp.129-130, 135-136 Outside Europe The term may also be used for similar vessels from other cultures, especially the ancient Middle East and China and Vietnam.Metropolitan, Vietnamese bronze situla Bronze bath buckets are also found in Islamic art, such as the 12th century Persian Bobrinsky Bucket in the Hermitage Museum.

Restoration by the architect Carlo Scarpa between 1959 and 1973 has enhanced the appearance of the building and exhibits. Scarpa's architectural style is visible in the details for doorways, staircases, furnishings, and even fixtures designed to hold a specific piece of artwork. The renovation carefully balanced new and old, revealing the history of the original building where appropriate. Unusual at the time, this approach has now become a common approach to renovation. Collection  The museum displays a collection of sculpture, statues, paintings, ancient weapons, ceramics, goldworks, miniatures and some old bells. Sculptures, mostly from the Romanesque period of Verona, include: *Sepulchre of the Sts. Sergius and Bacchus, basrelief from 1179. *\\"Crucifix\\", a 14th-century tuff work by the so- called Master of Sant'Anastasia, from the church of San Giacomo in Tomba. *\\"St. Cecilia and Catherina\\", from the same Master of St. Anastasia. *Equestrian statue of Cangrande I della Scala, coming from complex of the Scaliger Tombs. Paintings include: *Madonna of the Quail by Pisanello *Madonna of the Rose Garden by Stefano da Verona or Michelino da Besozzo *Crucifixion and Madonna dell'Umilt√† by Jacopo Bellini *Madonna with Child by Gentile Bellini *Madonna of the Oak by Girolamo dai Libri *Holy Family by Andrea Mantegna There are also numerous paintings and frescoes from the 14th century.

Aside from a lengthy solo career, he has been a member of such Icelandic bands as Utangar√∞smenn and Eg√≥.  Personal life  Bubbi was born in Reykjav√≠k to a Danish mother and a half-Norwegian father. Bubbi is a common nickname for √Åsbj√∂rn. He developed a strong addiction to cocaine and alcohol in his youth, later in life he became an advocate for sobriety and addiction prevention. In 2018 he published the poetry book Rof about the sexual abuse he was a victim of as a child. In 1973 (at the age of 17), Bubbi became a migrant worker. In 2004, the documentary Blindsker about the life of Bubbi was released. In 2020, a musical based on the life of Bubbi, named (\\"Nine Lives\\") was shown in Reykjav√≠k City Theatre. Career Bubbi recorded his first solo album in 1979, a blend of rock, blues and reggae, and published it the following year as √çsbjarnarbl√∫s. ;In Utangar√∞smenn His first important band was Utangar√∞smenn (The Outsiders), a punk band that led the new wave movement in Iceland. The band was formed with Michael D. Pollock (Mickey Dean), Daniel Pollock (Dirty Dan), drummer Magn√∫s Stef√°nsson and bassist R√∫nar Erlingsson. Utangar√∞smenn gained renown in Iceland by means of extensive press coverage and several gigs, including three at Laugardalsh√∂ll, Iceland's biggest sports arena, where one of the gigs they performed was as supporting band for The Clash. Bubbi left the band after the fourth album, √ç Upphafi Skyldi Endinn Sko√∞a in 1981, and the others continued the band with the new name \\"Bodies\\". ;In Eg√≥ At that time, Bubbi and his brother, Berg√æ√≥r, were joined by bassist √ûorleifur Gu√∞j√≥nsson, and formed the band Eg√≥. The band had their first tour in Reykjav√≠k when Magn√∫s Stef√°nsson and T√≥mas Magn√∫s T√≥masson replaced departing original band members. The band's debut album, Breyttir T√≠mar, released 1 April 1982, became one of the best-selling albums in Icelandic music history, climbing to second place on the Icelandic album chart, and staying in the top ten for 19 weeks. During the promotional tour for the album in Iceland, √ûorleifur left the band and was replaced by R√∫nar Erlingsson. Eg√≥ followed up with √ç Mynd the same year and it was considered better than the previous album. With this release, Eg√≥ toured Scandinavia, where Magn√∫s decided to leave the band and was replaced by J√∂kull √ölfsson, and the band was extended once more with the addition of Gunnar Rafnsson on keyboards. Internal conflicts led the band to break up but, having signed a contract under which they were obliged to release another album, they did not split up until after releasing their final work in 1984. Bubbi left Iceland and the musicians continued along different paths. In 2001, Eg√≥ reunited to release a compilation under the title of Fr√° upphafi til enda. ;In Das Kapital Later in 1984, Bubbi returned to Iceland and formed a rock and roll band called Das Kapital and released an album called Lili Marlene; the band broke up afterwards. ;Solo In 1985, he signed with Swedish record label Mistlur, and released Frelsi til S√∂lu (Freedom for Sale) which brought further commercial success. D√∂gun (Dawning), was released in 1987, and became a smash success. Bubbi's popularity was finally established in 1990 with the release of S√∂gur af Landi, which received good reviews. ;In MX-21 Towards 1987 Bubbi joined guitarist √ûorsteinn Magn√∫sson (former member of √ûeyr), Jakob Sm√°ri Magn√∫sson (former bassist of Tappi T√≠karrass), drummer Halld√≥r L√°russon and keyboardist T√≥mas Magn√∫s T√≥masson to form a new group called MX-21. The band collaborated with Megas and Sykurmolarnir (later known as The Sugarcubes) on Skytturnar, the soundtrack to the film directed by Fri√∞rik √û√≥r Fri√∞riksson. ;Solo By the early 1990s, Bubbi was planning to record a Spanish-language album; this work was consolidated with the release of Von (Hope), which was recorded in Cuba with the band Sierra Maestra. In 1993, Bubbi moved towards a mellower country music style with the release of L√≠fi√∞ er Lj√∫ft (Life is Good), and in 1994 experimented with rap music in the album 3 Heimar (3 Worlds). ;In G.C.D. In the 1990s, Bubbi joined R√∫nar J√∫l√≠usson to form a rock band called G.C.D. He recorded a tribute album for his beloved crooner uncle, Haukur Morthens, and a spoken word album of original poetry in 1996. In 1998, Arfur (Heritage), an album featuring traditional Icelandic rhymes and ballads, was released.

Plot (of the original Swedish version) While traveling in Sweden, Diane Wilson meets up with her uncle, famous geologist Dr. Vance Wilson (Robert Burton), who has come there to help investigate the recent landing of what appears to be a large meteorite. Diane is courted by her uncle's associate, Dr. Erik Engstrom (Sten Gester), though she aggressively plays hard-to-get, at first. A romance develops, and eventually their journey is interrupted by the news of a large herd of mutilated reindeer in Lapland. Both scientists immediately fly there, far north in the Arctic mountains of Lapland, near the site of the meteorite crash. To the irritation of both scientists, Diane stows away aboard their aircraft. When they arrive, the meteorite is actually determined to be a round alien spaceship, and she suddenly realizes just how dangerous a decision she has made. An enormously tall, hairy biped creature, with powerful jaws, tusks, and large round feet, under the control of three humanoid aliens in the spaceship, comes out of nowhere and begins menacing the scientists and the native Laplanders. The tall beast destroys the scientists' aircraft, killing the soldier guarding it, and begins tearing apart Laplander houses with its bare hands. As Dr. Engstrom and Diane are trying to ski away to safety, the hairy monster attacks again and is able to capture Diane. She screams and faints. Meanwhile, a search party has been formed, now carrying torches as night begins to fall. They hear Diane's screams and go toward the sound. Dr. Engstrom arrives and watches as the hairy monster carries her off. He hurries toward the torch-carrying Laplanders and tries to alert Dr. Wilson, who is with them, that the creature now has Diane. Carrying her to the snow-buried alien spaceship, the extraterrestrial monster suddenly begins displaying tenderness toward his captive, a result of mind control exerted over the creature by the humanoid aliens. She runs into an adjoining ice cave and screams and faints again when the aliens come near. The aliens leave the cave and see the mass of lighted torches coming their way. The hairy monster picks up Diane and heads away from the buried spaceship. The Laplanders give chase and are finally able to confront the huge creature, who is now standing with its back to the edge of a deep snow cliff. Angry villagers begin throwing their fire torches, and the tall monster carefully places Diane on the ground, where she is able to roll a few feet away. More torches are thrown and the hairy creature catches on fire, falling backward over the cliff to a fiery death down below. The aliens take off in their spaceship, returning the way they came. Diane and Erik walk off into the sunset, in love. Cast *Barbara Wilson as Diane Wilson *Sten Gester as Erik Engstr√∂m *Robert Burton as Dr. Frederick Wilson *Bengt Blomgren as Col.

The scene switches to two doctors discussing the strange case of a patient named Diane Wilson (Barbara Wilson). A third doctor comes into the office holding a skull and proceeds to lecture the other two on how the human ear functions. A flashback sequence begins by showing the audience Diane Wilson's earlier UFO incident: While asleep in her bed, the young woman experiences an extraterrestrial visit, awakening to a horrible, ear-splitting sound that only she can hear. Overcome by confusion, panic, and pain, she runs outside in her nightgown and sees a weird light in the sky. By the time paramedics arrive and take her to the hospital, she is in a catatonic state and no longer able to explain what she has experienced. Doctors cannot explain her mysterious condition. Local newspaper headlines wonder if what happened has something to do with a reported UFO sighting in the same area that night. Before this can be determined, she recovers completely, leaves the hospital, and flies to Sweden. At this point, the storyline of the original Swedish film begins.Henenlotter, Frank (2001).

Posvar Hall seen from Schenley Plaza in Apr, 2007 Wesley W. Posvar Hall (WWPH), formerly known as Forbes Quadrangle, is a landmark building on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. At it is the largest academic-use building on campus, providing administrative offices, classrooms, lecture halls, a food court, and computer labs. The hall sits on the former site of Forbes Field, and contains several artifacts, including the former stadium's home plate and one of two surviving Langley Aerodromes. Posvar Hall houses Pitt's School of Education, College of General Studies, Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, University Center for International Studies, and the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences's social sciences departments.  Construction  Posvar Hall Posvar Hall was designed by a consortium of architects, including Louis Valentour of Johnstone Newcomer & Valentour, who worked under the watch of university consultant Max Abramowitz. Construction began in 1975PhotoStandalone 8 -- No Title; New Pittsburgh Courier (1969‚Äì1981); Dec 20, 1975; ProQuest Historical Newspapers Pittsburgh Courier: 1911‚Äì2002; accessdate=2008-08-18 and was completed in 1978 with the dedication occurring on October 19, 1978. The building sits on the former site of Forbes Field baseball stadium and beside the university's Hillman Library on the corner of Schenley Drive and Roberto Clemente Drive, with Bouquet Street running along its west side. Enclosed passageways connect Posvar Hall to David Lawrence Hall, the Barco Law Building, and the Litchfield Towers. Posvar Hall was designed in the Brutalist style and is constructed with concrete with a limestone exterior. Its height was limited to five stories so it would not compete with The Carnegie Institute directly across Schenley Plaza. Construction costs exceeded $38 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Its floor space slightly exceeds that of the Cathedral of Learning. It has 2,000 windows, 574 offices, 30 seminar rooms, three lecture halls, one mile of corridors, and nearly 500 parking spaces in a two-level garage below the facility. Posvar Hall Galleria on the first floor is often used as meeting space and contains several lounge areas on the second floor. Home plate of Forbes Field can be seen near the middle of the photo. The central area of the interior space is called the Galleria and contains various artwork including Virgil Cantini's mural Enlightenment and Joy and one of Samuel Pierpont Langley's aerodromes. Escalators transport individuals between floors. Originally named Forbes Quadrangle, it was renamed on October 21, 1999, by the university's board of trustees in honor of Wesley W. Posvar (1925‚Äì2001), the 15th chancellor of the university. Forbes Field The building stands on the original site of Forbes Field, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team from 1909‚Äì1970 and, at various times, the Pittsburgh Steelers, Homestead Grays, and Pitt's own football team. The stadium was dismantled starting in July 1971, and construction on the new building started soon afterwards and continued until 1974. The building incorporates many reminders of the famous ballpark‚Äîthe home plate of Forbes Field remains near its exact spot, protected under plexiglass. The outfield wall is outlined in the sidewalk by bricks, and the portion of the famously deep left-center field wall still stands across the street, marked \\"457 Feet\\". Originally, the classrooms were numbered to reflect the seating section of the old stadium where each classroom was located. However, this system confused people, and was changed in 2004 to a standard four-digit numbering system.  Art  left Virgil Cantini's colorful porcelain enamel on steel mural Enlightenment and Joy (1977) is on display on the ground floor. The piece is an example of Cantini's use of circles, representing the earth, moon, and sun, an artistic trend inspired by the Apollo moon landings. The work was created to honor former University Chancellor Edward Litchfield, who died in a plane crash in 1956. Cantini's 1965 steel rod and multicolored glass sculpture New Horizons, Skyscape is also on display near room 1500. The sculpture was donated to the university by the Joseph Horne Company from its department store in the South Hills Village mall where it had previously been on display. Tony Smith's 1971 painted steel sculpture Light Up!, commissioned by Westinghouse and originally displayed in downtown Pittsburgh, can be found outside Posvar Hall, between it and Hillman Library. Donated to and re-installed at Pitt in 1988, it was temporarily loaned to the Museum of Modern Art and displayed in front of the Seagram Building in New York City for a 1988 Tony Smith retrospective. Aerodrome Samuel P. Langley Aerodromes, Aerodrome No. 6, can be seen inside Posvar Hall. Behind the aerodrome, a portion of Virgil Cantini's mural Enlightenment and Joy can be seen. One of two surviving Langley Aerodromes, Aerodrome No. 6 dating from 1896, is displayed in the ground floor lobby amid various artworks and sculptures. The Aerodrome was an experimental aircraft commissioned by the United States Army from former Pitt professor and Smithsonian Institution Secretary Samuel Langley. It flew in November 1896, further proving (after the success of No. 5 in May) the feasibility of engine-driven heavier-than-air flight. The aircraft was restored in part by Pitt engineering students. Fabric on the wings and tail is the only new material, however; the tail and several wing ribs were rebuilt using wood provided by the Smithsonian Institution and dating from the same time period. The restoration was completed over two years and the plane placed on display in Posvar Hall in 1980.  Gallery  right The home plate from Forbes Field is embedded in the ground floor Image:Wesley W.

EINE also made use of the window system of the Lisp machine and was the first Emacs to have a graphical user interface. In the 1980s, EINE was developed into ZWEI. Innovations included programmability in Lisp Machine Lisp, and a new and more flexible doubly linked list method of internally representing buffers. ZWEI would eventually become the editor library used for Symbolics' Zmacs (Emacs-like editor), Zmail (mail client), and Converse (message client), which were integrated into the Genera operating system which Symbolics developed for their Lisp machines.

The bulldog boss pushes a button that carries him through a trapdoor below the worker's desk, and replaces him with a robot that writes faster. Another yawns, and is also dropped through a trapdoor under his desk and replaced by a robot. Three more are eliminating for drinking water, sneezing and injury (one of them desperately plugs his nose with two pencils, but is unable to keep from sneezing, propelling the pencils into another's head). They are replaced by more robots. The remaining worker, madly scribbling away, is shocked to discover that his boss has been replaced by a boss robot. When the latter leaves, the last worker decides to take action, and begins destroying the robots in various cartoony ways (blowing one up with a stick of dynamite, dropping another through its desk trapdoor, yet another by hitting it with different objects, and electrically shocking another into a pile of cinders).

In order to get above the Earth's atmosphere, which is opaque to X-rays, X-ray telescopes must be mounted on high altitude rockets, balloons or artificial satellites. The basic elements of the telescope are the optics (focusing or collimating), that collects the radiation entering the telescope, and the detector, on which the radiation is collected and measured. A variety of different designs and technologies have been used for these elements. Many of the existing telescopes on satellites are compounded of multiple copies or variations of a detector-telescope system, whose capabilities add or complement each other and additional fixed or removable elements (filters, spectrometers) that add functionalities to the instrument. Optics The most common methods used in X-ray optics are grazing incidence mirrors and collimated apertures. Focusing mirrors NuSTAR, has captured these first, focused views of the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy in high-energy X-ray light. The utilization of X-ray mirrors allows to focus the incident radiation on the detector plane. Different geometries (e.g. Kirkpartick-Baez or Lobster-eye) have been suggested or employed, but almost the totality of existing telescopes employs some variation of the Wolter I design. The limitations of this type of X-ray optics result in much narrower fields of view (typically <1 degree) than visible or UV telescopes. With respect to collimated optics, focusing optics allow: * a high resolution imaging * a high telescope sensitivity: since radiation is focused on a small area, Signal-to-noise ratio is much higher for this kind of instruments. Focusing X-rays with glancing reflection The mirrors can be made of ceramic or metal foil coated with a thin layer of a reflective material (typically gold or iridium). Mirrors based on this construction work on the basis of total reflection of light at grazing incidence. This technology is limited in energy range by the inverse relation between critical angle for total reflection and radiation energy. The limit in the early 2000s with Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories was about 15 kilo-electronvolt (keV) light.NuStar: Instrumentation: Optics Using new multi-layered coated mirrors, the X-ray mirror for the NuSTAR telescope pushed this up to 79 keV light. To reflect at this level, glass layers were multi-coated with tungsten (W)/silicon (Si) or platinum (Pt)/silicon carbide(SiC). Collimating optics While earlier X-ray telescopes were using simple collimating techniques (e.g. rotating collimators, wire collimators), the technology most currently used on present days employs coded aperture masks. This technique uses a flat aperture patterned grille in front of the detector. This design results less sensitive than focusing optics and imaging quality and identification of source position is much poorer, however it offers a larger field of view and can be employed at higher energies, where grazing incidence optics become ineffective. Also the imaging is not direct, but the image is rather reconstructed by post- processing of the signal. Detectors Several technologies have been employed on detectors for X-ray telescopes, ranging from counters like Ionization chambers, geiger counters or scintillators to imaging detectors like CCDs or CMOS sensors. The use of micro-calorimeters, that offer the added capability of measuring with great accuracy the energy of the radiation, is planned for future missions. Missions employing X-ray telescopesHistory of X-ray telescopes The first X-ray telescope employing Wolter Type I grazing-incidence optics was employed in a rocket-borne experiment on October 15 1963 1605 UT at White Sands New Mexico using a Ball Brothers Corporation pointing control on an Aerobee 150 rocket to obtain the X-ray images of the Sun in the 8‚Äì20 angstrom region. The second flight was in 1965 at the same launch site (R. Giacconi et al., ApJ 142, 1274 (1965)). The Einstein Observatory (1978‚Äì1981), also known as HEAO-2, was the first orbiting X-ray observatory with a Wolter Type I telescope (R. Giacconi et al., ApJ 230,540 (1979)). It obtained high-resolution X-ray images in the energy range from 0.1 to 4 keV of stars of all types, supernova remnants, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. HEAO-1 (1977‚Äì1979) and HEAO-3 (1979‚Äì1981) were others in that series. Another large project was ROSAT (active from 1990‚Äì1999), which was a heavy X-ray space observatory with focusing X-ray optics. The Chandra X-Ray Observatory is among the recent satellite observatories launched by NASA, and by the Space Agencies of Europe, Japan, and Russia. Chandra has operated for more than 10 years in a high elliptical orbit, returning thousands 0.5 arc- second images and high-resolution spectra of all kinds of astronomical objects in the energy range from 0.5 to 8.0 keV. Many of the spectacular images from Chandra can be seen on the NASA/Goddard website. NuStar is one of the latest X-ray space telescopes, launched in June 2012. The telescope observes radiation in a high-energy range (3‚Äì79 keV), and with high resolution. NuStar is sensitive to the 68 and 78 keV signals from decay of 44Ti in supernovae. Gravity and Extreme Magnetism (GEMS) would have measured X-ray polarization but was canceled in 2012.

Named for Germany (Deutschland in German), the ship was laid down in the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London in 1872. The ship was launched in September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet in July 1875. Deutschland mounted a main battery of eight guns in a central battery amidships. She was the last capital ship built for the German Navy by a foreign ship-builder; all subsequent ships were built in Germany. Deutschland served with the fleet from her commissioning until 1896, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted with the exception of the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean, often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits. Deutschland was rebuilt in the early 1890s as an armored cruiser, though she was too slow to perform satisfactorily in this role. Nevertheless, she spent three years in the East Asia Squadron before returning to Germany in 1900. She was used in secondary roles after 1904, until 1908 when she was sold and broken up for scrap.  Design  Line-drawing of SMS Deutschland The two Kaiser-class ironclads were authorized under the naval program of 1867, which had been approved by the Reichstag to strengthen the North German Federal Navy in the wake of the Second Schleswig War, when the weak, then-Prussian Navy had been unable to break the blockade imposed by the Danish Navy. Designed by Edward James Reed in 1869, the ships were among the most powerful casemate ships built by any navy, though they were rendered obsolescent by the time they were completed by the advent of the turret ship. Deutschland was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. Deutschland was powered by one 2-cylinder single-expansion steam engine, which was supplied with steam by eight coal-fired trunk boilers. The ship's top speed was , at . She was also equipped with a full ship rig. Her standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 568 enlisted men. She was armed with eight L/20 guns mounted in a central battery amidships. As built, the ship was also equipped with a single L/22 gun. After being rebuilt in 1891‚Äì1895, her armament was increased by six L/22 and one 8.8 cm L/30 guns, four and later twelve auto-cannons, and five torpedo tubes, all mounted in the ship's hull. Deutschlands armor consisted of wrought iron; her armor belt was thick, above which a strake of armor that was thick protected the main battery guns. Her main armor deck was thick.  Service history  Deutschland in her original configuration Deutschland was ordered by the Imperial Navy from the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London, UK; her keel was laid in 1872. Deutschland and her sister Kaiser were ordered shortly after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, under the assumption that the French would quickly attempt a war of revenge. The ship was launched on 12 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 20 July 1875. She was the last German capital ship built by a foreign shipbuilder. Following her commissioning in July 1875, a German crew sailed Deutschland to Germany. She arrived too late, however, to participate in the annual summer training maneuvers. The ship was ready for the 1876 maneuvers; the squadron consisted of Deutschland, her sister , and the older ironclads and , commanded by Rear Admiral Carl Ferdinand Batsch. At around the time Batch's squadron was working up for the summer cruise, the German consul in Salonika, then in the Ottoman Empire, was murdered. Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared, and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean Sea to stage a naval demonstration in June 1876. After arriving with the four ironclads, he was reinforced by three unarmored vessels. After the threat of violence subsided in August, Batsch departed with Kaiser and Deutschland; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean for the rest of the summer. Port Arthur, China For the 1877 maneuvers, the new turret ironclad replaced Kronprinz. The squadron was again sent to the Mediterranean, in response to unrest in the Ottoman Empire related to the Russo-Turkish War; the violence threatened German citizens living there. The squadron, again under the command of Batsch, steamed to the ports of Haifa and Jaffa in July 1877, but found no significant tensions ashore. Batsch then departed and cruised the Mediterranean for the remainder of the summer, returning to Germany in October. The newly commissioned and , sister ships of Preussen, replaced Deutschland and Kaiser in the 1878 maneuvers, during which Grosser Kurf√ºrst was accidentally rammed and sank with great loss of life. Deutschland and her sister Kaiser remained in reserve for the next six years. They were reactivated in the spring of 1883 for the summer maneuvers under the command of Wilhelm von Wickede. Due to their long period out of service, their engines proved troublesome during the training cruise. Indeed, the maneuvers were temporarily put on hold when the steam plants in Deutschland, Kaiser, and Kronprinz broke down. Regardless, the 1883 cruise was the first year the German navy completely abandoned the use of sails on its large ironclads. Deutschland went into reserve during the 1884 maneuvers, which were conducted by a homogenous squadron composed of the four s. marines from Deutschland enlarging the long pier in Tsingtao; Deutschland is visible in the distance The ship did not see active duty again until the summer of 1889, when Deutschland joined the fleet that steamed to Great Britain to celebrate the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II; the ship joined her sister Kaiser and the turret ships Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse in II Division. The fleet then held training maneuvers in the North Sea under command of Rear Admiral Friedrich Hollmann. Deutschland and the rest of II Division became the training squadron for the fleet in 1889‚Äì1890, the first year the Kaiserliche Marine maintained a year-round ironclad force. The squadron escorted Wilhelm II's imperial yacht to the Mediterranean; the voyage included state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire. The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890, when it returned to Germany. Deutschland participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control in the summer of 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. II Division, including Deutschland, served as the training squadron in the winter of 1890‚Äì1891. The squadron again cruised the Mediterranean, under the command of Rear Admiral Wilhelm Schr√∂der. During the winter of 1892‚Äì1893, Deutschland participated in a training squadron alongside the old ironclad and the new coastal defense ships and . The squadron carried over for the fleet maneuvers during the summer of 1893, when they were joined by the four Sachsen-class vessels. In November 1893, the Deutschland, K√∂nig Wilhelm, and Friedrich der Grosse were joined by the brand-new pre-dreadnought battleship , under the command of Otto von Diederichs. The squadron participated in the fall maneuvers in 1894, which simulated a two-front war against France and Russia; Deutschlands squadron acted as the Russian fleet during the exercises. Between 1894 and 1897, Deutschland was rebuilt in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven. The ship was converted into an armored cruiser; her heavy guns were removed and replaced with lighter weapons, including eight and eight guns. Her entire rigging equipment was removed and two heavy military masts were installed in place of the rigging. Despite the modernization, she remained quite slow. Kaiser and the old ironclad K√∂nig Wilhelm were similarly converted. Deutschland rejoined the fleet on 25 January 1897. Deutschland as an armored cruiser Following Diederichs's seizure of Kiautschou Bay in November 1897, Deutschland, the protected cruiser , and the light cruisers and reinforced the East Asia Cruiser Division. The arrival of the four ships allowed the division to be expanded to the East Asia Squadron. Prince Heinrich, with his flag aboard Deutschland, departed Germany in December 1897 with Gefion; the two ships arrived in Hong Kong in March 1898. Prince Heinrich took the two ships on a tour of Asia, culminating in a state visit to Peking in April. While most of the Squadron went to the Philippines to safeguard German interests during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the summer of 1898, Deutschland, Gefion, and remained in Chinese waters. On 14 April 1899, Diederichs left the East Asia Squadron; command passed to Prince Henry and Deutschland became the Squadron flagship. Deutschland remained on the East Asia station until early 1900, when she travelled via the Mediterranean and Portsmouth to Kiel. After returning to Germany, Deutschland was used as a harbor ship, starting on 3 May 1904. She was renamed Jupiter on 22 November of that year. On 21 May 1906, the ship was stricken from the naval register and used briefly as a target ship in 1907. The Kaiserliche Marine sold the ship in 1908 for 120,000 marks; she was broken up for scrap the following year in Hamburg-Moorburg.

Manufacturing of bicycles began in 1878 in Hartford, Connecticut, at the Weed Sewing Machine Company factory. Pope manufactured bicycles, motorcycles, and automobiles. From 1905 to 1913, Pope gradually consolidated manufacturing to the Westfield Mass plant. The main offices remained in Hartford. It ceased automobile production in 1915 and ceased motorcycle production in 1918. The company subsequently underwent a variety of changes in form, name and product lines through the intervening years. Yet all the way up to present-day, bicycles continue to be made available under the Columbia brand. Early years Illustration of Pope Manufacturing Company from Frank Leslie's Pope Manufacturing Company was listed in the 1876 Boston City Directory, located at 54 High Street. In March 1877, the company drafted incorporation documents in Connecticut, naming Albert Pope, Charles Pope, and Edward Pope as shareholders. At the time of incorporation, Albert Pope held 595 shares, his father Charles held 400 shares, and his cousin Edward held five shares. The incorporation documents stated the company's intended business activities, \\"[to] make, manufacture and sell and licence to others to make, manufacture and sell air pistols and guns, darning machines, amateur lathes, cigarette rollers and other patented articles and to own, sell and deal in patents and patent rights for the manufacture thereof.\\" Pope Manufacturing Company was already selling air pistols and cigarette rolling machines. Though Pope Manufacturing had filed for incorporation in Connecticut, it continued to base its offices and many of its operations in Boston.Epperson (2010), pp. 2223. Albert and Edward Pope operated a factory at 87 Summer Street in Boston as early as 1874 for the production of hand-held cigarette rolling machines.Epperson (2010), p. 21. Bicycles=Imports and the first Columbias 1885 Advertisement for the Columbia brand Columbia ordinary, circa 1886 Albert Pope started advertising imported English bicycles for sale in March 1878. His initial investment in the Pope Manufacturing Company was $3,000 (USD), or worth about $125,000 in the early 21st century. He invested about $4,000 in 1878 to import about fifty English bicycles. In May 1878, he met with George Fairfield, president of Weed Sewing Machine Company. Albert Pope was inquiring about manufacturing his own brand of bicycles, proposing a contract with Weed to build fifty bicycles at its plant in Hartford, Connecticut, on behalf of Pope Manufacturing. Pope had ridden an imported Excelsior Duplex model penny farthing to the meeting, which Fairfield inspected. At that time, sewing machines were selling poorly, so Fairfield accepted the contract.Epperson (2010), pp. 29‚Äì31. In September 1878, Weed Sewing Machine Company built the last of the fifty bikes under the first contract. Albert Pope chose the brand name Columbia for the first high- wheelers \\"produced\\" by Pope Manufacturing. These first machines, copied from the Excelsior Duplex model, were made from seventy-seven parts that were made in-house, and only the rubber tires purchased from a supplier. Pope Manufacturing sold all its bicycles from the first production run. In 1879, production and sales were around 1,000, the last year of the Excelsior Duplex copies.Epperson (2010), p. 31. George Herbert Day worked as a clerk at Weed Sewing Machine Company when the company started producing high-wheelers for Pope Manufacturing. In early 1879, Day was promoted to corporate secretary. One historian characterized Day as \\"Albert Pope's right-hand man in Hartford between 1878 and 1899.\\"Epperson (2010), pp. 3133. Albert's cousin Edward started work as the Pope Manufacturing bookkeeper in 1880.Goddard (2000), p. 71. George Bidwell, an independent salesman from Buffalo, New York, purchased an imported Excelsior Duplex high-wheeler from Pope. Learning in a correspondence from Pope that he would be producing his own bicycle, Bidwell started taking orders for the Columbias. Bidwell sold seventy-five of the machines, holding down payments for each. Pope could only deliver about twenty-five. Shortly later, Pope hired Bidwell as Superintendent of Agencies, a job sending Bidwell on the road to teach sale agents the art of promotion. Bidwell taught agents how to promote the sport through riding halls and schools.Epperson (2010), p. 65. Redesigning the ordinaries In 1880, George Fairfield introduced design changes and proposed two ordinary Columbia models. Each weighed about forty-one pounds and featured an improved seat- spring and an improved head-adjustment. The Standard Columbia with a forty- eight inch wheel was introduced in 1880 priced at $87.50. The Special Columbia offered \\"a closed Stanley-style head,\\" a \\"built-in\\" ball-bearing assembly, and full nickel-plating for $132.50.Epperson (2010), pp. 3233. In 1881, Pope gained controlling interest of Weed, catalyzing a fifteen-fold increase in Weed's stock price. George Day was promoted to president of Weed.Goddard (2000), p. 70. After the introduction of the high wheeler, Pope bought Pierre Lallement's original patent for the bicycle, and aggressively bought all other bicycle patents he could find, amassing a fortune by restricting the types of bicycles other American manufacturers could make and charging them royalties. He used the latest technologies in his bicycles‚Äîinventions such as ball bearings in all moving parts, and hollow steel tubes for the frame, and he spent a great deal of money promoting bicycle clubs, journals, and races. Safety bicycles Columbia Model 40 Mens Safety Bicycle, 1895 Columbia Model 41 Ladies Safety Bicycle, 1895 An 1895 ad for Columbia Bicycle Ordinaries (high-wheelers or penny farthings) were driven by cranks and pedals attached directly to an oversized front wheel. The rider was seated over the wheel, just aft of the wheel hub. Many mishaps included the projection of the rider head-first over the handle bars: an event occurring with enough frequency to earn the name, header. Several manufacturers created safety models, which denoted a low-mount bicycle. Motive force came from cranks applied to a sprocket and chain creating an indirect drive to one of the wheels. The first commercially viable model was John Kemp Starley's Rover, drawing interest starting in 1885. The early Rover featured a complicated indirect steering system, but Starley replaced it with a direct steering system consisting of a single curved bar attached to the head. In 1886, after seeing some Rovers and touring a Rover-factory, Alfred Pope claimed that the safety bicycle was nothing more than a fad, and made no plans at that time to produce his own version. George Bidwell, by this time an independent agent again, recommended the safety after trying the mount in 1886.Herlihy (2004), pp. 235241. He urged Pope to design its own safety bicycle while predicting \\"the old high wheel was doomed.\\"Epperson (2010), p. 84. However, Pope did offer a safety ordinary model in 1886. This design retained the high-mount and oversized front wheel, but incorporated a chain drive to the front wheel, allowing the seating position and cranks to be positioned further back. Despite the new Columbia offering, Bidwell claimed that he never ordered another high-wheeler after trying the Rover. By 1888, Pope had reversed course and produced its own safety, the Veloce. It weighed , or heavier than its ordinary. In 1889, ordinaries only accounted for twenty percent of sales, dropping to ten percent of sales the next year. Once Pope offered the Veloce for sale, the company sold only 3,000 ordinaries through 1891.Epperson (2010), pp. 8485. Pope Manufacturing was an innovator in the use of stamping for the production of metal parts. Until 1896, the company was the leading US producer of bicycles. Hartford Cycle Company At a time when Pope charged $125 for a Columbia, Overman Wheel Company was marketing a bicycle for wage workers, who might earn $1 per day. Instead of reducing cost and price on the Columbias, Pope decided to produce a separate line to compete with Overman.Goddard (2000), pp. 8788. Around 1890, Pope started another manufacturer, Hartford Cycle Company in order to create a new line with a mid- price niche. He installed his cousin George to run the plant. He transferred David J. Post from Weed to serve as secretary for Hartford. MIT-graduate Harry Pope, Albert's nephew, was Hartford's superintendent. Pope Manufacturing subsumed Hartford Cycle Company in 1895.Goddard (2000), pp. 237240. Steel tubing Ordinaries had used a heavy pipe, but the safeties used twenty-seven feet of tubing: solid round bar would weigh down the machine. Safeties required thin, high-strength steel tubing. Almost all the Pope manufacturing facilities were located in Hartford in an area previously known for gun- making. Like bicycles, rifle barrels required thin, high-strength tubes, so the skills and processes of rifle manufacturing were related to the manufacturing of steel tubing for safety bicycles. Importing tubes cost an American manufacturer a forty-five percent import tariff, thus creating a financial incentive for domestic production. The sudden popularity of safety bicycles in the United States created a shortage of tubing supply for manufacturers, both in Europe and the United States. Albert Pope had invested in Shelby Steel Tubing, even while building two steel tubing factories in Hartford, owned by Pope Manufacturing. One was an experimental facility, and the other for commercial production.Epperson (2010), pp. 109111. Two Pope employees, Henry Souther and Harold Hayden Eames, collaborated on a new process for producing bicycle tubing. Souther had been experimenting with stress tolerances of different metals, and concluded that steel with five- percent nickel alloy would be ideal for bicycle tubing. At the time, this metal was only available in sheet form. Eames devised a process for converting metal sheets into billets, which could be cold-drawn through dies with methods and equipment already in use at the Pope tube works. The new tubing was stronger and more resistant to dents than the carbon-steel that was commonly used.Epperson (2010), pp.112116. Hartford Rubber Works Pope Manufacturing acquired the Hartford Rubber Works in 1892 as part of a vertical integration strategy. Founded by John Gray in 1885, Hartford Rubber Works imported raw material from Sumatra and produced solid tires. Later the factory produced cushion and pneumatic tires.Goddard (2000), p. 209. Motorcycles 1914 Pope motorcycle Pope began manufacturing motorized bicycles in 1902 and continued with motorcycles until 1918. Mopeds (late 20th century) 1978 Columbia moped Columbia mopeds were the first mopeds ever assembled in the United States, even though the motor and some parts were outsourced. The tubular frames, seats, fenders, wheels, hubs, brakes, front fork assembly, headlight, and wiring harnesses were made in the United States. The majority of Columbia mopeds were powered with a 47cc Sachs 505/1A, though some were powered by a Solo motor. Even though the Sachs 505/1A motor is designed for rear coaster-brakes, Columbia chose to use a Magura hand lever and cable for the rear brake. * There are two models that are the most abundant frame types for Columbia, both of which went by the same name of Columbia Commuter. The pressed steel frame was Sachs-powered only, while the tube frame model had either the Sachs or the Solo motor. * The top-tank Columbia Medallion, also known as the Western Flyer, is a unique design for Columbia mopeds. Essentially, the frame of the bike is identical to the tube frame Commuter, but it has a plastic gas tank that reaches from the seat to the steering column. * The \\"Western Flyer\\" name came on all frame types, and is not specific to any model. These bikes were sold under the name \\"Western Flyer\\" instead of Columbia. In the late 1980s, Columbia sold the rights and design of their mopeds to a company, KKM Enterprises, Inc. that produced identical mopeds under the name Mopet into the mid-1990s. This company produced the tubular frames, long seats, fenders, wheels, hubs, brakes, front fork assembly, headlight, and wiring harnesses in the United States.

By 1899, the company had produced over 500 vehicles. Hiram Percy Maxim was head engineer of the Motor Vehicle Department. The Electric Vehicle division was spun off that year as the independent company Columbia Automobile Company but it was acquired by the Electric Vehicle Company by the end of year. Pope tried to re-enter the automobile manufacturing market in 1901 by acquiring a number of small firms, but the process was expensive and competition in the industry was heating up. Between the years 1903 and 1915, the company operated a number of automobile companies including Pope-Hartford (19031914), Pope-Robinson, Pope-Toledo (19031909), Pope-Tribune (19041907) and Pope-Waverley. Pope declared bankruptcy in 1907 and died in August 1909. Bankruptcy and reorganizations In 1914, the main offices of Pope were moved to Westfield, Massachusetts. However, in 1915, the Pope Manufacturing Company filed for bankruptcy. In 1916 Pope was reorganized and renamed The Westfield Manufacturing Company, with catalogs stating they were the ‚Äúsuccessors to The Pope Manufacturing Company.‚Äù In 1933, Westfield Manufacturing became a subsidiary of The Torrington Company of Torrington, Connecticut. In December 1960 an independent corporation was formed and in 1961 was renamed Columbia Manufacturing Company. In 1967, Columbia Manufacturing Company merged with MTD, but ended up filing for bankruptcy in 1987. The following year saw Columbia purchased by some of the local management and reorganized as Columbia Manufacturing, Inc., and no longer part of MTD. Bicycle production continued in a limited capacity, but was negligible compared to the business of importing and selling foreign bicycles. As of the 2010s, Columbia-branded bicycles are marketed by Columbia Bicycles, a subsidiary of Ballard Pacific.

He also served as a Member of Parliament in the 1970s. He was best known for his studies of Maoist China, the three-volume The Origins of the Cultural Revolution and Mao‚Äôs Last Revolution. Family and early life MacFarquhar was born in Lahore, British India (now Pakistan). His father was Sir Alexander MacFarquhar, a member of the Indian Civil Service and later a senior diplomat at the United Nations. His mother was Berenice (n√©e Whitburn). He was educated at the Aitchison College in Lahore and Fettes College, an independent school in Edinburgh. Academic and journalistic career After spending part of his national service from 1949 to 1950 in Egypt and Jordan as a second lieutenant in the Royal Tank Regiment, he went up to Keble College, Oxford to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, obtaining a BA in 1953. He then went on to obtain a master's degree from Harvard University in Far Eastern Regional Studies in 1955, studying with John King Fairbank, who supported his career as a China scholar. He worked as a journalist on the staff of the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph from 1955 to 1961 specialising in China, and also reported for BBC television Panorama from 1963 to 1965. He was the founding editor of The China Quarterly from 1959 to 1968, and a non-resident fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford from 1965 to 1968. In 1969 he was a senior research fellow at Columbia University in New York City, and in 1971 he returned to England to hold a similar fellowship at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Political career In the 1966 general election, MacFarquhar fought the Ealing South constituency for the Labour Party but failed to dislodge the sitting Conservative MP. Two years later, he was Labour candidate who attempted to retain the Meriden seat in a by-election; he was on the wrong end of an 18.4% swing at the height of the Wilson government's unpopularity. Following the defeat of George Brown in 1970 and favourable boundary changes, MacFarquhar was selected to fight the Belper constituency, and at the February 1974 general election succeeded in winning the seat from its sitting Conservative MP Geoffrey Stewart-Smith. Although he won, there was an estimated swing of 4% to the Conservatives had the same boundaries applied in the previous election. MacFarquhar proved a moderate figure, in line with Brown's views. He abstained on a vote to remove the disqualification of left- wing Labour councillors in Clay Cross who had broken council housing laws enacted by the previous Conservative government. However, there were exceptions: he also abstained on a vote to increase the Civil list payments on 26 February 1975. He acted as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to David Ennals, a minister of the state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and retained the job when Ennals was promoted to be Secretary of State for Social Services. He was made a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology. After Parliament In 1978 MacFarquhar resigned his office as PPS after voting against the Government. In that year, he became a Governor of the School of Oriental and African Studies, a University of London constituent body. The post gave him a job which he could do if he lost his seat. In the 1979 general election, MacFarquhar did indeed lose by 800 votes, and returned to academia and broadcasting (returning to \\"24 Hours\\" for a year). He remained involved in politics and his moderate beliefs made him increasingly uncomfortable in the Labour Party: on 22 October 1981 he announced that he had joined the Social Democratic Party. He fought the South Derbyshire seat, which contained most of then-abolished Belper, for the SDP in the 1983 general election, and nearly succeeded in beating the Labour candidate, although the seat was easily won by the Conservatives. Subsequent academic career He was a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington D.C. in 1980-81 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1986. In 1980‚Äì1983, he was a Leverhulme Research Fellow from 1980 until 1983. In 1986‚Äì1992, MacFarquhar was Director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University.Suleski, Ronald Stanley. (2005). The Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard University, p. 77. He was a Walter Channing Cabot Fellow at Harvard in 1993‚Äì1994. He was the Leroy B. Williams Professor of History and Political Science, Emeritus. He was a scholar of Chinese politics from the founding of the People's Republic through to the Cultural Revolution. Volume three of his study The Origins of the Cultural Revolution: The Coming of the Cataclysm 1961-1966 (1997) won the Joseph Levenson Book Prize for 1999. Personal life MacFarquhar married Emily Cohen, a journalist and East Asian studies scholar, in 1964. They had two children, the writer Larissa MacFarquhar and economist Rory MacFarquhar, who served as policy adviser in the Obama administration. His first wife died in 2001. He married his second wife, British foreign policy scholar Dalena Wright, in 2012.

Standish. Biography Gilbert Patten was born in Corinna, Maine in 1866. His father, a carpenter, and his mother were deeply religious pacifists. They were Seventh Day Adventists.http://www.ulib.niu.edu/badndp/patten_william.html He entered Corinna Union Academy at fourteen, but when his father threatened that he would be put to work if he did not improve at school, Patten ran away to Biddeford, Maine where he worked in a machine shop. When he returned home and told his father that he would become an author, he was given thirty days to prove himself. He sold his first two stories in this period to the dime novel company of Erastus Flavel Beadle, and combined his resumed studies for the next four years with writing and publishing stories. When he was twenty, he married Alice Gardner, and in 1892 their son Harvan Barr Patten was born. They later divorced and Gilbert Patten would marry twice more.American Heritage Volume 12 #4: Frank Merriwell at Yale Again and Again and Again by Stewart Holbrook (June 1961] Patten worked at the Pittsfield Advertiser before creating in 1888 his own newspaper, the Corinna Owl. He sold it the next year to the Advertiser, and devoted his time to the stories, mostly westerns, for Beadle's Half-Dime Library. Meanwhile, he managed a semi-professional baseball team in 1890‚Äì1891 in Camden, Maine before leaving for New York City.Joel Zoss and John Bowman in Diamonds in the Rough: The Untold History of Baseball page 265 (2004) But after this season he again mostly worked as an author, working for Norman Munro, and for most of his career for Street & Smith.John T. Dizer, Authors Who Wrote Dime Novels and Series Books, 1890-1914 in Pioneers, Passionate Ladies, and Private Eyes, page 81 (1996) He was a writer of dime novels. His first published dime novel was The Diamond Sport; or, The Double Face of Bed Rock, published in 1886 by Beadle.J. Randolph Cox, in The Dime Novel Companion: A Source Book page 271 (2000) He wrote westerns with the pen name Wyoming Bill,John A. Dinan in Sports in the Pulp Magazines page 66 (1998) but is best known for his sporting stories in the Frank Merriwell series, written as Burt L. Standish. Patten started writing the Merriwell stories in April 1896 for the publisher Street & Smith and produced one each week, at a length of twenty thousand words, for twenty years. The series, which appeared in Tip-Top Weekly, was immensely popular, selling some 135,000 copies a week, and the brothers Frank and Dick Merriwell became icons of All-American sportsmanship, entering the jargon of sports commentators.Steven Serafin and Alfred Bendixen in The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature page 1072 (2003)Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions page 357 Patten, however, never received any royalties for them, being paid up to $150 per story as a hack writer. The series was originally inspired by the success of the British Penny Dreadfuls like Jack Harkaway.E.M. Sanchez Saavedra in Pioneers, Passionate Ladies, and Private Eyes, page 113 (1996) Gibert Patten also contributed to the Frank Merriwell comic strip from 1928, and supervised the 1934 NBC radio series.J. Randolph Cox, in The Dime Novel Companion: A Source Book page 172-173 (2000) In 1893, he hired Edward Stratemeyer as a writer for the Street & Smith publication Good News.John A. Dinan in Sports in the Pulp Magazines page 134 (1998) From 1927 to 1930, Gilbert Patten would start a new series of Frank Merriwell stories, aided now by a few ghostwriters. In 1930, Patten started his own publication, The Dime Novel, but only one issue appeared.J. Randolph Cox, in The Dime Novel Companion: A Source Book page 87-88 (2000) Apart from the Merriwell stories, Patten wrote 75 complete novels and an unknown number of stories. He estimated that he had written 40 million words as an author.James M. Cain in Sixty Years of Journalism page 157 (1985) In total, some 500 million of his books were in print,Chester G. Mayo in The New England Quarterly vol. 38 #3 page 422 (1965) making him one of the best- selling fiction authors of all time. He lived most of his life in Camden, Maine, but moved to California in 1941. He died aged 78 in his sleep at the home of his son H. V. Patten in Vista, California in 1945.Associated Press, ‚ÄúCreator of ‚ÄòFrank Merriwell‚Äô Dies‚Äù, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 17 January 1944, Volume 51, page 1.

It had a population of 5,603 in 2001,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Neath Port Talbot Retrieved 9 January 2010 increasing slightly to 5,615 at the 2011 Census. Cwmafan is known for having a high percentage of Welsh speakers. In many ways it is a suburb of the nearby town of Port Talbot which is less than to the south. The literal translation of Cwmafan from Welsh to English is complex, Cwm means valley with Afan as the name of the river flowing through, hence the village residing within the Afan Valley. It could be a version of Afon which means river, so literally the \\"River Valley\\", this is common in Wales and the UK with many rivers being called Afon or Avon. There is also a Saint Afan, which it is possible the river was named after. There have been other suggestions but none accepted locally. Geography The village is surrounded by hills: the biggest is Foel Fynyddau, which stands 370 m (1200 ft) high and stands above the northern edge of the village. West of Foel Fynyddau is Mynydd-y-Gaer: at its summit the community boundaries of Cwmavon, Baglan and Briton Ferry all meet. The River Afan runs through the village from north-east to south-west; the village is on the right bank. The area of Ynysygwas lies immediately across the river, Brynbryddan adjoins Cwmafan to the west and Pwllyglaw adjoins Cwmafan to the north-east (ie up the valley). The B4286 road runs through the village along the valley, and the A4107 runs along the valley on the opposite bank. History The village has an industrial history, with metalworking being particularly significant. There were large copper, iron and tin works as well as many coal mines close by. The metal ores, from as far away as Chile, were off-loaded in Port Talbot or Swansea docks and brought by rail to Cwmafan. In 1985 the Ynys-y-Gwas bridge suddenly collapsed, cutting off the water supply to the residents.BBC news report on recent bridge danger referring back to this event Accessed: 3.12.2012 A resident of Maesteg, Paul Barry, escaped unharmed from the incident, despite being on the bridge when it collapsed.Wales Today News reports Accessed: 3.12.2012 Culture=Sports teams The village is also home to several sporting grounds, the most prominent of these being the Welfare Ground, home to Cwmavon RFC who are currently playing in the Welsh Rugby Union leagues. A second rugby union pitch along with a football pitch, tennis courts and bowling green are located at \\" Parc Siencyn Powell\\" (Formerly named Parc-y-Llyn), which is administered by Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council.

It first began broadcasting in 1962 under the call sign KMBC-FM. The station is currently owned by Entercom. Its transmitter is located in east Kansas City, and studios are located in Mission, Kansas. History=Early years 99.7 FM's historic roots go back to an experimental station, W9XER, which began as an \\"Apex\\" high-frequency station owned by the Midland Broadcasting Company in Kansas City. In 1937, it was operating on 31.6 MHz,\\"Shortwave Stations by Frequencies\\", Radio Index, May 1937, page 70. and by 1940 was transmitting on 42.46 MHz.\\"High Frequency Broadcasting Stations in the United States\\", Broadcasting Yearbook (1940), page 374. In late 1941, W9XER was converted into one of the earliest FM stations, now transmitting on 46.5 MHz.\\"Experimental FM Stations Currently Operating\\", FM, December 1941, page 40. In 1944 the station received a commercial license as KMBC-FM, and began daily broadcasts that June. In 1946, it moved to 97.9 FM. For two more years, KMBC-FM broadcast on 100.5 FM, until the station was deleted in December 1949.\\"History of KMBZ\\" by Richie Kennedy (route56.com) Metromedia later revived the KMBC-FM call letters, when the station signed on at its permanent 99.7 FM location on October 15, 1962 with middle of the road music. KMBC-FM broadcast at 4,300 watts, but upgraded to 98,000 watts in 1966. Bonneville bought the station in 1967 and requested new call letters to separate the station from its original AM and TV counterparts. That became reality on July 18, 1966, when the station changed call letters to KMBR, and began airing an easy listening format. KMBR was a steady presence in the market, lasting for around 25 years. In May 1991, KMBR altered its format to soft AC, and rebranded as \\"Lite 99.7\\". The station also changed their call letters to KLTH (the calls were adopted on October 16, 1991). KLTH and KUDL competed strongly against one another for the dominant \\"at-work station\\" throughout the mid-1990s. However, KUDL's parent company Entercom bought KLTH in 1997, putting an end to the competition. Revival of KY KYYS logo from 1997 to 2006. KYYS logo from 2006 to 2008.

The first song on the revived \\"KY\\" was \\"Back in Black\\" by AC/DC.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-10-24.pdf KYYS started airing the syndicated \\"Nights with Alice Cooper\\" in 2006. At the same time, the station shifted to a harder classic rock format. However, this format altering led to a decline in ratings, resulting in many listeners jumping ship to KCFX. Death of KY; subsequent formats With ratings on the decline, and failing to effectively compete against KCFX, KYYS was ended for a second time. On January 18, 2008, at 1 p.m., after playing \\"In the Dark\\" by Billy Squier, KYYS flipped to AAA, branded as \\"99-7 The Boulevard\\".

On March 28, KUDL began simulcasting KGEX as part of a transition period to shift KUDL's audience over to the new format, as KUDL announced that they would be ending their adult contemporary format after 34 years in favor of a simulcast of KMBZ. On March 30, 2011, the simulcast between the two stations ended; on the same day, KGEX changed their call letters to the current KZPT.

The current version of the MPEP is the 9th Edition, which was released in March 2014. The MPEP has traditionally been available in paper form, but electronic versions are now used more often, particularly because an applicant only may consult the electronic versions while taking the USPTO registration examination, or the patent bar examination.

The island is divided between independent East Timor and West Timor province of Indonesia. The Timor Gap is part of the Australia-East Timor border, Australia-Indonesia border, and East Timor‚ÄìIndonesia border. It is 480 km (300 statute miles) wide. History Australia and Indonesia negotiated the border in 1972 and the Timor gap is part of the line they could not define because Portugal, who governed colonial East Timor then, declined to participate in the negotiations until the conclusion of UNCLOS negotiations, due to the extremely complex nature of both international law and the complex geographical problems posed. Timor Gap Treaty Australia and Indonesia each posed different delimitation boundaries on their borders, while Portugal chose to abstain until a formal determination of an appropriate method for delimitation could be discerned. East Timor was later annexed by Indonesia in 1975, removing the need to include Portugal in negotiations. Australia and Indonesia negotiated the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989. East Timor became independent in 2002. However, they have yet to establish maritime boundaries with their neighbouring countries, Indonesia and Australia.\\"The Timor Gap, Wonosobo and the Fate of Portuguese Timor\\", Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, vol.88, pt.1, June 2002, pp.75-103. Negotiations determining the ownership of the tens of billions of dollars' worth of oil and gas located on the seabed of the Timor Sea, including completing the undefined boundary known as the Timor Gap, have been underway between Australia and East Timor since 2002, but despite several interim agreements, permanent maritime boundaries are yet to be settled. Australia and international oil companies have been accused of pressuring East Timor to accept a petroleum revenue- sharing formula while deferring permanent boundary resolution and foregoing legal avenues. Timor Sea Treaty On its independence day, East Timor signed the Timor Sea Treaty with Australia. This treaty practically puts East Timor in the place of Indonesia in the Timor Gap Treaty, except that the ratio of revenue distribution in the Joint Petroleum Development Area, known as the Zone of Cooperation under the 1989 treaty, was changed to 90:10 in favour of East Timor. The 2002 treaty provided for the future \\"unitisation\\" - treating a gas or oil field which straddles one or several borders as one unit - of the Greater Sunrise gas field, of which only 20% was located within the JPDA while the rest was deemed to be in Australian territory. In East Timor's view, this distribution could be disputed as it did not recognise the borders, drawn between Australia and Indonesia, which placed the bulk of Greater Sunrise in Australian territory. On 20 February 2007, East Timor's parliament agreed to ratify the agreement with Australia over the management of oil and gas resources in the Greater Sunrise field in the Timor Sea. The Australian and East Timor governments formally exchanged notes in Dili on 23 February 2007 to bring into force the two treaties that provided the legal and fiscal framework for the development of the Greater Sunrise gas field in the Timor Sea. The notes covered the Sunrise International Unitization Agreement (Sunrise IUA) and the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS). Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, using a power invoked only six times in its history, invoked a \\"national interest\\" exemption clause to fast-track ratification of the CMATS treaty through the Parliament without scrutiny by its Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.Robert J. King, ‚ÄúThe Timor Gap, 1972-2017‚Äù, March 2017. Submission No.27 to the inquiry by the Australian Parliament Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into Certain Maritime Arrangements - Timor-Leste. p.67. 2018 Maritime Boundaries Treaty On March 7, 2018, Australia and East Timor announced that a treaty had been signed regarding the border and the exploitation of the Greater Sunrise gas field. The agreed boundary would follow the median line between the two countries. The 2018 Maritime Boundaries Treaty formalized the agreement reached by Australia and Timor Leste on their maritime boundaries. The two countries had failed to reach agreement on a preferred option for development of the Sunrise/Troubadour field, and annexes to the Treaty set out procedures for achieving this. Article 3 of the 2018 treaty on maritime boundaries between Australia and Timor-Leste provides for adjustment of the continental shelf boundary between the two countries following settlement of that boundary between Indonesia and Timor-Leste. If those countries agree to an endpoint to their continental shelf boundary west of point A18 on the 1972 Seabed Treaty Boundary, the continental shelf boundary between Australia and Timor-Leste shall be adjusted so that it proceeds in a geodesic line from point TA-2 in the 2018 Treaty (at 11¬∞ 24' 00.61\\" South and 126¬∞ 18' 22.48\\" East), to point A18 (at 18 10¬∞ 37' South and 125¬∞ 41' East). The Treaty provides that this shall not come into force before the commercial depletion of the Laminaria and Corallina Fields. In the event that a continental shelf boundary agreed between Timor-Leste and Indonesia meets the 1972 Seabed Treaty boundary at a point to the west of point A18 on the 1972 Seabed Treaty Boundary, the continental shelf boundary shall be adjusted so that it proceeds in a geodesic line from point TA-11 in the 2018 Treaty (at 9¬∞ 42' 21.49\\" South and 128¬∞ 28' 35.97\\" East), to point A18.

In the Solar System, gas tori tend to be produced by the interaction of a satellite's atmosphere with the magnetic field of a planet. The most famous example of this is the Io plasma torus, which is produced by the ionization of roughly 1 ton per second of oxygen and sulfur from the tenuous atmosphere of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io. Before being ionized, these particles are part of a neutral torus, also centered on the orbit of Io. Energetic particle observations also suggest the presence of a neutral torus around the orbit of Jupiter's moon Europa although such a torus would be merged with the outer portions of an Io torus. Other examples include the largely neutral torus of oxygen and hydrogen produced by Saturn's moon Enceladus. The Enceladus and Io tori differ in that particles in the Io torus are predominantly ionized while in the Enceladus torus, the neutral density is much greater than the ion density. After the Voyager encounters, the possibility of a torus of nitrogen produced by Saturn's moon Titan was proposed. Subsequent observations by the Cassini spacecraft showed no clear evidence of such a torus. While neutral nitrogen could not be measured, the ions near the orbit of Titan were primarily hydrogen or water group (O+, OH+, H2O+ and H3O+) from the Enceladus torus. Trace amounts of nitrogen ions were detected but at levels consistent with an Enceladus source. A fictional gas torus is the setting for Larry Niven's novels The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring, in which a gas giant in orbit around a neutron star generates a gas torus of sufficient density and free oxygen to support life (including humans).

They came to prominence during the new wave period but were largely ignored by the music press of the time - their emotional, psychedelic-tinged music was judged out of step with other bands of the time. Career The original line- up was Jackie Leven ‚Äì vocals and guitar, Jo Shaw ‚Äì vocals and guitar, Robin Spreafico ‚Äì vocals and bass, and David Macintosh ‚Äì vocals and percussion. This lineup only recorded one studio album Remember before Spreafico was replaced by Tony Waite (1958‚Äì2003). In this configuration they released the albums Gypsy Blood (produced by John Sinclair) and the eponymous third album, Doll By Doll, before the band split up. At the time of final LP Grand Passion, only Leven was left of the original line-up, joined by Helen Turner (vocals and keyboards) and Tom Norden (vocals, guitar and bass) with a number of guest musicians, including David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Mark Fletcher (bass) and Chris Clarke (drums) played with the group live. Doll By Doll finally fell apart in 1983, though Leven, Shaw and Macintosh plus ex-Sex Pistol Glen Matlock, released a single Big Tears under the name \\"Concrete Bulletproof Invisible\\" in 1988. Leven became a prolific solo artist, releasing a series of albums featuring more folk oriented material. In 2005 a live recording of the original band was released. Revenge of Memory, which features all but one of the songs on the Remember album, was recorded at the Sheffield Limits Club in 1977.

His best-known work is the screenplay for the Tim Burton film Beetlejuice. Personal life McDowell was born in 1950 in Enterprise, Alabama, and graduated from T.R. Miller High in Brewton, Alabama. He received a B.A. and an M.A. from Harvard College, and a Ph.D in English from Brandeis University in 1978, based on a dissertation entitled \\"American Attitudes Toward Death, 1825‚Äì1865\\". McDowell lived in Medford, Massachusetts and maintained a residence in Hollywood with his sister Ann and the filmmaker Peter Lake. He also had one brother, James. McDowell's partner was theatre historian and director Laurence Senelick, whom he met in 1969 when McDowell was a cast member of the Senelick-directed play, Bartholomew Fair. McDowell and Senelick remained together for thirty years until McDowell's death. McDowell specialized in collecting death memorabilia. His extensive and diverse collection, which reportedly filled over seventy-six boxes, included items such as death pins, photographs and plaques from infant caskets. After his death, the collection was acquired by Chicago's Northwestern University, where it went on display in 2013. McDowell was diagnosed with AIDS in 1994. After his diagnosis, McDowell taught screenwriting at Boston University and Tufts University while continuing to write commissioned screenplays. One of his final projects, upon which he was working at the time of his death, was a sequel to Beetlejuice. His final, unfinished novel Candles Burning was completed by novelist Tabitha King and published in 2006. McDowell died on December 27, 1999 in Boston, Massachusetts from an AIDS-related illness. Literary career While arguably best known for his works of Southern Gothic horror, McDowell was an accomplished stylist who wrote several series with marked differences in tone, character, and subject matter. His period novels are praised for their intricate eye for historical research and accurate details, and range from Gilded Age New York City to wiregrass Alabama in the depths of the Great Depression. McDowell collaborated with his close friend Dennis Schuetz in writing four mysteries starring Daniel Valentine and Clarisse Lovelace: Vermillion (1980), Cobalt (1982), Slate (1984), and Canary (1986). The four novels were published under the pseudonym Nathan Aldyne. In the early 1980s, McDowell and Dennis Schuetz released two psychological thrillers, Blood Rubies (1982) and Wicked Stepmother (1983) under the pseudonym Axel Young. Both books were over-the-top parodies of Sidney Sheldon-type suspense novels. In the mid-1980s, McDowell wrote the \\"Jack and Susan\\" mysteries for Ballantine Books, featuring characters reminiscent of the influential Thin Man films. The series included Jack and Susan in 1953 (1985), Jack and Susan in 1913 (1986) and Jack and Susan in 1933 (1987). The books chronicled the adventures of an eternally youthful couple and their ever-changing dog. McDowell had contracted to do one for each decade of the century, but he bowed out of the contract after three. His screen credits include Beetlejuice (1987), and collaborations on The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Thinner (1996). McDowell also wrote the novelization of the film Clue in 1985. The film was based on the board game and featured three different endings; however, the novelization was based on the shooting script and includes an additional fourth ending that was cut from the film. He also contributed screenplays to a number of television horror anthologies, including Tales from the Darkside. McDowell was one of seventeen contemporary British and American horror writers interviewed by Douglas E. Winter in his 1985 interview book Faces of Fear. Of his writing, McDowell says in this book: \\"I am a commercial writer and I'm proud of that. I am writing things to be put in the bookstore next month. I think it is a mistake to try to write for the ages.\\" Stephen King described McDowell as \\"the finest writer of paperback originals in America today\\".

It is officially ratified by the Internet Engineering Task Force. Its most common forms are in 1 Gbit/s, 2 Gbit/s, 4 Gbit/s, 8 Gbit/s, and 10 Gbit/s.  Technical overview  The iFCP protocol enables the implementation of Fibre Channel functionality over an IP network, within which the Fibre Channel switching and routing infrastructure is replaced by IP components and technology. Congestion control, error detection and recovery are provided through the use of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). The primary objective of iFCP is to allow existing Fibre Channel devices to be networked and interconnected over an IP based network at wire speeds. The method of address translation defined and the protocol permit Fibre Channel storage devices and host adapters to be attached to an IP-based fabric using transparent gateways. The iFCP protocol layer's main function is to transport Fibre Channel frame images between Fibre Channel ports attached both locally and remotely. iFCP encapsulates and routes the fibre channel frames that make up each Fibre Channel information unit via a predetermined TCP connection for transport across the IP network when transporting frames to a remote Fibre Channel port.

The address is Savska 41, on the Savska Road and Vukovar Avenue intersection. Technical information Zagrepƒçanka is ranked 4th by height (1st when you include the antenna) in Croatia. It is 94.6 meters (310 feet) tall, and it has 27 levels. There is a radio mast on the roof, which increases the height of the tower to 109 meters (363 feet). There are two underground levels, used for parking spaces. It's served by six elevators. The building is a part of the complex, which includes a lowrise 3 level business objects, an art installation, and a fountain. The tower has three parts. The center part has 26 floors, the west wing has 21 floor, and the east wing has 19 floors. The facade is derived in white marble, and a reflective green glass. There are 23 three-apses protrusions, which run from the 25th to 26th floor. The center wing has 24 support beams, and the side wings have 23 beams. The side wings are hyperbolically curved over the vertical axis.  History  The tower was built in 1976 by architects Slavko Jelinek and Berislav Vinkoviƒá, who drew their inspiration from the Thyssen-Haus building in D√ºsseldorf. Less than ten years after the completion, heavy marble tiles started to fall off from the facade. This was largely due to the low weather resistance of Carrara marble that had been used for the construction. The problem was most pronounced in the southern, Sun-exposed face. Because of the danger, the employees had to enter the tower through an improvised tunnel, made out of the wooden planks and steel bars. By 2014, the eastern and the western face of the building have been repaired by replacing 5000 square meters of tiles. Zagrepƒçanka was surpassed in (structural) height by the Eurotower (97.8 m) in 2006. But it still holds the No.1 place in the real height (109 m), and it has the Croatia's highest office.https://web.archive.org/web/20110704024244/http://193.198.60.202/komunalni/arhiva/345/str08.pdf https://web.archive.org/web/20110704024300/http://193.198.60.202/komunalni/arhiva/345/str09.pdf Zagrepƒçanka 512, an annual foot race up the staircase, has been held since 2012.http://www.zagrepcanka512.trcanje.hr/  See also  * List of tallest buildings in Croatia  Views of Zagrepƒçanka  Image:Zagrepƒçanka tower from west over railroad.jpgView from the west looking over railroad Image:Zagrepcanka noc istok.jpgZagrepƒçanka tower at night References External links  * Zagrepƒçanka on Emporis * Arhitekt koji je volio nebodere Category:Buildings and structures in Zagreb Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Croatia Category:Modernist architecture in Croatia Category:Office buildings completed in 1976 ","title":"Zagrepƒçanka"},{"id":"3801777","text":"The Grand Order of Water Rats is a British entertainment industry fraternity and charitable organisation with some claims of freemasonry, based in London. Founded in 1889 by the music hall comedians Joe Elvin and Jack Lotto, the order is known for its high-profile membership and benevolent works (primarily within the performing industries). Origin Founder Joe Elvin c. 1890 In 1889, two British music hall performers, Joe Elvin and Jack Lotto, owned a trotting pony called \\"Magpie\\".Golden, George Fuller. My Lady Vaudeville and her White Rats. Published under the auspices of the Board of Directors of the White Rats of America, 1909. p. 31. As the pony was a regular race winner, its owners decided that they would use the profits to help performers who were less fortunate than themselves.Charlie Chester, The Grand Order of Water Rats: A Legend of Laughter - W.H. Allen, London (1984) pg 12 One day, as Elvin was driving the pony back to its stables in the pouring rain, a passing bus driver called out, \\"Wot yer got there, mate?\\" \\"Our trotting pony!\\" replied Elvin. Observing the bedraggled, soaked condition of the pony, the driver shouted back, \\"Trotting pony? Looks more like a bleedin' water rat!\\" As Rats spelled backwards is Star, and vole, another name for a water rat, is an anagram of love, the name was deemed appropriate for the Order's agenda of Brotherly Love. (Motto: Philanthropy, conviviality and social intercourse.) The charity raises money by organising shows, lunches, dinners and other events. The objectives of the charity are \\"to assist members of the theatrical profession, or their dependents, who, due to illness or old age are in need.\\" When possible additional funds raised go to a diverse range of charities and good causes including hospitals, health charities and benevolent funds. A member of the public can become a Friend of the Water Rats. The Water Rats originally held meetings in Sunbury-on-Thames in a public house now called 'The Magpie'. Their headquarters is now at the Water Rats pub in Gray's Inn Road in Kings Cross, London. Members Newly inaugurated Bob Hope (right) emerges from ceremonies at the Hilton in London alongside grandson Zachary Hope - August 1991 Membership is limited to 180 male members of the entertainment industry plus 20 Companion Rats. Some Water Rats are household names but many are not, but all must be respected and trusted by their peers. Joining the Order is a complicated process that involves finding a proposer and seconder within the Order, consideration by the Order's Grand Council and finally a vote which needs a large majority for success. Current members include Kev Orkian, Derek Martin, Con and Dec Cluskey of The Bachelors, Engelbert Humperdinck, Lionel Blair, Tom O'Connor, Frank Bruno, Frazer Hines, Barry Cryer, Billy Murray, Brian May, Jimmy Osmond, Steve McFadden, Rick Wakeman, Robbie Sherman, Chas McDevitt, Andre Vincent, Joe Pasquale, Alfie Boe, Chris Emmett, Andrew Van Buren, Richard Joy, Ian Lavender, Roy Wood, David Myers and Si King (The Hairy Bikers), Kaplan Kaye and Jess Conrad. Past members include Bob Holness, Frank Carson, Max Bygraves, Charlie Chaplin, Peter Lorre, Peter Sellers, Don Smoothey, Danny Kaye, Davy Kaye, Ken Dodd, Laurel and Hardy, Maurice Chevalier, Bob Hope, Will Hay, Frankie Vaughan, Tommy Cooper, Ted Ray, Fred Kitchen, Les Dawson, George Martin, John Mills, Billy Butlin, David Nixon, Howard Keel, Harry Secombe, Arthur English,English, Arthur (with Linton Mitchell) Through the Mill and Beyond The Basingstoke Press (1989) pg 166 Charlie Chester, Jimmy Perry, Arthur Haynes, Jimmy Wheeler, Bill Pertwee, Jon Pertwee, Norman Wisdom,The Laurel and Hardy Encyclopedia by Glen Mitchell (2008) (Reynolds & Hearn) , (Page 124) Paul Daniels, Bert Weedon, Roy Hudd and Nicholas Parsons,. Members of the order wear a small gold emblem shaped as a water rat on the left lapel of their jackets, and if one Water Rat meets another who is not wearing his emblem he is fined, with the money going to charity. Magician David Nixon wore his while appearing on television, explaining that as current King Rat he could be fined by any other member who saw him on screen without it. There is also a small number of Companion Rats, distinguished men from various fields of business and influence who are not performers but who have achieved recognition for their support and friendship of the Order. These include Bob Potter OBE, Vice Admiral Sir Donald Gosling (now deceased), the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and Prince Michael of Kent. King Rats The first King Rat, who is the head of the charity, was the music hall singer Harry Freeman. The comedian Dan Leno joined in 1890 and was King Rat in 1891, 1892 and 1897.

It was once a major farm, later being named a national park. Originally known as Skaftafell National Park, it was subsequently joined together with other nearby regions to form the larger Vatnaj√∂kull National Park. Skaftafell National Park  Skaftafell National Park was a national park, situated between Kirkjub√¶jarklaustur, typically referred to as Klaustur, and H√∂fn in the south of Iceland. On 7 June 2008, it became a part of the larger Vatnaj√∂kull National Park. It was founded on September 15, 1967, and enlarged twice afterwards. Before its inclusion into Vatnaj√∂kull National Park, it measured about 4807 km2 (2884 mi2), making it Iceland's second largest national park. It contains the valley Mors√°rdalur, the mountain Krist√≠nartindar and the glacier Skaftafellsj√∂kull (a spur of the Vatnaj√∂kull ice cap). Skaftafellsj√∂kull glacier as seen from the sky The landscape is very similar to some of the Alps, but it has been formed over thousands of years by different influences of fire (volcanic eruptions of √ñr√¶faj√∂kull) and water (the glaciers Skei√∞ar√°j√∂kull and Skaftafellsj√∂kull), the rivers Skei√∞ar√°, Mors√° und Skaftafells√°. Volcanic eruptions under the ice-cap can give rise to j√∂kulhlaups (glacial floods) which swell the Skei√∞ar√° river massively. The sandy wasteland between the glacier and the sea caused by j√∂kulhlaups is called Skei√∞ar√°rsandur, and is a typical outwash plain known locally as a sandur. The last large j√∂kulhlaup occurred in 1996. Skaftafell is renowned in Iceland for its agreeable climate and the sunny days in summer, uncommon in the south of Iceland. There is a natural birch wood, B√¶jarsta√∞arsk√≥gur, as well as many species of birds and Arctic foxes. Svartifoss waterfall is one of Skaftafell's best known attractions, mainly for the basalt column walls that flank it. The waterfall Svartifoss (Black Fall) flows over a step of about 20 metres. Its name comes from the black basalt columns behind it. In the Middle Ages there were a number of large farms in this area, but they were abandoned after two volcanic eruptions and the ensuing glacier runs. The two surviving farms now mostly make a living from tourism. The park has also an information centre and a campground. There are many hiking trails crossing the area. Nearby hamlets include Kirkjub√¶jarklaustur, Sv√≠nafell, Hof, and K√°lfafell.  History of habitation  Soon after Iceland was settled, Skaftafell became a major farm, and area meetings (√æing) were held on its land. The disastrous √ñr√¶faj√∂kull eruption of 1362 wiped out the entire local community and the district has been named √ñr√¶fi, the \\"wasteland\\", ever since. Skaftafell and many other farms were soon re-established, but at that time the climate was also starting to cool down, making it increasingly difficult to live from farming. The frequent Gr√≠msv√∂tn eruptions triggered j√∂kulhlaups which flooded over hayfields, covering them with ash and sand. In 1988, traditional farming was discontinued at Skaftafell. The old farmhouse in Sel. In earlier times, however, the farmers had supplemented sheep farming by trips to the coast, where they hunted seals and collected eggs. Stranded ships provided excellent material for making various items, and some of the Skaftafell farmers became well known for their crafting talents. In earlier centuries, the farmstead stood just below the slopes, where some of the ruins still remain visible at G√∂mlut√∫n. Skei√∞ar√° river began flowing closer to the farm and destroyed the fields, until in the early 19th century when the farm was moved onto the mountain slopes and divided into three households. One of them, Sel, was abandoned in 1946 but has since been restored by the National Museum and made accessible for visitors.  Landscape and geology  A view from the S2 hike in Skaftafell The scenery around Skaftafell is full of stark contrasts. The various glacial tongues are flanked by jagged mountains, with the glacier- topped peak of Hvannadalshnj√∫kur rising highest. Evidence abounds of the erosive forces exerted by glacial ice and rivers. From the time of the first sagas, this ice has variously advanced or retreated, reaching farthest around 1890, since when it has retreated. View from Krist√≠nartindar mountain peaks towards Mors√°rj√∂kull glacier. The rivers running from it have flowed back and forth over the lowlands, depositing the material that forms the wide sands of Skei√∞ar√°rsandur. Road No. 1 did not become a complete circle around the country until 1974, when the last of the rivers barring transportation, the Skei√∞ar√°, was finally bridged. Even so, in 2009 Skei√∞ar√° stopped flowing where it had been bridged, running instead westwards directly in front of the glacier to the river G√≠gjukv√≠sl, so that the river under the long Skei√∞ar√° bridge to the east carries very little water compared to before. The bedrock geology of Skaftafell has been mapped in detail and a bedrock map of the area was published in 2007. It is available at the Skaftafell national park visitor center as well as in book stores in Reykjavik. A web site on the geology of Skaftafell (skaftafell.org) describes the varied rock types of the area. The oldest rocks in Skaftafell are about 5 million years old. Skaftafell strata display well the frequent shifts between glacial and inter-glacial conditions. Tho oldest tillite in the area is about 4 million years old. The Skaftafell vicinity has experienced considerable volcanic activity, with the 1362 √ñr√¶faj√∂kull eruption producing the most ash of any Icelandic volcano since the settlement and another, smaller √ñr√¶faj√∂kull eruption occurring in 1727. As shown once again in 2011, the subglacial volcano Gr√≠msv√∂tn is the country's most active volcano, and is also famous for the huge j√∂kulhlaups or glacial floods that originate from it.  Plants and wildlife  Arctic beauty grows next to Mors√° glacial river. Compared to many south coast areas, Skaftafell has a mild, pleasant climate, often benefiting from the towering shelter of √ñr√¶faj√∂kull. Birch trees and occasional rowans cover the rich undergrowth of the lower slopes and the birch trees in B√¶jarsta√∞arsk√≥gur grow higher than most other native birch. Several flowering plants distinctive to East Iceland are common here: the harebell, yellow saxifrage, and pyramidal saxifrage. Since sheep stopped grazing at Skaftafell, the vegetation has undergone great changes and is quickly making inroads on the glacial deposits in front of Skaftafellsj√∂kull and in Mors√°rdalur valley. Species such as garden angelica, wild angelica, sea pea and arctic river beauty, are hardly ever found on grazing land, but have now become common. Birch and willows are also starting to colonise land. Down in the Skaftafell woods, the redwing, redpoll, and wren are common, while the snipe, ptarmigan, golden plover, and meadow pipit, appear more frequently higher up the slopes. Other birds seen frequently include the raven, merlin, wheatear, and snow bunting. Although the sole wild mammals are the Arctic fox, mink and field mouse, the local insect fauna is considered quite diverse compared to most of Iceland.  National park and tourism  Glacier hike on Sv√≠nafellsj√∂kull. When Vatnaj√∂kull National Park was founded in the summer of 2008, the former Skaftafell National Park became part of it. Skaftafell has been protected since 1967, with the aim of opening it up to the public while also conserving its flora and fauna, landscape and cultural remains. Open all year, the Skaftafell Visitor Centre serves the Southern Territory of Vatnaj√∂kull National Park and provides information on the park and its environs, trails, nature and history, as well as on other recreation and services. Display boards at the Centre describe the intertwined history of people and nature at Skaftafell. Skaftafell has a selection of hiking trails, and the spacious campground has facilities for tents, folding camping trailers and camping vehicles. While the campground only stays open from 1 May to 30 September, camping in other seasons is possible after obtaining permission from park personnel. In recent decades, Skaftafell and the √ñr√¶fi district has shifted from a dependence on sheep farming to large- scale tourism. Skaftafell has emerged as one of the most popular locations for glacier tourism with most tours run on the nearby Sv√≠nafellsj√∂kull (pre-2018) and Fallj√∂kull (post-2018). As of mid-2018, four large and several smaller organisations were running tours on the glaciers. In the summertime, park rangers offer guided walks and various additional events are also offered, such as lectures and children's activities.

Life Henry was the eldest son of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria and Matilda, the eldest daughter of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Henry, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Christian Tunica, 1836 After his father's deposition by the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he grew up in England. When the family returned to Germany in 1189, young Henry distinguished himself by defending the Welf residence of Braunschweig against the forces of the emperor's son King Henry VI. Peace was established the next year, provided that Henry and his younger brother Lothar (d. 1190) were held in hostage by the king. He had to join the German forces on the 1191 campaign to the Italian Kingdom of Sicily and participated in the siege of Naples. Henry finally deserted, fled to Marseille, and returned to Germany where he falsely proclaimed Henry VI's death and tried to underline his own abilities as a possible successor. This partly led to the withdrawal of Henry VI and the captivity of Empress Constance. Though he was banned, he became heir to the County Palatine of the Rhine through his 1193 marriage to Agnes, a cousin of Emperor Henry VI and daughter of the Hohenstaufen count palatine Conrad. He and the emperor reconciled shortly afterwards, and upon Conrad's death in 1195, Henry was enfeoffed with his County Palatine. A close ally of the emperor, he accompanied him on the conquest of Sicily in 1194/95 and on the Crusade of 1197. After the sudden death of the emperor in 1197, Henry's younger brother Otto IV became one of two rival kings of the Holy Roman Empire. At first he supported him, but switched sides to Philip of Swabia in 1203. Having divided the Welf allodial lands with his brothers Otto and William of Winchester, Henry then ruled over the northern Saxon territories around Stade and Altencelle and also was confirmed as count palatine by King Philip. When the German throne quarrel ended with Philip's assassination in 1208, Henry again sided with Otto IV. In Imperial service, he tried to ward off the territorial claims by the Rhenish Prince-archbishops of Cologne, Trier and Mainz, though to no avail. After he inherited further significant properties in Saxony from his brother William in 1213, Henry ceded the Palatinate to his son Henry the Younger and moved north. After his son's early death the next year, he left his Welf properties to his nephew, William's son Otto the Child, who became the first Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg in 1235. Henry died in 1227 and is entombed in Brunswick Cathedral. Marriage and children In 1193, Henry married Agnes of Hohenstaufen (1177‚Äì1204), daughter of Count Palatine Conrad. They had the following children: * Henry VI (1197‚Äì1214), married Matilda, daughter of Duke Henry I of Brabant * Irmengard (1200-1260), married Margrave Herman V of Baden * Agnes (1201-1267), married Otto II of Wittelsbach, Count palatine of the Rhine from 1214, Duke of Bavaria from 1231. Around 1209, he married Agnes of Landsberg (d. 1248), daughter of the Wettin margrave Conrad II of Lusatia.

The roads, transferred to the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1964, are now largely state highways. The main part of the network is the Mixing Bowl at Interstate 395 (Shirley Highway) and Route 27 (Washington Boulevard), named because it had major weaving issues with traffic \\"mixing\\" between the two roads before it was rebuilt in the early 1970s. The \\"Mixing Bowl\\" nickname is now more commonly used to refer to the Springfield Interchange, where I-395, I-495, and I-95 converge in nearby Springfield. The Mixing Bowl The Mixing Bowl originally opened in 1942 as the junction of the Shirley Highway with the connection to the Arlington Memorial Bridge and the connection to Lee Boulevard (now Arlington Boulevard). The western half, towards Lee Boulevard, was a full three-level Y interchange. The eastern half, towards the Memorial Bridge, was missing a ramp to enter the Shirley Highway northeastbound. Just south of the west half was another interchange, a single Y connecting to Arlington Ridge Road. From 1970 to 1973, as part of a total reconstruction of the Shirley Highway, the interchange was totally rebuilt to eliminate all weaving of traffic, mainly by the use of collector/distributor roads. The former cloverleaf with Hayes Street became a system of ramps to the various roads. The ramp from I-395 south to Route 27 towards the Memorial Bridge was removed, and a pair of ramps at the crossing of Route 27 and Route 110 made some of the ramps at Route 110 (then known as the Jefferson Davis Highway) redundant. Finally, a two-lane reversible HOV roadway was added in the median, becoming a four-lane two-way road from the eastern part of the interchange into Washington. Special ramps to Route 27 towards the Memorial Bridge and to the Pentagon south parking lot (via Eads Street) were provided for HOV traffic. Roads Looking north on I-395 toward the Pentagon Shirley Highway (I-395) The Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway was built to take traffic off the Highway Bridge (now the 14th Street Bridge). The first phase, from the bridge to Arlington Ridge Road, was completed in 1942. This began at an existing cloverleaf interchange with the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway and ran southwest, parallel to the existing Jefferson Davis Highway (U.S. Route 1), to a point southeast of the Pentagon. That section included an interchange with Boundary Channel Drive, which served the Pentagon's north parking lot, and a bridge over the Rosslyn Connecting Railroad. US 1 was routed onto it, as the existing US 1 was cut in several places by ramps. After crossing the Jefferson Davis Highway, where US 1 exited to the south, the Shirley Highway turned west, with an interchange to access the south parking lot. (Hayes Street now crosses under the highway there.) Southwest of the Pentagon, the connection to the Arlington Memorial Bridge (now Route 27) merged, and soon after was a split for the connection to Lee Boulevard (now also Route 27, Washington Boulevard). Just past that, the original construction turned southeast to end at Arlington Ridge Road. The extension beyond to Route 7, also built by the federal government, opened October 23, 1943 and became a divided highway on October 30, 1944. The extension beyond Route 7 to US 1 near Occoquan was built by the Virginia Department of Highways as State Route 350 from 1945 to 1952. (SR 350 was also signed along the Federally built portion southwest of US 1.) On December 17, 1964, the road system was transferred to Virginia, and soon after the Shirley Highway became part of Interstate 95. With the cancellation of I-95 through Washington, D.C., it was renumbered to I-395 in 1977. Washington Boulevard (Route 27) What is now Route 27 was built in two sections. The western section served as a realignment of Washington Boulevard from Lee Boulevard (U.S. Route 50, now Arlington Boulevard) southeast to the Mixing Bowl. It had several grade crossings and one interchange (with Route 244, Columbia Pike). East of the Mixing Bowl, the other part of current Route 27 headed northeast, crossing a realigned Columbia Pike, with access to the Pentagon's south parking lot to the east. Past that was another full interchange, for Pentagon service access, just before a crossing (with no ramps) of the Jefferson Davis Highway Extension and the Rosslyn Connecting Railroad. Finally, an interchange with Boundary Channel Drive (for north parking) was provided, with access only to/from the north, before the road crossed the Boundary Channel into Washington, D.C. (on Columbia Island) for connections to the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway (now the G.W. Parkway) and Arlington Memorial Bridge. Those roads were also transferred to the Virginia Department of Highways on December 17, 1964 and assigned the number Route 27. Richmond Highway (Route 110) The extension of the Richmond Highway (which at the time was called Jefferson Davis Highway) ran along the east side of the Pentagon, parallel to the Rosslyn Connecting Railroad, connecting the junction of the Virginia State Route 110 (U.S. Route 1) and Shirley Highway to Rosslyn. It had one interchange with the Pentagon, connecting to the drop-off area to the southeast. After crossing the Mixing Bowl-Arlington Memorial Bridge connection with no access, a partial interchange (access to/from the south) was provided with the main road to the bridge. The extension ended at Arlington Ridge Road just north of Lee Boulevard (U.S. Route 50). Following the September 11 attacks, Route 110 was closed to trucks and tour buses due to its proximity to the Pentagon. In September 2002, a contract was awarded to reroute Route 110 to increase the standoff distance between vehicles and the Pentagon. The project, called the Pentagon Secure Bypass, was completed in 2004. When the road was transferred to the Virginia Department of Highways on December 17, 1964, it was numbered Route 110. In 2019, Arlington County voted to rename U.S. Route 1 through Arlington County to Richmond Highway. Columbia Pike Extension (Route 244) Prior to the building of the Mixing Bowl, the Columbia Pike (and Route 244) ran through its site to end at the Jefferson Davis Highway (US 1). It was truncated at that time to Arlington Ridge Road, which itself was cut by the Mixing Bowl (and later cut by Arlington National Cemetery to the north). As part of that network, a connection was built from Arlington Ridge Road north of Columbia Pike east to the Arlington Memorial Bridge connection, continuing across that connection to the Pentagon south parking lot. It was also transferred to the Virginia Department of Highways on December 17, 1964, and numbered as an extension of Route 244. Pentagon access Access to the Pentagon was provided in the following places: ;South parking lot *Shirley Highway east of the Mixing Bowl (full cloverleaf where Hayes Street now crosses, also providing access to Army Navy Drive to the south) *Arlington Memorial Bridge connection (now Washington Boulevard) and the Columbia Pike Extension northeast of the Mixing Bowl (full cloverleaf) ;North parking lot *Shirley Highway northeast of the Jefferson Davis Highway (partial cloverleaf with Boundary Channel Drive, providing full access) *Arlington Memorial Bridge connection (now Washington Boulevard) south of the Boundary Channel (partial interchange‚Äîaccess only to/from the north‚Äîwith Boundary Channel Drive) ;Service area north of the Pentagon *Arlington Memorial Bridge connection (now Washington Boulevard) south of the Jefferson Davis Highway Extension (folded diamond) ;Drop-off area southeast of the Pentagon *Jefferson Davis Highway Extension north of the Shirley Highway (trumpet) ReferencesExternal links *Roads to the Future‚ÄîHenry G.

It lies close to the geological Highland Boundary Fault, and is frequently described as the \\"Gateway to the Highlands\\" due to its position on the main road and rail lines north. Dunkeld has a railway station, Dunkeld & Birnam, on the Highland Main Line, and is about north of Perth on what is now the A9 road. The main road formerly ran through the town, however following modernisation of this road it now passes to the west of Dunkeld. Dunkeld is the location of Dunkeld Cathedral, and is considered to be a remarkably well-preserved example of a Scottish burgh of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Around 20 of the houses within Dunkeld have been restored by the National Trust for Scotland, who run a shop within the town. The Hermitage, on the western side of the A9, is a countryside property that is also a National Trust for Scotland site. Over the centuries there have been several bridges linking Dunkeld with neighbouring Birnam, and the current bridge, designed by Thomas Telford and financed by the 4th Duke of Atholl, was completed in 1809. History=Early history The name D√πn Chailleann means Fort of the Caledonii or of the Caledonians. The 'fort' is presumably the hill fort on King's Seat, slightly north of the town (). Both these place- names imply an early importance for the area of the later town and bishop's seat, stretching back into the Iron Age. Dunkeld (Duncalden and variants in early documents) is said to have been 'founded' or 'built' by Caustant√≠n son of Fergus, king of the Picts (d. 820). This founding likely referred to one of an ecclesiastical nature on a site already of secular importance, and a Pictish monastery is known to have existed on the site. Kenneth I of Scotland (Cin√°ed mac Ailp√≠n) (843‚Äì58) is reputed to have brought relics of St Columba from Iona in 849, in order to preserve them from Viking raids, building a new church to replace the existing structures, which may been constructed as a simple group of wattle huts. The relics were divided in Kenneth's time between Dunkeld and the Columban monastery at Kells, Co. Meath, Ireland, to preserve them from Viking raids. The 'Apostles' Stone', an elaborate but badly worn cross-slab preserved in the cathedral museum, may date to this time. A well- preserved bronze 'Celtic' hand bell, formerly kept in the church of the parish of Little Dunkeld on the south bank of the River Tay opposite Dunkeld, may also survive from the early monastery: a replica is kept in the cathedral museum. The dedication of the later medieval cathedral was to St Columba. This early church was for a time the chief ecclesiastical site of eastern Scotland (a status yielded in the 10th century to St Andrews). An entry in the Annals of Ulster for 865 refers to the death of Tuathal, son of Artgus, primepscop (Old Irish 'chief bishop') of Fortriu and Abbot of Dunkeld. The monastery was raided in 903 by Danish Vikings sailing up the River Tay, but continued to flourish into the 11th century. At that time, its abbot, Cr√≠n√°n of Dunkeld (d. 1045), married one of the daughters of M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda (1005‚Äì34) and became the ancestor of later Kings of Scots through their son Donnchad (Duncan I) (1034‚Äì40).See Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS), South-East Perth, Edinburgh: 1994, 89-90, for a summary of the early history of Dunkeld, and descriptions of the 'Apostles' Stone' and other early sculpture. Middle Ages Engraving of Dunkeld by James Fittler in Scotia Depicta, published 1804 Dunkeld Cathedral The see of Dunkeld was revived by Alexander I (1107‚Äì24). Between 1183 and 1189 the newly formed diocese of Argyll was separated from that of Dunkeld, which originally extended to the west coast of Scotland.RCAHMS Argyll, Volume 2: Lorn, Edinburgh 1974, 160. By 1300 the Bishops of Dunkeld administered a diocese comprising sixty parish churches, a number of them oddly scattered within the sees of St Andrews and Dunblane.McNeill, P G B & MacQueen, H L (eds) Atlas of Scottish History to 1707, Edinburgh 1996, 353. The much-restored cathedral choir, still in use as the parish church, is unaisled and dates to the 13th and 14th centuries. The aisled nave was erected from the early 15th century. The western tower, south porch and chapter house (which houses the cathedral museum) were added between 1450 and 1475.RCAHMS 1994 (op cit), 124. The cathedral was stripped of its rich furnishings after the mid-16th century Reformation and its iconoclasm. The nave and porch have been roofless since the early 17th century. They and the tower in the 21st century are in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. Below the ceiling vault of the tower ground floor are remnants of pre-Reformation murals showing biblical scenes (c. 1490), one of very few such survivals in Scotland. The clearest to survive is a representation of the Judgement of Solomon. This reflects the medieval use of this space as the Bishop's Court. Within the tower are preserved fragments of stonework associated with the cathedral and the surrounding area, including a Pictish carving of a horseman with a spear and drinking-horn, and a number of medieval grave-monuments. The cathedral museum is housed in the former chapter house and sacristy, on the north side of the choir. After the Reformation this chamber was used as a burial aisle by the Earls, Marquises and Dukes of Atholl, and contains a number of elaborate monuments of the 17th- early 19th centuries. Also preserved within the museum are two early Christian cross-slabs, a number of communion and other items, and a display on the history of Dunkeld and the cathedral. In June 2005, there was a major theft from the cathedral museum. Items stolen included a quaich, communion cups, and 'a cast-bronze beadle‚Äôs bell with a wooden handle, that was used in the cathedral from the 17th century.' Battle of Dunkeld (1689) Most of the original town was destroyed during the Battle of Dunkeld when, in August 1689, the 26th Foot (Cameronian Regiment) successfully fought the Jacobites shortly after the latter's victory at the Battle of Killiecrankie. Holes made by musket-ball strikes during the battle can still be seen in the east gable of the cathedral.Inglis, John Alexander. (1911). The Monros of Auchinbowie and Cognate Families. pp. 40 ‚Äì 44. Edinburgh, Privately printed by T and A Constable. Printers to His Majesty. Later history Dr George Smyttan FRSE HEIC (1789-1863) was born and raised in Dunkeld and retained links to Birnam all his life. The High Street drill hall in Dunkeld was completed in 1900. The alignment of the town was radically altered in 1809 by the building of a new stone bridge over the River Tay by Thomas Telford at the east end of the town, and the laying out of a new street (Bridge Street‚ÄìAtholl Street) at right angles to the old alignment. This street, which retains much of its Georgian appearance, was part of the main route north to Inverness until Dunkeld was bypassed in 1977, along with Birnam, by the A9. Townscape The main street of Dunkeld The rebuilt town of Dunkeld is one of the most complete 18th- century country towns in Scotland. Many of the harled (rough-cast) vernacular buildings have been restored by the National Trust for Scotland (NTS). The present street layout of the older part of town consists of a 'Y-shaped' arrangement, parallel with the River Tay, comprising a single street (Brae Street/High Street) sloping down from the east into the long 'V' of the market place, known as The Cross. Closes (lanes) leading off this main street give access to the backlands of the houses (a traditional arrangement in Scottish towns). On the site of the traditional market cross, the fanciful neo-Gothic Atholl Memorial Fountain (NTS) was built in 1866, as a monument to George Murray, 6th Duke of Atholl (1814‚Äì64). The Fountain is notable for its heraldry and Masonic symbolism, the 6th Duke having been Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, 1843‚Äì64. At the west end of The Cross is the Ell Shop (NTS), built 1757, which takes its name from the iron ell (weaver's measure) fixed against one corner. This building is said to have been built on the site of the town's medieval hospital, dedicated to St George. At the north-west corner of the same row is the Duchess of Atholl Girls' School, erected 1853 in neo-Gothic style, designed by R & R Dickson.Dictionary of Scottish Architects It is generally known as the Duchess Anne after its founder Anne Home-Drummond (1814‚Äì97), spouse of the 6th Duke of Atholl and Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria. The building is used for exhibition and other purposes, notably the popular annual Dunkeld Art Exhibition in summer. Historic view of Dunkeld from The London Magazine, January 1777 The left arm of the 'Y' leads along Cathedral Street to the medieval cathedral, and the right arm (now largely blocked off) originally led to Dunkeld House, built by Sir William Bruce in 1676-84 for the 1st Marquis of Atholl. Demolished in 1827, this was one of Scotland's major 17th-century mansions. A neo-Gothic replacement was begun on the same site but never completed (no visible remains). The area around the cathedral was the original focus of settlement in Dunkeld in medieval (and doubtless earlier) times. Here stood the manses of the Cathedral clergy, with the Bishop's Palace to the west of the church. This was also the position of the medieval bridge over the River Tay. Surrounding countryside Ossian's Hall of Mirrors stands in the Craigvinean Forest near Dunkeld. Dunkeld is situated in an area of Scotland marketed as Big Tree Country. The area is heavily wooded, and has some notable trees, including the Birnam Oak, believed to be the only remaining tree from the Birnam Wood named by Shakespeare in his play Macbeth: Other significant trees in the area include Niel Gow's Oak, the tree under which Niel Gow, a fiddler under contract to three of the Dukes of Atholl, composed many of Scotland's famous strathspeys and reels. It stands near Gow's home at Inver. The Parent Larch near Dunkeld cathedral is the sole survivor from a group of larches collected from the mountains of the Tyrol mountains in 1738, and which were the seed source for large-scale larch plantings in the local area. Much of the countryside surrounding the town is designated as a national scenic area (NSA), one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development. The River Tay (Dunkeld) NSA covers . Parts of the area also form part of the Tay Forest Park, a network of forests managed by Forestry and Land Scotland that are spread across the Highland parts of Perthshire. About northeast of the town is the Loch of the Lowes nature reserve, managed by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. There are many walks in the area. The summit of Birnam Hill (on Murthly Estate) lies south of the railway station and is easily ascended from there, or from a car park to the east. Ossian's Hall of Mirrors is a folly located in the pleasure grounds known as The Hermitage, located close to Dunkeld. The site is owned by the National Trust for Scotland, and has walks in the wooded scenery surrounding the River Braan. Transport Dunkeld and Birnam Railway Station The A9 through Dunkeld as bypassed by a new section of road in 1977. The town is now approximately one hour from Glasgow and Edinburgh, and two hours from Inverness, by car. There are regular bus and coach services to Birnam and Dunkeld along the A9, with long-distance coaches operated by Scottish Citylink. There is access by rail at Dunkeld & Birnam railway station on the Highland Main Line route between Perth and Inverness. Most services on the route extend to either Edinburgh Waverley or Glasgow Queen Street; on Sundays only a southbound train operated by the East Coast Main Line operator extends to London King's Cross via Edinburgh, although there is no corresponding northbound service from London. A daily (except Saturday) London service is offered by the overnight Caledonian Sleeper trains to and from London Euston.

Biography  Michel started out her career as a model at a young age. She was born in Guadalajara. She modeled suits in order to help in her house expenditures. In interviews for magazines she has said her father died during her childhood and thus her relatives had to help out financially with her schooling. That is also the reason she started to work in modeling so young. She then moved to Mexico City where she got the opportunity of working for the famous model agency Contempo. Through this agency, Anette got the opportunity of hosting a TV program called Hollywood DF. In 1996, Anette was offered a role in the telenovela Al Norte del Corazon for TV Azteca. She rejected the proposal, fearing of being typecast for the role she was offered. Some time later she received a proposal to work in the same telenovela, but this time as the protagonist, √Ångela Medina, costarring with her ex-husband, Jorge Luis Pila. In 1997, Anette was offered, and accepted, to star in the play Que lio con las petacas. In July 1998, she and Alan Tacher started co-hosting the TV program Tempranito, which airs on weekends. That same year, Anette was invited to Paris to model for fashion designer Armando Maffud. In January 1999, Anette left Tempranito in order to act again.

It also offers the only American Bar Association‚Äìapproved, year-long, study-abroad program, which is based in London. History=Beginnings Notre Dame Law School opened in February 1869. Despite its humble beginning, right from the start, the Law School required law students to have completed previous education in a thorough course in the liberal arts. This was uncommon at the time when Law School applicants only had to be 18. The first faculty consisted of only four professors, with the most prominent being Lucius Tong and Timothy Howard. The first class graduated in 1871 and consisted of three students. The reading room of the Kresge Law Library, in Biolchini Hall \\"Colonel\\" Hoynes era The Arch connecting Eck (left) and Biolchini (right) Halls One of the most important names in the history of the school was \\"Colonel\\" William J. Hoynes. He was born in County Kilkenny, Ireland in 1847 and emigrated with his parents at age seven. He fought for the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war, he was a student at Notre Dame from 1867 to 1872, and later went to Brunswick, New Jersey where he was editor of the Daily Times. Hoynes later attended the University of Michigan Law School where he obtained his LL.B. In 1882, Rev. Walsh, then the president of the University, invited Hoynes to take control of the Law School, which was in demise. Hoynes accepted Rev. Walsh's offer in 1883, and taught classes in the Main Administration Building (University of Notre Dame) and in Sorin Hall where a large room permitted him to set up a \\"Moot Court\\". The course of study was extended from two to three years. Hoynes was assisted in various subjects by John Ewing and Lucius Hubbard of South Bend. Under his tenure, enrollment in the law school began to rise immediately. The university restored the old building of the Institute of Technology after it was damaged by fire in 1916, and renamed it Hoynes Hall in honor of Dean William Hoynes. It was given to the exclusive use of the law students who moved there from Sorin Hall. After the Law School moved to its own building, Hoynes Hall housed the Architecture Department until 1963 and the Psychology Department until 1974, and then was renamed Crowley Hall and became the house of the Music Department since 1976. In 1925 John Whitman was appointed by Dean Thomas Konop as the first Law School librarian, and the collection grew to 7,000 volumes. 20th century On October 7, 1930, the Law School was transferred to the new building located on Notre Dame Avenue. The beautiful Gothic building, which still stands today, has a large reading room. The second librarian, Lora Lashbrook, and the third, Marie Lawrence, grew the library's collection to 20,000 volumes by 1952, and 55,000 volumes by 1960. The increase of both the library collection and student population reduced the available space. Regardless, this was balanced by the expansion of the law school funded by a donation from S. S. Kresge, the namesake of the Kresge Law Library. Under the guidance of Dean Lawless the school started one of the nation‚Äôs first programs allowing law students to study abroad, with a year-long program in London to study the roots of common law. In 1986 a further expansion added the East Reading Room and created the reference librarian offices. In 1990 alumnus John F. Sandner donated funding for the acquisition of the entire 120,000 volume collection of the Chicago Bar Association Library. In 1970, Graciela Olivarez became the first woman and Latina to graduate from Notre Dame Law School. The next class to graduate women would be 1973. 21st-centuryNew resources for scholarship= In 2004, the Kresge Law Library became one of the few academic law libraries to own more than 600,000 volumes. This was accomplished mainly under the tenure of the fifth law librarian, Roger Jacobs, who also served as head librarian of the Library of the United States Supreme Court. Between 2007 and 2008, a new building, the Eck Hall of Law, was constructed to provide the Law School with an additional 85,000 square feet of classroom and office space. In 2010 Robert Biolchini, alumnus and entrepreneur from Tulsa, Oklahoma, funded the renovation of the Kresge Law Library, located in the renamed Biolchini Hall of Law. The renovated Biolchini Hall is 106,500 square feet, has two 50-seat classrooms, a seminar room, 29 group study rooms, and holds 300,000 book volumes and more than 300,000 volumes in microfilm. The total cost of renovations and expansions was approximately 58 million dollars. =Faculty hiring momentum= In recent years, the expanding Notre Dame Law faculty has attracted several accomplished scholars from other top law schools. In 2009, University of Virginia Law School Professor Stephen Smith left a tenured position to join the Notre Dame Law faculty. In 2012, Professor Barry Cushman, the James Monroe Distinguished Professor of Law and Professor of History at the University of Virginia, joined the NDLS faculty. In 2017, it was announced that private law theorist Paul Miller from McGill University would join the Notre Dame faculty. Samuel Bray, a remedies theorist previously teaching at UCLA law, joined the faculty in 2018. During the same period, long-time Notre Dame professors have been invited for visiting faculty positions at Harvard, the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago law schools. =Expanded urban presence in DC and Chicago= In 2013, new space was secured for the Notre Dame Law in Chicago program, which allows ND Law students to pursue their studies from an urban campus in downtown Chicago (\\"in the Loop\\"). In 2015, in partnership with Kirkland & Ellis, the law school debuted its Notre Dame Law in DC program, which allows students to spend a semester studying in Washington, DC. In recent year, the school has hosted talks and events by may prominent legal figures, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, William Barr.

Degrees The Law School grants the professional Juris Doctor, Master of Laws and Doctor of Juridical Science degrees. The Master of Laws program can be pursued either at the main campus in South Bend or at the Law School's London Law Centre in the United Kingdom. The law school also offers a Master of Science in Patent Law, Certificate in Patent Prosecution, and LL.M. in International Human Rights Law. Job and clerkship placement In the class of 2019, 167 out of 193 graduates (86%) secured full-time, long- term employment requiring passage of the bar exam within ten months of graduation. The top 3 most popular destinations for graduates in the class of 2018 were Illinois (21.7%), New York (10.6%), and California (9.5%). Furthermore, 41.5% of graduates in the class of 2019 found employment in large law firms (100+ attorneys) and 11.9% pursued federal clerkships. Notre Dame has been recognized as a feeder school for federal clerks and in recent years has placed a higher percentage of its graduates as federal clerks than other top law schools, such as the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Columbia Law School. Costs The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Notre Dame Law School for the 2020-2021 academic year is $84,230. Facilities Former main entrance to Notre Dame Law School; the new Eck Hall of Law opened in 2009. Notre Dame Law School is located in the heart of Notre Dame's campus and it housed in the Eck and Biochini Halls, two buildings connected by a suspended walkway. Biolchini Hall was designed by architect Charles Donagh Maginnis in 1930 and serves as a prominent example of collegiate Gothic architecture. It was renovated in 2010 thanks to a gift from Robert Biolchini and renamed to its current name. The Kresge Law Library is located in Biochini Hall, while most of the classrooms are in Eck Hall. Funding for the law library was provided by businessman S.S. Kresge, the founder of what is now Sears Holding Corporation. In 2004, the Kresge Law Library became one of the few academic law libraries to own more than 600,000 volumes. This was accomplished mainly under the tenure of the fifth law librarian, Roger Jacobs, who also served as head librarian of the Library of the United States Supreme Court. Eck Hall was built in 2010. The $57-million building was connected to the original building through a suspended walkway that hosts a common area. Eck's 85,500 square feet of space include classrooms, faculty offices, and administrative space. The building also hosts a 205-seat moot courtroom, the Patrick F. McCartan Courtroom, in addition to four lecture halls, five seminar rooms, three skills training rooms, student services and activities center, and a chapel. The building was named in honor of school graduate, benefactor, and advisor Frank E. Eck. The Law School also hosts a legal aid clinic in South Bend. Notable alumni Despite having smaller graduating classes than most of America's top law schools, Notre Dame's alumni roster includes a range of distinguished jurists, advocates, politicians, and business leaders. *Tae-Ung Baik - a legal scholar of international human rights law and Korean law; Professor of Law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa William S.

The Obando Fertility Rites\\"Sayaw Obando.\\" (Fertility Dance), Obando, Bayang Pinagpala! (Obando, Blessed Town!), Pamahalaang Bayan ng Obando (Local Government of Obando), 2006/2007 are a dance ritual, initially an Anitist ritual, and later also became a Catholic festival celebrated every May in Obando, Bulacan, Philippines. Locals and pilgrims, sometimes dressed in traditional costume, dance and sing in the town's streets to honour and beseech Obando's three patron saints: San Pascual (Paschal Baylon), Santa Clara (Clare of Assisi) and Nuestra Se√±ora de Salamb√°o (Our Lady of Salambao). Origin The fertility rites were initially made in honor of the anito Diyan Masalanta, the Tagalog goddess of love, Lakapati, the Tagalog fertility deity, and Bathala, the supreme god of the Tagalog people. The rites were performed within the vicinity of a dambana. When the Spanish arrived, they forcibly converted the natives into Roman Catholicism and changed their religious beliefs regarding the fertility rites.https://www.aswangproject.com/lakapati- the-transgender-tagalog-deity/ Festivities The Rites are observed in a triduum: 17th of May for St. Paschal Baylon, 18th of May for St. Clare of Assisi , and 19th of May for Our Lady of Salamb√°o. Each of the three days usually begins with a morning Mass said by the parish priest. A procession, held immediately thereafter, consists of the three saints' images followed by bands playing instruments made of bamboo or brass, and devotees who dance the fandango while singing the hymn, Santa Clara Pinung-Pino (Saint Clare, Most Refined). The image of each saint leads the procession on his or her designated feast day. The Rites, especially the fertility dance, are popular with pilgrims from all over the Philippines, most of whom supplicate the triad of saints for a child, a spouse, or general good fortune. Throughout the three days, devotees joyously dance in the streets as a form of prayer, asking for the spirit of life to enter into the wombs of women. The Philippine national hero, Jos√© Rizal, mentioned the Rites in Chapter 6 (\\"Captain Tiago\\") of his 1887 Spanish novel, Noli Me T√°ngere. The patron saints Images of the three saints above the altar of Obando Church: Our Lady of Salamb√°o is in the centre, flanked by St Paschal to her right and St Clare to her left. Saint Clare St. Clare of Assisi is the oldest saint declared patroness of Catanghalan (the town's former name), her image first enshrined the chapel built by missionaries of the Order of Friars Minor in the town. St. Clare was a 13th-century Italian nun, who founded the Poor Clares according to the rule and teachings of her contemporary, St. Francis. St. Clare became the patroness of good weather because her Spanish name, Clara, also referred to clearer skies after a storm. This formed the basis for the Filipino custom of offering chicken eggs to St. Clare to ensure good weather, as the Spanish word for egg white or albumen, claro, is also a pun on her name. Devotees participating in the Rites would sometimes hold eggs as they sway to the fandango. The introduction of St. Clare by Spanish Franciscans as a replacement for pre- colonial Tagalog gods, especially the deity of conception Diyan Masalanta, transformed the old, animist Kasilonawan dancing ritual into the offering of the fandango to the saint to prevent or cure sterility in women. Eventually, St. Clare evolved into the patroness of individuals seeking a mate and to have children, particularly daughters. =Santa Clarang Pinong-pino= *\\"Santa Clarang pinong-pino / Ako po ay bigy√°n mo / Ng asawang lab√≠ntatl√≥ / Sa gastos 'di magreklamo!\\" *(\\"Saint Clare, most refined / Unto me bestow / Spouses, thirteen in all / For the expense, I shan't complain!\\") *A variation: \\"Santa Clarang pinong-pino / Ang pangak√≤ ko ay ganit√≥ / Pagdat√≠ng ko sa Obando / Sasay√°w ako ng pandanggo.\\" *(\\"Saint Clare, most refined / My promise is like so / When I arrive at Obando / I shall dance the fandango.\\") Saint Paschal During the 18th century, the Franciscan missionaries built the town church and introduced the veneration of Saint Paschal Baylon. His surname, Baylon, was taken to mean \\"one who likes dancing\\", ultimately derived from the Spanish bailar, the verb form of \\"dance\\". Like St. Clare, he also became the patron saint of fertility, wealth and abundance. An anecdote tells of how a childless couple from the neighbouring town of Hagonoy met a youth selling crabs. The young man told the couple to visit Obando and participate in the Rites to ameliorate their condition. Upon entering Obando Church, the couple were amazed by the sight of Saint Paschal's image, for its face looked exactly like the young crab vendor. This is the origin of St. Paschal's patronage of childless couples who wish to have children, particularly sons. Our Lady of Salamb√°o On 19 June 1763, the image of Our Lady of Salamb√°o (formal title: \\"Our Lady of Immaculate Conception of Salamb√°o\\"), was the last saint whose cultus was introduced to Obando. Legend tells of three fishermen named Juan, Juli√°n, and Diego dela Cruz caught the Virgin Mary's image in their salamb√°w, a fishing net supported with bamboo crosspieces and mounted on a raft. They were fishing at a place known as Hulingduong, Binwangan (now part of Malabon), and when they decided to bring the image to the neighbouring town of Navotas, their boat suddenly grew heavy and immobile. When they eventually decided to bring the image to Obando, their boat quickly lightened and became easy to paddle. This was taken a sign that the Virgin wanted to be enshrined in Obando Church. She is still venerated there as the local patroness of fishing and of good harvests. Ban and post-War revival During the Second World War, the church and a large portion of Obando were ravaged by fire; included amongst the damaged property were the images of the three patron saints. A few years after the war's end, both the Archbishop of Manila and the vicar of Obando Church forbade the fertility dance due to its pagan origins. During the prohibition, normal religious processions were still held on the triduum, but without the lively street dancing. In 1972, parish priest Rev. Fr. Rome R. Fern√°ndez and the Komisyon ng Kalinangan (Commission on Culture) of Obando helped in having the ban lifted and in reviving the ancient dance ritual, which is still practised to this day. In popular culture The Rites were featured in the pilot episode of the Filipino teleserye Ina Kapatid Anak, which used fertility issues as a plot device.

Photo circa. 1947 to 1955 This article details the history of electrical engineering.  Ancient developments Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \\"Thunderer of the Nile\\", and described them as the \\"protectors\\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra‚Äòad () applied to the electric ray.The Encyclopedia Americana; a library of universal knowledge (1918), New York: Encyclopedia Americana Corp Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus, an ancient Greek philosopher, writing at around 600 BCE, described a form of static electricity, noting that rubbing fur on various substances, such as amber, would cause a particular attraction between the two. He noted that the amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair and that if they rubbed the amber for long enough they could even get a spark to jump. At around 450 BCE Democritus, a later Greek philosopher, developed an atomic theory that was similar to modern atomic theory. His mentor, Leucippus, is credited with this same theory. The hypothesis of Leucippus and Democritus held everything to be composed of atoms. But these atoms, called \\"atomos\\", were indivisible, and indestructible. He presciently stated that between atoms lies empty space, and that atoms are constantly in motion. He was incorrect only in stating that atoms come in different sizes and shapes, and that each object had its own shaped and sized atom.Russell, Bertrand (1972). A History of Western Philosophy, Simon & Schuster. pp.64-65.Barnes, Jonathan.(1987). Early Greek Philosophy, Penguin. An object found in Iraq in 1938, dated to about 250 BCE and called the Baghdad Battery, resembles a galvanic cell and is claimed by some to have been used for electroplating in Mesopotamia, although there is no evidence for this. 17th-century developments Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia. In 1600, the English scientist, William Gilbert extended the study of Cardano on electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\\"of amber\\" or \\"like amber\\", from ŒÆŒªŒµŒ∫œÑœÅŒøŒΩ [elektron], the Greek word for \\"amber\\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \\"electric\\" and \\"electricity\\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646. Further work was conducted by Otto von Guericke who showed electrostatic repulsion. Robert Boyle also published work. 18th- century developments By 1705, Francis Hauksbee had discovered that if he placed a small amount of mercury in the glass of his modified version of Otto von Guericke's generator, evacuated the air from it to create a mild vacuum and rubbed the ball in order to build up a charge, a glow was visible if he placed his hand on the outside of the ball. This glow was bright enough to read by. It seemed to be similar to St. Elmo's Fire. This effect later became the basis of the gas-discharge lamp, which led to neon lighting and mercury vapor lamps. In 1706 he produced an 'Influence machine' to generate this effect. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society the same year. Benjamin Franklin Hauksbee continued to experiment with electricity, making numerous observations and developing machines to generate and demonstrate various electrical phenomena. In 1709 he published Physico-Mechanical Experiments on Various Subjects which summarized much of his scientific work. Stephen Gray discovered the importance of insulators and conductors. C. F. du Fay seeing his work, developed a \\"two-fluid\\" theory of electricity. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. It is uncertain if Franklin personally carried out this experiment, but it is popularly attributed to him. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge, by coming up with the single fluid, two states theory of electricity. In 1791, Italian Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectricity, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which nerve cells passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. 19th-century developments Sir Francis Ronalds Electrical engineering became a profession in the late 19th century. Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network and the first electrical engineering institutions to support the new discipline were founded in the UK and US. Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, Francis Ronalds stands ahead of the field, who created a working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity. Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the Institution of Electrical Engineers) where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort. The donation of his extensive electrical library was a considerable boon for the fledgling Society. Michael Faraday portrayed by Thomas Phillips c. 1841‚Äì1842 National Portrait gallery NPG 269 Development of the scientific basis for electrical engineering, with the tools of modern research techniques, intensified during the 19th century. Notable developments early in this century include the work of Georg Ohm, who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the electric current and potential difference in a conductor, Michael Faraday, the discoverer of electromagnetic induction in 1831. In the 1830s, Georg Ohm also constructed an early electrostatic machine. The homopolar generator was developed first by Michael Faraday during his memorable experiments in 1831. It was the beginning of modern dynamos ‚Äî that is, electrical generators which operate using a magnetic field. The invention of the industrial generator, which didn't need external magnetic power in 1866 by Werner von Siemens made a large series of other inventions in the wake possible. In 1873 James Clerk Maxwell published a unified treatment of electricity and magnetism in A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism which stimulated several theorists to think in terms of fields described by Maxwell's equations. In 1878, the British inventor James Wimshurst developed an apparatus that had two glass disks mounted on two shafts. It was not till 1883 that the Wimshurst machine was more fully reported to the scientific community. Thomas Edison built the world's first large-scale electrical supply network During the latter part of the 1800s, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of physics. It was not until the late 19th century that universities started to offer degrees in electrical engineering. In 1882, Darmstadt University of Technology founded the first chair and the first faculty of electrical engineering worldwide. In the same year, under Professor Charles Cross, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began offering the first option of Electrical Engineering within a physics department. In 1883, Darmstadt University of Technology and Cornell University introduced the world's first courses of study in electrical engineering and in 1885 the University College London founded the first chair of electrical engineering in the United Kingdom. The University of Missouri subsequently established the first department of electrical engineering in the United States in 1886. During this period commercial use of electricity increased dramatically. Starting in the late 1870s cities started installing large scale electric street lighting systems based on arc lamps.Quentin R. Skrabec, The 100 Most Significant Events in American Business: An Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO - 2012, page 86 After the development of a practical incandescent lamp for indoor lighting, Thomas Edison switched on the world's first public electric supply utility in 1882, using what was considered a relatively safe 110 volts direct current system to supply customers. Engineering advances in the 1880s, including the invention of the transformer, led to electric utilities starting to adopting alternating current, up till then used primarily in arc lighting systems, as a distribution standard for outdoor and indoor lighting (eventually replacing direct current for such purposes). In the US there was a rivalry, primarily between a Westinghouse AC and the Edison DC system known as the \\"war of the currents\\".Quentin R. Skrabec Jr, The 100 Most Significant Events in American Business - 2012, Page 85 George Westinghouse, American entrepreneur and engineer, financially backed the development of a practical AC power network. \\"By the mid-1890s the four \\"Maxwell equations\\" were recognized as the foundation of one of the strongest and most successful theories in all of physics; they had taken their place as companions, even rivals, to Newton's laws of mechanics. The equations were by then also being put to practical use, most dramatically in the emerging new technology of radio communications, but also in the telegraph, telephone, and electric power industries.\\"Bruce J. Hunt (1991) The Maxwellians, page one By the end of the 19th century, figures in the progress of electrical engineering were beginning to emerge. (published 1996 in the NFPA Journal) Charles Proteus Steinmetz helped foster the development of alternating current that made possible the expansion of the electric power industry in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. Emergence of radio and electronics Jagadish Chandra Bose in 1894 Charles Proteus Steinmetz circa 1915 During the development of radio, many scientists and inventors contributed to radio technology and electronics. In his classic UHF experiments of 1888, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves (radio waves) leading many inventors and scientists to try to adapt them to commercial applications, such as Guglielmo Marconi (1895) and Alexander Popov (1896). Millimetre wave communication was first investigated by Jagadish Chandra Bose during 18941896, when he reached an extremely high frequency of up to 60GHz in his experiments. He also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves, reprinted in Igor Grigorov, Ed., Antentop, Vol. 2, No.3, pp. 87‚Äì96. when he patented the radio crystal detector in 1901. 20th-century developments John Fleming invented the first radio tube, the diode, in 1904. Reginald Fessenden recognized that a continuous wave needed to be generated to make speech transmission possible, and by the end of 1906 he sent the first radio broadcast of voice. Also in 1906, Robert von Lieben and Lee De Forest independently developed the amplifier tube, called the triode. Edwin Howard Armstrong enabling technology for electronic television, in 1931. In the early 1920s, there was a growing interest in the development of domestic applications for electricity. Public interest led to exhibitions such featuring \\"homes of the future\\" and in the UK, the Electrical Association for Women was established with Caroline Haslett as its director in 1924 to encourage women to become involved in electrical engineering.  World War II years  The second world war saw tremendous advances in the field of electronics; especially in radar and with the invention of the magnetron by Randall and Boot at the University of Birmingham in 1940. Radio location, radio communication and radio guidance of aircraft were all developed at this time. An early electronic computing device, Colossus was built by Tommy Flowers of the GPO to decipher the coded messages of the German Lorenz cipher machine. Also developed at this time were advanced clandestine radio transmitters and receivers for use by secret agents. An American invention at the time was a device to scramble the telephone calls between Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. This was called the Green Hornet system and worked by inserting noise into the signal. The noise was then extracted at the receiving end. This system was never broken by the Germans. A great amount of work was undertaken in the United States as part of the War Training Program in the areas of radio direction finding, pulsed linear networks, frequency modulation, vacuum tube circuits, transmission line theory and fundamentals of electromagnetic engineering. These studies were published shortly after the war in what became known as the 'Radio Communication Series' published by McGraw-Hill in 1946. In 1941 Konrad Zuse presented the Z3, the world's first fully functional and programmable computer.  Post-war years  Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as 'radio engineering' and was primarily restricted to aspects of communications and radar, commercial radio and early television. At this time, the study of radio engineering at universities could only be undertaken as part of a physics degree. Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field broadened to include modern TV, audio systems, Hi-Fi and latterly computers and microprocessors. In 1946 the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) of John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly followed, beginning the computing era. The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives, including the Apollo missions and the NASA moon landing. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name electronics engineering, which then became a stand-alone university degree subject, usually taught alongside electrical engineering with which it had become associated due to some similarities. Solid-state electronics  A replica of the first working transistor, a point-contact transistor. Metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), the basic building of modern electronics. The first working transistor was a point-contact transistor invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at the Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) in 1947. They then invented the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. While early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, they opened the door for more compact devices. The surface passivation process, which electrically stabilized silicon surfaces via thermal oxidation, was developed by Mohamed M. Atalla at BTL in 1957. This led to the development of the monolithic integrated circuit chip. The first integrated circuits were the hybrid integrated circuit invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the monolithic integrated circuit chip invented by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959. The MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at BTL in 1959. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. It revolutionized the electronics industry, becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world. The MOSFET is the basic element in most modern electronic equipment, and has been central to the electronics revolution, the microelectronics revolution, and the Digital Revolution. The MOSFET has thus been credited as the birth of modern electronics, and possibly the most important invention in electronics.

Atalla first proposed the concept of the MOS integrated circuit (MOS IC) chip in 1960, followed by Kahng in 1961. The earliest experimental MOS IC chip to be fabricated was built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA Laboratories in 1962. MOS technology enabled Moore's law, the doubling of transistors on an IC chip every two years, predicted by Gordon Moore in 1965. Silicon-gate MOS technology was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in 1968. Since then, the MOSFET has been the basic building block of modern electronics. The mass-production of silicon MOSFETs and MOS integrated circuit chips, along with continuous MOSFET scaling miniaturization at an exponential pace (as predicted by Moore's law), has since led to revolutionary changes in technology, economy, culture and thinking. The Apollo program which culminated in landing astronauts on the Moon with Apollo 11 in 1969 was enabled by NASA's adoption of advances in semiconductor electronic technology, including MOSFETs in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) and silicon integrated circuit chips in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). The development of MOS integrated circuit technology in the 1960s led to the invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s. The first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971. It began with the \\"Busicom Project\\"Federico Faggin, The Making of the First Microprocessor, IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine, Winter 2009, IEEE Xplore as Masatoshi Shima's three-chip CPU design in 1968, before Sharp's Tadashi Sasaki conceived of a single-chip CPU design, which he discussed with Busicom and Intel in 1968. The Intel 4004 was then designed and realized by Federico Faggin at Intel with his silicon-gate MOS technology, along with Intel's Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima. This ignited the development of the personal computer. The 4004, a 4-bit processor, was followed in 1973 by the Intel 8080, an 8-bit processor, which made possible the building of the first personal computer, the Altair 8800.

Although the most advanced intelligent lights can produce extraordinarily complex effects, the intelligence lies with the human lighting designer, control system programmer, or the lighting operator, rather than the fixture itself. For this reason, intelligent lighting is also known as automated lighting, moving lights, moving heads, or simply movers. More recently the term has fallen into disuse as abilities once reserved to a specific category of lighting instruments (most notably colour changing and variable focus) have become pervasive across a range of fixtures. The distinction has become more blurred with the introduction of machines that would not be considered lights but share the ability to move their orientation and are operated by the same DMX512 control protocol, such as moving yoke projectors. History There are many patents for intelligent lighting dating back from 1906, with Edmond Sohlberg of Kansas City, USA. The lantern used a carbon-arc bulb and was operated not by motors or any form of electronics, but by cords that were operated manually to control pan, tilt and zoom. 1925 saw the first use of electrical motors to move the fixture, and with it the beam position, by Herbet F. King (US patent number: 1,680,685). In 1936 US patent number 2,054,224 was granted to a similar device, with which the pan and tilt were controlled by means of a joystick as opposed to switches. From this point on until 1969, various other inventors made similar lights and improved on the technology, but with no major breakthroughs. During this period, Century Lighting (now Strand) started retailing such units specially made to order, retrofitted onto any of their existing lanterns up to 750 W to control pan and tilt. George Izenour made the next breakthrough in 1969 with the first ever fixture to use a mirror on the end of an ellipsoidal to redirect the beam of light remotely. In 1969, Jules Fisher, from Casa Ma√±ana area theatre in Texas saw the invention and use of 12 PAR 64 lanterns with 120 W, 12 V lamps fitted, 360 degrees of pan and 270 degrees of tilt, a standard that lasted until the 1990s. This lamp was also known as the 'Mac-Spot' \\\\- scroll down to \\"Early Automated Lighting\\" ~1970 In Bristol in 1968, progress was also being made, mainly for use in live music. Peter Wynne Wilson refers to the use of 1 kW profiles, with slides onto which gobos were printed, inserted from a reel just like on a slide projector. The fixtures also had an iris and a multiple colored gel wheel. These lights were also fitted with mirrors and made for an impressive light show for a Pink Floyd gig in London. Another fixture known as the 'Cycklops' was also used for music in the USA, although it was limited in terms of capabilities. With only pan, tilt, and color functions, and at 1.2 meters long and weighing in at 97 kilograms including the ballast, they were heavy and cumbersome. These units were designed more for replacing the ever unreliable local spotlight operators. In 1978 a Dallas, Texas-based lighting and sound company called Showco began developing a lighting fixture that changed color by rotating dichroic filters. During its development, the designers decided to add motors to motorize pan and tilt. They demonstrated the fixture for the band Genesis in a barn in England in 1980. The band decided to financially back the project. Showco spun off their lighting project into a company called Vari-Lite, and the first fixture was also called the Vari-lite. It also used one of the first lighting desks with a digital core and this enabled lighting states to be programmed in. Genesis was later to order 55 Vari-lites to use in their next chain of gigs across the UK. The lights were supplied with a Vari-Lite console which had 32 channels, five 1802 processors and a dramatic improvement of the first console which was very simple and had an external processing unit. In 1986 Vari-Lite introduced a new series of lighting fixtures and control consoles. They referred to the new system as their Series 200, with the new lights designated \\"VL-2 Spot Luminaire\\", and \\"VL-3 Wash Luminaire\\". The Series 200 system was controlled by the Artisan console. Vari-Lite retroactively named the original system \\"series-100\\". The Original Vari-Lite console was retroactively named the \\"series 100 console\\" and the original Vari-Lite was retroactively named the \\"VL-1 Spot Luminaire\\". The prototype fixture shown to Genesis in 1980 was re- designated the \\"VL-zero\\" in the mid-1990s to keep the naming consistent. In 1985, the first moving head to use the DMX protocol was produced by Summa Technologies. Up until that time, moving lights were using other communication protocols, such as DIN8, AMX, D54 and the proprietary protocols of other companies, such as VariLite, Tasco, High End and Coemar. The Summa HTI had a 250 W HTI bulb, two colour wheels, a gobo wheel, a mechanical dimmer and zoom functions. The first purchasable/mass-produced scanner was the Coemar Robot, first produced in 1986. Initially produced with either the GE MARC350 lamp, or the Philips SN250. Later versions were factory equipped with the Osram HTI400, a modification that High End Systems had been doing since 1987. The Robot used model aircraft servo motors to control Pan, Tilt, Color and Gobo, with the gobo wheel providing the shutter function as well. The Color wheel had 4 dichroic color filters (red, blue, yellow, and green), and the gobo wheel contained four stamped patterns (non-replaceable). The Robot communicated with a proprietary 8-bit protocol, yet had no microprocessors/pal's/pics/ram, O/S or other modern logic device. In 1987, Clay Paky began producing their first scanners, the Golden Scan 1 & Crystal Scan. They utilized stepper motors instead of servos and used a HMI 575 lamp, bright and with a far more uniform beam brightness. This was followed by the Intellabeam in 1989, released by High End, who at the time were the distributors for Clay Paky. In the 1990s, the future came closer with Martin, a Danish Company that produced fog machines. They began to manufacture a line of scanners known as Roboscans, with a variety of different specifications for different users. They were named for their wattages, with a range starting with 1004 and 1016. Later came the 804 and 805, designed for small venues. Other models were the 218, 518, 812, 918 and 1200Pro units. Martin also produced a whole new range of Moving Heads called the Martin MAC Series. This series is still popular today, with new fixtures such as the MAC III and MAC Viper, which are among the highest quality moving lights. The most recent development in intelligent lighting is digital lighting, with fixtures such as High End Systems' DL3. These fixtures consist of a bright LCD or DLP projector mounted on a moving yoke, much like that of an ordinary moving head. These fixtures also contain an integrated media server, which allows for millions of colour choices, endless libraries of gobo-like images, and projection of images and video. Features Several intelligent lights in use at a concert. Note the white beams they produce An automated light, properly called a luminaire, fixture (or sometimes moving head), is a versatile and multi-function instrument designed to replace multiple conventional, non-moving lights. Depending on the venue and application, automated luminaires can be a versatile and economical addition to a stock of traditional lights because, with proper programming, they can swiftly alter many aspects of their optics, changing the ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù of the light very quickly. Lighting is typically pre-programmed and played back using only simple commands, although moving heads can be controlled ‚Äúlive‚Äù if the operator is sufficiently experienced. Most moving heads have all or some of the features, each feature is set to a channel number, such as these: Control Moving lights are controlled in many ways. Usually the fixtures are connected to a lighting control console, which outputs a control signal. This control signal sends data to the fixture usually in one of three ways: Analogue (which has largely been phased out), DMX (which stands for \\"Digital Multiplex\\", also the industry standard control protocol), or Ethernet Control (such as ArtNet or sACN). The fixture then takes this signal and translates it into internal signals which are sent to the many stepper motors located inside. DMX connectors, the most common method of controlling moving heads. Note that these are 3-pin DMX connectors, which are used by some manufacturers, rather than the 5-pin, which specified by the USITT DMX-512 Standard. The vast majority of moving heads are controlled using the DMX protocol, usually using dedicated twisted pair, shielded cable with 5-pin XLR connectors at the ends.DMX512 Control Protocol Information - Connectors and Cables Each fixture is assigned a block of DMX channels in one of the venue's DMX universes (a self-contained set of cables and fixtures which can operate a maximum of 512 individual channels). The central lighting desk transmits data on these channels which the intelligent fixture interprets as value settings for each of its many variables, including color, pattern, focus, prism, pan (horizontal swing), tilt (vertical swing), rotation speed, and animation. Since moving heads did not attain prominence until DMX's predecessor, AMX, or Analog Multiplex had passed the zenith of its popularity. Very few moving heads use analogue control, due to crippling restrictions on bandwidth, data transfer speeds and potential inaccuracy. Some of the most modern intelligent fixtures use RJ-45 or Ethernet cabling for data transfer, due to the increased bandwidth available to control increasingly complicated effects. Using the new Ethernet technology, control surfaces are now able to control a much larger array of automated fixtures. The most recent development in lighting control is RDM (lighting), or Remote Device Management. This protocol allows for communication between the lighting controller and fixtures. With RDM, users can troubleshoot, address, configure, and identify fixtures from the RDM enabled lighting desk. Moving lights are programmed using a fixture box in ETC light boards Moving lights are much more difficult to program than their conventional cousins because they have more attributes per fixture that must be controlled. A simple conventional lighting fixture uses only one channel of control per unit: intensity. Everything else that the light must do is pre-set by human hands (colour, position, focus, etc.) An automated lighting fixture can have as many as 30 of these control channels. A slew of products are available on the market to allow operators and programmers to easily control all of these channels on multiple fixtures. Lighting boards are still the most common control mechanism, but many programmers use computer software to do the job. Software is now available that provides a rendered preview of the output produced by the rig once fixtures are connected to the program or console. This allows programmers to work on their show before ever entering the theater and know what to expect when the lights are connected to their controller. These products usually feature some method of converting a computer's USB output to a DMX output. Construction Intelligent fixtures usually employ compact arc lamps as light sources. They use servo motors or, more commonly, stepper motors connected to mechanical and optical internal devices to manipulate the light before it emerges from the fixture's front lens. Examples of such internal devices are: :* Mechanical dimming shutters used to vary the intensity of the light output. Mechanical dimmers are usually a specially designed disk or a mechanical shutter. Shutters with high speed stepper motors can be used to create strobe effects. :* Color wheels with dichroic color filters used to change the color of the beam. :* Variable, incremental Cyan, Magenta and Yellow color-mixing filters to vary beam color via subtractive color mixing. Using this method, a much wider range of colors can be created than is possible using single color filters. :* Automated lens trains used to zoom and focus the beam; irises are used to change the size of the beam. Some fixtures have as many as 10 independently controlled prisms and lenses to focus and shape the beam. :* Pattern wheels with gobos and gate shutters to change the shape of the beam or project images. Some fixtures have motors to rotate the gobo in its housing to create spinning effects, or use their complicated lens systems to achieve the same effect. :* Automated framing shutters to further shape the beam and control unwanted spill. These fixtures also use motors to enable physical movement of the light beam by either: :* Pivoting an automated mirror which reflects the beam along X & Y axes, or :* Attaching the entire fixture lens train to a yoke with motorized pan & tilt Note that fixtures which use the former method are not technically ‚Äúmoving heads‚Äù, since the light source itself does not move. However, the term ‚Äúmoving head‚Äù is used interchangeably throughout this article. On a moving head the glass gobos could have some fault caused by back-reflections of the light on the lens, to solve this defect can be used antireflections gobo. AntiReflections Gobos Usage mirror ball Intelligent lights (now commonly referred to as automated or moving heads), can be used wherever there is a need for powerful lighting which must be capable of rapid and extreme changes of mood and effects. Moving heads would, therefore, be inappropriate in a setting which does not require strong lighting (such as a home) or where the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of the light required does not vary excessively (although it may need to be very strong for a venue like a stadium). Naturally, there are exceptions to this rule, most notably the use of large numbers of moving heads for international sporting events, such as the Commonwealth Games or Olympic Games, where many thousands of separate automated fixtures are often used to light the opening and closing ceremonies. The 2008 Summer Olympics, in Beijing, had a rig of around 2,300 intelligent fixtures which is \\"the largest single automated lighting system ever assembled for a single event\\" Usually, however, the use of intelligent lights is confined to theatre, concerts, nightclubs, and churches where the versatility of these fixtures can be utilised to its best extent. In these applications, the uses of fixtures can be informally grouped into two categories: active and passive (although these are not standardised terms). Passive use of automated lighting involves utilizing their versatility to perform tasks which would otherwise require many conventional lights to accomplish. For example, six to eight moving heads can create a textured blue ‚Äúnight‚Äù effect on the stage floor while applying amber light to the actors during one scene - this can create a sensation of dusk or night. At the flick of a switch, the fixture can change to an animated red ‚Äúfire‚Äù effect for the next scene. Attempting this transition with traditional lighting fixtures could require as many as thirty instruments. In this circumstance, the automated fixtures are not doing anything that could not be achieved using conventional fixtures, but they dramatically reduce the number of lights needed in a rig. Other features of automated fixtures, such as rotating gobos, are also possible with conventional fixtures, but are much easier to produce with intelligent fixtures. A Martin MAC 250 entour (profile - top) and MAC 250 wash (wash - bottom). Active use of automated lights suggests that the luminaire is used to perform tasks which would otherwise require human involvement, or be simply impossible with conventional fixtures. For instance, a number of moving heads producing tightly focused, pure white beams straight down onto the stage will produce a fantastic effect reminiscent of searchlights from a helicopter (especially if a smoke machine or hazer is used to make the beams visible). To recreate such an effect without intelligent lights would require at least one human operator seated directly above the stage with a followspot, which would generally be considered to be too expensive for such a small effect. Moving head fixtures are often divided into spot, wash lights and beam lights. They vary in use and functions, but many companies offer profile and wash versions of the same model of light. Profile lights generally contain features like gobos and prisms, whereas wash lights have simpler optics and a wider beam aperture resulting in wider beam angle, which may be altered by internal lenses or ‚Äúfrost effects‚Äù. Wash lights are more likely to have CMY colour mixing although it is common for high-end spot lights to have such features too. Spot units are generally used for their beam effect (usually through smoke or haze) and the ability to project texture, whereas wash lights tend to be used for providing a stage wash. A Martin MAC 250 Entour (profile - top) and MAC 250 wash) wash - bottom). Notice the difference in beam characteristics caused by the gobo of the Entour and the wider beam angle of the wash. Beam lights are often built much like the spot in terms of functionality aside from one key difference, beam lights use a wide lens to make an even more extreme beam. A typical spot has a beam angle from 15 to 35 degrees, whereas an average spot has a beam angle of three to seven degrees with some high end companies producing lights with zero degree beams. Such beam effects are less seen in the theatre industry and more in the club and concert industry. Debate Not all lights that have movement can be defined as intelligent. Basic, low cost fixtures that are marketed primarily to DJ's, club venues, or for retail in novelty stores are not controllable beyond simply powering the device on or off. This lack of a feature set or remote control makes these lights only a small step above a conventional stage lighting instruments. The introduction of devices referred to as \\"Auto-yokes\\", after the original design created by the company City Theatrical, blurs the line between a \\"conventional\\" and \\"intelligent\\" fixture. Designed to replace the static mounting hardware on stage lights, an automated yoke provides the pan and tilt features built into a traditional automated fixture. When combined with an LED fixture or colour scroller, the most common features of an automated light can be readily duplicated http://www.citytheatrical.com/Products/2012/02/10/autoyoke City Theatrical Auto Yoke. \\"Auto-yokes\\" are often promoted as a way to modernize and increase the flexibility of an inventory of lighting fixtures at a reduced cost to replacement with intelligent lights. Generally, moving mirrors are faster at adjusting a lights position than moving head fixtures, however moving heads style fixtures have a far larger total range of movement. The movement from mirror lights tends to be rectilinear, because the center of movement for both axes is usually in the same place (behind the centre of the mirror). Moving head fixtures have a much more concentric range of motion, owing to the separation of the axis of motion. Much smoother operation can be achieved through one axis of a moving head luminaire describing a circle (usually pan) and the other (tilt) changes the diameter of the circular movement. In early luminaires a pseudo rotating gobo effect could be achieved by moving the tilt in line with the other axis and then moving the pan from end stop to end stop.

Story In 19th century Britain, a series of grisly murders are taking place in the countryside near London. The victims are good- looking young men, between the ages of twenty and thirty, and all have had their throats torn open and their blood drained. The witness of the latest murder, a coachman named Joe Trigger (Leslie Anderson), is driven insane when he catches a glimpse of the mysterious killer. Investigating the deaths are Detective Inspector Quennell (Peter Cushing) of Scotland Yard and his assistant, Sergeant Allan (Glynn Edwards). Because Joe keeps ranting about a horrible winged creature with huge eyes, Quennell hatches a theory that perhaps a homicidal eagle is on the loose. At the scene of the latest killing, several shiny scales are discovered. The two latest victims were students of the renowned entomology professor Dr. Carl Mallinger (Robert Flemying), who lives nearby with his beautiful daughter Clare (Wanda Ventham) and their scar- faced butler, Granger (Kevin Stoney). When Quennell brings the scales to Mallinger for identification, Mallinger behaves suspiciously and tries to take all of them. Quennell describes his theory about a killer eagle, but Mallinger dismisses it outright. Quennell is unaware that the entomologist has a pet eagle, which is tormented by the sadistic Granger. Explorer and naturalist Frederick Britewell (William Wilde) returns from Africa with some moth chrysalids for Dr. Mallinger and the handsome young adventurer soon becomes a victim of Clare, who is the real murderer; Clare is a \\"were-moth\\" and transforms at night to drink the blood of young men. Britewell becomes her latest victim after watching her in an amateur horror play performed by some of her father's students (which seems to be a spoof of the Hammer Frankenstein genre), but lives long enough to exclaim, \\"Death's head!\\", to Quennell before he dies. Both Mallinger and Clare claim not to have known Britewell when questioned by Quennell. Quennell's superior suggests he takes a holiday and delegate the case to Sgt. Allan, but the Detective Inspector refuses. He reveals his intention to send his daughter Meg to stay with some relatives in Sussex until the investigation is over. As they leave for the railway station, Allan informs Quennell that Dr. Mallinger did in fact know Frederick Britewell, prompting Quennell to perform an immediate search of Mallinger's home. He finds that the scientist and his daughter have left for Upper Higham. He also discovers a cellar filled with human bones and Granger's corpse. Quennell informs his superior he will be taking leave after all: he and Meg go to Upper Highham incognito as a vacationing banker named Thompson and his daughter. There they meet a young bug collector who shows him the proudest exhibit in his collection, a Deathshead moth, and Quennell discovers that Mallinger is also incognito as a \\"Dr. Miles\\" staying at a nearby estate.

History E.V.C. Hansom Cab, ca. 1904 The Electric Vehicle Company was founded 27 September 1897 as a holding company of battery-powered electric vehicle manufacturers made up of several companies assembled by Isaac Rice. Rice had acquired in May, 1897 another electric cab manufacturer, the Electric Carriage & Wagon Company (E.C.W.C.) in New York. Their vehicles were constructed by Henry G. Morris and Pedro G. Salom, builders of the Electrobats, the first truly useful electric automobiles in the USA. E.V.W.C. pioneered a cab system that included service stations for quick change of battery sets, and repair work; vehicles were leased only, not sold. Twelve of these cabs were in use in Manhattan in January, 1897. After the merger, E.C.V. concentrated on building heavy but reliable electric cabs which were built in the E.C.W.C. workshops. The rental system was for a short time run by E.V.C. Between 1897 and 1899, there were several hundred E.V.C. vehicles built. The company was taken over in 1899 by a syndicate around William C. Whitney, Thomas Fortune Ryan Anthony N. Brady, and P. A. B. Widener, thus forming the so-called \\"Lead Cab Trust,\\" which hoped to develop a monopoly by placing electric cabs on the streets of major American cities, starting with New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Boston. Although by 1899, E.V.C. was the largest motor car manufacturer in the USA \\\\- a position lost to Oldsmobile in 1901 - this policy failed soon, as it was even then not able to sell as many vehicles as necessary for the task. The firm actually made and sold about two thousand electric cars, but fell into hard times in 1900 after facing competition from gas-powered cars and legal problems stemming from these monopolistic practices, as well as scandal surrounding the poor performance of its vehicles. Whitney brought in industrial leader Albert Augustus Pope now, who brought the Columbia Automobile Company. The trust was reorganized as the parent company of several vehicle manufacturers, among them Columbia and the Riker Electric Vehicle Company, which was acquired in 1902. Electric Vehicle's chief asset was now the holding of the Selden Patent which established a right to royalties from all manufacturers of internal combustion engine vehicles. While this was initially lucrative, it led inevitably to opposition from the other manufacturers and expensive lawsuits, which ended with bankruptcy in 1907. The patent was valid until 1913, but lost its worth as the appellation court reduced it to vehicles with Brayton engines, of which none was used in a motor vehicle.

It covers the period from 1307 until its abrupt end in 1326. Manuscript The earliest surviving version of the Vita is a copy made by Thomas Hearne in 1729 from a manuscript lent to him by James West. The original is thought to have been burnt some years later along with many of West‚Äôs other papers. The manuscript is known to have come from the Benedictine Abbey of Malmesbury, but it is not known if the work was written there. Authorship The author is unknown, but aspects of his character can be inferred from his work. He was a highly educated person, shown in his use of biblical quotations and knowledgeable references to the Civil Law of the time. He was likely to have been of advanced age, due to both his apparent death in 1326 and his despair at ‚Äúthe young men of today.‚Äù A popular candidate for the authorship of the Vita is a lawyer from Herefordshire and clerk to the Earl of Hereford: John Walwayn. No√´l Denholm-Young first put forward the proposition that Walwayn was the author. Denholm-Young's conclusions are based on the known facts about Walwayn--such as being a king's clerk whose career reached its peak between 1315 and 1323, and who was dead by 1326--matching the interests, knowledge and timeline of the author of the chronicle. However, Antonia Gransden has cast doubt on Denholm-Young's theory and has said that \\"the evidence seems insufficient to warrant more than a very tentative conclusion, especially as the Vita has nothing about St Paul's and practically nothing on London\\".W.R Childs takes a similar view to Gransden but notes that \\"Walwayn fits a substantial number of the criteria in training, west country connections, and career. If it is not he, then someone with a career very like his is needed to fit the bill\\". The most recent theory about the date in which it was written was put forward by Professor C.J. Given-Wilson. He thought the Vita was written at intervals throughout Edward‚Äôs reign, this is supported by the seeming lack of future knowledge shown by the author at different stages of his work.

The drivetrain had clear evolutionary roots in Pope's bicycle business, driving the rear axle via a chain drive (typical of automobiles of the era), producing virtually the only operating noise. Between the motor and the chain drive was a transmission with three forward and two reverse speeds. Twenty batteries manufactured by Exide Batteries, also associated with Electric Vehicle Company, were placed above both axles in order to balance the weight. Brakes on both rear wheels featured a bell, which rang when the vehicle reached a full stop. Top speed was about . Besides the runabout, Columbia manufactured about 20 other models including taxis, police cars, and buses. The vehicles were most popular in cities, where relatively smooth roads made the electric motor, with its smoothness and silence, appear superior over the gasoline engine. It helped in urban areas that electrical supply for recharging was easily found within the runabout's range. Nevertheless, in 1903, a Columbia was driven from Boston to New York City in 23 hours. In keeping with this urban orientation, the Columbia was positioned as a high-end vehicle (even at a time when automobiles were very expensive), with its showroom across the street from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York.

(The International Mozarteum Foundation and the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg are the other two.) It specializes in music and the dramatic arts and, like its affiliates, was established in honour of Salzburg-born musician Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. History and clarification In 1841, Mozart's widow Constanze Weber Mozart founded the first of the ‚ÄúMozarteum‚Äù entities: the ‚ÄúCathedral Music Association and Mozarteum,‚Äù whose mission was the ‚Äúrefinement of musical taste with regard to sacred music and concerts.‚Äù The association operated as predecessor to the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg through the 19th century and was at the heart of the city‚Äôs musical life, offering concerts and related activities. It assumed its present name in 1908. The International Mozarteum Foundation came next, toward the end of the 19th century. It built, and to this day maintains, a sizeable elegant office building on Schwarzstra√üe to which are attached two concert halls. Construction took place between 1910 and 1914 to a design by Munich architect Richard Berndl (1875‚Äì1955). The larger of the two halls is itself known as the ‚ÄúMozarteum‚Äù and is world-renowned; its proper name is simply ‚ÄúGro√üer Saal.‚Äù The smaller hall is the ‚ÄúWiener Saal.‚Äù Besides maintaining this complex, the foundation runs two museums devoted to Mozart (the composer‚Äôs birth house, or ‚ÄúGeburtshaus,‚Äù and his main Salzburg residence, or ‚ÄúWohnhaus‚Äù) as well as an annual January music festival devoted to Mozart‚Äôs music (‚ÄúMozartwoche‚Äù). The more recently rebuilt University main building is at Mirabellplatz 1. Organ of the Gro√üer Saal The original 100-rank grand concert hall organ was built by the Austrian firm Rieger in 1914. A completely new organ in neo-Baroque style was installed in 1970 by E. F. Walcker & Cie. This was dismantled in 2008. In 2010 a new 50-stop tracker action organ was installed by Hermann Eule Orgelbau, Bautzen, and the 1914 fa√ßade for the instrument was reconstructed. Organ of the Wiener Saal The pipe organ in the ‚ÄúWiener Saal‚Äù small concert hall, invisibly located in an organ chamber above the stage, was built in 1914 by Rieger with 25 stops and electro-pneumatic action. It was rebuilt in 1941, including a new console and some neobaroque modifications. The organ is in bad condition, but still playable.

He was one of the leading artists of the Macchiaioli and was also involved with the Mazzini movement. Biography Silvestro Lega Painting (1866‚Äì67) by Giovanni Fattori He was born in Modigliana, near Forl√¨, to an affluent family. From 1838 he attended the Piarist College, where his skill at drawing became evident. From 1843 to 1847 he attended the Accademia di Belle Arti, Florence, studying drawing under Benedetto Servolini (1805‚Äì79) and Tommaso Gazzarrini (1790‚Äì1853), then studying painting, briefly, under Giuseppe Bezzuoli. During 1847 he attended Luigi Mussini‚Äôs school, where the teaching emphasized the 15th-century Florentine principles of drawing and orderly construction. Then and for some years afterwards he continued to attend the Scuola del Nudo of the Accademia. As a Garibaldian volunteer, Lega participated in the military campaigns for Italian independence (1848‚Äì49) before resuming his training, this time under Antonio Ciseri.Steingr√§ber & Matteucci 1984, p. 113. In 1850 he completed his first large-scale painting, Doubting Thomas (Modigliana, Osp. Civ.). In 1852 he won the Concorso Trienniale dell‚ÄôAccademia with David Placating Saul. On 30 January 1853, he became a member of the Accademia degli Incamminati of Modigliana. In 1855, Lega returned to his native town, where he remained until 1857. Serious by nature, Lega was an infrequent visitor of the Caff√® Michelangiolo, a favorite meeting place in the 1850s for the young painters who later became known as the Macchiaioli. Diego Martelli, a contemporary of Lega, wrote of him that \\"he was not one of those people who, artistically speaking, can fling themselves into novel developments .... In spite of the discussions that went on nightly in the crucible of the Caff√® Michelangiolo, Lega's art, until 1859, remained conspicuously academic.\\"Broude 1987, p. 151. Subsequently, Lega's style began moving towards Realism and away from the Purismo of Mussini. This progress is evident in the four lunettes he painted between 1858 and 1863 for the Oratory of the Madonna del Cantone in Modigliana, and in several military-themed works he painted during that period.Broude 1987, pp. 153‚Äì154. Together with his Macchiaioli friends Odoardo Borrani, Giuseppe Abbati, Telemaco Signorini and Raffaello Sernesi, he started painting landscapes en plein air. From 1861 to 1870, he lived with the Batelli family, near the Affrico river, and started a relationship with the elder daughter, Virginia. The children and women of the Batelli family were the subjects of many of his paintings during this happy period of his life.Calingaert, \\"Lega, Silvestro\\", Grove Art Online In 1870, he was awarded the silver medal at the Parma's National Exposition. In that same year, Virginia Batelli, his companion, died of tuberculosis. Three of Lega's brothers also died at about this time. The grieving Lega returned to Modigliana. Depressed, and experiencing the onset of eye problems, he ceased painting almost entirely for four years between 1874 and 1878. In 1875, he and Borrani established a modern art gallery in Florence, but it quickly failed, and Lega's financial problems worsened.Broude 1987, p. 171. In 1878 he took part in the preparation of the Parigi's Universal Exposition. At the Florentine Promotrice in 1879, Lega‚Äîwho never traveled outside Italy‚Äîsaw two Impressionist paintings by Camille Pissarro, which he admired.Broude 1987, pp.172‚Äì174. He became a frequent guest of the Tommasi family, and a tutor of the sons of the family. The art historian Norma Broude says that \\"like the Batellis before them, [the Tommasis] welcomed Lega into their family circle and provided for him the warm and close-knit family environment in which he and his art could flourish.\\" In 1886, he painted one of his most famous works, the Gabbarigiane. By the mid-1880s, Lega was almost blind, and perceived only large masses. He produced many paintings in Gabbro, where he was a guest of the Bandini family. He participated at the Exposition Universelle (1889) and at the Promotrice of Florence. Lega died in Florence in 1895 of stomach cancer. Style Lega's artistic career may be divided into two periods: the first is the calm phase, where he looked at the world optimistically. The second is the disturbed phase, associated with his poor economic conditions and with his depression after Virginia's death. Efrem Gisella Calingaert says: > the originality of Lega‚Äôs style lies in the way he adapted a contemporary > use of colour, based on direct experience of the motif, to a traditional > type of composition and carefully defined forms. This is illustrated by the > Singing of the Ballad (1867; Florence, Pitti), which, together with A Visit > (1868; Rome, G.N.A. Mod.) and The Pergola, constitute the most important > works of Lega‚Äôs mature period and perhaps of his whole career. In the > Singing of the Ballad the simplicity and balance of the composition, the > transparency of the colours and rendering of atmosphere, the monumentality > of the figures in profile and their pyramidal forms invest the scene with > the solemnity of a painting by Piero della Francesca.

One of the city's oldest neighborhoods, it originated as the township of Newburgh, first settled in 1799. Much of the area has historically served as home to Cleveland's original Czech and Polish immigrants. While demographics have shifted over the decades, the largest part of Broadway today, Slavic Village, is named for these earlier communities. Broadway is bordered to the west and northwest by Cuyahoga Valley, to the north by the Central neighborhood, to the east by the neighborhoods of Union‚ÄìMiles Park and Kinsman, the suburbs of Cuyahoga Heights and Newburgh Heights to the west and southwest and Garfield Heights to the south. Slavic Village The historic Slavic Village is named for what was once a predominantly Central European neighborhood centered on Fleet Avenue and Broadway. The neighborhood's name encompasses two smaller ethnically sub-divided sections: the larger Czech- dominated Karlin, and the heavily Polish Warszawa districts. Slavic Village is combining the Warszawa site the Polish immigrants settled in 1870. The lives of these immigrants were centered on the hamlets they've formed and the St. Stanislaus Church they built. Its exact location is at East 65th Street and Forman Avenue, and the thriving Polish commercial center along Fleet Avenue and East 71st Street. The population of Poles and other Central Europeans in the neighborhood peaked in the period from 1920s to 1940 and began to decline during migration of the people to the villages, when the city suffered demographic decline during the 1950s and 1960s. On November 28, 1980, Warszawa was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Warszawa Neighborhood District. An attempt to revitalize the neighborhood was undertaken with the organization of Neighborhood Ventures, Inc., in 1977. With Teddy and Donna Sliwinski, along with architect Kaszimier Wieclaw, the area began to come alive once again. In order to attract people of various Slavic European descent, the name of the region was changed to \\"Slavic Village\\". The nonprofit Slavic Village Assn. was organized in 1978 to preserve residential and commercial buildings through its sponsorship of the annual Slavic Village Harvest Festival, which in its 17th year (1993) was drawing 100,000 people. Between 1987 and 1990, the Slavic Village Assn. merged with the Broadway Development Corporation as the Slavic Village Broadway Development Corporation to coordinate community-based revitalization activities in the Broadway neighborhood. The Slavic Village Broadway Development Corporation is now known as just Slavic Village Development, and cites an \\"investment of $160 million over the past 22 years to improve Slavic Village.\\" More recently, Slavic Village has seen difficult times. The zip code that includes the neighborhood, 44105, recorded more home foreclosures than any other zip code in the country during the second quarter of 2007,\\"Foreclosures drift to Sun Belt from Rust Belt.\\" CNN Money Magazine, November 16, 2007. Accessed February 2, 2008. causing the national media to declare the neighborhood the center of the 2007 foreclosure crisis The neighborhood saw an increase in property crime, violent crime, and prostitution during 2007, attributed to youth gangs and drug dealers taking advantage of the high number of home foreclosures.\\"Crime scene: foreclosure.\\", CNN Money Magazine. November 19, 2007. Accessed February 2, 2008. The City's plan to eliminate the 3rd police district, which includes Slavic Village, had been an issue of concern for some residents, as voiced by local councilman Anthony Brancatelli.\\"Cleveland City Council members question plan to reduce police districts.\\" The Plain Dealer. January 31, 2008. Accessed February 2, 2008. In May 2008, the former 3rd District Police headquarters closed and Slavic Village policing responsibility was redrawn between the 3rd and 5th Police Districts, increasing the number of police cars on the street. Subsequently, Councilman Brancatelli stated he was satisfied with the resulting improved police response time and police presence. In July 2008, Slavic Village was one of six neighborhoods of the Neighborhood Strategic Investment Initiatives featured locally in an audio discussion titled \\"Conversations in Slavic Village\\" held by the Case Western Reserve Studies Symposium. Stakeholders discussed how neighborhoods are vital to the livable city. Speakers cited specific events occurring in direct counterexample to the increased crime reported in the media in 2007. Representatives included a savings and loan association official, steel mill corporate social responsibility manager, public art coordinator, community development corporation director, and local metropark, youth organization, and cultural center directors.

Roleplaying in Sindome is unique in that most of its coding is custom, employing XML, File-IO, custom web based websocket powered game client, and a graphical web interface. Sindome has been online since 1997 and there are typically between 60-100 players dedicated role-players online at any time.Sindome Mudconnector Entry Storyline Set in a dark gritty world in the year 2105, Sindome takes place in Withmore City, a geodesic dome city built in the wastelands of lower California. The face of the earth has been scarred by climate change and many great cities have been submerged due to the rising oceans. Sindome is all about playing a role in the struggle of the haves versus the have-nots. Characters fight for survival, carving out a niche in the underworld for themselves. From the Sindome website: > The corporations have grown larger than the countries they were once > entities of, their wealth and power allowing them to build a refuge away > from the chaos that has befallen the globe.

Theme The Sindome world is based on the cyberpunk genre of science fiction. Sindome draws its inspiration from books, movies, and traditional role-playing games like: William Gibson's Neuromancer, Count Zero, Virtual Light, Idoru, \\"Burning Chrome\\"; Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash; Bruce Sterling's Mirrorshades, Richard K Morgan's Altered Carbon and Islands in the Net; R. Talsorian Games' Cyberpunk 2020; the movies Blade Runner, Judge Dredd, and The Matrix series.  Criticism  Sindome has been a topic of regular discussion on the /r/MUD subreddit community for many years. Issues raised by one former player named 'Ephemeranalis' include criticism of its dated codebase and number of missing features common to the cyberpunk theme (decking, matrix use, etc) despite regular code and content updates. Other unsubstantiated allegations made anonymously on Reddit include abuse by its volunteer staff of their positions for their own personal gain. These allegations remain unproven given the nature of accusations made from anonymous aliases. Sindome's rigid \\"no discussing in character events on out of character channels\\" rule have been described as being a tool wielded by the administration to silence critics on their platform. In addition, these rules have reportedly been flaunted by members of the GM team themselves in the past, with at least one known incident of such spilling over onto Reddit and Discord. An 'anti-fan site' titled \\"Club Banished\\" was created by former community members who were removed for toxic behavior. The Sindome staff team has responded to many of the issues raised by the website. A disclosure about a former GM being banned for cheating after abuse of their powers was discovered during an audit can be found on their forums.

Effect  The performer displays a cigarette which behaves in almost a magnetic fashion, sticking to a fingertip, the tongue etc. Next it floats from hand to hand before suddenly dropping down near the floor. As it moves up again it passes through a ring formed by the performer's fingers, as proof that there is no external support, and ends up in the performer's mouth.  History  Fearson had seen an illusion performed by John Kennedy, called the \\"Animated Self-lighting Cigarette\\". Fearson attempted to duplicate it, and thought that he had succeeded, but during a conversation with Kennedy he was told that he had, in fact, invented a new method. He published a manuscript to document the illusion, entitled \\"Fearson's floating cigarette\\", which included the necessary props.  Method  The main principle is based on using a very thin thread, an old principle. But what Fearson had discovered during his attempts to duplicate John Kennedy's effect was a new and unorthodox way of arranging the thread. One end of the invisible thread is attached by wax to the cigarette and the other end is attached to the right thumb, with the middle of the invisible thread attached to the head, making it possible to create effects that previous to Fearson's discovery had been impossible, such as making the cigarette fall to the ground (performed by placing the right thumb near the head, causing the cigarette to fall down).

It is located at the lower end of Uptown, just above the New Orleans Central Business District, on the \\"lakeside\\" of St. Charles Avenue. A subdistrict of the Central City/Garden District Area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: MLK Boulevard, South Claiborne Avenue and the Pontchartrain Expressway to the north, Magazine, Thalia, Prytania and Felicity Streets and St. Charles Avenue to the south and Toledano Street, Louisiana Avenue and Washington Avenue to the west. This old predominantly African-American neighborhood has been important in the city's brass band and Mardi Gras Indian traditions. History The area closest to Saint Charles Avenue developed first, in the first half of the 19th Century, booming with the opening of the New Orleans & Carrollton Railway, which became the St. Charles Avenue Streetcar line. The opening of the New Basin Canal at the neighborhood's lower end contributed to the area's development as a center of commerce and a working class residential area, attracting many Irish, Italian, and German immigrants. After the American Civil War many African Americans from rural areas settled in this part of the city. By the 1870s, the urbanized area extended back to Claiborne Avenue. Dryades Street in this area was a neighborhood commercial district by the 1830s. In 1849 the public Dryades Market was built, and served as an anchor for almost 100 years. The commercial district thrived in the first half of the 20th century, becoming the city's largest commercial district patronized by African Americans during the Jim Crow law era and a major hub for the Uptown African American community, overtaking the older South Rampart Street area in importance. At its height in the years after World War II, the Dryades Street district boasted over 200 businesses, with businesses owned primarily by Jews and some African Americans. The commercial portion of Dryades Street began a decline in the late 1960s, which became a steep nose-dive by the 1980s. At the low point somewhere around 1990, blighted and vacant buildings predominated. The blighted area got city attention, and the old commercial section of Dryades Street was renamed after local civil rights activist Oretha Castle Haley, who was one of the young college students who boycotted Dryades Street in 1960 (although black shoppers were welcomed, the businesses did not hire black cashiers or clerks) and participated in lunch counter desegregation demonstrations on Canal St. Projects to improve the neighborhood gradually saw fruit by the start of the 2000s. A large part of Central City was above the flooding which devastated the majority of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (see: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans). As there were many vacant buildings and vacant lots in this rare piece of high dry ground, greater attention has been drawn to Central City in post-Katrina redevelopment of the city, including the redevelopment and updating of old public housing apartments built in the 1940s during segregation. The Melph, Magnolia Projects, and Calliope Projects were located in Central City. Magnolia has been redeveloped and is now the mixed-income Harmony Oaks. Calliope has been partially redeveloped into the mixed-income Marrero Commons. Melpomene (known as the Guste apartments) includes a multi-story building for senior citizens, as well as newer townhouses and additional new replacement units under construction in 2015. Central City has a significant Civil Rights History. In addition to the boycott on Dryades Street, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was founded with Martin Luther King Jr. in Central City in 1957.

It is considered by many to be the \\"true\\" sequel to Kick Off 2 (in preference to Kick Off 3), as Kick Offs creator Dino Dini had moved from Anco Software and was responsible for all Goals engineering and game design. Goal introduced improved dynamics and A.I. over Kick Off 2, as well as other innovative features, such as multiple camera views. The game shipped 60,000 units on the first day of release. Dino Dini's Soccer Dino Dini's Soccer was a conversion of Goal! for the Sega Mega Drive. Dino Dini's Soccer had all the relevant features of the Amiga version and it was graphically superior to it. The game implemented an innovative 4-way play feature. There was also a conversion to Super NES. However, this version was only an interpretation of the game, and Dino was unhappy to have his name associated with it, as he was not responsible for any of that version and had no creative control over it. The SNES version features a very different control method, with the ball on sticking to your foot to make running with the ball easier. The game is viewed from above and played up and down the pitch, without the left-to-right option of Goal. Matches can be between 2 or 20 minutes, and the scanner which shows player positions on the rest of the pitch can be moved, resized or disabled. The method of triggering aftertouch onto a pass can be chosen as well. The game features a variety of tournaments, including the full World Cup and its qualifying rounds, and the European Championships, or individual matches, as well as being able to configure a league or cup tournament to your own specification. Only international teams are included, although their names can be customised. Unlike most soccer games of the time, player ethnicities are accurately depicted.

This knowledge is assessed by answering multiple choice questions regarding various ethical hacking techniques and tools. The code for the CEH exam is 312-50. This certification has now been made a baseline with a progression to the CEH (Practical), launched in March 2018, a test of penetration testing skills in a lab environment where the candidate must demonstrate the ability to apply techniques and use penetration testing tools to compromise various simulated systems within a virtual environment. Ethical hackers are employed by organizations to penetrate networks and computer systems with the purpose of finding and fixing security vulnerabilities. The EC-Council offers another certification, known as Certified Network Defense Architect (CNDA). This certification is designed for United States Government agencies and is available only to members of selected agencies including some private government contractors, primarily in compliance to DOD Directive 8570.01-M. It is also ANSI accredited and is recognized as a GCHQ Certified Training (GCT).  Examination  Certification is achieved by taking the CEH examination after having either attended training at an Accredited Training Center (ATC), or completed through EC-Council‚Äôs learning portal, iClass. If a candidate opts to self-study, an application must be filled out and proof submitted of two years of relevant information security work experience. Those without the required two years of information security related work experience can request consideration of educational background. The current version of the CEH is V11 which uses the EC-Council's exam code 312-50, as the earlier versions did. The cost of CEH V11 is $1199. Although the new version V11 has recently been launched, this exam has 125 multiple-choice questions, with a 4-hour time limit, The EC-Council and various ATCs (Accredited Training Center) administer the CEH examination.

Contrary to popular belief, the station is not named after a masjid (mosque) but a synagogue, the 300-year-old Gate of Mercy Synagogue near a once thriving Jewish neighbourhood, popularly known as Juni Masjid by locals. The station has four platforms (two for Harbour Line and two for Main Line). The volume of passengers on this station is very high due to different wholesale markets (i.e., Crawford Market) surrounding the station. These markets, referred to as bazaars, have various wholesale merchants, called stockists. Stockists from the Iron Market (Lokhand Bazaar), situated on the Eastern side of the railway station and Diamond Traders situated on Western side make trades of millions of Rupees each day in the markets.

Zacharia's mother was Maria Pavles asuli Mesarkishvili (1851‚Äì1916). Zacharia was the third child in a family of eighteen children (thirteen sons and five daughters). Seven children died in infancy. Although Zacharia's parents were not professional musicians, their children remembered their mother's singing.Dzigua, p. 9 In his autobiographical notes Zacharia Paliashvili writes: \\"...in our big family, my brothers and sisters displayed a natural gift of music even in their early age. To my mind the explanation of this should be sought in the fact that we, being catholics attended the church where the sweet sounds of organ music are not only enjoyable but help develop a good ear... we spend much time in the church and gradually developed a good ear..\\" Zacharia (far right) with his brothers Ivane (center) and Polycarp (far left) The first to display considerable musical abilities was the eldest son Ivane (Vano) Paliashvili (1868‚Äì1934) who subsequently became an outstanding conductor. When Vano was eleven years old he was made assistant to the church organist, and the eight-year-old Zacharia was admitted as a chorister to the church choir. With the help of the dean, Father I. Antonishvili, little Zacharia studied \\"Lullaby for Jesus\\" and sang it with great success on Christmas night.Dzigua, p. 11 The Kutaisi period, however, left a deep impression on the life of the future composer. It was the place of his first contact with music, and the basis of his professional attitude to his life's dedication ‚Äì music ‚Äì had developed there, too. All his life Zacharia had retained his youthful love for the relics of Georgia's magnificence, the ruins of the Church of Bagrat (built by Georgia's King Bagrat III in 1003, ruined and plundered by the Turks in 1631), Gelati (1106‚Äì1125), one of the most important centres of education, philosophy and literature in medieval Georgia and the extraordinary beauty of his home town. Subsequently, Paliashvili recalled Kutaisi many times, permeated, he said, with a \\"truly Georgian spirit\\". Upon leaving the two-year parish school, brothers Ivan and Zacharia began to play the piano under tutorship of Felix Mizandari, an organist and pianist. Mizandari did not charge the family for the lessons for he was aware that Paliashvili family was of very modest means. Shortly afterwards, people in the town learned of the two talented and exceptionally persevering young musicians.Dzigua, pp. 11-13 The news reached father Alfonso Khitarishvili, dean of Tbilisi Georgian Catholic Church of the assumption. With the parents' consent Khitarishvili took Ivan and Zacharia Paliashvili to Tbilisi. This was in the spring of 1887. The elder brother was appointed to the post of the organist and Zacharia was made his brother's assistant and a choirboy. A short time after, the entire family of Petre Paliashvili moved to Tbilisi. Move to Tiflis and period in Moscow The work at the Catholic Church in Tbilisi, besides providing a small but badly needed salary also gave Zacharia Paliashvili the opportunity to broaden his musical knowledge by getting acquainted with the composers of Palestrina, Lassus, Bach, Handel, Mozart and other great composers of the past.Dzigua, pp. 14-15 The first performance of a Georgian Ethnographic choir, established of the initiative and with the material support of Lado Agniashvili, a well-known public personality, took place in Tbilisi in 1886.Dzigua, p. 16 Later the concerts of this choir were conducted by Joseph Ratil (Navratil), who though Czech by birth had forever associated his life with Georgia. The concerts of Agniashvili's choir evoked favourable comments from the patriotically minded Georgian public. Vano and Paliashvili sang in this choir in 1887‚Äì1889 and this fact was of importance for the future composer. In 1889 Vano left for Russia where he was engaged as an opera conductor. His post of church organist was taken over by Zacharia who now had to support the entire family; as a result, he had no opportunity to continue his musical education.Dzigua, p. 18 in 1874 on the initiative of singer Kharlamphy Savaneli, pianists Aloizy Mizandari and Konstantin Alikhanov, the first musical school in Georgia was founded in Tbilisi. The Tbilisi Musical School was reorganised into the Tbilisi Branch of the Russian Royal Musical Society with the statue of a musical college. This was carried out with the active assistance of Mikhail Mikhailovich Ippolitov-Ivanov, a well-known Russian composer, conductor and educationalist who worked in Tbilisi in (1882‚Äì1893). Paliashvili's cherished dream came true only in 1891 when he was admitted to the french horn class under F.F. Parizek. A year later, when Parizek left the school, Paliashvili continued to study under A.I. Mosko. He graduated from the French horn class in 1895 and in the same year was admitted to the musical theory class which was conducted by Nikolai Semenovich Klenovsky, a Russian conductor, composer and teacher. Paliashvili also studied with Ippolitov-Ivanov and music critic Vasili Davidovich Korganov.Dzigua, p. 21 While studying in Klenovsky's class, Paliashvili wrote several pieces and this aroused in him a desire for further composition. Paliashvili graduated from the school with honours in the spring of 1899. During his school years he had founded a mixed choir of factory and office workers who performed Georgian and Russian folk songs for workers. In 1898 Paliashvili conducted his choir in Gyandja and had tremendous success. Following an exchange of letters with Sergei Ivanovich Taneyev (1856‚Äì1915), a Russian composer and teacher, Paliashvili went to Moscow towards the end of August 1900. After taking his entry examinations he became a pupil in the class of counterpoint at the Moscow Conservatorie. Three years of study with Professor Taneyev, an expert in polyphony, enriched Paliashvili with fundamental knowledge and facilitated his maturing into a professional composer.Dzigua, p. 23 Return to Georgia Towards the end of June 1903 Paliashvili completed his studies under Taneyev. With his young wife Julia Mikhailovna Utkina, he returned to Georgia to put into practice the knowledge he had gained in Russia. In autumn of 1903, Paliashvili began teaching at the Tbilisi High School for the nobility, where he had a singing class and also conducted the choir and orchestra, founded by him. Paliashvili was a strict and uncompromising teacher. He demanded full accuracy of intonation and precision of rhythm for every pupil-member of his choir or orchestra. He made such big progress in this field, that the school choir and orchestra soon began giving public concerts. The press called this \\"a triumph of the gifted maestro\\" and said, that the \\"choir and orchestra were brought to an evinous standard even for a musical school\\". A number of personalities who later on distinguished themselves in the Georgian Soviet musical culture (Composers: I. Tuskia, G Kiladze, S. Taktakishvili, V. Gokiely, A. Andriashvili; music critics: S. Aslanishvili, G. Chkhikvadze; Violinist L. Yashvili and others) had their first inspiring contact with music in this school, attending Z. Paliashvili's class. Violinist Andrei Karashvili and composer Zacharia Chkhikvadze worked at the same high school, where they conducted musical classes.Dzigua, p. 29 In 1904 Paliashvili was invited to head the teaching of theoretical subjects at the Tbilisi Musical College. Besides instructing classes in solfeggio, harmony and orchestration, he conducted the pupils' choir and orchestra, the public performances of which were invariably successful. In 1906, using a piano piece by A. Karashvili (\\"Sazandary\\") as a point of departure, Paliashvili composed a profoundly patriotic song, \\"Samshoblo\\", which became popular throughout Georgia.Dzigua, p. 30 Zacharia with his wife and children, c. early 1900s Progressive Georgians before the revolution had regarded collecting, recording and elaboration of folklore material as an essential element, contributing to the spiritual life of the nation. Apart from the practical application ‚Äì the use of folklore material as the basis of literary fand musical work ‚Äì a large scale propaganda of remarkable folk poetry and songs formed a major instrument for stimulating the Georgian people's patriotic sentiments. Many contemporaries of Paliashvili were engaged in folklorist work, including Meliton Balanchivadze (father of well-known Soviet composer Andria Balanchivadze and of George Balanchine, an American choreographer), Dimitri Arakishvili, Filimon Koridze, Zacharia Chkhikvadze, Kote Potskhverashvili.Dzigua, pp. 31-32 In the summer of 1903, Paliashvili and A.S. Khakhashvili (Khakhanov), professor at the University of Moscow and specialist in the history of Georgian literature, made a tour of Svanetia (a high-altitude area in western Georgia), where they recorded some rare old Georgian folk songs. Paliashvili described the trip to his favourite teacher, S.I. Taneyev. in 1903‚Äì1908 with the same goal in view Paliashvili toured such districts as Racha, where he recorded local folk singers, and in particular a mestvire (Bag-piper); Guria (Ozurgeti), Imereti, Kartli and Kakheti. Some of the songs recorded by Paliashvili were published in Moscow as a collection in 1910, financed by the Georgian Philarmonic Society. These are Forty Georgian Folk Songs recorded by Z. Paliashvili and Eight Folk songs rendered for choir and orchestra. Paliashvili, however, did not rest content. Whenever he had the least opportunity, he included folk songs elaborated by him in the concert programme of his choirs. Kliment Kvitka, Ukrainian musicologist and ethnographer, and the husband of Lesya Ukrainka, a distinguished Ukrainian poet, sang in one of these choirs. Paliashvili was a good friend of this talented daughter of the Ukrainian people and of her husband till Lesya Ukraininka's death. In 1908, on his initiative, a music school was opened under the Philharmonic Society. As the Society was short of funds, Paliashvili headed the school for several years without receiving any payment. Theoretical subjects were taught by Giorgi Natadze, one of Paliashvili's closest friends and a graduate of Moscow Conservatorie. Ilya (Ia) Kargareteli, a prominent musician, singer and composer, initiated an association of staging operas in Georgian, which soon began to work under the patronage of the Georgian Philharmonic Society. The efforts of Kargareteli, Paliashvili and Niko Kartvelishvili led to the first ever Georgian-language performances of Gounod's Faust, Anton Rubinstein's Demon, Rossini's The Barber of Seville, Verdi's Aida and Bizet's Carmen in the Tbilisi opera house. The conductors were Z. Paliashvili and N. Kartvelishvili.Dzigua, p. 39 In May 1917, the Tbilisi Musical College was reorganised into the Tbilisi Conservatory. The post of director was offered to pianist and teacher N. Nikolayev, and that of inspector to Z. Paliashvili. In 1918, when Nikolayev left Georgia, Paliashvili became the director of the Conservatorie. in 1919 he was awarded a professor's degree. Paliashvili continued to conduct classes in theoretical subjects at the Conservatorie. At the turn of the century, Paliashvili commenced working on his first opera \\"Abesalom da Etery\\". He was inspired in this by a folk legend, \\"Eteriany\\", which had been published in the Paskunji magazine (the fire bird, 1908) and rendered in the form of an opera libretto by Petre Mirianashvili, a teacher, writer and public personality of the time. The plot of the opera is based on a story of a prince who falls in love with a beautiful village girl. Believing in the sincerity of Absalom's feelings Etery marries him. At the same time, Murman, the closest friend of the prince and his visier also falls in love with Etery. Through malicious intrigues Murman destroys the happiness of the young couple. Parted from Etery Absalom falls ill and dies. Etery does not wish to live without Absalom and stabs herself to death. The opening night of this opera took place on February 21, 1919. It was produced by A. Tsutsunava and conducted by the author. The leading parts were performed by B. Zapliski (Absalom), who was soon substituted by Vano Sarajishvili; O. Bakutashvili-Shulgina (Etery) and Sandro Inashvili (Murman).Dzigua, pp. 40-41 The rousing success of his first opera had inspired Paliashvili to compose another ‚Äì the lyrical-drama Daisi (\\"Twilight\\" or \\"Sunset\\") founded on the libretto by Valerian Gunia, a stage art personality, actor and playwright. The drama of love and jealousy in Daisi is shown against the background of national genre scenes. Maro, a beautiful young girl, is betrothed by the will of her parents to Kiazo, who is brave and ambitious. The girl, however, loves her childhood friend Malkhaz, a young warrior. Tsangal, the village jester, tells Kiazo about this, and the latter challenges Malkhaz. At this time the country is attacked by enemies. The people are alarmed, but the adversaries, forgetting their duty to their Motherland, continue duelling and Malkhaz is mortally wounded. The people sternly censure the man who failed to restrain his passions on the day of trial to the country. Maro grieves over the death of her sweetheart. Thus, twilight falls prematurely on the life of the three young people. Paliashvili dedicated this work to his only son Irakly, whose untimely death he had suffered deeply.Dzigua, p. 49 The first showing of Daisi was held on December 19, 1923. It was produced and directed by Kote Marjanishvili, the sets were designed by Valerian Sidamon-Eristavi, the conductor was Ivane Paliashvili. The leading parts were performed by V. Sarajishvili (Malkhaz), E. Popova (Maro) and Krzhizhanovsky (Kiazko). When Sarajishvili died in November 1924 the part of Malkhaz was performed by a number of remarkable singers: N. Kumsiashvili, D. Andguladze, D. Badridze and M. Kvarelashvili.Dzigua, p. 51 Paliashvili's third opera, Latavra, after the libretto by Sandro Shanshiashvili, appeared five years later (the first showing was on March 16, 1928). Subsequent revisions (in 1950, particularly) noticeably improved the shortcomings of this opera which were mainly of an ideological character. \\"Daisi\\" and Latavra\\", a romance \\"who do I love?\\" to words by Ilia Chavchavadze and \\"lullaby\\" to the words of Mikhail Lermontov and several chamber pieces were dedicated to Nadejda Ivanovna Buzogly (Abashidze), a close friend of the composer, a merited artist of the Georgian Republic, professor of the Chair of Solo Singing of the Tbilisi Conservatorie, and candidate of sciences (arts). The \\"Collection of Ten Georgian and Russian folk songs\\" was dedicated by Paliashvili to Buzogly's sons Mikhail and Alexy. Paliashvili always enjoyed real friendship and respect of his talent in the family of the well-known civil engineer Mikhail Buzogly and his wife.Dzigua, p. 54 Soviet period Early in 1929 Paliashvili was invited to the Ukraine to conduct two concerts of Georgian music in Kharkov, then the capital of Ukrainian Soviet Republic. The concerts were held on January 28 and 29 and were very successful. The Ukrainian musical world warmly greeted the great Georgian composer. The reception in honor of Paliashvili was attended by distinguished representatives of Ukrainian culture and also by Henri Barbusse, a French writer who was on a visit to the Soviet Union at that time. He warmly thanked Zakharia Paliashvili for the aesthetic pleasure and for the discovery he had made ‚Äúof a new world of musical Georgia‚Äù. It was there that the idea came to produce in Kharkov Absalom and Eteri and in Tbilisi Taras Bulba, a Ukrainian classical opera by Nikolay Lysenko. Both were produced as suggested, the former in Kharkov on October 18, 1931 (Director ‚Äì A. Pagava, d√©cor ‚Äì S. Nadareishvili), and the latter in Tbilisi in the winter of 1933. Absalom and Eteri was produced in Ukrainian by Konstantin Tsagareli, a gifted lawyer and close friend of the composer, jointly with O. Varava.Dzigua, p. 56 In the summer of 1929, Paliashvili made his second visit to Azerbaijan. Two symphonic concerts were given in Baku, the capital of the republic, on July 23 and 24. The program was made up of Paliashvili's works and the author conducted the orchestra.Dzigua, p. 57 Sickness and death Since the beginning of the 1930s, Paliashvili was frequently unwell. Having been diagnosed with sarcoma of the adrenal gland, the composer was taken to Leningrad to their friend Yustin Janelidze, a famous Soviet-Georgian surgeon. Janelidze operated on Paliashvili, but when he saw that surgical interference would do no good, he stopped the operation and sewed up the wound. He estimated that Paliashvili had only several months to live. Paliashvili was bedridden during the summer months of 1933 and his condition continually deteriorated, all the while a new season had begun at the Tbilisi Opera House. Several days before his death, Paliashvili reportedly wished to hear his opera Abesalom da Eteri for the last time. The radio was switched on and Paliashvili strained to listen, happy at first but soon contorted with severe pain. At 5 p.m. on October 6, 1933, he died. Paliashvili was buried on October 10 in the garden of the opera house next to the grave of his friend Ivane \\"Vano\\" Sarajishvili, known as the ‚ÄúGeorgian nightingale‚Äù. By a decree of the Soviet Georgian Government, the Tbilisi Second Musical School, the Tbilisi Ten-Year Musical School, the Batumi Musical School and a street in Tbilisi were named after the late composer. Later, a street in Moscow was also named after him. In 1959, the entire second floor of 10 Barnov Street, where Paliashvili lived from 1915 to 1933, was set aside as his Home-Museum, which contains valuable materials relating to the life and work of the composer. On October 8, 1962, a special ceremony marked the opening of a permanent exhibition at this museum. Another permanent exhibition dedicated mainly to the childhood and youth of the composer was opened in Kutaisi, in the house where he was born. There are special exhibits on Paliashvili's life and work at the M. I. Glinka All-Union Museum of Musical Culture in Moscow.Dzigua, p. 61 Works Paliashvili on a 2018 stamp of Georgia Operas :all premiered in Tbilisi *Abesalom da Eteri (Absalom and Eteri)‚Äî4 acts, libretto by P.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. History In 1949, after making a request to Samuel Stritch, Cardinal Archbishop of Chicago, a priest at St. Agnes parish in Chicago Heights was given permission to purchase land and begin raising funds for the construction of a coed high school. By 1951 enough capital had been raised to hire a local architect to design the building. The Cardinal then mandated that there were to be two cooperative schools, one for women and one for men, each to be run by a religious order. The new plan called for the first school to accept coed classes until the boys' school was ready, about four years after the school for women was open. The Dominican Sisters of Springfield, Illinois agreed to oversee and staff the new school in 1955. Ground breaking occurred on January 6, 1957, and the school opened in September, 1958. The school was dedicated by Cardinal Albert Gregory Meyer on January 11, 1959. In September 1961, the first group of seniors preparing to graduate stood at 165, but the incoming freshman class was 450. The initial staff of six nuns was now at 18, and had outgrown the capacity of their convent in nearby Homewood. The Dominican Sisters added a new convent to the school to accommodate the growing staff. Without a male religious order to sponsor the male school, plans were eventually dropped to build the second school. Mobile classrooms were brought in to help with the overcrowding. In 1970, the Sisters and the Archdiocese reached an agreement that would leave the sisters as the sole sponsors of the school, while the Archdiocese committed more money to build an addition. While the Archdiocese did not cover all of the needed additions, over the intervening years the school continued to raise money and make needed additions and renovations.History of Marian Catholic HS The school received some criticism over tuition payment issues in March 2009, with an article appearing in the Chicago Tribune and various local media outlets. 100 students who were late on their fees, causing a $450,000 hole in the budget, were temporarily sent home from the school. Most quickly returned to class after working out payment plans with Marian. The Chicago Tribune was charged with bad reporting by many parents, who felt that many vital facts were not accurately represented in the initial article. Athletics Marian Catholic is a member of the East Suburban Catholic Conference and participates in state tournaments sponsored by the Illinois High School Association. The school sponsors interscholastic sports teams for both men and women in basketball, cross country, lacrosse, golf, soccer, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The school sponsors baseball, football, and wrestling for men, while sponsoring cheerleading, softball, water polo, and swimming and diving for women. While not sponsored by the IHSA, Marian Catholic also sponsors interscholastic teams for men and women in fencing. The fencing teams compete as a part of the Great Lakes High School Fencing Conference.Great Lakes HS Fencing Conference members The following teams have placed in the top four of their respective state tournament sponsored by the IHSA: *Football ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ State semifinalist (1981, 1986); 2nd place (1999--2000); State Champion (1993--94) *Men's Basketball ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 3rd place (2018) *Women's Basketball ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4th place (2003-- 04); 3rd place (2006--07); 2nd place (2001--02), State Champion (2012--13); 3rd place (2013--14) *Women's Golf ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4th place (2006--07); 3rd place (2007-- 08); 2nd place (2005--06) *Softball ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4th place (1986--87); 3rd place (1984-- 85) *Women's Volleyball ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4th place (2011); State Champion (2016) *Baseball ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 2nd place (2017); State Champion (2012) Band program The Marian Catholic Band has been awarded both the Sudler Shield (1997), \\"an international award recognizing high school, youth, and international marching bands of world class excellence\\", and the Sudler Flag of Honor (1991), another international award given for outstanding concert performance from the John Philip Sousa Foundation.

The Prime Minister is the final authority on all matters regarding the civil service. The civil service defined itself as \\"key wheels on which the entire engine of the state has to move.\\" Derived from the colonial legacy of the former Indian Civil Service, the civil service came into its modern formation immediately after the establishment of Pakistan as a \\"Civil Service of Pakistan\\". During its time of formation, the bureaucracy produced Ghulam Ishaq Khan who would go on to become the President of Pakistan. It had influence on many of the state's defence, internal, foreign and financial policies. In 1971, it was re- organized and reestablished under \\"Chapter I: Part-XII, Article 240\\" of the Constitution of Pakistan which gave it foundation and constitutional status. The civil bureaucracy closely collaborated with the military establishments of Pakistani Armed Forces in issues concerning the national security. The bureaucracy consists of 12 directorates that provide vital office and secretariat related duties to the Government of Pakistan. The provincial bureaucracies are headed by the respective Chief Secretaries of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan. The highest attainable rank for an officer who serves in the country's bureaucracy is BPS-22 grade. The most influential civil servants belong to the Pakistan Administrative Service and the highest-ranking civil service positions are the federal secretaries and provincial chief secretaries The Civil Service of Pakistan selects only 7.5% of the applicants by merit, education, qualification and experience while the 92.5% are selected by a quota system. The civil service exams are competitive and provides equal opportunities to males and females, depending on their qualifications. The CSS Examinations are held at the start of every year. The exams are conducted and supervised by the Federal Public Service Commission. CSS exams have a reputation of a very low pass percentage, in 2015, only 3% of the 12,176 participants cleared the multi-staged exam. Constitutional structure The Constitution of Pakistan lay down separate services for the central government and the provincial governments. Although, both types of the governments are required to regulate their civil services through the \\"Article 240 of Chapter I of Part XII\\", in case of the central reservation of the government and by the provisional assembly decrees for officers subjected in legislative list of the provinces. The idea of civil service was established by the British Empire during the colonial period of the British Indian Empire. It was derived into as \\"Pakistan Civil Service\\" in 1947 and reorganised and re-established into its modern form in 1973. The Constitution of Pakistan describes the constitutional status as below: Naming convention The Constitution of Pakistan does not set the legal name for the civil service and there is no service named as \\"Central Superior Services of Pakistan\\" (or CSS). The constitution allowed the government appointed officer and chairman of the Federal Public Service Commission of Pakistan to choose the name. The term \\"CSS\\" emerged during the first public examination of the civil service for the appointment on posts at officer entry level in the occupational groups of All- Pakistan Unified Group (APUG). The Federal Public Service Commission holds the combine competitive exam annually under the title advertised as exam for \\"Central Superior Services\\"‚Äî the term of colonial days which survived reforms. Similarly, the use of word \\"Central\\" instead of that \\"Federal\\"; as well as the term \\"Superior\\" are also the legacy of the past. These were relevant when there was central government under 1956 constitution and classes existed in the civil service. The 1973 constitution abolished all classes in the civil service as the concept of occupational groups was introduced. Act Following the foundations laid in the Constitution, the federal government promulgated The Civil Servants Act, 1973 and each province enacted its own Civil Servants Acts. The law allows civil service of federation, and of provinces, to be regulated as per rules notified under these enactments. Consequently, both sets of governments have notified Civil Servants (Appointment, Transfer and Promotion) Rules, 1974. The qualification and method (the way) of filling of all posts is regulated by these rules. The posts at initial officer level i.e. BS-17, are classified to be filled by way of promotion or transfer and by direct recruitment under share fixed for each category. The recommendation for appointment in BS-17, under direct recruitment share, is done by Federal Public Service Commission, which is established under its own law as a requirement of the Constitution. The rest of posts reserved for departmental officers under promotion quota and posts under appointment by transfer is confined for officers inducted through lateral entry or for hardship cases coming from surplus pool. In practical terms, those appointed on posts in direct appointment quota in each occupational groups through CSS Exam have natural advantage. They join service at young age as compared to departmental officers, and therefore reach to the highest slots. Since the number of direct officers at entry level are few but their quotas in posts in BS-18 to BS-22 are fixed on the higher side, therefore their promotions are fast-paced. These arrangements makes the civil service attractive for talented individuals and instill sense of superiority and pride. Currently, CSS exams conducted by Federal Public Service Commission include the following Occupational Groups. # Pakistan Customs Services # Pakistan Administrative Service # Police Service of Pakistan # Foreign Service of Pakistan # Inland Revenue Service of Pakistan # Commerce & Trade Group # Information Services of Pakistan # Military Lands & Cantonment Group # Office Management and Secretariat Group # Pakistan Audit and Accounts Service # Postal Group # Railways (Commercial & Transport) Group History of civil services in Pakistan The civil Bureaucracy is a colonial legacy in this part of the world. The British used to rule the native population through Indian Civil Service (ICS) and most of the officers in ICS were British themselves. It was in the early 20th century that the Indians also started competing against the British and many Indians eventually made it to the ICS. With time the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the term 'Central Superior Services' was used in Pakistan and the concept of All-Pakistan Services continued. The latter consisted of the Civil Service of Pakistan and the Police Service of Pakistan, whereas the Central Services included the Pakistan Foreign Service and a broad category of Finance and other services. The Finance category included the Pakistan Audit and Accounts Service, Pakistan Railway Accounts Service, Pakistan Military Accounts Service, Pakistan Taxation Service, and the Pakistan Customs and Excise Service. The Central Services other than these included the Pakistan Postal Service, Pakistan Military Land and Cantonment Service, Central Secretariat Service, and Central Information Service. Each of these services had its own cadre and composition rules, specifying the total cadre strength in terms of its number of positions. With the Civil Services Reforms of 1973 a new system of common training program was introduced and all of these occupational groups (12 at that time) were required to go through a mandatory combined training at Civil Services Academy, Lahore. The batch of officers who attended the Civil Service Academy in 1973 is recognised as \\"1st Common\\". Up till 5th Common the allocation of occupational groups was done after the culmination of Common Training Program but from 6th Common onwards this task has also been assumed by Federal Public Service Commission. Even till this day it is an official procedure that once the Probationary Officers successfully complete their common training program then they undergo some further Specialized Training Program (STP) in their own professional academies. Pakistan Administrative Service The Pakistan Administrative Service, previously known as the District Management Group before 1 June 2012, is a cadre of the Civil Service of Pakistan. The Pakistan Administrative Service over the years has emerged as the most consolidated and developed civil institution, with the senior Pakistan Administrative Service officers of grade 22 often seen as stronger than the government ministers. The service of Pakistan Administrative Service is very versatile in nature and officers are assigned to different departments all across Pakistan during the course of their careers. Almost all of the country's high-profile bureaucratic positions such as the federal secretaries, the provincial chief secretaries and chairmen of top-heavy organizations like the National Highway Authority, Trading Corporation of Pakistan and State Life Insurance Corporation usually belong to the elite Pakistan Administrative Service. Armed forces and civil services of Pakistan Commissioned officers of Pakistan Army, Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy have their own quota of 10% in all service groups of the Central Superior Services but historically they have only joined the Pakistan Administrative Service (previously known as the District Management Group), Office Management Group, Foreign Service of Pakistan, and Police Service of Pakistan. Usually officers who join the civil services are of the rank of Captain / Lieutenant / Flight Lieutenant (equivalent to BPS-17 grade). Rank are short listed by respective Services Headquarters and selected against this quota after interview process. The interviews are conducted by a committee headed by the Chairman of the Federal Public Service Commission, same as in the case for regular candidates. Only the written exam is waived. Reform of civil services Despite the fact that Civil Services of Pakistan have been still running on the pattern set out by British Raj (no major change has been performed), the Musharraf government started a major reform process of it. The task was to be performed by National Commission of Government Reforms (NCGR) under the chairmanship of Dr.Ishrat Hussain, the former governor of State Bank of Pakistan. The final report that was published in September 2007 stated that four CSS cadres i.e., Pakistan Railway Service, Pakistan Postal Service, Commerce and Trade Group, and the Information Service of Pakistan, should be axed. According to the recommendation, Postal and Railway Service should be made autonomous commercial bodies, Commerce and Trade and Information Services be suspended till further notice. The report also highlighted broad changes in the examination system, with the recommendation of a personality test be made part of the selection process. 2016 on wards reforms The civil services reforms have been under consideration and the Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Ahsan Iqbal has announced that the upper age limit would be increased up-to 30 years instead of 28, for taking the Central Superior Services (CSS) examination from 2017 on wards.; where as the increase educational qualification by 14 to 16 years. The CSS Aspirants collected funds from their pocket money and filed a petition in the Lahore High Court and Peshawar High court for the age relaxation. On August 2, 2016, the Planning Commission announced plans to restructure the examination process by dividing the Civil Superior Services (CSS) under three cluster program comprising three categories including General, Finance and Information by abolishing the existing generalized system. The plan would come into effect from 2018 and would require participants to possess a four-year bachelor's degree in a relevant discipline, for information cluster, a degree in mass communication, journalism or information science will be required, while for finance cluster a degree in economics, finance or related discipline will be required.

The Tam-O-Shanter facilities include two ice rinks, two restaurants, an ice skating equipment shop, and a senior center in a neighboring building. The Sports and Exhibition Center contains a 36,000 square foot fieldhouse, used for conventions, trade shows, and sporting events.left  History = Construction and city purchase  In December 1972, the then-named Tam-O-Shanter Sports ice rink was built under the development of a private organization, Tam-O-Shanter Sports, Inc. In January 1980, the city of Sylvania began investigating options for purchasing the facility, at the request of John Crandall, the president of the Sylvania Metropolitan Area Hockey League. He argued that the city could likely purchase the property at less than the $1.1 million being asked. In July of the same year, the chairman of the Board of Sylvania Savings Bank announced that it had acquired the property. In August 1980, the city announced that it had leased the facility for a period of two years and that it would be run by a commission of nine volunteers. In December that same year, the center held a grand reopening after being remodeled, with the ceremony presided over by Mayor James E. Seney. In August 1982, the city officially purchased the four acres of land where the property stood from the Sylvania Savings Bank. In June 1993, the Sylvania Area Join Recreation District broke ground on a new expansion to the complex for a second ice rink and a lobby area to join the old and new buildings. Sylvania Sports and Exhibition Center  In June 2000, city officials hired architects to prepare plans for third, \\"dry rink\\" in the Tam-O-Shanter complex that could be used for indoor soccer, basketball, or other indoor sports, as well as a senior center. The city sold bonds in order to finance the construction of a field house expansion to the main building, while the senior center would be a new building. Construction on the new facilities was completed in 2001, and the expansion was named the Sylvania Sports and Exhibition Center at Tam-O- Shanter. The Blade reported in 2002, approximately one year after the expansion, that nearly 1,000 children and more than 125 adults were regularly using the new facilities for a variety of activities. In September 2007, renovations were made to the Exhibition Center fieldhouse and Tam-O-Shanter ice rinks, which included new bleachers, a new ceiling to improve energy efficiency, and 27,000 square feet of artificial turf.  Children's Wonderland  Children's Wonderland is a Christmas-themed exhibit that has been presented annually for since it premiered on December 6, 1963 at the Lucas County Recreation Center. It features a walk-through collection of Christmas displays, many of which are original to the exhibit and feature simple animatronic figures. It was sold to the Sylvania Recreation District in December 2010, and since then has been displayed each year at Sylvania Tam-O- Shanter in the Exhibition Center fieldhouse.

The plot deals with the sacrifices that contestants in the Miss America pageant typically must make. The film was both a critical and a commercial failure. Plot Mona Hibbard (Minnie Driver) is a young woman from a troubled home who has one overarching goal: to become the winner of the Miss America pageant. Her mother is an alcoholic who graduates from berating her young daughter for not doing well in kids' pageants to declaring she will not provide any money or support for Mona if she keeps competing. Mona becomes best friends with Ruby Stilwell (Joey Lauren Adams), and Ruby's kind grandmother (Herta Ware) joins her sweet granddaughter to support Mona as she begins her steady rise through the beauty pageant ranks. Mona becomes pregnant, but, as women with children are ineligible for the MAM crown, Ruby selflessly agrees to raise Mona's daughter Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) as her own daughter. Mona becomes colder and meaner as she gets closer to achieving her goal, whether she's sabotaging fellow contestant Joyce Perkins (Leslie Stefanson) on her routine and earning a lifelong enemy of an aspiring newscaster, or pawning all of her inconveniences onto Ruby while ignoring how obvious it is that Vanessa looks exactly like her ‚Äì a path that leads to her victory in the Miss Illinois pageant. When Mona goes to tell her mom about it, she fends off the mom's gross, leering husband and is left hurt when she's told that it would take too much effort to attend the MAM pageant, at which point Vanessa defends Mona and Mona is bitterly relieved to be ejected from the unloving home she grew up in. When Ruby is falsely accused of euthanasia and jailed, Mona is forced to care for Vanessa, a task at which she is neither qualified nor appreciative, as she is afraid that her MAM crown bid will be taken away. Vanessa reacts to the situation by being angry and difficult to handle, making it clear she knows Mona is her mother and leaving Mona sad and angry with herself for not being able to just be honest. Mona heads to the MAM showcase, where one of the other contestants is nice to her and another cattily asks Mona for extra tickets for her large and loving family (Mona smiles and says \\"No\\"), while Joyce has the lead on breaking the story about Vanessa's parentage. She only later matures after seeking guidance from jailed Ruby, when Ruby refuses to fill her usual supportive role and bluntly tell Mona she needs to take care of her responsibilities in general and her daughter most of all. Mona comes to see that the pursuit of pageant fame is empty next to taking care of her family, and when she makes the MAM Final 3 she announces that she will be a role model to one little girl instead of a hero to countless strangers, confirming that she is Vanessa's mom and is withdrawing from the pageant. The judges see that the crowd is 100% in her favor, and change their rules so Mona becomes the new Miss America Miss. Joyce is left humiliated as her anti-Mona efforts, and chance to become a star TV personality, are both in ruins. Mona and Vanessa end the film having re-united with a fully exonerated Ruby and heading off to happier times.

It ranked number 10 at the North American box office, earning $1,409,433 in its opening weekend. Overall, the film grossed $3,157,348 in the United States and $3,169,930 worldwide. Critical reception Beautiful received generally negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 16% \\"Rotten\\" rating based on 64 reviews, the consensus states: \\"Sally Field's directing debut suffers from an inconsistent tone, implausible script, and a protagonist that critics say is one of the most loathsome to come around in a long time.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a 23% rating based on 28 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four and wrote: \\"\\"Beautiful\\" should have gone through lots and lots more rewrites before it was imposed on audiences. It's a movie with so many inconsistencies, improbabilities, unanswered questions and unfinished characters that we have to suspend not only disbelief but also intelligence.\\" In addition, Ebert felt that Minnie Driver was miscast as Mona because she \\"doesn't come across like the kind of person who could take beauty pageants seriously.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:2000 films Category:2000 comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:Films directed by Sally Field Category:Beauty pageant films Category:Films scored by John Frizzell (composer) Category:2000 directorial debut films ","title":"Beautiful (2000 film)"},{"id":"3802298","text":"Rohoznice is name of several locations in the Czech Republic: * Rohoznice, a village in Pardubice Region (Pardubice District) * Rohoznice, a village in Hradec Kr√°lov√© Region (Jiƒç√≠n District) ","title":"Rohoznice"},{"id":"3802323","text":":See other places named Rohoznice (disambiguation).

Born in 1964, in Rock Hill, South Carolina,and raised in New York and Virginia, he currently paints in Menlo Park, California as well as in Truro, Massachusetts; Buonconvento, Italy; Meyreuil, France and Bornholm, Denmark. Johnson earned his M.F.A. at Parsons School of Design in 1990, where he studied with Larry Rivers, Paul Resika, Leland Bell, Robert De Niro, Sr., Wolf Kahn, Jane Freilicher, Nell Blaine and John Heliker--many former students of Hans Hofmann. The Smithsonian Archives of American Art have two interviews with Johnson, the first from 2008 with Paul Karlstrom, the second from 2009 with Peter Selz. Selz describes Johnson as an artist who paints \\"realist paintings that are basically abstract paintings and abstract paintings that are figurative\\". Johnson has a very large following on instagram and his paintings appear regularly in the New York Times print Magazine. Education Johnson studied drawing and painting in high school at Staten Island Academy and at Randolph-Macon College, where he studied with Ray Berry and earned a bachelor of science degree in computer science with minors in math and fine art. He studied painting and drawing with Jo Weiss, Lee Newman, Jack Boul, and David Holt at the Washington Studio School, Washington, D.C., from 1987 to 1988, and attended graduate school in fine arts at Parsons School of Design, New York City.http://www.mitchelljohnson.com/ During graduate school, Johnson supported himself doing odd jobs for various New York artists, most notably Frank Stella, Sol LeWitt, Sandy Skoglund, sculptor Abram Schlemowitz and Frank Stella's assistant, Earl Childress. In the fall of 1990, while waiting to hear if he would be able to join LeWitt's Wall Drawing Team, Johnson was offered a studio assistant job with Sam Francis and this is what landed him in Palo Alto. He has since divided his time between California and Europe. In 2007 he was an artist-in-residence at the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation in Bethany, Connecticut. Johnson is a 2015 Visiting Artist at the American Academy in Rome and the subject of a short documentary film, The Artist of Silicon Valley, by Meg Smaker. His paintings can be found in over 700 private collections and the permanent collections of 28 museums. The most recent museum acquisitions were the Museo Morandi in Bologna, Galleria D'Arte Moderna in Rome and the Tucson Museum of Art. Johnson's paintings have appeared regularly in the New York Times Magazine since 2012. His work has been the subject of solo-exhibitions in Milan, New York, Santa Fe, San Francisco, Los Angeles, St. Helena, Oakland, Portland, and Scottsdale. Johnson's paintings have also appeared in many feature films and television shows including The Holiday (2006), It's Complicated (2009), The Lodger (2009), Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), and The Mindy Project.

Prior to and following World War I, Winchester was a private yacht, later renamed Renard. In World War II, Renard was requisitioned for use in the Royal Canadian Navy as a patrol vessel, keeping her name. She was returned to her owners in 1944. Description Winchester had a tonnage of . The yacht was long with a beam of and a draft of . The ship was propelled by two geared Parsons steam turbines driving two shafts powered by two watertube boilers creating . This gave the ship a maximum speed of . Construction and career SS Winchester was built as a fast, steel-hulled, steam-powered, destroyer-like civilian yacht in 1916 by Bath Iron Works at Bath, Maine. The ship was ordered for construction by the millionaire Peter W. Rouss. The yacht was launched on 29 April 1916. Winchester was considered a \\"floating palace\\" during her career in the 1920s. The U.S. Navy acquired the yacht from her owner on 30 May 1917 for use as a patrol vessel during World War I. United States Navy service, 1917‚Äì1919 After her acquisition, the yacht was commissioned on 4 September 1917 as USS Winchester (SP-156) with Lieutenant, junior grade, R. C. Nickerson, USNRF, in command. Winchester initially was assigned to section patrol duty in the 2d Naval District in southern New England, patrolling the coast between Chatham, Massachusetts and New London, Connecticut. In January 1918, the vessel was reassigned to the 5th Naval District and operated in the Norfolk-Hampton Roads area of Virginia, where she was assigned to special duty with the U.S. Navy Bureau of Construction and Repair to test minesweeping equipment. Late in December 1918, Winchester deployed to City Island in the Bronx, New York, where she continued her minesweeping testing duties. On 13 April 1919, she returned to the 5th Naval District, operating out of Yorktown, Virginia, continuing to test minesweeping gear. Winchester was decommissioned at Norfolk on 19 December 1919. After several attempts, she was finally sold to Cox and Stevens of New York City on 24 March 1921. Civilian career, 1921‚Äì1940 Winchester resumed civilian service as a yacht with Cox and Stevens. The ship was sold several times, first to Vincent Astor who rebuilt the yacht in 1930. The vessel was finished with teak, ivory and walnut. The owner's quarters, located aft, comprised a lounge, two double staterooms, four single staterooms and four baths. Forward was the dining room and crew quarters. The yacht was sold to Russell A. Alger, Jr., and then to Cornelius Vanderbilt III. Winchester was later sold to B. P. McCurdy, this latter time being rechristened SS Renard. Royal Canadian Navy and fate After failing to acquire any British vessels at the outset of World War II for auxiliary purposes, the Royal Canadian Navy discreetly searched the American market for suitable ships. However, American law prevented the sale of ships for possible use in the war to any of the belligerents. The Royal Canadian Navy requisitioned unsuitable Canadian yachts and had their respective owners go the United States and buy those ships the navy wanted as replacements. Once the ships arrived in Canada, the navy then returned the original yachts and requisitioned the new ones. Renard was among those vessels chosen and was acquired in 1940. HMCS Renard underway off Halifax during World War II Renard was brought to Halifax, Nova Scotia and commissioned there on 27 May 1940 with the pennant number S13, which was later altered to Z13, keeping her name. The vessel then went to Quebec City, Quebec where she was converted into an armed yacht, having a 12-pounder naval gun placed forward, an ASDIC set installed and armed with depth charges. This took until December 1940, when the ship returned to Halifax and was assigned to the Halifax Local Defence Force. In 1941, Renard was tender to HMCS Stadacona and in 1942 was fitted with high- speed target towing gear. Renard remained with this unit until April 1942 when the ship was taken in hand for a refit, this lasting until July. Upon completion, she was attached to as a torpedo training ship and two torpedo tubes were installed aft. In July 1943 the training group moved to Digby, Nova Scotia. However, by November Renard was back at Halifax. In 1944, Renard was surveyed and was found not worth repairing and was paid off on 1 August. The vessel was put up for disposal on 15 November 1945 and sold to W.N. MacDonald of Sydney, Nova Scotia. The ship remained at Sydney until 1949, when the yacht was converted to a stationary power plant for a mining development near Mabou, Nova Scotia. Renards turbines were stripped out and replaced with modern generators and her oil burning units were replaced with pulverized coal burning equipment. The ship was derelict at Sydney, Nova Scotia in 1955.

Margai is a former candidate for the office of President of Sierra Leone and the leader of the People's Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC). He was his party's candidate in the August 2007 presidential election, placing third with 10% of the vote.\\"Sierra Leone: leading parties nominate candidates for presidential poll\\" , African Press Agency, 5 July 2007. Though he received less than 3% of the votes in the 2012 and 2018 Sierra Leone presidential elections. Margai is the son of Albert Margai, former Prime Minister of Sierra Leone, and the nephew of Sierra Leone's first Prime Minister Milton Margai.  Early life Charles Francis Kondo Margai was born on 19 August 1945 in Bonthe, Bonthe District in southern British Sierra Leone. He is the natural son of Sir Albert Margai, second Prime Minister of Sierra Leone. His uncle, Sir Milton Margai, was Sierra Leone's first Prime Minister. Education Charles Margai attended St. Edward's Primary School in Freetown and then proceeded to the Christ the King College in Bo. He completed his secondary school education at Blackrock College in Co. Dublin, Ireland. Margai received a Bachelor of Arts in civil law in 1970 from the University of Dublin. Family and personal life Margai is married to Vivat Margai and has four children.(1 boy and 3 girls) The boy is called Albert Peter Margai jr , The girls are Gbatima Margai , Eluma Margai, and Ndanneh Margai. Law career Margai began working as a lawyer in 1971 as State Counsel in Freetown. He later opened his private law office in 1973 in Bo.  Political career = Sierra Leone People's Party  Margai was a member of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), which was co-founded in 1951 by his uncle Milton Margai. Both his father and his uncle had been leaders of the SLPP. In 1996 Charles Margai sought the nomination to stand as the party's candidate in the 1996 presidential elections. When he failed to secure the nomination he left the SLPP.Sierra Leone News Archives ‚Äì March 2002 , sierra- leone.org.  National Unity Party  In the aftermath of Margai's failure to become the SLPP presidential candidate, he joined the National Unity Party and ran in the 1996 parliamentary election.  Return to the Sierra Leone People's Party  He subsequently returned to the SLPP and in April 1998, Margai became Minister of Internal Affairs and Local Government following the restoration of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah;Sierra Leone News Archives ‚Äì April 1998, sierra-leone.org. \\"President Kabbah's Third Cabinet, 20 April 1998 to 2 November 1999\\", sierra-leone.org. From November 1999 he was Minister of Safety and Security.\\"President Kabbah's Fourth Cabinet, 2 November 1999 to 2 February 2001\\", sierra-leone.org. = Infighting in the SLPP = On 6 January 2002, Kabbah requested that Margai clarify reports that the latter planned to seek the SLPP party leadership, which was held by Kabbah. Margai resigned as a minister on 8 January 2002 following a meeting with Kabbah, in which Kabbah expressed concern that the country might appear unstable and might therefore receive less aid from abroad. On 9 January, Margai confirmed his plans to seek the leadership of the SLPP and its presidential nomination, describing himself as the best person for the position and saying that he had resigned from the cabinet \\"in the interest of good governance and for the people of this nation\\" due to \\"mistrust\\" between himself and Kabbah.Sierra Leone News Archives ‚Äì January 2002, sierra-leone.org. On 8 March, however, the High Court ruled that he was not technically a member of the SLPP, preventing him from seeking the nomination, which was won by Kabbah. Margai was President of the Sierra Leone Bar Association from 2004 to 2005. Margai again unsuccessfully sought the SLPP presidential nomination at the party's national convention in Makeni on 3‚Äì4 September 2005; he received second place, with 34 votes, far behind Vice-President Solomon Berewa, who received 291 votes.\\"Vice President Berewa Leads SLPP\\", statehouse-sl.org, 6 September 2005.  People's Movement for Democratic Change  In early October 2005, he broke with the SLPP to form a new party, the People's Movement for Democratic Change. Margai faced difficulty in getting the PMDC officially registered, which he alleged was due to Kabbah deliberately delaying appointments to the Political Parties Commission which would enable the registration, thereby giving Berewa's campaign an advantage in time. The PMDC was officially registered on 19 January 2006. = Arrest = On 7 December 2005, Margai was arrested in connection with an incident on 18 November in which his supporters blocked a convoy that included Berewa, leading to accusations that Margai was behind it as an attempt to kill Berewa. Margai denied this, saying that his supporters had acted spontaneously.\\"Sierra Leone: Politician‚Äôs bid to form rival party makes waves\\", IRIN, 9 December 2005.  2007 Election  In the August 2007 presidential election, Margai took third place with 13.9% of the vote, behind Ernest Bai Koroma of the opposition All People's Congress (APC) and the SLPP's Berewa.\\"Freetown opposition party wins majority\\", Reuters (IOL), 24 August 2007.Final results from the National Electoral Commission , 25 August 2007.

On 24 August, he said that the PMDC would campaign together with the APC for the second round\\"Sierra Leone opposition unite\\", Reuters (IOL), 24 August 2007. The alliance he formed with the APC thwarted the SLPP's chances to win the 2007 election and thus Margai became the kingmaker of the Koroma presidency. However, the PMDC's constitution did not permit him to join a government led by the APC. However, after the election, he became a close ally and confidante to President Koroma. As part of the PMDC and APC deal saw Koroma appoint 8 members of Margai's senior party chiefs and financial supporters to ministerial positions. All of Margai's PMDC ministers lost their positions by 2010 and were replaced by APC supporters. He entered into a legal dispute with then-First Lady of Sierra Leone Sia Koroma over a property in Aberdeen. When Mrs. Koroma received a favorable judgment, Margai went to the national news media to demand the First Lady's arrest. He was arrested in May 2013, charged with \\"careless talk\\" and detained for several days before being set free on bail. 2018 Presidential Election Margai was the PMDC candidate for Sierra Leone's 2018 Presidential Election. He choose educator Isata Dora Bangura as his running mate, making her Sierra Leone's second woman vice presidential candidate . The PMDC won 0.4% of the vote. Attorney General and Minister of Justice of Sierra Leone Margai was appointed Attorney General and Minister of Justice of Sierra Leone by President Julius Maada Bio on 16 April 2018. Shortly after he received his appointment, a memo from Margai to President Bio was leaked during the first week of June 2018 requesting permission to dismiss the Chief Justice of Sierra Leone, the Commissioner of the Anti-Corruption Commission and other officials. The memo also indicated that he wanted the president to form a commission of inquiry to investigate the finances of members of the former APC government. Political observers speculated that Margai wished to use the office to exact revenge on his political enemies in the APC. On 12 June 2018, a week after the memo was leaked, President Bio dismissed Margai as Attorney General and Minister of Justice without any official reason. He was immediately replaced by Dr.Patricia Schwartz, who Margai had recently recommended to President Bio to head the law school at the University of Sierra Leone. With a tenure of less than two months, Margai is the shortest ever serving Attorney General and Minister Justice in the history of Sierra Leone.

Her husband was Emperor Kang, and, outliving him by 40 years, she was an empress dowager during the reigns of five emperors, including serving as regents for three of them: her son Emperor Mu (344-357), her nephew Emperor Ai (364-366), and her cousin Emperor Xiaowu (373-376). Despite the power she held, she appeared to largely yield to the judgement of high-level officials who advised her and rarely made decisions on her own. Background and life as empress Chu Suanzi's father Chu Pou (Ë§öË£í) was a mid- level official during the reign of Emperor Kang's brother Emperor Cheng, successively on the staffs of Sima Yang (Âè∏È¶¨Áæï) the Prince of Xiyang and then of Sima Yue the Prince of Wu‚Äîthe future Emperor Kang. He was respected for the appropriateness of his speech. As Chu Suanzi herself grew, she was known for her intelligence and foresight, and she was married to Sima Yue, who had then become the Prince of Langye, as his princess. When Emperor Cheng chose to pass the throne to his brother rather than his sons at his death in 342, Sima Yue became emperor, and he created her empress in early 343, when he was 21 and she was 18. That year, she also bore him his only son, Sima Dan. He died just one year later, however, and her infant son Sima Dan, whom he created crown prince just before his death, became emperor (as Emperor Mu). As empress dowager= During Emperor Mu's reign  Due to Emperor Mu's young age, Empress Dowager Chu was quickly called upon to serve as regent. He Chong (‰ΩïÂÖÖ) was her key advisor. He Chong initially wanted to share that authority with her father Chu Pou, but Chu Pou believed that as the empress dowager's father, it was inappropriate for him to serve in that capacity, and therefore remained a provincial governor. Eventually, in 345, that role went to Emperor Mu's granduncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji. After He Chong's death in 346, the authority was shared between Sima Yu and Cai Mo. After the general Huan Wen conquered Cheng Han in 347, effectively, the imperial government lost authority over the western provinces, with Huan being only nominally submissive. In response, Sima Yu invited the equally renowned Yin Hao to join as a key advisor to the empress dowager. In 348, after he led a failed campaign against the collapsing Later Zhao with major losses, Chu Pou died in humiliation. During the next few years, however, without major campaigns on Jin's part, many of Later Zhao's southern provinces switched their allegiance to Jin, but not firmly so. Huan repeatedly requested permission to march north, but was constantly rebuffed by Sima Yu and Yin, who were concerned that he would be even harder to control if he recovered central and northern China for Jin. In 350, when Empress Dowager Chu was bestowing a greater honor on Cai, Cai repeatedly declined‚Äîso much so that, as the emperor, the empress dowager, and the officials waited at the palace for the messengers that the empress dowager sent to his home to return with him, they waited from morning to evening, causing the seven-year-old emperor to be drained. Yin used this opportunity to accuse Cai of disrespect and had him excluded from government and reduced to commoner status. In 352 and 353, Yin made two failed attempts at northern expeditions against Former Yan and Former Qin‚Äîand after the second failure, which was caused by Yin's arrogance toward one of the former Later Zhao generals who surrendered to Jin, Yao Xiang (ÂßöË•Ñ), causing Yao to rebel in fear and anger‚ÄîHuan submitted a petition accusing Yin of crimes, and with popular sentiment against Yin, Sima Yu was forced to exile Yin. From that point on, the imperial government rarely went against Huan's wishes. In 354, Huan attacked Former Qin and enjoyed some initial successes, moving within miles of the Former Qin capital Chang'an, but eventually hesitated when he was close, and Former Qin fought back and forced him to retreat. In 356, Huan marched north again and was able to force Yao out of the Luoyang region, which he had occupied, and this allowed Jin to regain control of the territory south of the Yellow River (except for modern Shandong, where the warlord Duan Kan (ÊÆµÈæï) had been a nominal Jin vassal since 351 but was conquered by Former Yan's emperor Murong Jun in 356). In 357, as Emperor Mu turned 14 and went through his rite of passage (jiaguanli (Âä†ÂÜ†Á¶Æ)), Empress Dowager Chu officially stripped herself of her role as regent, and moved to Chongde Palace (Â¥áÂæ∑ÂÆÆ), which would be her residence for the rest of her life. In 361, Emperor Mu died at the age of 18. As he had no sons, Empress Dowager Chu ordered that his cousin Sima Pi the Prince of Langye (Emperor Cheng's oldest son) be made emperor, and he took the throne as Emperor Ai. During Emperor Ai's reign As Emperor Ai was two years older than Emperor Mu and already 21 at the time of his ascension, Empress Dowager Chu did not serve as regent initially. However, in 364, when Emperor Ai became poisoned by pills given by magicians he was taking trying to seek immortality, he fell ill and could not handle matters of state. Empress Dowager Chu again served as regent at that point.Sima Guang, ed. (1956) [1084]. Ë≥áÊ≤ªÈÄöÈëí [Zizhi Tongjian]. Beijing: Zhonghua Publishing After he died sonless in 365, she ordered that his younger brother Sima Yi the Prince of Langye succeed him (as Emperor Fei). During Emperor Fei's reign Similarly, because Emperor Fei was also already an adult at the time he ascended the throne, Empress Dowager Chu did not serve as regent. However, after Huan Wen's major attack on Former Yan in 369 was repelled, at much loss of life, by joint forces of Former Yan and Former Qin, he pondered ways to demonstrate that he was still in control, particularly because he was interested in usurping the Jin throne. He spread false rumors that Emperor Fei was impotent and that all his sons were actually sons of his close associates. In 371, he drafted a proposed edict for Empress Dowager Chu and submitted it to her while she was at a Buddhist shrine in her palace. She read his submission and commented that she suspected of the same thing, and she signed the edict, although she added several sentences showing her grief: :This widow has suffered more than a hundred kinds of grief. I consider those who have died and those who still live, and my heart is like being cut by knives. Huan was initially apprehensive that Empress Dowager Chu might not submit to his plan, so he was happy that she agreed despite her tone. Huan then removed Emperor Fei and replaced him with his granduncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji (as Emperor Jianwen). Empress Dowager Chu initially created the former emperor the Prince of Donghai‚Äîa title he had held previous to becoming Prince of Langye and then emperor‚Äîbut Huan pressured her into demoting him further to Duke of Haixi, a title that he would be known by in many historical accounts. During Emperor Jianwen's reign As the niece of Emperor Jianwen, Empress Dowager Chu had few roles during his reign‚Äîparticularly because he himself had to negotiate a treacherous path that Huan had laid for him, as Huan himself intended to take the throne. Emperor Jianwen honored her as Empress Dowager Chongde, based on the name of her palace. After he died in 372, he was succeeded by his son and crown prince Sima Yao (as Emperor Xiaowu), and while she initially instinctively thought that Huan should be named regent, Wang Tanzhi (ÁéãÂù¶‰πã) and Xie An, officials loyal to the imperial clan and trying to prevent a Huan usurpation, persuaded her to become regent again. She agreed, but did not take official regent capacity initially. During Emperor Xiaowu's reign In 373, Huan Wen visited the capital Jiankang, and the rumor at the time was that he was going to execute Wang Tanzhi and Xie An, and then take over the throne. However, after Wang and Xie met him, he apparently changed his mind and returned to his defense post at Gushu (ÂßëÂ≠∞, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui), although he continued to pressure the imperial government to grant him the nine bestowments, but Wang and Xie dragged on, and after Huan died later in 373, his territories were divided among his brothers Huan Huo and Huan Chong, and his nephew Huan Shixiu (Ê°ìÁü≥ÁßÄ). As Huan Chong was loyal to the imperial government, the threat of a Huan usurpation dissipated. After Huan Wen's death, Empress Dowager Chu formally took over as regent. In 376, after Emperor Xiaowu turned 14 and had his rite of passage, Empress Dowager Chu again gave up her regent authorities and was again referred to as Empress Dowager Chongde. She died in 384 and was buried with honors due an empress, with her husband Emperor Kang.

History  Established in 1928 when the Canadian Pacific Railway opened a rail line through the region, it was named after Derwent, Derbyshire, England. Prior to this name, the community was briefly known as Monkman (purportedly after the temporary stay in the community of Albert Monkman, an important member of the 1885 Metis Provisional Government headed by Louis Riel) and, before that, the Native Americans of the region referred to it as Penguix. The population peaked at 301 in 1959, but declined rapidly after the construction of the bridge to Elk Point and the closure of the local grain elevator. The subsequent abandonment of the Lloydminster to Starr rail line in 2005 - 2007 signaled the final chapter in Derwent's rail access. Only two new homes have been built since the 1980s and the last business building permit issued was in 2001.  Education  There are no schools currently operating in Derwent.

The market was established in 1876, and was the second of four founded in Columbus, and the only one remaining. North Market is set to be expanded as part of a 28-story building developed beside the original. The market is also set to open a second location, in Dublin, Ohio, in late 2020. The market hosts about 35 vendors. About one third of these sell ready-to-eat foods, one third sell specialty goods, and the remaining portion sell produce, flowers, meat and fish, cookware, and gifts.https://northmarket.com/downtown-layout-map/ The market is managed by the North Market Development Authority (NDMA), a not-for- profit organization. The NDMA also hosts a weekly farmer's market from June to October outside the market building.https://www.columbusunderground.com/event/north-market-farmers- market/2020-09-05 History North End Market House, 1882 The second North Market, 1990 From 1813-1873, the current location of the North Market housed a cemetery known as the North Graveyard. After negotiations with city developers, grave removal and relocation began in 1872. In 1876, a market house as well as other small businesses and restaurants were built on the land. This public space at 29 Spruce Street became the North Market. The North Market was the second of four public markets built throughout the city (North, East, West and Central) and is the only remaining public market. The Central Market, built in 1850 at Town and Fourth Streets as a combination City Hall and public market, was torn down in 1966 to make way for urban renewal and today is the location of Columbus‚Äôs Greyhound bus station. The building once housing the West Market on South Gift Street is now a Boys and Girls Club. The East Market at Mt. Vernon and Miami Avenues was destroyed by fire in 1947. In 1948, almost one year to the day of the fire at the East Market, the same tragedy struck North Market (or North End Market as it was then called). The City of Columbus decided not to rebuild the market but merchants quickly pooled their funds to purchase a war surplus Quonset hut to house North Market. Though the merchants bought the building, the city retained ownership of the Market property. The vitality of the Market began to wane post World War II as population shifted from the city to the suburbs and the development of supermarkets. The building of the Ohio Center and the temporary closing of High Street in the late 1970s caused the Market to hit rock bottom. Attempts to revive the once thriving institution were thwarted by the physical and mechanical limitations of the Quonset hut. The Market was operating on a month-to-month lease with the city. The future was far from secure. During the 1980s a national, growing recognition of public markets emerged. This enabled Columbus residents to rediscover their market. That idea, along with the fear that the city would tear down the Market to develop a parking lot for the planned Greater Columbus Convention Center, drove the creation of the North Market Development Authority (NMDA). This not-for-profit group of shoppers and merchants was established to ‚Äúpreserve and promote the traditional and cultural aspects of the historic North Market.‚Äù In 1988, NMDA led the Market‚Äôs recovery by negotiating a long-term lease with the city, effectively eliminating the threat of demolition. In 1989, the NMDA assumed daily operations of the market. The initial staff of a Market Master and Executive Director, plus volunteer board members, the NMDA focused on the possibility of rehabilitating the Quonset hut. Physically bursting at the seams and on its last legs, the building was financially impractical to renovate. Even if the costly and extensive repairs were made, the Market would still be housed in a cramped Quonset hut, rather than a light, clean, functional marketplace. The NMDA spearheaded a capital campaign to finance building renovations. The Market‚Äôs new home would be 60 percent larger than the Quonset hut with room for new merchants. After raising $5 million, the NMDA began construction in January 1995. In November 1995, the new North Market opened with 25 merchants. North Market has been under the leadership of Executive Director Rick Harrison Wolfe since mid 2013. North Market Development Authority plans to open a second location for the market in the nearby city of Dublin.

Opening to service in 1994, this line bypasses the built-up Lyon area towards the east, and in addition serves Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup√©ry (known until June 2000 as Gare de Satolas TGV). Beyond Valence the line is continued by the LGV M√©diterran√©e. The line was constructed in two sections, north and south. The first section was opened in time for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. Route The line crosses four departments from north to south: Ain, Rh√¥ne, Is√®re and Dr√¥me. The route of the new line represents a total length of 115 km; 42 km from Montanay to Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, and 73 km from Saint-Quentin-Fallavier to Valence. The line is connected to the regular network by links at Saint-Quentin- Fallavier, enabling links to Savoie, Is√®re and Italy via Chamb√©ry and Modane. Line specifics The line has a surface area of 12.18 km¬≤ (in comparison Lyon-Saint-Exup√©ry Airport occupies the same area). Like the LGV Sud-Est, the line was designed for a nominal speed of 300 km/h, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000 m, and a space between track centres of 4.2 m. The second section is designed for 320 km/h. The line includes 10 large viaducts (total length 4.3 km), and 4 tunnels (total length 5.3 km). A command post named CCT (Commande centralis√©e des trains - Central Train Command) enables the continual monitoring of trains running on the entire line and to remotely control security installations. It is situated in Lyon, in an SNCF building near the gare de Perrache. Stations The line comprises one new station: Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup√©ry, situated in the commune of Colombier-Saugnieu. This station, with its striking architecture, is the work of the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. It serves the Lyon‚ÄìSaint-Exup√©ry Airport.

Composition Two formulations are commonly used: * 70% HMX & 30% TNT * 75% HMX & 25% TNT Given that HMX has a much higher detonation velocity than TNT (over 2,000 metres per second faster) and forms the main part of this explosive blend, the brisance characteristics of Octol can be inferred. Applications The applications of Octol are generally military; e.g., shaped charges and warheads used in guided missiles and submunitions. Octol is somewhat more expensive than RDX-based explosives, such as Composition B and Cyclotol. The advantage of Octol is that it significantly reduces the size and weight of the explosive charge required. These are important considerations where smart weapons such as guided missiles are concerned. A light (but effective) warhead means a superior power to weight ratio. This in turn results in a higher velocity missile with a longer range and shorter flight time. As a result, the target has less opportunity to recognise and evade the attack.

Sabbe hid in the forests of Estonia, living off of the land like other Forest Brethren. In 1978, at the age of 69, Sabbe was found near his birthplace of Paidra, Lasva Parish in southeastern Estonia by two KGB agents posing as fishermen. When they attempted to arrest him, he leaped into the V√µhandu River and either drowned accidentally or deliberately wedged himself under a submerged log. The KGB, which took photographs before and after the attempted arrest, maintained that Sabbe drowned while attempting to escape. But someMart Laar, Metsvennad, Tallinn 1993 have observed that the river is narrow, sluggish and shallow at that point, an unlikely place for an accidental drowning, and that the open field on the opposite bank and the river's lazy loops gave an elderly man no place to flee from two young, physically fit pursuers. The Forest Brethren's code of conduct and the quickness of Sabbe's reaction suggest that Sabbe was prepared not to be taken alive. A stone monument to Sabbe stands in a pine grove overlooking the site of his death. It is located just west of Route 65 between Leevi and Tsolgo, almost exactly on the boundary between P√µlva and V√µru counties.

Amtrak disposed of the trains in 1980. It was one of the first gas turbine powered trains to enter service for passenger traffic, and was also one of the first tilting trains to enter service in North America.  Description = Chesapeake & Ohio design study  A series of design studies carried out by Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in the 1950s used the second-generation Talgo design for their car suspensions. The suspension arms for each neighboring pair of cars were attached to a common bogie (\\"truck\\") between them, as opposed to having a pair of separate bogies for each car. The bogies rode the common curve between the two cars, centered by traction springs that centered the axle between adjoining car bodies. TurboTrain cars are lower than conventional cars, to lower the center of gravity in relation to the swinging point at the top of the arms. The arms included air springs to smooth out the motion, although it still felt \\"odd\\" while the train navigated short turns in switchyards and stations. Like the earlier articulated trains, this meant that train lengths would be difficult to change. Their solution to this problem was to modify the power cars (engines) to allow the trains to be coupled end-to-end. Since articulated trains required \\"special\\" cars at either end anyway (to fill in the otherwise missing bogie), the C&O; was double-ended, with a power car at each end. The power cars were organized with their two diesel engines on either side of the train, and the operators cabin in a \\"pod\\" on top. This left enough room for a passageway to run between the engines and under the pod to the nose of the car, where a coupling and doors were hidden behind a pair of movable clamshell covers. That way the train could be attached front-to-end with another, providing some of the flexibility in train lengths that coupled cars offered, while still being as lightweight as a normal articulated design.  TurboTrain  Turbo in DOT paint prior to Amtrak's inception, 1971 Penn Central passenger timetable in the early days of the United Aircraft TurboTrain (June 1969) showing daily round-trip between Boston's Back Bay Station and New York's Grand Central Terminal. C&O;'s early work went undeveloped until the 1960s. At that time two major forces began operating that would re-invent the concept as the TurboTrain; one was the US Department of Transportation's desire to update train service in the US as a result of the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965, the other was CN Rail's desire to update their passenger service with the ending of \\"pooled service\\" (with CP Rail) between Toronto and Montreal. United Aircraft (UAC) purchased the C&O; patents to enter into the DOT's Northeast Corridor Demonstration Project. The TurboTrain was designed by personnel of the Corporate Systems Center Division (CSC) of UAC, at Farmington, Connecticut. The design was similar to the original C&O; version, but modified to use turbine power instead of diesel. The chosen engines were a modified version of the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 (also a UAC division) known as the ST6, downrated from . The PT6 uses a \\"free turbine\\" that acts as a torque coupler, so the new design did not require a transmission and was able to drive the powered wheels directly. The power cars had three engine bays on either side of the car and could mount engines in pairs for two to six turbines, depending on the needs of the carrier. Another ST6 drove an alternator to provide 'hotel' electrical power for the train. Each power car had a fuel capacity of . The turbine engines were smaller and lighter ( with accessories) than the diesels they replaced, so the original power cars ended up being much larger than needed. Instead of a major redesign, UAC re-arranged the interior of the existing layout. The control room \\"pod\\" on top was lengthened to produce a viewing area with seating, and additional seating was added along the main level as well. This produced the Power Dome Cars (PDC) that were long (tip of nose to trailing articulated axle, while the Intermediate Cars (IC) were long (axle to axle), considerably shorter than the -long conventional passenger cars of this period. The ability to connect trains together remained largely unchanged, although the routing of the internal passage changed slightly to rise up into the observation area of the pod, then back down under the control room and from there to the nose. This particular design, with the control cabs on top and couplers hidden behind doorways on the front, is similar to that of the NS Intercity Materieel used in the Netherlands. The Turbotrains were evaluated by multiple journalists in the Canadian press as having \\"rail noise that substantially exceeds that of standard equipment\\" and having poor riding characteristics, especially on curves, with one journalist stating that \\"the single-axle articulation in practice negotiates curves in a series of short jerks rather than the smooth flowing motion promised in press releases\\". The single-axle bogies on the Turbotrain were very mechanically complex and the suspension arms were \\"telescopic arms which were in essence ball-bearing screw actuators; the suspension of the inside-bearing powered bogies was \\"especially complex\\" and attached to the turbines via \\"an intricate web of mechanical couplings and shafts\\".  Production and use = U.S. service  An Amtrak TurboTrain arriving at Ann Arbor, Michigan in September 1971. Two Turbotrains (DOT1 and DOT2) were built at the Pullman Works in Chicago. High-speed testing of the trains was performed from a base at Fields Point in Providence, Rhode Island, using track between Route 128 near Boston and Westerly, Rhode Island (track segments along this section, to this day, are the only areas where Amtrak operates Acela revenue service at 150 mph). After its construction at the Pullman yards in Chicago, the Turbotrain was sent eastward on August 1, 1967, at regular speed and without passengers, to Providence, Rhode Island in order for UAC Aircraft Systems engineers to tear it down, study it for further development, and then eventual high-speed testing on a specially-built track between Trenton and New Brunswick, New Jersey. \\"Fast Train Project Chugs at Half Speed\\", by Louis Dombrowski, Chicago Tribune, July 27, 1967, p2-18 \\"Turbotrain Due in State Today\\", Bridgeport (CT) Post, August 3, 1967, p2 In a competition with a GE powered Metroliner on Penn Central's main-line between Trenton and New Brunswick, New Jersey on December 20, 1967, one of the TurboTrains reached . This remains the world speed record for gas turbine- powered rail vehicles.\\"Dedication of plaque commemorating high speed rail in America\\" on the National Capital Land Transportation Committee's website On January 1, 1968, the TurboTrain program was transferred from CSC to Sikorsky Aircraft Division (SA) of UAC. The United States Department of Transportation leased both trainsets and contracted with the New Haven Railroad to operate them. The New Haven had been in bankruptcy since July 2, 1961; on January 1, 1969, it was absorbed into the Penn Central Railroad, which inherited the contract. On April 8, 1969, Penn Central placed the equipment in service on the Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. The three-car sets carried 144 people and operated at a maximum speed of . The TurboTrains were equipped with third rail shoes for operation into Grand Central Terminal. In their first year of operation the trains' on-time performance approached 90 percent. They covered the in three hours and 39 minutes. After railroad bankruptcies and amid threats of more, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) took over passenger service for most U.S. railroads, including the Penn Central, on May 1, 1971. Amtrak continued Turbotrain service between Boston and New York, switching to Pennsylvania Station as its New York terminal. It also briefly ran Turbotrains elsewhere. In September 1976, Amtrak ceased revenue runs of Turbotrain trainsets and moved them to the Field's Point Maintenance Yard in Providence, Rhode Island pending any possible sales to CN. An additional attempt was made to sell the units to the Illinois Central, but the poor mechanical condition of the trainsets caused the deal to fall through.  Canadian service  CN TurboTrain in Toronto In May 1966, Canadian National Railways ordered five seven-car TurboTrains for the Montreal-Toronto service. They planned to operate the trains in tandem, connecting two trains together into a larger fourteen-car arrangement with a total capacity of 644 passengers. The Canadian trains were built by Montreal Locomotive Works, with their ST6 engines supplied by UAC's Canadian division (now Pratt & Whitney Canada) in Longueuil, Quebec. The Canadian Turbotrains were originally planned to have been in service by the summer of 1967, but technical difficulties with the trainsets delayed passenger service entry until December 12, 1969; the primary failures concerned the auxiliary equipment and caused the power on the trains to go out. CN and their ad agency wanted to promote the new service as an entirely new form of transit, so they dropped the \\"train\\" from the name. In CN's marketing literature the train was referred to simply as the \\"Turbo\\", although it retained the full TurboTrain name in CN's own documentation and communication with UAC. A goal of CN's marketing campaign was to get the train into service for Expo 67, and the Turbo was rushed through its trials. It was late for Expo, a disappointment to all involved, but the hectic pace did not let up and it was cleared for service after only one year of testing ‚Äì most trains go through six to seven years of testing before entering service. The Turbo's first demonstration run in December 1968, included a large press contingent. An hour into its debut run, the Turbo collided with a truck at a highway crossing near Kingston. Despite the concerns that lightweight trains like the Turbo would be dangerous in collisions, the train remained upright and largely undamaged. Large beams just behind the nose, designed for this purpose, absorbed the impact of the collision and limited the damage to the fiberglass clamshell doors and underlying metal. The train was returned from repairs within a week. No one was killed, though this event has been cited as a main deterrent to Canada's efforts to develop modern passenger rail. Initial commercial service started soon after. On its first westbound run the Turbo attained 10 minutes outside of Dorval. During speed runs on April 22, 1976, it achieved near Gananoque, the Canadian record to this day.Jerry Langton, \\"Model-train manufacturer on the right track\\", 8 December 2008 However, in regular passenger service the Turbotrains were limited to 95 mph (153 km/hr) in Canada because of the Canadian route's numerous grade-crossings, estimated at 240 public highway grade-crossings and 700 agricultural or private crossings between Montreal and Toronto. Technical problems, including brake systems freezing in winter, required a suspension of service in early January 1969. Service resumed in May 1970; however, technical problems again caused the Canadian National to withdraw all Turbotrains from service again in February 1971. At this point, the CN management publicly expressed great dissatisfaction with these trainsets, with one vice-president claiming, \\"the trains never did measure up to the original contract and they haven't yet\\"; the manufacturer United Aircraft Company publicly claimed that CN suspended Turbotrain service for relatively minor technical problems. Railroad analysts, including Geoffrey Freeman Allen (editor of Jane's World Railways), noted that the Turbotrains employed too many advanced, derived technologies which had been packed in \\"without extended practical evaluation in railroad conditions. From transmission to suspension to auxiliaries, far too many vital components seemed to have been translated straight from the drawing board to the series production line. During the \\"downtime\\" CN changed their plans, and in 1971 a rebuild program began, converting the five seven-car sets to three nine-car sets. Several minor changes were added. The engine exhaust fouled the roof windows of the power car, so these were plated over, and a grill was added to the front of the engines just behind the clamshell doors. The remaining power and passenger cars were sold to Amtrak as two 4-car sets. One of those sets sideswiped a freight train on a test run in July 1973 and three of the cars were written off. The sale of the surviving Power Dome Coach car was cancelled, and it stood spare until a sister unit caught fire and burned in September 1975. The three rebuilt 9-car sets entered service for CN in late 1973. CN ran the Turbos from Toronto-Montreal-Toronto with stops at Dorval, Kingston and Guildwood on the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. Original train numbers were Train 62 which left Toronto at 12:45 p.m. and arrived in Montreal at 4:44 p.m. Train 63 left Montreal at 12:45 p.m. and arrived in Toronto at 4:44 p.m. (Both were daily trains.) Train 68 left Toronto at 6:10 p.m. and arrived in Montreal at 10:14 p.m., while Train 69 left Montreal at 6:10 p.m. and arrived in Toronto at 10:14 p.m. (The evening trains did not run on Saturdays.) The trip took 3 hours and 59 minutes downtown-to-downtown on trains 62 and 63, while the evening trains were slightly slower, taking four hours and four minutes to complete the run. Turbo service was about a full hour faster than CN's previous express trains, the \\"Rapido\\". However, even the runs made by the Turbotrains in the late 1970s still fell substantially short of their intended 120 mph design speed; the fastest average speed for the Turbotrain in regular scheduled Canadian passenger service was an intermediate booking from Kingston to Guildwood (102 minutes for the 145.2 miles between the two cities nonstop at an average speed of 85.4 mph (137.4 km/hr). By 1974, after substantial modifications of the gearbox device and pendular suspension, and reinforcement of the sound insulation, the Turbotrains finally took up untroubled service. CN operated the Turbos until 1978, when their passenger operations were taken over by Via Rail, who continued the service. One of the three remaining trains developed an oil leak and caught fire on the afternoon run from Montr√©al to Toronto on May 29, 1979. It was stopped west of Morrisburg. It took some time for the fire engines to arrive as they were forced to drive on the trackbed. The power car and two coaches were totally destroyed. There were no injuries, although rapid disembarkation was needed. The train was eventually towed back to the Turcot yard in Montr√©al and remained there for several years, covered by tarpaulins. The Turbo's final run was on October 31, 1982, when they were replaced by the all-Canadian LRC trainsets from Bombardier Transportation, which employed conventional diesel- electric locomotives. Although they had an early reputation for unreliability, according to CN's records, the rebuilt TurboTrains had an availability rate of over 97% for their careers with CN and Via. The LRC suffered from similar teething problems, notably with the tilt system locking the cars in a tilted position. The withdrawal of the Turboliners was also precipitated by the rise in oil prices during the 1973 oil embargo and the following years, which destroyed \\"one of gas turbine traction's prime advantages, fuel cost economy\\". None of the UAC TurboTrains were preserved.

The first section was constructed as a bush tramway in 1868 and converted to a railway in the next decade. Today the railway is partially used by the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway, which runs tourist services between Kawakawa and Taumarere. The line's centrepiece is the section where it runs down along the main street of Kawakawa. Construction A tramway was opened in 1868 to carry coal from mines at Kawakawa to the Taumarere wharf at what is now known as Derrick Landing. The rails were wooden, the track gauge was the international standard gauge , and the wagons were pulled by horses. In 1871, some surplus rails, wagons and two steam locomotives were acquired from a railway project near Auckland and the tramway was upgraded to railway standards. It was purchased by the government in 1876, who had recently established the national gauge as , and re-gauged the line in 1877. In 1876, a settlement with a deepwater port was proposed, and in 1881 plans of a town named \\"Newport\\" were published. It became known as Opua and the railway from Kawakawa opened on 7 April 1884. The spur to Taumarere wharf was no longer necessary, as Opua's port was far superior, and it was closed. It was some time before the isolated KawakawaOpua line was connected to the rest of the national rail network. There were questions over its viability, but in 1899 parliament approved a connection with the line that was progressing north from Whangarei. A line 44 kilometres in length was required to link Kawakawa to the Whangarei section's northern railhead in Waiotu, and factors such as poor winter weather and difficulties in accessing the construction due to the relative isolation of the region at the time meant that it was not until 1911 that the rails from each end met. In 1925, the North Auckland Line was finally completed and the WhangƒÅreiOpua section was linked to the national network. Stations The following stations were on the Otiria-Opua section of the North Auckland Line, with the distance in kilometres from Otiria in brackets: *Moerewa (3 km) *Kawakawa (7 km) *Taumarere (10 km) *Te Akeake (15 km) *Whangae Bridge (16 km) *Opua (19 km) Operation TR class shunting locomotive along the main street of Kawakawa In the tramway days and the first years of the line, the predominant traffic was coal from Kawakawa for export. By the late 1890s coal traffic had all but disappeared and the government initially expressed a desire to remove the line. Local indignation was such that instead of removing the line, it was connected to Whangarei and then the national network. When the North Auckland Line was fully opened in 1925, the Opua Express passenger train operated thrice weekly from Auckland to Opua. Freight did not operate directly to Auckland; it was conveyed to and from Whangarei, with other services operating south. Some trains were mixed trains, conveying both passengers and freight. In November 1956, railcars replaced the Opua Express. Unfortunately for Opua, the railcars operated to the other northern terminus of Okaihau on the Okaihau Branch, leaving Opua without any dedicated passenger trains. Passengers had to rely on mixed trains, which did not connect with the railcars. Nonetheless, the mixed trains lasted another two decades (longer than the railcars, which ceased operating in 1967); the last one ran between Whangarei and Opua on 18 June 1976. From this time, this part was used to carry solely freight, almost all of which was output from the Moerewa Dairy Factory and Affco Meat Works to the port of Opua. By the 1980s, regular freight services beyond Kawakawa were becoming irregular due to the decline of shipping to Opua as a result of containerisation. It was last used in 1985 and leased to the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway to operate tourist passenger services from Opua to Kawakawa, including running down the centre of Kawakawa's main street. The short stretch between Otiria and Kawakawa was retained as a link to the national network, but has since been dismantled and is now used as a footpath connecting Kawakawa with Moerewa (a disused siding terminates at Moerewa). The tourist trains operated between Kawakawa and Opua until 2001, when the Land Transport Safety Authority withdrew the line's operating licence. Currently, operations run from Kawakawa, including the stretch down the main street, to Taumarere. The terminus in Opua is on land now owned by Far North Holdings, the trading arm of Far North District Council, and negotiations are under way so that trains can return to Opua in the near future.

On 23 May 2007 the commission ruled against the union, declining to consider the question, considering it inappropriate for the AIPA to be able to enrol New Zealand‚Äìbased Jetconnect pilots, as they were already eligible to be members of the New Zealand Air Line Pilots' Association. In December 2009 the AIPA took Jetconnect parent Qantas to Fair Work Australia, accusing the company of deliberately driving down wages and conditions, by undermining the spirit and intent of the Australian Fair Work Act. The AIPA accused Qantas of paying Jetconnect pilots 40 percent less than Qantas pilots, who six months earlier had been flying the majority of the airline's trans-Tasman services.

Since the beginning the collection has been divided into two main groups: the art historical collection and the folklore collection. History and building The museum was founded by King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1855. It houses a large collection of European artifacts from the late antiquity until the early 20th century with particular strengths in the medieval through early modern periods. Narcissus fountain in the courtyard The building, erected in the style of historicism by Gabriel von Seidl 1894-1900, is one of the most original and significant museum buildings of its time. It is situated in the Prinzregentenstra√üe, one of the city's four royal avenues. The house replaced an older building which houses today the Museum Five Continents. Already in 1905/06, the museum was expanded to the north by a few rooms and a workshop wing. German Bestelmeyer added a wing at the southeast corner in 1937. The main building of the Bavarian National Museum includes on three floors exhibition rooms with in total about 13,000 square meters. The core of the collection dates from the art collection of the Wittelsbach family. This gives the National Museum an importance far beyond the local area. Diversity and breadth of the collections, however, were particularly motivated by the new additions to the subsequent period. To date, the inventory is updated continuously not only through acquisitions, but also by significant foundations and bequests. Support experienced by the National Museum, in particular, by the 1960 launched club \\"Friends of the Bavarian National Museum\\". The National Museum has several branch museums throughout Bavaria. A new building behind the museum houses as addition the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection (Arch√§ologische Staatssammlung) from the first settlement in the Paleolithic Ages through the Celtic civilization and the Roman period right up to the early Middle Ages. Decorative arts The gothic Madonna from Seeon Abbey Medieval knight's armour The art collection displays artworks in a tour through more than forty rooms from the hall for late antiquity and Romanesque art via the rooms for Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo art to the exhibits of Neoclassicism and Art Nouveau. The western side wing of the museum houses The Bollert Collection with late medieval sculptures. The museum is especially noted for its collections of carved ivory, goldsmith works, textiles, glass painting, tapestries and shrines. The displayed sculptures were created by noted sculptors including Erasmus Grasser, Tilman Riemenschneider, Hans Multscher, Hans Leinberger, Adam Krafft, Giovanni Bologna, Hubert Gerhard, Adriaen de Vries, Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, Johann Baptist Straub, , Ignaz G√ºnther, Matthias Steinl, and Ludwig Schwanthaler. The museum is famous for its collections of courtly culture, musical instruments, furniture, oil paintings, sketches, clocks, stoneware, majolica, miniatures, porcelain and faience, and its statues. It has probably the world's best collection of the Nymphenburg porcelain figures of Franz Anton Bustelli (1723‚Äì63). Medieval art The Romanesque period is represented by stone sculptures from the monastery of Wessobrunn and the marble lions from Reichenhall. Important pieces of Romanesque art include wooden figures of crucifixion groups from Bamberg, Schongau and Kaufbeuren, and several works of metal and ivory. The Kasten der Heiligen Kunigunde (jewelry box of Holy Cunegonde), is a unique masterpiece made in the year 1000 in Scandinavia of wood, bronze and narwhal tusk. Reliefs from the Magdeburg Ivories, plaques probably from an antependium of Emperor Otto I and a relief of the West Roman imperial court with one of the oldest representations of the Ascension among the most famous works in the ivory collection. Key works of ivory art, important stained glass windows, and not least excellent testimonies of textile are found in the Gothic department. On display are also historic Gothic chamber ensembles such as the magnificently painted Zunftstube of Augsburg weavers, one of the finest Gothic cabinets at all. The Bavarian National Museum displays one of the largest and most important collections of late medieval sculpture from the German-speaking countries. Special attractions are the great knight's hall with the ceremonial armor of the 15th and 16th Century and the true to scale wooden Renaissance models of the Bavarian ducal capitals. The portrait art of the Renaissance is represented by medals, miniatures, paintings and full plastic sculptures. Many items come from the art chamber of the Wittelsbach family. From the possession of the Wittelsbach the Bavarian National Museum also presents unique Baroque objects from all areas of craft and artistic production, such as ostentatious furniture, jewelry, weapons, musical instruments, watches, glasses, miniatures, ivories and bronzes. Of importance are especially Florentine bronzes from the collection of the Medici and pastel paintings from Venice including works of Rosalba Carriera. The Bavarian National Museum has the most important collection of the Bavarian Rococo sculpture. A rich collection of architectural models and designs for frescoes and altarpieces documents the new buildings and conversions of churches in the competition of the various monasteries and convents. A unique court ensembles are the silverware of the Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim and the service and figurative centrepieces of Nymphenburg and Meissen porcelain manufacturers. Rare furnitures testify to the high rank of the most famous German cabinetmaker manufactories of the 18th Century. The collection of Neo-classical art of the 19th Century is also strongly influenced by works that once belonged to the Wittelsbach family. Thus, from the estate of Maximilian's father King Ludwig I are magnificent presents of Napoleon Bonaparte which arrived at the Museum, a result of the strong connection between France and Bavaria. Of special importance is for example a splendid table with precious wood with a rich porcelain decor, a gift Napoleon gave in 1806 to the Crown Prince Ludwig. The Art Nouveau Department shows, for example, the floral art direction, an expression of Art Nouveau inspired by the plants and animals, first developed in France. The collection of fine glass and porcelain and ceramics includes many objects of high artistic and technical quality of the most important centers of this epoch in Europe and the United States. The museum displays a major collection of Art Nouveau objects, including the work of Louis Comfort Tiffany, Ren√© Lalique, √âmile Gall√© and several Bavarian artists. Period rooms Many of the museum's treasures are displayed in antique rooms moved to the museum. For example, the armor is in one of several rooms featuring gothic ribbed vaulting form medieval buildings, magnificent renaissance furnishings are displayed in rooms roofed with decorative wood-beamed and mullioned ceilings form the 14th and 15th centuries, and the baroque objects in rooms with 16th century wood paneling and decorative ceilings. Folklore collection The folklore collection houses for example traditional Bavarian furnitures, rural pottery, crockery and religious folklore including an outstanding collection of Neapolitan, Sicilian, Tyrolian and Bavarian wood carvings including street scenes and Nativity Scenes. Nativity scenes The museum holds an extensive collection of Nativity scene from the fifteenth through early nineteenth centuries, dramatically and imaginatively displayed. Many of the scenes display wonderful craftsmanship and detailed workmanship, some are worked in precious materials, others show exotic elements, like a Flight into Egypt intended to astonish 18th century viewers with the monkeys, crocodiles and hippopotamuses Mary and Joseph encounter on the Nile.

History The monastery, dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist, was founded in 1107 by Heinrich of Kirchberg, a ministerialis of Niederm√ºnster in Regensburg, and settled by monks from either the monastery of Michelsberg in Bamberg or St. Emmeram's Abbey in Regensburg. Under Abbot Eppo (1122-1143) the reforming influences of the monasteries of St. Georgen im Schwarzwald and of Hirsau had a significant impact. At this time the community was subordinated to Otto I, Bishop of Bamberg and placed under the direct protection of Pope Innocent II (1130-1143). In 1136 Abbot Eppo dissolved the double monastery (i.e., including both men and women) which seems to have been there until that time; the women's convent was transferred to nearby Eitting. In the 12th century there was church building in the romanesque style, in the 13th a period of spiritual awakening, and in the 14th the reforms led by Kastl Abbey. In the mid 16th century the abbey narrowly escaped dissolution. The monastic grammar school enjoyed an excellent reputation. The abbey was finally dissolved in 1803 during the secularisation of Bavaria. The assets and estates were auctioned off. The monastery buildings were used from 1807 as offices for local officials. Since 1869 Franciscan sisters have lived at the site, and presently run the \\"Special Academy for Social Pedagogy of the Poor Clares of Mallersdorf\\" (\\"Fachakademie f√ºr Sozialp√§dagogik der Armen Franziskanerinnen Mallersdorf\\"). There is also a Realschule there. In August 2014, it was reported that Sister Doris Engelhard, a nun at the abbey and a certified master brewer, was the last beer making nun in Europe. She has been brewing beer at the abbey for over 40 years. Brewing at the abbey was revived in 1881. On brewing days, she is excused from morning prayers and starts work at the abbey brew house at 3:30 a.m. Depending on the season, Sister Doris will brew a maibock, a doppelbock, a dark zoigl, or a copper-hued vollbier (lager).

The Anglican Missal is a liturgical book used liturgically by some Anglo-Catholics and other High Church Anglicans as a supplement to the Book of Common Prayer. History The Anglican Missal was first produced in England in 1921 by the Society of SS. Peter and Paul. The book reflected a particular way, drawn from the traditional Roman Rite, of celebrating the Eucharist according to Anglican liturgical use. It was brought to the United States, Canada, and other English-speaking countries over the course of the 20th century. In the United States, it was produced in former years by the Frank Gavin Liturgical Foundation, which sold to the Anglican Parishes Association the rights to its publication. The newer American version is not substantially different from the Gavin editions except for the fact that certain typographical errors have been corrected. American edition The Anglican Missal sitting on an altar desk in an Anglican parish church The Gavin edition of the Anglican Missal in the American Edition is in turn simply an American version of the missal produced in England. Some adjustments were needed to adapt the version from England to use in the United States, but this was all done decades ago by the Gavin Liturgical Foundation. The new American edition of the Anglican Missal still retains the three versions of the Eucharistic prayer that were in the former edition. These are the American Canon of 1928 (related to Eucharistic Prayer I in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America), the 1549 Canon as translated and illuminated by Thomas Cranmer, and an English translation of the Roman Canon (Eucharistic Prayer I in modern Roman Catholic missals, called the \\"Gregorian Canon\\" in the Anglican Missal). Variations Some Anglo-Catholic parishes use the Anglican Missal, or some variation of it for the celebration of Mass. Variations include the Anglican Service Book, the English Missal, A Manual of Anglo-Catholic Devotion, and the directive books A Priest's Handbook by Dennis Michno and Ceremonies of the Eucharist by Howard E. Galley. All of these books (with the exception of Manual and Anglican Service Book) are intended primarily for celebration of the Eucharist. They contain meditations for the presiding celebrant(s) during the liturgy, and other material such as the rite for the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday, propers for special feast days, and instructions for proper ceremonial order. These books are used as a more expansively Catholic context in which to celebrate the liturgical use found in the Book of Common Prayer and related liturgical books. Latin American edition In Latin America, the Anglican Missal has an edition which is a version of the Anglican American Missal promoted by the Anglican Diocese of the Caribbean and New Granada (Colombia), which is the only version of the Anglican Missal in Spanish. During 1989 the present Archbishop Emeritus of the Anglican Province of Christ the King, Robert S. Morse, as President of the American Church Union that promotes devotion to and use of the Anglican Missal, authorized and encouraged Bishop Victor Manuel Cruz Blanco to translate, propagate and implant application of the Anglican Missal in Latin America. Lutherans Some High Church Lutheran parishes use ritual propers and directives from these books in conjunction with a form of Martin Luther's German Mass.

Biography He was born in Kumasi to Nana James W.K. Appiah and Nana Adwoa Akyaa, members of the Ashanti imperial aristocracy. His father was a schoolmaster, Methodist leader, traditional nobleman and, finally, Chief Secretary of Asanteman - a position which gave him considerable influence in Ashanti affairs. Appiah was educated at Wesley College, Mfantsipim, and the Middle Temple.Susan Williams, Colour Bar: The triumph of Seretse Khama and His Nation, Allen Lane, 2006; Penguin Books, 2007, p. xxxiii-iv.Cameron Duodu, Obituary of Peggy Appiah, The Guardian, 6 March 2006. During his time in the United Kingdom, he was closely involved with the West African Students' Union (WASU), eventually becoming its president. He came, through residence in London and involvement with WASU, to know many of the main players in the fight against imperial rule in Ghana and elsewhere in Africa. Not least among these was Kwame Nkrumah, to whom he became very close. Nkrumah was Appiah's first choice for best man at his wedding to Peggy Cripps in 1953 (\\"but the job went to arguably the more influential figure of George Padmore, a Trinidadian who was political mentor to African nationalist leaders, including Nkrumah and Jomo Kenyatta\\"). Their firstborn child, son Kwame, was born in London in 1954, followed by Ama (born 1955), Adwoa (born 1960) and Abena (born 1962). The Appiah family returned to Ghana in late 1954. Soon after, Joe Appiah's friendship with Nkrumah was ruined. He joined the National Liberation Movement party and won the Atwima- Amansie seat in 1957. The NLM was later to merge with other opposition parties to form the United Party. After the General Afrifa-led coup that overthrew Nkrumah in 1966, he was asked to explain the new regime's motives to Ghana's friends and neighbours. Appiah was intermittently involved in public life as a diplomat and a government minister from then on until his retirement in 1978. He returned to Kumasi, where he continued to fulfil his duties as a tribal elder. Following the death of his grand-uncle Yao Antony, he had become the head of their branch of the nobility of the Ashanti people. Prior to his own death, he served as the kingmaker and titular overlord of Nyaduom, a town that was founded centuries before by his ancestor Nana Akroma-Ampim I. His autobiography Joe Appiah: The Autobiography of an African Patriot was published in 1990. Kwame Anthony Appiah's In My Father's House: Africa in the Philosophy of Culture was inspired by his father's easy cosmopolitanism. Joe Appiah died in Accra after an illness and was buried at the Tafo cemetery at Kumasi in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. His widow would buy and occupy the adjacent plot after her death in 2006.\\"Peggy Appiah\\" obituary, The Telegraph, 24 February 2006. His tomb was vandalised in 2008 by unknown persons.

Somerset Maugham.Hastings, Selinia. The Secret Lives of Somerset Maugham, New York: Random House, 2010 He and Maugham met at the outbreak of World War I when they both began serving as part of a Red Cross ambulance unit in French Flanders. Secrecy and arrest Maugham, and to a lesser extent Haxton, had been affected by the trial of Oscar Wilde. Common to men who were either homosexual or in the case of Maugham who had sexual relationships with both men and women (Maugham had had an affair with the actress Sue Jones before meeting Haxton and later had a child with Syrie Wellcome whom he married), neither spoke of their situation for fear of recrimination. However in November 1915 Haxton and another man, John Lindsell, were arrested in a Covent Garden hotel in London and charged with gross indecency. Military policemen, whilst looking for deserters, had burst into the hotel room of Haxton and Lindsell to find them committing a homosexual act that was not buggery. On December 7 that same year both men were indicted under the same law that had been used to prosecute Oscar Wilde. However, unlike Wilde, when the two men appeared in the Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey on December 10 they were both acquitted. Deportation Haxton left England shortly thereafter. After touring the South Pacific islands, Haxton was aboard the Hitachi Maru en route to South Africa when the ship was captured by the German raider SMS Wolf in September 1917. Haxton was a prisoner aboard the Wolf until February 1918 when the Wolf returned to Germany and he was transferred to a German prison camp. He was reunited with Maugham in 1919. On attempting to return in February 1919 he was deported from Britain as an undesirable alien and was never allowed to enter the country again. Haxton's Home Office file, containing the reason or reasons for his deportation, is sealed until 2019.Robert Calder, Willie: the Life of W. Somerset Maugham, p. 161 Robert Calder speculates that Syrie Maugham may have used her high connections in the British government to have Haxton deported.Robert Calder, Willie: the Life of W. Somerset Maugham, p. 161 Because Maugham and Haxton traveled abroad and chose to live on the French Riviera in the \\"Villa La Mauresque\\", they were able to carry on their relationship despite Haxton's deportation. They lived in Villa Mauresque at Cap Ferrat almost exclusively until they were forced to flee the advancing Germans at the commencement of World War II. It is thought that Haxton's flamboyant nature, said to be portrayed in the character Rowley Flint in Up at the Villa, was the key to Maugham's invitational success with the members of society wherever the pair traveled. Later years and death Haxton continued as Maugham's constant companion for 30 years, until he died in a private room in the Doctors Hospital, New York.

It was published in 1969, first by Ace Books in the US, as part of their Ace Science Fiction Specials series, and later by Mayflower Books in the UK. It is essentially a novel about the decay of society and the deep personal and social isolation this has caused, and tells of a man fleeing through interstellar space from Earth, where civilisation is collapsing into anarchy and wars. The author uses techniques ranging from straight narrative to entries in the spaceship's log, dream sequences and sixties-style computer printouts. Plot summary Ryan is a tough-minded British businessman appalled by the breakdown of society at the end of the 20th century. He feels that he is one of the few sane men in a world of paranoiacs. With a small group of family and friends, he has stolen a spaceship and set out for Munich 15040 (Barnard's Star), a planet believed to be suitable for colonisation. Now he keeps watch alone, with his 13 companions sealed in cabinets designed to keep them in suspended animation for the many years of the journey. He makes a daily report on each one: it is always 'Condition Steady'. Ryan is tormented by nightmares and memories of the violence on Earth; he starts to fear he is losing his grip on reality. The shipboard computer urges him to take a drug that eliminates all delusions and hallucinations; but he is strangely reluctant to use this drug. Authorship Although the novel is credited to Michael Moorcock, it is based on an idea for a novel started but not finished by Moorcock's then-wife, Hilary Bailey, \\"a straight future disaster story ‚Äì collapse of society stuff\\". Moorcock took Bailey's scenes set on Earth and heavily rewrote them, adding all the scenes that occur on the Hope Dempsey. Typographical art The novel contains sequences of typographical art, where, in the words of the author, \\"words create a pattern of other letters forming other words\\". In various editions of the book, these sequences have not always been presented correctly. The first American edition (Ace, 1969) got the art right, although the book's opening passages were cut. The first UK edition (Mayflower, 1969) restored the opening passages but the typesetters messed up the typographical art, although they did get the art on their correct pages, something that subsequent American printings failed to do. When John Davey edited the Tales of the Eternal Champion omnibuses for Orion (in the UK) and White Wolf (in the US) in the 1990s, every effort was made to ensure that the typographical art was perfect in the volume containing The Black Corridor (Sailing to Utopia). These omnibuses (particularly the White Wolf edition) are regarded by Moorcock as being the \\"most accurate typographically\\". Critical response Barry Malzberg reviewed the novel unfavorably on its release, saying \\"it is not good. It is really not at all good,\\" but concluded \\"I remain convinced that someday Moorcock will write a substantial novel, fully worthy of his pretensions and our expectations.\\"\\"Books,\\" F&SF;, May 1970, pp.25-6 The Black Corridor was cited by Karl Edward Wagner as one of the thirteen best science-fiction horror novels.N.

He later served in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. Through his granddaughter Wang Yuanji's marriage with Sima Zhao, he was the great-grandfather of Sima Yan, the founding emperor of the Jin dynasty. Early life and career Wang Lang was from Tan County (), Donghai Commandery (), which is around present-day Tancheng County, Shandong. His original given name was \\"Yan\\" () but he changed it to \\"Lang\\" () later.(È≠èÁï•Êõ∞ÔºöÊúóÊú¨ÂêçÂö¥ÔºåÂêéÊîπÁÇ∫Êúó„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 13. He started his career as a Palace Gentleman () due to his academic proficiency, particularly with the Chinese Classics. When his teacher Yang Ci () died, he left his post and went back to his home county to mourn him. Later, he served Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province. During that time, he advised Tao Qian alongside several others to pledge allegiance to Emperor Xian, citing the Spring and Autumn Annals. Tao Qian then sent an envoy to the Han central government in Chang'an to pledge allegiance to the Emperor, and in return received the appointment \\"General Calming the East\\". The Han central government also appointed Wang Lang as the Administrator of Kuaiji Commandery. As a warlord In Kuaiji Commandery, Wang Lang banned the worship of Qin Shi Huang, a widespread custom among locals, believing that he was a ruler without virtue.(„ÄäÊúóÂÆ∂ÂÇ≥„ÄãÊõ∞ÔºöÊúÉÁ®ΩËàäÁ•ÄÁß¶ÂßãÁöáÔºåÂàªÊú®Áà≤ÂÉèÔºåËàáÂ§èÁ¶πÂêåÂªü„ÄÇÊúóÂà∞ÂÆòÔºå‰ª•Áà≤ÁÑ°Âæ∑‰πãÂêõ‰∏çÊáâË¶ãÁ•ÄÔºåÊñºÊòØÈô§‰πã„ÄÇ) Annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 13 by Pei Songzhi. During his tenure as the Administrator of Kuaiji, Wang formed a secret alliance with the Shanyue tribes. When the warlord Sun Ce started his Jiangdong campaign, Wang Lang financed the Shanyue leader Yan Baihu to fight Sun Ce, but Yan Baihu and the other Shanyue clan leaders lost to Sun Ce. At the time, Liu Yao, another warlord in the Jiangdong region, had also lost to Sun Ce in battle. Yan Baihu had become the head of a loose confederation composed of bandits and local officials, including Wang Lang, and he again gathered soldiers numbering tens of thousands. Despite opposition from his adviser Yu Fan, Wang Lang directly joined Yan Baihu in military operations against Sun Ce's forces, but they were defeated. He then escaped to Dongye (). There, he gained the support from the Chief of Houguan () and attempted to rebuild his power.(ÊôÇÁéãÊúóÂ•îÊù±ÂÜ∂Ôºå‰æØÂÆòÈï∑ÂïÜÂçáÁÇ∫ÊúóËµ∑ÂÖµ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 60.

He then conducted a very humble speech to appease Sun Ce, who later accepted his surrender.

Eventually he was contacted by one of Cao Cao's spies and was asked to join Cao Cao in the new imperial capital, Xuchang, where the Han central government was based. Although he was initially hesitant, he became convinced after reading a letter from his old friend, Kong Rong, who praised Cao Cao and urged him to go to Xuchang. Thus, he travelled north and reached Xuchang about a year later. Cao Cao highly valued Wang Lang's talent and appointed him as Critical Grandee, and Advisor to the Army of the Excellency of Works.

In 220, after Cao Cao's death, his son Cao Pi became king, promoting Wang Lang as Censorate Grandee and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Yueping Village. Later that winter, the Emperor abdicated in favor of Cao Pi, who established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Han dynasty. After becoming the emperor, Cao Pi appointed Wang Lang as the Minister of Works and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Anling Precinct. During Cao Pi's reign, Wang Lang made several suggestions regarding both military and civilian matters, such as security and the reduction of the state's employees and expenditures. In 226, when Cao Rui came to the throne, he promoted Wang Lang from a district marquis to a county marquis under the title \\"Marquis of Lanling\\", increasing his marquisate to 1,700 taxable households, from his previous 1,200. Wang Lang was later sent to Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei) to visit the tomb of Empress Wenzhao, Cao Rui's mother. She had yet to be canonized as Empress at that point, so Wang Lang was given the tally and document that permitted him to do so, as well as the proper sacrificial animals for this. A special tomb was to be built for her as well. During his visit, he saw the populace was short on material; thus, he wrote to advise Cao Rui to be frugal, and to reduce the scale of the building of his extravagant palaces and ancestral temples. Wang Lang was later promoted to the position of Minister over the Masses. Late life and death After Wang Lang objected to Cao Rui's palace- building project, he noticed that Cao Rui had a small imperial harem and wrote to Cao Rui stating that an emperor should have more concubines in order to continue the imperial bloodline with more offspring. This time, Cao Rui wholeheartedly agreed with Wang Lang and started expanding the size of his imperial harem. Wang's advice had a profound influence: Nine years after Wang Lang's death, Cao Rui even ordered beautiful married women all be formally seized unless their husbands were able to ransom them, and that they would be married to soldiers instead ‚Äì except that the most beautiful among them would become his concubines. Despite protests from some officials, this decree was apparently carried out, much to the distress of his people. Wang Lang later focused on academic works and had published several books that were well received at the time. He died in 228 and was given the posthumous title \\"Marquis Cheng\\" (), literally meaning \\"marquis of establishment\\". He was succeeded by his son Wang Su, who continued serving as an official in Wei. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Wang Lang died at the age of 76 in 228. Despite his age, he led a group of soldiers and set up camp to do battle with Zhuge Liang. In the novel, Cao Zhen was defeated by Zhuge Liang. Cao Zhen called for his subordinates to help, and Wang Lang decided to try and persuade him to surrender (even though Guo Huai was sceptical that it would succeed) and engaged Zhuge Liang in a debate, but was soundly defeated. Zhuge Liang among other things scolded him as a dog and a traitor, from the shock of which he fell off his horse and died on the spot. There is no record of this in history, and instead, it is said that he merely sent a letter to Zhuge Liang recommending that he surrender. The letter was ignored.

Gudgeon pin fits into gudgeons inside piston. In internal combustion engines, the gudgeon pin (UK, wrist pin or piston pin US) connects the piston to the connecting rod, and provides a bearing for the connecting rod to pivot upon as the piston moves.Nunney, Malcolm James (2007) \\"The Reciprocating Piston Petrol Engine: Gudgeon pins and their location\\" Light and heavy vehicle technology (4th ed.) Butterworth- Heinemann, Oxford, UK, p. 28, In very early engine designs, including those driven by steam, and many very large stationary or marine engines, the gudgeon pin is located in a sliding crosshead that connects to the piston via a rod. A gudgeon is a pivot or journal. The origin of the word gudgeon is the Middle English word gojoun, which originated from the Middle French word goujon. Its first known use was in the 15th century.Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, G & C Merriam Company, 1963, p. 370 Overview The gudgeon pin is typically a forged short hollow rod made of a steel alloy of high strength and hardness that may be physically separated from both the connecting rod and piston or crosshead. The design of the gudgeon pin, especially in the case of small, high-revving automotive engines is challenging. The gudgeon pin has to operate under some of the highest temperatures experienced in the engine, with difficulties in lubrication due to its location, while remaining small and light so as to fit into the piston diameter and not unduly add to the reciprocating mass. The requirements for lightness and compactness demand a small diameter rod that is subject to heavy shear and bending loads, with some of the highest pressure loadings of any bearing in the whole engine. To overcome these problems, the materials used to make the gudgeon pin and the way it is manufactured are amongst the most highly engineered of any mechanical component found in internal combustion engines. Design options Gudgeon pins use two broad design configurations: semi-floating and fully floating. Construction of gudgeon pin Typical construction of gudgeon pin (wrist pin) is shown on the picture. The design depend on technological and technical effectiveness. ;Semi-floating :In the semi-floating configuration, the pin is usually fixed relative to the piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.Williamson, W.D. (16 March 1916) \\"The Sizes of Motors for Trucks and Outline of British Practice in This Field: Part Two: Outline of British Truck Motor Design\\" The Automobile [Automotive industries] The Class Journal Company, New York, Vol. XXXIV, pp. 502‚Äì504, p. 502, ) The connecting rod small end bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into the eye of the small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings.Hillier, Victor Albert Walter and Pittuck, Frank William (1991) \\"The Petrol Engine: Gudgeon pins\\" Fundamentals of Motor Vehicle Technology (4th ed.) Stanley Thornes Pub., Cheltenham, England, p. 34 This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace. ;Fully floating :In the fully floating configuration, a bearing surface is created both between the small end eye and gudgeon pin and the journal in the piston. The gudgeon pins are usually secured with circlips. No interference fit is used in any instance and the pin 'floats' entirely on bearing surfaces. The average rubbing speed of each of the three bearings is halved and the load is shared across a bearing that is usually about three times the length of the semi-floating design with an interference fit with the piston.

Examples of physiologically inert gases, which have caused accidental or deliberate death by this mechanism, are argon, helium, nitrogen and methane. The term \\"physiologically inert\\" is used to indicate a gas which has no toxic or anesthetic properties and does not act upon the heart or hemoglobin. Instead, the gas acts as a simple diluent to reduce oxygen concentration in inspired gas and blood to dangerously low levels, thereby eventually depriving all cells in the body of oxygen. According to the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, in humans, \\"breathing an oxygen deficient atmosphere can have serious and immediate effects, including unconsciousness after only one or two breaths. The exposed person has no warning and cannot sense that the oxygen level is too low.\\" In the US, at least 80 people died due to accidental nitrogen asphyxiation between 1992 and 2002. Hazards with inert gases and the risks of asphyxiation are well established.\\"HAZARDS OF INERT GASES AND OXYGEN DEPLETION\\". Singapore: Asia Industrial Gases Association. An occasional cause of accidental death in humans, inert gas asphyxia with gases including helium, nitrogen, methane and argon has been used as a suicide method. Inert gas asphyxia has been advocated by proponents of euthanasia, using a gas-retaining plastic hood device colloquially referred to as a suicide bag. Nitrogen asphyxiation has been suggested as a new way to carry out capital punishment. In April 2015, the Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed a bill authorizing nitrogen asphyxiation as an alternative execution method in cases where the state's primary method of lethal injection was not available. In March 2018, Oklahoma attorney general Mike Hunter and corrections director Joe M. Allbaugh announced plans to implement nitrogen executions, but after struggling for years to design a nitrogen execution protocol, the state announced in February 2020 it abandoned the project and will resume executions by lethal injection.  Process  When humans breathe in an asphyxiant gas, such as pure nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, methane, or any other physiologically inert gas(es), they exhale carbon dioxide without re-supplying oxygen. Physiologically inert gases (those that have no toxic effect, but merely dilute oxygen) are generally free of odor and taste. Accordingly, the human subject detects little abnormal sensation as the oxygen level falls. This leads to asphyxiation (death from lack of oxygen) without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation (the hypercapnic alarm response, which in humans arises mostly from carbon dioxide levels rising), or the side effects of poisoning. In scuba diving rebreather accidents, there is often little sensation, however, a slow decrease in oxygen breathing gas content has effects which are quite variable. By contrast, suddenly breathing pure inert gas causes oxygen levels in the blood to fall precipitously, and may lead to unconsciousness in only a few breaths, with no symptoms at all. Some animal species are better equipped than humans to detect hypoxia, and these species are more uncomfortable in low-oxygen environments that result from inert gas exposure; however, the experience is still less aversive than CO2 exposure.  Physiology  A typical human breathes between 12 and 20 times per minute at a rate influenced primarily by carbon dioxide concentration, and thus pH, in the blood. With each breath, a volume of about 0.6 litres is exchanged from an active lung volume (tidal volume + functional residual capacity) of about 3 litres. Normal Earth's atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases. After just two or three breaths of nitrogen, the oxygen concentration in the lungs would be low enough for some oxygen already in the bloodstream to exchange back to the lungs and be eliminated by exhalation. Unconsciousness in cases of accidental asphyxia can occur within 1 minute. Loss of consciousness results from critical hypoxia, when arterial oxygen saturation is less than 60%. \\"At oxygen concentrations [in air] of 4 to 6%, there is loss of consciousness in 40 seconds and death within a few minutes\\". At an altitude over , where the ambient oxygen concentration is equivalent to a concentration of 3.6% at sea level, an average individual can perform flying duties efficiently for only 9 to 12 seconds without oxygen supplementation. The US Air Force trains air crews to recognize their individual subjective signs of approaching hypoxia. Some individuals experience headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and euphoria, and some become unconscious without warning. Loss of consciousness may be accompanied by convulsions and is followed by cyanosis and cardiac arrest. About 7 minutes of oxygen deprivation causes death of the brainstem. The RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine did a study in which subjects were asked to hyperventilate in a nitrogen atmosphere. Among the results: \\"When the duration of over-ventilation with nitrogen was greater than 8‚Äì10 sec the subject reported a transient dimming of vision. In the experiments in which nitrogen breathing was carried out for 15‚Äì16 sec the subject experienced some general clouding of consciousness and impairment of vision. Vision was frequently lost in these experiments for a short period. In the few experiments in which nitrogen was breathed for 17‚Äì20 sec unconsciousness supervened and was accompanied on most occasions by a generalized convulsion. The duration of the interval between the start of over-ventilation with nitrogen and the onset of symptoms was 12‚Äì14 sec.\\" The study did not report how much discomfort the subjects felt.  Animal slaughter = Relation to controlled atmosphere killing  Controlled atmosphere killing (CAK) or controlled atmosphere stunning (CAS) is a method for slaughtering animals such as chickens or cane toads by placing the animals in a container in which the atmosphere lacks oxygen and consists of an asphyxiant gas (one or more of argon, nitrogen or carbon dioxide), causing the animals to lose consciousness. Argon and nitrogen are important components of a gassing process which seem to cause no pain, and for this reason many consider some types of controlled atmosphere killing more humane than other methods of killing. However, \\"stunning\\" is often done using carbon dioxide. If carbon dioxide is used, controlled atmosphere killing is not the same as inert gas asphyxia, because carbon dioxide at high concentrations (above 5%) is not biologically inert, but rather is toxic and also produces initial distress in some animal species. The addition of toxic carbon dioxide to hypoxic atmospheres used in slaughter without animal distress is a complex and highly species-specific matter, which also depends on concentration of carbon dioxide.Raj, A.B.M. and Gregory, N.G., (1995).  Euthanasia of animals  Diving animals such as rats, minks and burrowing animals are sensitive to low-oxygen atmospheres and (unlike humans) will avoid them, making purely hypoxic techniques possibly inhumane for them. For this reason, the use of inert gas (hypoxic) atmospheres (without CO2) for euthanasia is also species-specific.  Accidental deaths and injury  Accidental nitrogen asphyxiation is a possible hazard where large quantities of nitrogen are used. It causes several deaths per year in the United States, which is asserted to be more than from any other industrial gas. In one accident in 1981, shortly before the launch of the first Space Shuttle mission, five technicians lost consciousness and two of them died after they entered the Orbiter aft compartment. Nitrogen had been used to flush oxygen from the compartment as a precaution against fire. They were not wearing air packs because of a last-minute change in safety procedures. During a pool party in Mexico in 2013, eight party-goers were rendered unconscious and one 21-year-old male was put into a coma after liquid nitrogen was poured into the pool. Occasional deaths are reported from recreational inhalation of helium, but these are very rare from direct inhalation from small balloons. The inhalation from larger helium balloons has been reportedly fatal. A fatal fall from a tree occurred after the inhalation of helium from a toy balloon, which caused the person to become either unconscious or light headed.Lung ruptures and fatal gas embolisms have occurred from inhalation from a pressure tank and although this was reported as a helium inhalation death, it differs greatly from the process of inert gas asphyxiation. See gas embolism helium death In 2015, a technician at a health spa was asphyxiated while conducting unsupervised cryotherapy using nitrogen.  Suicide  Use of inert gas for suicide was first proposed by a Canadian, Dr Bruce Dunn.Dunn B, Nitrogen and other Inert Gases. In: Smith K, Docker C, Hofsess J, Dunn B, \\"Beyond Final Exit.\\" Published by the Right to Die Society of Canada 1995, pp.65-71. The book was distributed internationally by Canadian, American, and British organizations. See also Exit (Right-to-Die Organisation) Dunn commented that, \\"...the acquisition of a compressed gas cylinder, an appropriate pressure reducing regulator, and suitable administration equipment... [was] \\"not inaccessible to a determined individual, but relatively difficult for a member of the public to acquire casually or quickly.\\"\\"Dunn B, Beyond Final Exit, p.70. Dunn's work and other chapters from Beyond Final Exit was also publicised on the Canadian website (now offline) called DeathNET. C√¥te R, In Search of Gentle Death, Corinthian Books 2012, page 314. Dunn collaborated with other researchers, notably the Canadian campaigner, John Hofsess, who in 1997 formed the group \\"NuTech\\" with Derek Humphry and Philip Nitschke.See: Euthanasia device Two years later, NuTech had streamlined Dunn's work by using readily-available party balloon cylinders of helium.Humphry, Derek (2014). \\"Obtaining drugs via the internet and using helium hood kits\\". finalexit.org. The method of suicide based on self-administration of helium in a bag, a colloquial name being the \\"exit bag\\" or suicide bag, has been referenced by some medical euthanasia advocacy groups. Originally such bags were used with helium, and 30 deaths were reported with use of them from 2001 to 2005, and another 79 from 2005 to 2009. This suggested to one set of reviewers that the popularity of the technique was increasing, as also did the increase in helium suicides in Sweden during the latter half of the same decade. After attempts were made by authorities to control helium sales in Australia, a new method was introduced that instead uses nitrogen. Nitrogen became the main gas promoted by euthanasia advocates, such as Philip Nitschke, who founded a company called Max Dog Brewing in order to import canisters of nitrogen into Australia. Nitschke stated that the gas cylinders can be used for both brewing and, if required, to end life at a later stage in a \\"peaceful, reliable [and] totally legal\\" manner. Nitschke said, \\"[nitrogen] was undetectable even by autopsy, which was important to some people\\".  Capital punishment  Execution by nitrogen asphyxiation was discussed briefly in print as a theoretical method of capital punishment in a 1995 National Review article. The idea was then proposed by Lawrence J. Gist II, an attorney at law, under the title, International Humanitarian Hypoxia Project.International Humanitarian Hypoxia Project. gistprobono.org. In a televised documentary in 2007, the British political commentator and former MP Michael Portillo examined execution techniques in use around the world and found them unsatisfactory; his conclusion was that nitrogen asphyxiation would be the best method. In April 2015, Governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma signed a bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as an alternative execution method. Three years later, in March 2018, Oklahoma announced that, due to the difficulty in procuring lethal injection drugs, nitrogen gas will be used to carry out executions. In March 2018, Alabama became the third state (along with Oklahoma and Mississippi), to authorize the use of nitrogen asphyxiation as a method of execution. In the case Bucklew v. Precythe, decided 1 April 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a Missouri death row inmate could not avoid death by lethal injection and choose inert gas asphyxiation using nitrogen, since it has never been used in any execution in the world. After struggling for years to design a nitrogen execution protocol, Oklahoma announced in February 2020 it abandoned the project after finding a new reliable source of lethal injection drugs.

At that time, the observatory consisted of a dome housing a Newtonian telescope and small library. In 1974, a foyer and meeting hall accommodating 50 people was added. In 1997, a roll-off roof observatory and storeroom was added adjacent to the existing observatory. Soon afterwards, a C14 Schmidt Cassegrain telescope was added, along with CCD imaging equipment. The observatory was closed for much of 2007 as further additions were made. The two buildings were joined into one, the meeting hall was extended to seat 100 people, and a unisex toilet and library annexe were added.

He served as the National Legal Director of American Atheists from 2006 until his death in 2014. Personal life Edwin Kagin was born in Greenville, South Carolina, to a Presbyterian minister father who had been born in Kentucky and a Daughters of the American Revolution mother who had been born in South Carolina. His ancestry was German Calvinist on his father's side and Scottish Calvinist Presbyterian on his mother's‚Äîboth sides boasting numerous clerics. In youth Kagin became an Eagle Scout. In early adulthood he served in the United States Air Force as a medic in London, England, and received an Honorable Discharge in 1962. He then attended The College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio; Park College in Parkville, Missouri; and the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City. At the University of Louisville School of Law in Louisville, Kentucky, he earned his Juris Doctor. He was married to Helen McGregor Kagin, a Canadian of Scottish descent from Regina, Saskatchewan, who was a retired anesthesiologist. Helen died on February 17, 2010 following complications from cancer surgery. He died in 2014 at the age of 73 at his home in Union, Kentucky.http://www.courier- journal.com/story/news/2014/04/03/american-atheists-attorney-edwin-kagin- dies/7268017/ Career and activism Kagin worked for a time as a college English instructor and served as editor of the American Association of Mental Deficiency and National Institute for Mental Health project that created the Adaptive Behavior Scale, an instrument for the assessment of mental retardation. But the larger part of his career was as an attorney, sometimes focusing on civil liberties and constitutional issues. After abandoning belief in Christianity, Kagin became a freethought activist. He was a founding member in 1991 of the Free Inquiry Group, Inc., (FIG) of Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky and served as its vice president. Through his writings in Fig Leaves, the FIG newsletter, as well as those he published and circulated via the Internet, Kagin gradually became known in wider humanist and freethought circles. This led in 2003 to his authorship of a chapter in Kimberly Blaker's Fundamentals of Extremism: The Christian Right in America and in 2005 to his own book, Baubles of Blasphemy, a collection of some of his often irreverent essays and poetry. In 2003 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Kagin is the originator and was, for its first decade, Director of Camp Quest, the nation's first residential secular summer camp for children of Atheists and other freethinkers, started in 1996 by FIG. First incorporated in 1996 by Kagin and others as Camp Quest Company, Inc., restructuring was required by 2002. He was then an incorporator, and a founding board member, of Camp Quest, Inc., a national non-profit corporation established in 2002 to operate Camp Quest. In 2005, following ten successful years, he and his wife Helen retired from this venture, after transferring control and management of Camp Quest to other hands. That same year they were named \\"Atheists of the Year\\" by American Atheists. Kagin was also a founder and board member of Recover Resources Center, which provides an alternative addiction recovery program to the religiously-oriented Alcoholics Anonymous. He served on the national advisory board of the Secular Student Alliance and on January 13, 2006, was named national legal director for American Atheists, replacing the retiring Duane Buchholtz. In 2008, he was elected to the Board of Directors of American Atheists, a position he held until 2013. He was named as \\"Atheist of the Year\\" twice, first in 2005 with his wife and again in 2008. As an outspoken public critic of religious intrusions into government, Kagin was a frequent speaker and debater at local and national events and has appeared on hundreds of radio and television programs, sparring on more than one occasion with Michael Medved. Kagin also ran prominently, albeit unsuccessfully, as \\"the candidate without a prayer\\" for the Kentucky Supreme Court (1998) and the Kentucky State Senate (2000). Moreover, some of his legal work involved him in religious issues and church-state separation controversies in addition to other civil liberties and constitutional issues. He was a member of the bar of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1975 until his death. Kagin was a National Rifle Association Certified Handgun Instructor, an honorary Black belt in Kenpo karate, and an honorary Kentucky Colonel. He had four children, Stephen, Eric, Heather, and Kathryn, a stepdaughter, Caroline, and five grandchildren at the time of his death.

Life Struthers Burt grew up in Philadelphia and graduated from Princeton University in 1904. In 1908 he moved to Wyoming and founded, with Louis Joy, the JY Ranch, which would later become the famous Rockefeller Ranch of the same name. In 1912, following a dispute with Louis Joy, he established the Bar B C Ranch, a dude ranch. He met and married his wife, Katharine Newlin Burt, an author of Western novels, in the same year. Burt's son, Nathaniel Burt, was also a published writer as was his grandson, Christopher C. Burt. Burt was one of the people who led ultimately to the establishment of Grand Teton National Park when, in 1923, he met with other like-minded individuals at Maud Noble's cabin and began the process of gathering support to have the area come under protection by the Federal Government.

Tourism Huayna Picchu may be visited throughout the year, but the number of daily visitors allowed on Huayna Picchu is restricted to 400. There are two times that visitors may enter the Huayna Picchu Trail; entrance between 7:00‚Äì8:00 AM and another from 10:00‚Äì11:00 AM. The 400 permitted hikers are split evenly between the two entrance times. A steep and, at times, exposed pathway leads to the summit. Some portions are slippery and steel cables (a via ferrata) provide some support during the one-hour climb. The ascent is more challenging between November and April because the path up the mountain becomes slippery in the rainy season. Better conditions for climbing can be expected during the dry season, which runs from May to September. There are two trails in varying length that visitors can take to hike to the summit. The shorter trail takes approximately 45‚Äì60 minutes to reach the top, which the longer trail takes approximately 3 hours to the summit. From the summit, a second trail leads down to the Gran Caverna and what is known as the Temple of the Moon. These natural caves, on the northern face of the mountain, are lower than the starting point of the trail. The return path from the caves completes a loop around the mountain where it rejoins the main trail.

It is one of the most popular blended teas, common in British and Irish tea culture. English breakfast tea is a black tea blend usually described as full- bodied, robust, rich and blended to go well with milk and sugar, in a style traditionally associated with a hearty English breakfast. The black teas included in the blend vary, with Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan teas predominating, and Keemun sometimes included in more expensive blends.  Origins and history  of English breakfast tea Accounts of its origins vary. Drinking a blend of black teas for breakfast is a longstanding British and Irish custom. The term breakfast tea has been applied by vendors since at least the late 18th century. The practice of referring to such a blend as \\"English breakfast tea\\" is claimed to have originated not in England but America, as far back as Colonial times. An additional account (referencing a period-era Journal of Commerce article) dates the blend to 1843 and a tea merchant named Richard Davies in New York City. Davies, an English immigrant, started with a base of Congou and added a bit of Pekoe and Pouchong. It sold for 50 cents per (equivalent to $ per pound in ), and its success led to imitators, helping to popularize the name. An investigation to find the original Journal of Commerce article failed to locate it but did come upon an earlier reference to the same story in an 1876 edition of the Daily Alta California, citing \\"a New York commercial journal\\" and dating the tea's origin to 1844. In an 1884 American publication it was noted that \\"Bohea teas (are) known to trade in this country as \\"English Breakfast\\" tea, from its forming the staple shipment to England\\". In the UK, the popularisation of breakfast tea has been attributed in part to Queen Victoria. At Balmoral in 1892 she tasted and enjoyed a blend so-named and returned to London with a supply.

Background Andersen was born in Bergen, Norway, of parents Anders Andersen from L√¶rdal and Helene Monsine Monsen from Bergen. He emigrated as an infant with his family to Newport, Rhode Island the following year. As a young man in Newport, Andersen began his work as a sculptor and learned to mingle among the city's wealthy elite, including serving as an art instructor for Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney.1757 - 1855 - Newport Mansions at www.newportmansions.org In 1893, Andersen traveled to Europe to study art and eventually settled in Rome. There he ingratiated himself with other artists as well as a number of wealthy expatriate patrons and pursued his work.  The World City  Stone sculpture by Hendrik Andersen. Roma, Museo Andersen Andersen's sculpture, paintings and writings demonstrate a fondness for large monumental classically inspired pieces, which, he believed, stirred in the viewer a desire for self- improvement. Much of his work was done in contemplation of the single idea of designing a perfect \\"World City,\\" filled with art, which would motivate humanity to achieve a near-Utopian state. His urban planning philosophy is evident in his 1913 A World Center of Communication. This enormous tome (the text weighed over ten pounds) was written with Ernest H√©brard and grew out of Andersen's earlier writing, The Fountain of Life. Central to the work was Andersen's belief that art, more specifically monumental Beaux-Arts architecture, could bring about world peace and international harmony. The plan called for the creation of a central world capital. In his words, the city would be \\"a fountain of overflowing knowledge to be fed by the whole world of human endeavour in art, science, religion, commerce, industry, and law; and in turn to diffuse throughout the whole of humanity as though it were one grand, divine body conceived by God, the vital requirements which would renew its strength, protect its rights, and enable it to attain greater heights through a concentration of world effort.\\" Evident in the treatise is Andersen's philosophy that art could change humanity and produce perfection. While roundly criticized by urban planners of the time for its political na√Øvet√© coupled with an over-emphasis on the monumental, the work demonstrates an appreciation of the political and social conflicts necessitated by the rampant nationalism of the early 20th Century and sought to use art to bring about an Utopian world. Andersen's view of the power of art and architecture to transform society can be seen as a precursor to similar concepts advanced later in the 20th century by a variety of urban planners including Le Corbusier in his Contemporary City.  Relationship with Henry James  In 1899 Andersen met Henry James the American expatriate writer. Although James was almost 30 years his senior the two developed a close relationship that was to last until James' death in 1916. While the precise nature of the relationship is still unclear and may always be so‚Äîthe two actually met on just a few occasions, and then for only brief periods of time‚Äîthey exchanged numerous letters, which evidence a close, loving, homoerotic bond perhaps best illustrated by a letter from James to Andersen following the death of Andersen's brother, dated February 9, 1902 where James wrote: > The sense that I can't help you, see you, talk to you, touch you, hold you > close & long, or do anything to make you rest on me, & feel my deep > participation ‚Äì this torments me, dearest boy, makes me ache for you, & for > myself; makes me gnash my teeth & groan at the bitterness of things. ... > This is the one thought that relieves me about you a little - & I wish you > might fix your eyes on it for the idea, just, of the possibility. I am in > town for a few weeks, but return to Rye April 1st, & sooner or later to have > you there & do for you, to put my arm round you & make you lean on me as on > a brother & a lover, & keep you on & on, slowly comforted or at least > relieved of the bitterness of pain ‚Äì this I try to imagine as thinkable, > attainable, not wholly out of the question. Despite such affection, James lost patience with Andersen when the sculptor tried to interest him in the grandiose plans for the \\"World City.\\" In response to Andersen's request that James endorse such plans, the novelist wrote on September 4, 1913: > I simply loathe such pretentious forms of words as \\"World\\" anything‚Äîthey are > to me mere monstrous sound without sense. The World is a prodigious & > portentous & immeasurable affair, & I can't for a moment pretend to sit in > my little corner here & \\"sympathise with\\" proposals for dealing with it. It > is so far vaster in its appalling complexity than you or me, or than > anything we can pretend without the imputation of absurdity & insanity to do > to it, that I content myself, & inevitably must (so far as I can do anything > now) with living in the realities of things, with \\"cultivating my garden\\" > (morally & intellectually speaking) & with referring my questions to a > Conscience (my own poor little personal) less inconceivable than that of the > globe. In another letter of April 14, 1912, James warned Andersen that he was slipping into megalomania with his plans for the \\"World City.\\" Colm Toibin's 2004 novel The Master draws upon many sources to explore and give insight into beginnings of the James/Andersen relationship.  Museo Hendrik Christian Andersen  Andersen died in Rome in 1940. He bequeathed his home, studio, papers and more than 400 pieces of his work to the Italian Government. The home has been renovated and now is a museum located at Via Pasquale Stanislao Mancini, 20 (piazzale Flaminio). The Museum is open to the public Tuesday through Sunday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. and contains much of Andersen's work as well as that of other contemporary artists and photographers.

The Temple of the Moon dates back 1500 years.Miranda, Carolina, Aimee Dowl, Katy Shorthouse, Luke Waterson, Beth Williams. Lonely Planet Peru p.326. It was rediscovered in 1936. It lies below the summit on the north side of Huayna Picchu. Architecture Inca ruins near the cave The Temple of the Moon consists of three structural components: an overhanging cave with superb stonework, a very tall double-jamb doorway beyond, and farther beyond, several structures including one that again uses a cave.[The Machu Picchu Guidebook. A self guided tour. Ruth M Wright, Alfredo Valencia Zegarra, p158. ] The stone work in the Temple is said to contain the three planes of the Incan religion to be depicted: the Hanan Pacha (the heavens, or world of above), the Kay Pacha (the earth, or physical life), and the Ukju Pacha (the underworld, or world of below), represented respectively by the condor, the puma, and the snake.[6] The temple also boasts niches and fake doors inserted in the stones, with an enormous by entrance. The premises are rectangular with the rocks of the mountains as walls. Its three doors are 1.60 meters high (in the front) and 1.00 m high (at the sides). Inside, there are six trapezoidal niches. The \\"temple\\", strictly speaking, consists of a major platform supporting a building which is raised 5 meters above the ground, with an entrance. Huaca de la Luna (Temple of the Moon), contains 6 levels, built on top of the other during a 200-year span, according to Eyewitness travel guide.[Eyewitness travel guide. DK Publishing. p 223. ] Name Most scientists and authors believe that the name of the Temple is arbitrary, as many other names given to sites in Machu Picchu. Guidebook writers Ruth M Wright and Alfredo Valencia Zegarra say that they have found no indication that the lunar ritual played any part in the use of this shrine.The Machu Picchu Guidebook. A self guided tour Some have speculated that the temple gets its name from the way moonlight radiates inside the cave at night. Purpose The purpose of building of the Temple is not exactly known. Scientists have long known and documented that people lived in caves. Keeping in mind that caves, like springs, were thought to be entrances for gods, they believe the Temple's purpose was to be a place of worship to the Gods. There is a theory that it must have been a royal tomb, place of worship and look-out post. Some believe that this was a place for sacrifices, because the structure has beautiful vaulted niches and empty trapezoids of typical Inca type and in front of the cavern, there is a rock sculpted in the shape of an altar. Others think Temple of the Moon was a ceremonial bathing complex.[Eyewitness travel guide. DK Publishing.p114, ] Access The trail that leads from the summit of Huayna Picchu to the Temple and the Great Cave is very exposed and can be quite slippery. A few spots have a steel handrail cable (a via ferrata), but a fall in many places would have severe results. The trail that leads off from the main Huayna Picchu trail near the saddle is easier and safer, but still presents hazards. Expect at least a 45-minute walk in each direction from this lower trail, and at least an hour from the summit down the alternate trail to the ruins, plus the 45-minute walk back uphill and to the main trail.

It is located about 6 kilometres away from Kinabalu National Park, 12 kilometres from Ranau town and is renowned for its vegetable market which is open seven days a week. It is the closest town to Mount Kinabalu and has a panoramic view of the Mountain. It is populated mainly by the native Dusun and a small population of Chinese people. Almost all the shops are operated by locals. At an elevation of almost 1,900m (6,200ft), it is the highest settlement in Malaysia.  Kundasang War Memorial and Gardens  A memorial for the Australian Army during the Death Marches in Kundasang War Memorial. The memorial is on a hill immediately behind the vegetable wholesale stalls. Major G. S. Carter, D.S.O. (Toby Carter) a New Zealander employed with Shell Oil Co. (Borneo) initiated the building of the Memorial in 1962, together with the launching of Kinabalu Park to commemorate the 2,428 Australian and British prisoners who died during World War II at the Sandakan POW Camp, and the casualties of the three infamous forced death marches from Sandakan to Ranau. It also serves as a tribute to the many local people who risked their lives while aiding the prisoners of war. Only six Australians survived in this tragedy to tell their horror and there were no English survivors. The fort-like Memorial was designed by J.C. Robinson, a local architect. It has four interlocking but separate gardens to represent the homelands of those who died: an Australian Garden, a formal English Garden of roses, a Borneo Garden with wild flowers of Kinabalu and at the top level is the 'Contemplation Garden' with a reflection pool and pergola. To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, the Memorial was restored in 2005 by Mr Sevee Charuruks and with his own personal funds. No government funding was available during the major restoration project in 2005. However, years later help came from the Australian Government in the form of several grants. The Australian Government Grants aided in: * The building of a perimeter fence around the Memorial. The Estimated grant: RM$120,000 * The building of the Australian Memorial Hall to enable visitors to view WW2 Documentary Films. The Estimated grant: RM$350,000 * The Demolishment & Re- construction of concrete wall of Contemplation Garden. The Estimated grant: RM$120,000 * The Construction of Confrontation Memorial. The Estimated grant: RM$14,000 In recognition of his hard work and commitment to the Kundasang War Memorial, in 2007 Queen Elizabeth II awarded Mr Charuruks the MBE (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire). Later in 2012, the Australian Government awarded Mr Charuruks the Member of the Order of Australia (AM). The Gardens have been replanted with flowers, particularly roses and rare orchids that include the Paphiopedilum rothschildianum (Rothschild's slipper orchid). The Memorial is open to all visitors not only to view the gardens but to remember those who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of others. ANZAC Memorial Services and private Memorial Services are welcomed with prior arrangements. The Memorial is open to visitors with minimal entrance fees charged. An access road with ramp allows easy access for wheelchair bound visitors.  Vegetable wholesale stalls  Fruits such as rambutan, salak, oranges and lemons can also be found at the vegetable stalls in Kundasang. Beside the main road vegetables wholesalers can be found in a long row of wooden stalls (Malay: gerai). Bulk buyers come from all over the state of Sabah, Sarawak and even Brunei for the fresh harvest. Pick up trucks are seen laden fully with harvest from the farms nearby the valley and delivered to the stalls. Passing tourists and travellers also stop by the road for shopping at a good bargain with the stalls are open seven days a week.

Gardner, a Know Nothing, was elected governor as part of the sweeping victory of Know Nothing candidates in the Massachusetts elections of 1854. Born in Dorchester, Gardner was a dry goods merchant from Boston active in the local Whig Party in the early 1850s. With the sudden and secretive rise of the nativist Know Nothings in 1854, Gardner opportunistically repudiated previously-held positions, and joined the movement, winning a landslide victory over Whig Emory Washburn. During his three terms in office the Know Nothing legislatures enacted legislation on a wide-ranging reform agenda, and made several significant changes to the state constitution, including important electoral reforms such as the replacement of majority voting with plurality voting. The Know Nothing movement began to disintegrate not long after its 1854 victory, dividing over slavery. Gardner won reelection in 1856 only with Republican support, given in exchange for Know Nothing support for the Republican presidential candidate, John Fr√©mont. Republican Nathaniel Prentice Banks easily defeated Gardner in 1857, and the Know Nothing movement effectively dissolved. By 1860 Gardner had left politics and returned to his business interests; he died in relative obscurity. Early life Henry Joseph Gardner was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts (then a community separate from Boston) on June 14, 1819, to Henry Gardner and Clarissa Holbrook Gardner.Roberts, p. 263 His grandfather, also named Henry Gardner, was a well-respected Harvard graduate, was politically active during the American Revolution and served as the state's treasurer 1774‚Äì82.Palmer, pp. 169‚Äì170 The younger Henry was first educated in private schools in the Boston area, and then attended Phillips Exeter Academy, from which he graduated in 1831. He then attended Bowdoin College,Wright et al, p. 101 and embarked on a career as a dry goods merchant in Boston, a business in which he remained until 1876. In 1844 he married Helen Cobb of Portland, Maine; they had seven children.Rand, p. 243 Entry into politics Emory Washburn, the incumbent Whig governor, lost the 1854 election. In 1850 Gardner, politically a Whig, was elected to the Boston City Council, serving until 1853. He was a moderately conservative Websterite Whig who was involved in the state party organization, serving on its central organizing committee. In 1854 he broke with the Whigs over their support of the pro-slavery Kansas-Nebraska Act, and became involved in the nativist Know Nothing movement.Anbinder, p. 91 This shift in position was fairly radical on Gardner's part, and was viewed by contemporaries and recent historians as politically opportunist.Mulkern, p. 96 Prior to joining the Know Nothings he had not displayed any nativist sentiments, and had even supported an Irish American in a bid to become justice of the peace. He also switched from a moderate Websterite position on slavery to an abolitionist stance, and supported positions on prohibition of alcohol that he had previously opposed. The Whig statesman Edward Everett described Gardner as \\"a man of some cleverness, but no solidity of character.\\"Gienapp, p. 136 The Know Nothing convention in October 1854 chose Gardner as its gubernatorial candidate,Anbinder, p. 90 in part because his stand on slavery was not as radical as that of Republican candidate Henry Wilson, who was also seeking Know Nothing support. Wilson eventually made a deal with the Know Nothings, withdrawing from the race at the last moment in exchange for Know Nothing support in a United States Senate bid. The campaign was relatively sedate, because both the Whigs and Democrats did not organize large-scale events. The larger parties may have been concerned that rallies would be poorly attended due to defections to the Know Nothings. The aristocratic Whigs fielded incumbent governor Emory Washburn to stand for reelection. They were particularly dismissive of the Know Nothings: one commentator described the Know Nothing ticket as \\"spavined ministers, lying toothpullers, and buggering priests\\" who were led by \\"that rickety vermin of a Henry J. Gardner.\\"Mulkern, p. 75 Gardner was, however, optimistic, warning one journalist that he would win by a large majority. The election was a landslide: Gardner won 79% of the vote, and the state legislature and Congressional delegation were almost entirely populated by Know Nothings.Anbinder, p. 92 Governor of Massachusetts The legislature elected in the Know Nothing sweep was unlike any that preceded it: almost all of its members were new to elected office. The 1855 session was one of the most productive in the state's history, with about 600 bills and resolutions passed. In his inaugural address, Gardner set what he hoped was a tone that would solidify his position has the party leader. The speech focused almost to exclusion on nativist issues, and included hyperbolic claims that the level of immigration was reaching crisis proportions. Gardner notably omitted popular substantive reform issues such as the ten-hour workday, and also avoided the contentious subject of slavery.Mulkern, pp. 95‚Äì96, 107 Reforms The 1855 legislature passed a wide variety of reform legislation, most of which Gardner signed. A board of insurance with broad powers of inspection was created; bankruptcy laws were changed to benefit lower-class individuals; imprisonment for debt was abolished. Vaccinations were mandated for all school children, women were given the right to own property on their own, and exempted from responsibility for their husbands' debts; and restrictions were placed on child labor. Schools were desegregated, a reform school for girls was established, and state funding was withdrawn from parochial schools.Formisano, pp. 332‚Äì333 Cities and towns were authorized to engage in a wide variety of civic improvements, including the building of highways, gas, water, and sewer lines, and public transport facilities such as docks and wharves.Mulkern, p. 109 One of the major reforms that was not enacted, despite vigorous debate, was legislation calling for a ten-hour workday.Formisano, p. 340 Several amendments to the state constitution were enacted during Gardner's term. All of them originated in the 1853 constitutional convention, whose proposals, although popular, were poorly organized and defeated in a popular referendum. Plurality voting, which had previously been enacted legislatively to apply to federal elections, was extended to state elections. More state executive offices were made elective, including the Governor's Council, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Auditor, and Treasurer. The state's rules for districting were reformed so that they were based on districts drawn by population instead of by towns.Formisano, pp. 334‚Äì335 One reform that was immediately a subject of controversy was a harsh prohibition law, which criminalized the service of a glass of grog with a six-month jail sentence. The bill, signed into law by Gardner, was immediately protested, and legislators who passed it were later criticized for charging bar tabs to the state when they traveled.Mulkern, pp. 101‚Äì102 Nativist issues Some legislation and executive action was squarely aimed at addressing nativist concerns. So-called \\"foreign\\" militia, composed of Irish immigrants, were disbanded, and foreigners were not allowed in police forces or state government jobs.Formisano, p. 334 The state deported more than 1,000 allegedly indigent aliens, inciting protest over abuses. One notable case involved the deportation to Liverpool of a woman with an American-born infant without any means of support. Gardner reported that the state saved $100,000 by this process.Mulkern, p. 103 The most scandalous aspect of the nativist agenda was the legislature's investigation of alleged abuses in Roman Catholic boarding houses. Joseph Hiss, one of the principal investigators, was reported to have made lewd remarks to nuns in these establishments, and was later found to engage in drinking and the hiring of prostitutes. The scandal received a great deal of press and badly tarnished the Know Nothings.Voss-Hubbard (2002), p. 170 Slavery Before Gardner's election, on May 24, 1854, Anthony Burns was arrested in Boston as a fugitive under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.Von Frank, p. 1 Edward G. Loring, a Suffolk County probate judge who also served as U.S. commissioner of the Circuit Court in Massachusetts, ordered that Burns be forced back into slavery in Virginia, outraging abolitionists and the increasingly antislavery public in Massachusetts. Under the pressure of a public petition campaign spearheaded by William Lloyd Garrison, the legislature passed two Bills of Address, in 1855 and 1856, calling for Judge Loring to be removed from his state office, but in both cases Gardner declined to remove Loring. A third Bill of Address to remove Loring from office was later approved by Gardner's Republican successor, Nathaniel Prentice Banks.Voss-Hubbard (1995), pp. 173‚Äì174 The Know-Nothing legislature also passed, over Gardner's veto, one of the most stringent personal liberty laws, designed to make enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 as difficult for slave claimants as possible.Voss-Hubbard (2002), p. 172 Gardner said that the law would exacerbate relations between North and South, and called for its repeal.Voss-Hubbard (1995), p. 173 Minority parties in the legislature sought to weaken the bill, but its major provisions, including rights of habeas corpus, jury trial, and state-funded defense, survived.Voss-Hubbard (1995), pp. 175‚Äì177 Later elections Nathaniel Prentice Banks, a former Know Nothing, defeated Gardner in 1857. In 1855 the national Know Nothing convention split on the subject of slavery. Prominent antislavery Know Nothing supporters in Massachusetts, including Henry Wilson, began another attempt (after having failed in 1854) to form a party with abolition as a major focus.Duberman, pp. 364‚Äì365 This effort resulted in the formation of the Republican Party, which sought to negotiate with the Know Nothings for a fusion of the two parties. However, Massachusetts Know Nothing leadership refused fusion and Republican leadership refused coalition,Duberman, p. 366 with many Republicans skeptical of Gardner's fidelity to the antislavery cause despite his support for fusion.Duberman, p. 367 The parties ended up fielding separate slates of candidates, and many Know Nothing politicians and supporters switched allegiance. In the fall election Gardner, running on a strictly nativist platform, garnered 38% of the vote, to the 27% of Republican Julius Rockwell. With the new plurality voting rule in effect, Gardner won the election,Duberman, pp. 368‚Äì369 but the split (and disaffection in some circles with the Know Nothing agenda) cost him support from former Free Soilers and Democrats.Baum, pp. 966‚Äì967 In the 1856 election Gardner benefited from a deal with the Republicans, who refused to run a candidate for governor in exchange for Know Nothing support for their presidential candidate, John C. Fr√©mont. He easily won reelection, although many Republicans voted for a protest candidate instead of supporting him.Baum, pp. 968‚Äì969 He attempted to parlay the Republican support into an election to the United States Senate (a matter then decided by the state senate early in its session) replacing Charles Sumner. However, Republican operatives maneuvered the Senate into voting before Gardner's speech opening the 1857 session, and Sumner was easily reelected.Donald. pp. 320‚Äì322 Although the nation was wracked by the Panic of 1857 and Bleeding Kansas, the election in Massachusetts that year hinged on other factors. Gardner was opposed by Republican (and former Know Nothing) Nathaniel Prentice Banks and Democrat Erasmus Beach. Gardner was accused of having become little more than a tool of the formerly Whig industrial interests, and Banks was adept at bringing many former Know Nothings into his camp, most importantly John Z. Goodrich who attested to Banks' strong antislavery credentials. Gardner sought to focus the contests on local issues, but slavery predominated as an issue,Stampp, p. 242 and Banks won a comfortable victory.Hollandsworth, p. 35 In 1858 Gardner sought to bring what remained of the Know Nothings into a coalition with the Democrats, but his attempts to find a suitable candidate were unsuccessful. That year's Know Nothing candidate, Amos A. Lawrence, trailed well behind Banks.Baum, pp. 972‚Äì973 Later life Gardner continued in his dry goods business until 1876, and became an agent for the Massachusetts Life Insurance Company in 1887. He died in Milton, Massachusetts on July 21, 1892. In the 1850s he was recognized by Harvard University with honorary degrees,Annual Report of Harvard University, 1854‚Äì1855, p. 53 and he was made a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company in 1855.

Diplomatic Career In 1847 St John's father, the journalist James Augustus St. John, introduced him to James Brooke. He went out to Sarawak the following year to become Brooke's private secretary and thus began his diplomatic career. He was British Consul General in Brunei from 1856 and in 1858 made two ascents of Mount Kinabalu with Hugh Low. One of the peaks of Mount Kinabalu, \\"St John's Peak\\" (4,091 m ‚Äì 4 metres shorter than the summit, \\"Low's Peak\\"), is named in his honour.

Career Dillingham was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, becoming a Fellow there in 1594. He was appointed to the \\"First Cambridge Company\\", charged by James I of England with translating parts of the Old Testament for the King James Version of the Bible. He was renowned for his mastery of the Greek language and wrote several theological treatises, including a Manual of the Christian Faith. Francis Dillingham was the eldest son of Walter Dillingham (died 1581), yeoman of Over Dean, who was himself a son of John and Joan Dillingham. In his nuncupative will, Walter mentions his wife Ales or Alice, and his father-in-law, Thomas Rolte. Francis Dillingham, who rates an entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, although this does not recognise his parentage or his maternal connection with the Roltes, was baptised at Dean, Bedfordshire, as the son of Walter, on 15 August 1568. After completing his education at Christ's College, Cambridge, Francis was put forward by his uncle, John Rolte, as Rector of Wilden, Bedfordshire, in 1601. The Roltes were from a branch of the Milton-Ernest family, which held Wilden Manor for 200 years. Walter's marriage into the family was a social advance. Francis was a prolific writer on religious themes and a member of the committee of divines appointed by James I to produce the 1611 translation of the Bible.

The Old Rotation experiment, which started in 1896, is the third-oldest ongoing field crop experiment in the United States and the oldest continuous cotton experiment in the world. It was the first experiment to show that a cotton/legume crop rotation would allow soil to support a cotton crop indefinitely. The Old Rotation is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History For much of the latter part of the 19th century, cotton yields in the Southern United States suffered declines caused by planting the same crop on the same land year after year, a process which caused significant soil nutrient loss. In 1896, Professor J. F. Duggar of the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College set up the Old Rotation experiment on a one-acre (1,600 m¬≤) plot of land one mile (1.6 km) south of the campus to test whether soil nutrient levels could be maintained by growing a crop of legumes on the same land as cotton, but in the winter months when cotton doesn't grow. This rotation of cotton and soybeans has continued uninterrupted since. In addition to the cotton/legume rotation, additional rotations have been added in adjacent plots consisting of a cotton/corn, cotton/corn/legume and cotton/corn/legume/soybean rotation. It became evident within a few years that adding the winter legume crop as a rotation was sufficient to restore adequate nutrients to the soil to maintain a yearly cotton crop indefinitely. See also: Experiment The Old Rotation consists of 13 plots of six planting systems: * A control test where cotton is planted without rotation or fertilizer * Cotton rotated with winter legumes but not fertilized * Cotton just fertilized * Cotton rotated with corn and winter legumes * Cotton rotated with corn, winter legumes, and fertilizer * Cotton rotated with corn, winter legumes, and soybeans After 110 years of continuous plantings, cotton yields remain high for the rotated plots, producing nearly three times the yield of the unrotated plots. Miscellaneous The Old Rotation is located adjacent to the Donald E. Davis Arboretum on Lem Morrison Drive in Auburn. The Rotation was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1988.

It is a smaller adaptation of traditional Cape Cod catboat designs originally intended for fishing in shallow waters.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 18-19. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The basic design has been widely copied and built under many names in the US and other countries. Production The design was initially built by the designer's company, the Beetle Boat Co in New Bedford, Massachusetts, United States. Following the end of the Second World War, the owner of the company at that time was Carl N. Beetle, the son of designer John Beetle. Wanting to concentrate on newer materials for boat manufacturing, he sold the Beetle Cat design rights to the Concordia Company, a company that builds a series of traditional yawls. The design was later passed to Howard Boats of Barnstable, Massachusetts, who still provide parts and repairs for the boat, although they no longer produce new boats. The design was also built in Marans, Charente- Maritime, France by Construction Navale Franck Roy. The current manufacturer is Beetle, Inc. of Wareham, Massachusetts, which operates under the trade name of the Beetle Boat Shop. More than 4,000 examples of the design have been built. Design The Beetle Cat is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly with oak and cedar wooden construction, although some have been built from fiberglass, with wood trim. The deck is canvas-covered. It has a gaff-rigged catboat sailplan with wooden spars of fir, a spooned plumb stem, a near-vertical transom, a shallow depth, transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable centerboard daggerboard. It displaces , has a wide beam for load carrying capacity. The boat has a draft of with the centreboard/daggerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing operation in very shallow waters, beaching or ground transportation on a trailer. The design has no seats. In light winds it is sailed sitting on the cockpit sole and in higher winds on the gunwale. The mainsail is sheeted to a rod-type mainsheet traveler on the transom. The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 103.8. For racing it is normally sailed with a crew of two. Operational history Notable owners of Beetle Cats include John Kerry, Jacqueline Onassis, who had one shipped to Greece in 1969 for John F. Kennedy Jr. and Caroline Kennedy to learn to sail in, Steven Spielberg and Calvin Klein. In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"Look for the Beetle Cat on the south and east of Cape Cod, in Buzzards Bay, and in Narragansett Bay. There are also fleets on Long Island. Competition, especially for juniors, is stiff. The Beetle is an excellent, stable training boat.\\" Reviewing the design in 2007, naval architect Robert Perry, wrote \\"Beetle Cats are true to the traditional Cape Cod catboat model. They are fat and heavy. They have no overhangs. The strange-looking rudder is designed to give you control in a very shoal-draft boat. Unfortunately, this puts the center of pressure on the rudder blade way aft which exaggerates any helm pressure. The stern is broad. The mast is in the eye of the bow.\\" He summarized it as a \\"sturdy, traditional catboat with a lively personality.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types ReferencesExternal links * Category:Dinghies Category:1920s sailboat type designs ","title":"Beetle Cat"},{"id":"3803362","text":"Blood Bath is a 1966 American horror film directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman and starring William Campbell, Linda Saunders, Marissa Mathes, and Sid Haig. The film concerns a mad painter of weird art who turns into a vampire- like man (with different features) by night, apparently as a result of a family curse, and believes that he has found his reincarnated mistress in the person of an avant-garde ballerina. Blood Bath had a complex and troubled production history, marked by various cuts and reshoots. In 1963 Roger Corman had co-produced a Yugoslavia-made spy thriller called Operation: Titian, but the film was deemed unreleasable. Corman purchased the rights to another film and assigned writer-director Jack Hill to write a new script. This time, it was a horror film that incorporated the previous footage from Operation: Titian. Hill wrote and directed numerous horror sequences that were edited into the film, and it was re-titled Portrait in Terror. Still unsatisfied with the completed product, Corman hired Stephanie Rothman to film additional sequences that were also added. This cobbled-together feature was given a brief theatrical release by American International Pictures under the title Blood Bath, with screenplay and directorial credit jointly shared by Hill and Rothman. An additional version of the film was made for television and re- titled Track of the Vampire. Plot In an unidentified locale, art student and model Daisy leaves a club alone after having an argument with her beatnik boyfriend Max. Walking through the deserted streets, she stops to admire some gruesome paintings in a gallery window painted by artist Antonio Sordi, who coincidentally also comes by to look in on his \\"lost children.\\" After a friendly conversation, they return to Sordi's studio in a room beneath an old bell tower, where Sordi convinces the young woman to pose for him. There, however, Sordi is possessed by the spirit of a long-dead ancestor and suddenly transforms into a vampiric monster who hacks the screaming Daisy to death with a cleaver, then lowers her mutilated corpse into a vat of boiling substance. In his vampiric form, Sordi has already killed a lone woman in the town square, then takes her to a nearby car and feigns kissing her so that a pair of oncoming pedestrians assume they are just lovers sharing an intimate moment. Another victim is approached at a party, chased into a swimming pool, and drowned there after the other guests have moved into the house. The murdered women are carried back to Sordi's studio and painted by the artist, their bodies then covered in wax. Because his vampiric self looks nothing like Sordi, facially, no one connects him with the rash of murders. Max wants to make up with Daisy but cannot find her anywhere. After recognizing her as the model in Sordi's painting of her, which is now on display at a local beatnik cafe, he goes to see her sister, Donna. Donna tells Max she hasn't seen Daisy for days, and is concerned about the recent rash of disappearances. She reads Max the legend of Sordi's 15th-century ancestor Erno, a painter condemned to be burned at the stake for capturing his subjects' souls on canvas and being a vampire. Unable to convince Max that Antonio Sordi might also be a vampire, she confronts the artist at his studio and asks him if he has seen Daisy. He angrily brushes her off. That night, he later follows her through the streets and murders her as she tries to escape from him on a carousel. The \\"human\\" Sordi is in love with Dorian, an avant-garde ballerina, Daisy's former roommate and a lookalike for both Donna and a former love, Meliza, the loss of whom may have driven him mad. At first he tries to protect her from his vampiric tendencies, warning her his studio is a cheerless place and at one point breaking a date with her to spend time gaining control of himself after murdering Daisy. But one day at the beach, she reveals her attraction to him and asks him to make love to her. He tries, but panics and runs away. As Dorian leaves the beach, she then is approached by the vampiric Sordi, who chases her back to town, where she is rescued by Max and two of his beatnik friends. They pursue the vampire while Dorian, shaken, and unaware the vampire is really Sordi, proceeds to the bell tower to try to get understanding why he fled from her. Sordi returns and finds Dorian in his studio. He madly enmeshes her in some netting, then comes at her with a knife, apparently believing she is really Meliza. But before he can harm her, numerous wax figures on the floor of the studio begin to move, come alive, and kill him. Max and his friends arrive, break in, and free Dorian. CastProduction=Operation: Titian In 1963, while on vacation in Europe, Roger Corman made a $20,000 deal to distribute an as-yet unproduced Yugoslavian espionage thriller titled Operacija Ticijan/Operation: Titian. Corman also insisted on involvement in the production to ensure it could be adequately ‚ÄúAmericanized‚Äù, and provided two well-known English-speaking cast members, William Campbell and Patrick Magee for lead roles. In addition, Francis Ford Coppola, then fresh out of \\"film school\\" and formerly associated with Corman in the Americanization of Nebo Zovyot, was installed as the production‚Äôs script supervisor. Unfortuantely, the completed film was deemed unreleasable by Corman, although a redubbed, slightly re-edited version would eventually be released directly to television under the title Portrait in Terror. Reconception as Blood Bath Meanwhile, in 1964, Corman asked director Jack Hill to salvage the film. Hill wrote numerous new principal scenes, and filmed them in Venice, California, in order to match the original movie‚Äôs European look, and turned the former spy thriller into a horror movie about a crazed madman who kills his models and makes sculptures out of their dead bodies. Campbell was available for the reshoots but insisted on a sizeable paycheck to appear in the film, reportedly angering Corman, who nonetheless agreed to the actor‚Äôs demands. Hill added all of the beatnik-related scenes shot with Sid Haig and Jonathan Haze, and was responsible for what many fans believe is the single most effective sequence in the film, the hatchet murder of Melissa Mathes. Magee‚Äôs role was more or less retained intact in this version. However, the resulting film, now titled Blood Bath, was not released, as Corman once again was unhappy with the results. In 1966, Corman made another attempt to create a workable film from the footage already shot. He hired another director, Stephanie Rothman, to change the story as she saw fit. While retaining much of Hill‚Äôs material, she changed the plot from a story about a deranged, murderous artist to a story about a deranged, murderous artist who is also a vampire. Because Campbell refused to participate in yet another reshoot, Rothman was forced to use a completely different actor (unidentified) for the new vampire scenes. This meant Rothman now had to provide the Campbell character with the ability to magically transform his physical shape whenever he turned into a vampire, in order to explain why the vampire-killer looked nothing like Campbell. Other complications including bringing Sid Haig back for re-shoots; at the time of shooting with Hill, he did not have a beard, but had grown one for the subsequent project he was working on. This explains the continuity errors concerning his facial hair in the film. In spite of the inconsistencies in the finished product's plot, created by Rothman's new ideas, and the fact that the two principle female characters are played by actresses who look remarkably alike, this was this version of the film that most pleased Corman, and it was subsequently released to theatres by American International Pictures, retaining Hill's Blood Bath title. Both Hill and Rothman were credited as co-directors. Hill later claimed that Rothman's changes \\"totally ruined\\" the film.Jack Hill on Blood Bath at Trailers From Hell A fifth version of the film exists, entitled Track of the Vampire. Because Rothman's Blood Bath ran 62 minutes, which was deemed too short for television showings, further footage was filmed, including a six- minute sequence showing Linda Saunders dancing non-stop on the beach. This version of the film was shown often on late-night television. Commenting on the film's convoluted history, Hill stated: Release Blood Bath debuted in cinemas in March 1966 through American International Pictures, and was screened as a double feature with Queen of Blood (1966), written and directed by Curtis Harrington and co-produced by Rothman. Critical response Michael Weldon, in his Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, called Blood Bath ‚Äúa confusing but interesting horror film with an even more confusing history. Phil Hardy‚Äôs The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror noted, ‚ÄúCheap and crude, with echoes of a dozen movies ranging from Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) to A Bucket of Blood (1959), this film isn‚Äôt unenjoyable.\\"Hardy, Phil (editor). The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror, Aurum Press, 1984. Reprinted as The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Horror, Overlook Press, 1995, Cavett Binion of AllMovie wrote, \\"As one might imagine, this is pretty difficult to follow, but there are some good performances -- particularly from William Campbell as the haunted shutterbug -- and some fairly suspenseful scenes.\\" In 1991, Video Watchdog magazine devoted lengthy articles in three separate issues fully detailing the production history of the film. These articles included interviews with Hill and Campbell, the latter of whom expressed shock when he was told that the film he had shot so long ago in Yugoslavia had been turned into five individual movies. Clayton Dillard of Slant Magazine awarded the film four out of five stars, writing: \\"Purely as a film, Blood Bath expectedly turns out to be a mash-up of styles and tones, with surrealist flourishes (a tracking shot focused on Sordi in the wide-open California desert) juxtaposing routine scenes of women being lured to the villain‚Äôs lair. Everything within it is odd, from rampant continuity errors, to unintelligible footage of shadowy figures from the preceding films interspersed throughout.\\" Home media The film was released on DVD in 2011 through Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's \\"Limited Edition Collection,\\" which are made-on-demand discs. In May 2016, the film was released on Blu-ray in a limited edition two-disc set by Arrow Films. It features four versions of the film restored from the original negatives: the original Operation: Titian; Portrait in Terror; Blood Bath featuring Stephanie Rothman's re-shoots; and Track of the Vampire. Hill's version of Blood Bath seems to be lost.

WZAP is owned and operated by Charles Lawson, through licensee Awaken Broadcasting Inc. History The station was founded by Appalachian Broadcasting, a consortium of local businessmen, in December 1946 under the call sign WCYB. The station's initial format was country music, including such notable acts as the Stanley Brothers. Appalachian Broadcasting signed on WCYB-TV in 1956. In 1969, Appalachian's owners decided to retire. The FCC had by this time barred common ownership of television and radio stations, so the radio station was sold to another local businessman, James Ayers, who changed the call letters to WZAP. Ayers died in 1975, and in 1976 his estate sold the station to general manager Al Morris and his company, RAM Communications. Prior to the dominance of FM radio, WZAP was the number one station in the Tri-Cities TN/VA market, playing country/western music with a personality-DJ format. The station switched to its current Southern gospel format in 1982. Some key on-air personnel over the years included Glenn Harlow, Dave Ray, Matt Stevens, Douglas \\"D.K.\\" Smith, Ray Hutchins, Greg Hutchins, and Ed Spiegel.

When the truss section was completed, engineers floated the span on its barges down the river. The bridge was positioned higher than the supports so it could be brought into place.

The railroad offers a narrow gauge excursion train for zoo visitors hauled by a steam locomotive. The train loads passengers at two stations within the zoo. Annual ridership of the Omaha Zoo Railroad is over 200,000 people. History The Omaha Zoo Railroad was one of the first major attractions added after the zoo's 1963 re-incorporation as the Henry Doorly Zoo. As part of its centennial celebration, the Omaha-based Union Pacific Railroad decided to sponsor the construction of a ridable miniature railroad at the zoo. The zoo's railroad initially had just over of narrow gauge track (roughly half the width of standard mainline railroad tracks) in the form of a twisted oval with a connecting track through the middle. Two wyes (Y-shaped track arrangements enabling the train to reverse direction) were constructed at the intersections of the connecting track and the main oval. The track was laid using rail from the Union Pacific's Encampment branch in Wyoming. Due to the hilly terrain of the zoo's riverside location, grades of up to 6% (for most railroads 2% is considered steep) were required and some of the curves were well under in radius. Track crews from the Union Pacific were brought in to lay the track, and operation commenced on July 22, 1968 under the supervision of UP Roadmaster Robert Kovar. Fitting for a railroad attraction sponsored by the Union Pacific, the Omaha Zoo Railroad was initially themed after the UP's First Transcontinental Railroad route, for which Omaha was the eastern terminus. Passengers boarded at the \\"Omaha train depot\\" located in the Aksarben Nature Kingdom (today known as Red Barn Park) and rode to \\"Promontory Junction\\" at the south end of the zoo's lagoon, where they had the option of disembarking at the small depot and catching a later train back to Omaha. The ride also featured a climb up the 6% grade of \\"Sherman Hill\\", named for the Union Pacific's own grade over the continental divide in Wyoming. The steam locomotive was painted and decorated to resemble Union Pacific's No. 119, the famous locomotive used in the laying of the real \\"Golden spike\\" marking the transcontinental line's completion, and the four coaches were given names significant to the UP's history. The UP influence was perhaps most evident in the Omaha Zoo Railroad's logo: a Union Pacific shield with a smiling tiger superimposed over it. Though the direct references to Union Pacific place names have faded over the years, UP's support of the zoo railroad has remained strong. For years the train equipment was trucked to the Union Pacific's Omaha shops for winter maintenance, and when the shops closed much of the machinery was donated to build a new shop on site at the zoo. The Union Pacific Engine House, as this building is called, was dedicated in July 1994. Union Pacific crews continue to maintain the crossing signals along the zoo railroad's route. During the 1970s the Omaha Zoo Railroad and the zoo as a whole saw large increases in attendance. Especially on the weekends, it became evident that the original four car train could not provide the needed capacity, and a search was begun for a second train. By chance, a small tank locomotive of Austrian Heritage named \\"Riva\\" was found in Romania and its owner, Plasser & Theurer, was willing to donate it to the zoo. The locomotive was restored in the UP's shops and entered service at the zoo in 1976, together with two extra cars that were purchased to augment the original four. Kenefick Station was added in 1981 allowing guests to board the train closer to the zoo's main entrance. In late 2014, the Kenefick station was demolished and the track was shortened to make room for plans of a new exhibit. (African Grasslands) A new Kenefick Station was opened in 2015, across the visitor pathway from the African Lodge. In the early years the train commonly ran figure eights through the zoo using the connecting track and often reversed direction on the wyes. This practice ended in the early 1970s due to the need for faster turnarounds and the new locomotive's inability to negotiate a tight curve on the north (Bailey) wye. The connecting track lay idle for two decades before finally being removed in the mid-1990s, retaining a short section of track on the western side, and a wye at the eastern end, which were used for storing railcars not in use. These last remnants of the connecting trackage were removed in 2016, with new sidings for storing rolling stock installed just beyond the Omaha depot. Today the trains circle the park in a clockwise direction, covering roughly and taking 15‚Äì20 minutes on each circuit. The Promontory Junction Station was abandoned in the early 1990s. Beginning in 2010, both trains have operated simultaneously on busy weekends allowing more frequent departures from the two stations.  Omaha Zoo Railroad Trains  Engine 119, original locomotive of the Omaha Zoo Railroad Visitors to the Henry Doorly Zoo ride behind one of three locomotives for the trip around the park. Two of the engines are steam locomotives, and though they are similar in the basic principle of their operation, the two locomotives are otherwise quite different and guests can easily distinguish between them. The third engine is a diesel, which operates very differently from the steam locomotives. New coaches have been added and replacing the old coaches. 119 is the less powerful of the zoo's two locomotives and regularly hauls a train of five open-air coaches. This engine is known for its colorful paint scheme, polished brass, and sweet-sounding Nathan six chime whistle. No. 119 was the original locomotive on the Omaha Zoo Railroad and was custom built for the zoo in 1968. It was built by Crown Metal Products of Wyano, Pennsylvania, a company that built replica steam trains for amusement parks and zoos all over the country. In honor of zoo railroad benefactor Union Pacific, the engine was decorated to resemble the Union Pacific's ceremonial engine used at the 1869 completion of the first transcontinental railroad. It is a 4-4-0 \\"American\\" type locomotive, meaning that it has four pilot wheels to help guide it through curves, 4 large driving wheels, and no trailing wheels. This type of locomotive was prevalent on American railroads from 1850 to about 1880, thus earning it the nickname \\"American standard\\". During the 119's first years at the zoo, it was underpowered and had difficulty pulling the train up the steep hills. Subsequent modifications by the Union Pacific and the zoo railroad's own shop have improved it greatly, and after a major rebuild in 1996‚Äì1999, it was deemed to be in better-than-new condition. During the rebuild, the engine also received a cosmetic makeover. Originally painted black, silver and red, it emerged resplendent in a beautiful and (at the time) historically accurate scheme of crimson, maroon, and olive green with a boiler jacket of simulated Russia iron. A new stained wood cab replicating the one on the original UP locomotive was also fitted. This engine returned to service in May 2013 after an overhaul. Plans for a second cosmetic makeover are possibly being taken into consideration due to new discoveries of Union Pacific's 119 and its paint. 1890 steam locomotive \\"Riva\\", CFR no. 395-104 Riva, number 104, is the zoo's second steam locomotive, acquired in 1974. It is a 0-6-2 tank locomotive, meaning that it carries its fuel oil and water in tanks on the locomotive rather than in a separate tender, as does the 119. It has six relatively small driving wheels and large cylinders, making it extremely powerful for its size and is also known for its European-style high-pitched whistle. A two-wheel trailing truck supports the firebox and cab. Generating tractive effort of 10,600 pounds it has almost twice the pulling power of 119, and typically operates with a train consisting of six open-air coaches and a caboose. The caboose has had its lettering, data, and logo removed. Riva began its long career in 1890 when it was turned out by the Krauss Works of Linz, Austria as serial number 2360. Its first owner was the M.A.R. (Mori‚ÄìArco‚ÄìRiva del Garda) Railway in northern Italian region of Trentino-South Tyrol, where it served as number 2 alongside two identical sister engines, \\"Arco\\" and \\"Lago di Garda\\". The railway was closed when Italy entered the World War I in 1915. The railway was on the front line and then sustained heavy damage, while \\"Riva\\" was sent to work on the Heeresfeldbahn (field military railways) in the Eastern front. From 1918 to 1941 it served an industrial railway in Stryj, Poland. World War II brought another stint in military duty before the engine finally ended up on the State Railways of Romania (CFR) as number 395‚Äì104. \\"Riva\\" operated on the CFR's Alba Julia‚ÄìZlatna line until 1968, when it was finally retired and sold to Plasser & Theurer, an Austria-based builder of track maintenance machinery. An American representative of Plasser & Theurer became aware of the Omaha Zoo's search for a second locomotive, and in 1974 arrangements were made for \\"Riva\\" to be donated to the zoo. Restoration took place in the Union Pacific's Omaha shops. The overhaul consisted of major running gear work, the installation of American air brake equipment, and conversion from coal to oil firing. The locomotive was then painted, and missing parts such as the headlights and bell were replaced. The reborn \\"Riva\\" entered service at the zoo in 1976 during the annual Family Night/Members' Day event, and has operated almost every year since. A major multi-year overhaul took place in the early 1990s and another in 2000‚Äì2002. During the winter and spring of 2005, the water tanks were replaced and the air tanks (added in 1976) were moved to a concealed location, returning the engine to a more historically correct appearance. The engine lost its light green and black paint scheme and was repainted all dark green with maroon wheels. The engine was given a new bell in 2013. Diesel locomotive Virgie Virgie is the zoo's first diesel locomotive, acquired in 2008. It is a four-wheeled, 40-ton diesel switcher locomotive built by Plymouth, in 1957 and named for one of the railroad's founders. The engine was initially painted light blue with red and black, and featured a likeness of a woman's face (presumably that of its namesake) on its front. Virgie entered service in 2009, and is mainly used as a train set switcher and is used for multiple different shop tasks. This locomotive was later repainted to red and black with white trim, and the face has since been removed.

Lamb arrived in Sabah, then part of the British Crown Colony of North Borneo, in 1962 and started work on developing agricultural settlement schemes around Tawau. In 1981, Lamb set up the Tenom Orchid Centre as a Sabah State Government conservation project. He is co- author of Rhododendrons of Sabah (1988) and Pitcher-Plants of Borneo (1996), and a coordinator and a co-author of the Orchids of Borneo series. In 2015, Lamb was awarded a P.G.D.K. (Panglima Gemilang Darjah Kinabalu, in English: Commander of the Order of Kinabalu) by the Governor of Sabah, which carries the title of Datuk. Lamb is married to Datin Anthea Phillipps, and has two children. Lamb has authored several volumes relating to the native orchids of Kinabalu Park, in Sabah, and Lamb described his life's work in an extensive 2004 interview, The Lost World of Sabah, in The Daily Telegraph. A species of the orchid genus Dendrobium, found in Sabah and described in 2016, has been named Dendrobium Lambii in his honour. The New Zealand Native Group has recognized the work he has done over the years in 2016 for the Orchids of Borneo.

Nevill (1847 ‚Äì 1897) was a British civil servant, best known for his scholarship and studies of the culture of Sri Lanka. Biography Hugh Nevill was born on 19 June 1847, and came to Ceylon, as it was called then, at the age of seventeen as Private Secretary to the Chief Justice.K. D. Somadasa, Catalogue of the Hugh Nevill Collection of Sinhalese Manuscripts in the British Library (London, 1987), 1: vii, from which all biographic information given here is drawn. Subsequently, he was a Writer in the Ceylon Civil Service, 1869; Commissioner of Requests, Colombo, 1879; District Judge, Matara, 1885; Fiscal for the Central Province, 1886; Assistant to the Government Agent, Trincomalee, 1891 and District Judge, Batticaloa from 1895 to 1897. He died at Hy√®res in France on 10 April 1897. Hugh Nevill had a younger brother named Geoffrey, who was a malacologist and a malacological author who worked in the Indian Museum, in Kolkata. Scholarly contributions Nevill was a pioneer student of the origin and development of Sinhala, the main language of Sri Lanka, and of the dialects of the Veddhas, Rodiyas, and Vanniyas. He was the founder and a major contributor of the scholarly journal The Taprobanian, and of the Kandyan Society of Arts. His interests and publications were extremely broad, covering anthropology, archaeology, botany, ethnology, folklore, geography, geology, history, mythology, palaeography, philology, and zoology. Hugh Nevill shared an interest in malacology with his younger brother Geoffrey; together they worked on researching the mollusks of India. Like his brother, Hugh also had a scientific collection.museum.wales, Curatorial Departments, Biodiversity & Systematic Biology, Mollusca, Collections, Collections Sources, M‚ÄìZ, Accessed 2016-10-22 The Hugh Nevill Collections During his 32 years in Sri Lanka, Nevill assembled a collection of 2,227 prose and verse manuscripts, mostly in Sinhala, Malayalam, Tamil, and Pali, now kept at the British Library. He produced a critical catalogue of the collection, in two volumes, but died before it was published. A more detailed description, in seven volumes, was eventually prepared by K. D. Somadasa and was published by the Library. One of these manuscripts is the Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole Manuscript, the earliest text of significant length in the Indo-Portuguese creole spoken by the Burghers and Kaffirs communities of Sri Lanka.

The origins of the bank were established in 1867; it became PostBank in 1987 and was disestablished and the branches were rebranded when it was acquired by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in 1989. History PostBank was formed when the New Zealand Post Office (a former Government Department) was split up by the Postal Services Act 1987 into Post Office Bank Ltd (trading as PostBank), New Zealand Post Ltd (a Postal Services company) and Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd (a telecommunications company). It purchased the assets of the former Post Office Savings Bank. PostBank was sold two years after it was formed to ANZ, with the PostBank brand being absorbed and finally removed by the late 1990s. PostBank shared many operating characteristics with the later Kiwibank, a bank which initially operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the state-owned enterprise, New Zealand Post Limited. Later, Kiwibank and New Zealand Post started a process of no longer co-locating with Kiwibank opening 13 stand-alone stores. The origins of PostBank are in the Post Office Savings Bank, which was established in 1867 to give New Zealand investors a place to deposit their savings.

At this point, US 52 is on the Lafayette Freeway. The bridge spans across railroad yards north of the Mississippi, the river itself, and industrial areas south of the Mississippi. The Lafayette Bridge is one of the longest Mississippi River bridges in the Twin Cities. An earlier bridge on Lafayette Street, built in 1905 by C.A.P. Turner, was removed to make room for the Lafayette Bridge. The 1905 bridge spanned the Soo Line railroad tracks, not the river itself. This was an experimental bridge of Turner's design, being a flat slab resting on mushroom- capped columns for support. The existing Lafayette Bridge was constructed during the 1960s and opened to traffic in 1968. In the aftermath of the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi bridge in Minneapolis, the Lafayette Bridge was cited as another bridge in Minnesota with insufficient redundancy‚Äîa so- called \\"fracture critical\\" structure which could collapse with the failure of just a single support element. The Lafayette bridge currently undergoes an in- depth, annual bridge inspection using special procedures for inspecting fracture critical bridges. A consultant inspection in 2007 reported the overall condition of the structure as fair, with only minor repairs and spot painting recommended. This work was done in 2008. The annual Mn/DOT inspections also report the overall condition of the bridge as fair, and that the bridge is satisfactory for public use. The most recent inspection was carried out in September 2010 and found no significant problems. The bridge nearly collapsed in 1975 after a large crack in a main beam caused a dip to form at the road surface. It was temporarily closed to traffic as that damage was repaired. The Lafayette Bridge was already scheduled to be replaced in 2011 before the I-35W bridge collapse occurred in 2007. That event did not impact the replacement schedule, which began in January 2011. It will be complete sometime in 2015. When completed, the two new bridges (northbound and southbound) each will provide two through-lanes and an auxiliary lane in each direction for entering and exiting traffic. The project also includes replacement of the Hwy 52 bridges over I-94 and redecking of the Hwy 52 bridges spanning Plato Boulevard south of the Mississippi River. A pedestrian and bicycle crossing over the river is included in the plans. The project limits stretch along Hwy 52 from East Seventh Street to just south of Plato Boulevard. Lunda Construction Company of Black River Falls, Wisc. is the prime contractor for the $130.4 million project. While the current Lafayette Bridge is a safe structure to use, it is nearing the end of its designed life. The old Lafayette Bridge is not in use any more, the last day it was open was March 1, 2014. The bridge‚Äôs age and current condition are driving the planned replacement.

It is arguably the main iron ore region of Eastern Europe. Along with Donbas, Kryvbas is a major center of heavy industry in Ukraine. Named after the city of Kryvyi Rih, the region occupies the southwestern part of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, as well as a small neighbouring part of the Kirovohrad Oblast in a valley of Inhulets and Saksahan rivers (both are tributaries of Dnieper).Pliushch, M., Hruzin, D.V.

The region has major deposits of iron ore and some other metallurgical ores. To exploit them, several large mining companies were founded there in the middle of the 20th century. Most of them are located in Kryvyi Rih. Kryvorizhstal (located in Kryvyi Rih) is the largest and most up-to-date steel company in the region, and in the country. It includes ore facilities and a major steel mill (the only one in the city). Other ore companies supply their raw materials to either Kryvorizhstal or steel mills outside the region (particularly to Dnipro). With the exception of Kryvorizhstal, owned by Mittal Steel, the steel companies of the region are controlled by either the Privat Group or the SCM. These were one state-owned industries. From the 1990s until 2004, after Ukraine declared independence and worked to establish capitalism, these industries went through difficulties and scandals as they became privatized. A major mining and processing factory was under construction in the early 21st century in the neighboring city of Dolynska (Kirovohrad Oblast).

Its western terminus is at an interchange with U.S. Route 9 (US 9) and US 20 in Rensselaer, and its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 150 in Shivers Corners, a hamlet in the town of Schodack. It also has an intersection with US 4 in East Greenbush. NY 151 was assigned to most of its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. In Rensselaer, NY 151 has been altered several times, with the most recent change coming in the late 1990s. The current western terminus of NY 151 was once the western terminus of NY 43\\\\. Route description NY 151 in Rensselaer NY 151 begins as a city-maintained highway at a junction with US 9 and US 20 in Rensselaer, near the Hudson River. Known as 3rd Avenue, the two-lane route heads towards the southeast in a largely developed area. Upon assuming an eastward route, the highway crosses over a series of Amtrak tracks, passing south of the Albany-Rensselaer rail station and entering a more residential area. NY 151 turns slightly towards the northeast as it leaves the city of Rensselaer and becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as it passes into the town of East Greenbush. Just east of the city line, NY 151 veers to the south at an intersection with Barrack Road. While 3rd Avenue continues eastward as the unsigned NY 915E, NY 151 follows Barrack Road through a less-developed‚Äîand at times forested‚Äîlandscape as it passes through the town. After , the highway curves to the southeast, intersecting County Route 63 (CR 63) and changing street names to Red Mill Road in the process. It continues on a southeasterly alignment across Mill Creek to a junction with US 4\\\\. At this point, it becomes known as Luther Road as it turns northeastward towards Interstate 90 (I-90). NY 151 subsequently passes under the freeway and crosses Mill Creek a second time. After resuming a southeastern path, the route loses its street name and terminates at NY 150 in Shivers Corners, a hamlet in the town of Schodack. History NY 151 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a routing similar to its current alignment. At the time, NY 151 began at the intersection of Third Avenue (then-NY 152) and High Street in Rensselaer and followed the length of High Street and Red Mill Road to where it merged with its current alignment southeast of the city. West of High Street, what is now NY 151 was the westernmost portion of NY 152. NY 152 was truncated to Defreestville on its western end . Its former routing along Third Avenue from Rensselaer to Defreestville was redesignated as NY 381. NY 381 was supplanted by a rerouted NY 43 in the late 1960s. In the late 1970s, NY 151 was rerouted off High Street and onto a new roadway, Barracks Road, in the vicinity of Rensselaer. As a result, the roadway no longer entered the Rensselaer city limits. It was re-extended into the city by way of Third Avenue in the late 1990s when NY 43 was rerouted to meet I-90 at the new exit 8 west of Defreestville.

Name Misinterpretation The word has been mistakenly interpreted as being the name of the chief of Hochelaga, on the site of present-day Montreal. This confusion stems from a passage in A Shorte and Briefe Narration of the Two Nauigations and Discoueries to the Northwest Partes Called Newe Fraunce by Richard Hakluyt, in which French explorer Jacques Cartier first meets the chief of Hochelaga. The passage reads \\"...the Lord & King of the countrey was brought upon 9 or 10 mens shoulders (whom in their tongue they call Agouhanna)\\" This passage was interpreted as meaning that Agouhanna was the name of the Hochelagan chief. This proves not to be the case, as in Jacques Cartier's work entitled Bref Recit Et Succincte Narration de la Navigation Faite en MDXXXV et MDXXXVI par Le Capitaine Jacques Cartier Aux Iles de Canada, Hochelaga, Saguenay, et Autres, he recounts his meeting with Donnacona, chief of Stadacona, near present-day Quebec City, saying, \\"...le seigneur de Canada nom√© Donnacona en nom, & l'appelent pour seigneur Agouhanna...\\" This translates as: \\"the chief of Canada, called Donnacona by name, and called 'Agouhanna' for 'chief'.\\" This means, therefore, that the word Agouhanna means 'chief', and is not a proper name.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 24, 1972. History Noble Hall was built in 1854 as the main residence of a 2,000 acre (8 km¬≤) cotton plantation. The house was constructed utilizing rock masonry, with eight rooms featuring 12 foot (3.7 m) ceilings and 18 inch (46 cm) thick exterior walls. The front and rear both feature full-width cantilevered balconies and four monumental Doric columns, for a total of eight. Built behind the home were the exterior kitchen, carriage and smokehouse, and overseer's house. As with most of the larger plantation houses in the antebellum South, Noble Hall was built with slave labor, though the owner brought in a contractor from Kentucky to manage the construction. During the American Civil War, the home housed a number of sick and injured Confederate soldiers. Toward the end of the war, Union troops came to ransack the mansion, but were persuaded to take only the horses and mules when one of the residents showed a Masonic sign. The home remained in the hands of the original owners, the Frazer family, until cotton prices collapsed in 1922. In 1932, Noble Hall was purchased by J.V. Brown, who restored the home and grounds to their original condition. In 1941, Brown sold the house and surrounding lands to Alabama Polytechnic Institute president Luther Noble Duncan. His daughter inherited the home in 1951, and named it Noble Hall, after her father.

The match format sees two teams of varying sizes face off against each other. It uses standard lucha libre tag team rules with elimination occurring with a pinfall, submission, disqualification and count out and allows a wrestler to enter the match when their tag team partner exits the ring as well as when they tag out. A special 'batting' order system is used in which the wrestlers are given a specific order and may only tag in and out in this order. If two or more men from the same team remain, they must face each other to determine one individual winner. History in the United States=Chikara The lucha libre-inspired, Pennsylvania-based Chikara promotion holds an annual show with a torneo cibernetico as their main event. The Chikara Torneo Cibernetico has always been a 16-man match with teams of eight facing off. The first Chikara Torneo Cibernetico took place on October 30, 2004 in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, and featured \\"Sweet 'n' Sour International\\" (Larry Sweeney (captain), Crossbones, Hallowicked, Mano Metalico, Rorschach, ShareCropper, Spyrazul and UltraMantis Black) wrestling against the team of Jigsaw (captain), DJ Skittlez, Gran Akuma, Icarus, Jolly Roger, Mister Zero, Private Eye and Shane Storm. Spyrazul unmasked himself as Mike Quackenbush and helped Jigsaw pick up the win over Sweeney. The second annual Torneo Cibernetico took place on October 22, 2005 in Hellertown, Pennsylvania, and featured Chris Hero (captain), Blind Rage, Arik Cannon, Claudio Castagnoli, Gran Akuma, Hallowicked, Icarus and UltraMantis Black wrestling against Mike Quackenbush (captain), Jigsaw, Eddie Kingston, Milano Collection A.T., Sabian, Skayde, Shane Storm and Mister ZERO. Gran Akuma was victorious, lastly eliminating Shane Storm. Chikara held their third annual Torneo Cibernetico on October 28, 2006 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This edition featured Larry Sweeney (captain), Gran Akuma, Claudio Castagnoli, Chris Hero, Icarus, and The Thomaselli Brothers (Sal, Vito and Brandon) taking on the team of Eddie Kingston (captain), Cheech, Cloudy, Darin Corbin, Ryan Cruz, Hallowicked, Mike Quackenbush, and Shane Storm. Icarus emerged victorious, lastly eliminating Kingston. Chikara's fourth annual Torneo Cibernetico was held on September 22, 2007 in Philadelphia and pitted The Kings of Wrestling (Mitch Ryder (captain), Chris Hero, Claudio Castagnoli, Larry Sweeney, Gran Akuma, Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Shayne Hawke) against Team Mega Mucha Lucha (Lince Dorado (captain), Incognito, Magno, Equinox, El Hijo del Ice Cream, Ice Cream, Jr., Chiva III and Chiva IV), in which Claudio Castagnoli would emerge victorious, lastly eliminating his own team captain, Mitch Ryder. Chikara's fifth annual Torneo Cibernetico was held on November 15, 2008 in Framingham, Massachusetts, and saw \\"Team Equinox\\" (Jimmy \\"Equinox\\" Olsen (captain), Mike Quackenbush, Tim Donst, Hydra, Helios, Fire Ant, Soldier Ant, and Worker Ant) taking on \\"Team Gerard\\" (Vin Gerard (captain), Lince Dorado, Stigma, Eddie Kingston, Amasis, Ophidian, UltraMantis Black, and Crossbones). The winner was Jimmy Olsen lastly eliminating Ophidian. Chikara's sixth annual Torneo Cibernetico was held on October 18, 2009 in Philadelphia, PA, and was contested under parejas increibles rules, which meant that regular tag teams were broken up and the partners would be divided to opposing teams. The match saw \\"Team Hot Property\\" (Fire Ant (captain), Jigsaw, Frightmare, Green Ant, Player Dos, Matt Jackson, Helios and KC \\"Cloudy\\" Day) taking on \\"Soldier's Army\\" (Soldier Ant (captain), Mike Quackenbush, Hallowicked, Carpenter Ant, Player Uno, Nick Jackson, Lince Dorado and Cheech Hernandez).

They attempt to enhance privacy and confidentiality. In addition, they attempt to make traffic harder to identify by third parties including internet service providers (ISPs). However, encryption will not protect one from DMCA notices from sharing not legal content, as one is still uploading material and the monitoring firms can merely connect to the swarm. MSE/PE is implemented in BitComet, BitTornado, Deluge, Flashget, KTorrent, libtorrent (used by various BitTorrent clients, including qBittorrent), Mainline, ŒºTorrent, qBittorrent, rTorrent, Transmission, Tixati and Vuze. PHE was implemented in old versions of BitComet. Similar protocol obfuscation is supported in up-to-date versions of some other (non-BitTorrent) systems including eMule. Purpose As of January 2005, BitTorrent traffic made up more than a third of total residential internet traffic, although this dropped to less than 20% as of 2009. Some ISPs deal with this traffic by increasing their capacity whilst others use specialised systems to slow peer-to-peer traffic to cut costs. Obfuscation and encryption make traffic harder to detect and therefore harder to throttle. These systems were designed initially to provide anonymity or confidentiality, but became required in countries where Internet Service Providers were granted the power to throttle BitTorrent users and even ban those they believed were guilty of illegal file sharing. History=Early approach Protocol header encryption (PHE) was conceived by RnySmile and first implemented in BitComet version 0.60 on 8 September 2005. Some software like IPP2P claims BitComet traffic is detectable even with PHE. PHE is detectable because only part of the stream is encrypted. Since there are no open specifications to this protocol implementation the only possibility to support it in other clients would have been via reverse engineering. Development of MSE/PE In late January 2006 the developers of Vuze (then known as Azureus) decided to design and simultaneously implement a new, open protocol obfuscation method, called message stream encryption (MSE). It was included in Azureus CVS snapshot 2307-B29 on 19 January 2006. This first draft was heavily criticized since it lacked several key features. After negotiations between different BitTorrent developers a new proposal was written and then implemented into the Azureus and ŒºTorrent betas within days. In ŒºTorrent, the new protocol was called protocol encryption (PE). MSE/PE in BitTorrent client versions *aria2 supports MSE/PE as of build v1.34 but is not enforced by default. *BitComet version 0.63 was released 7 March 2006. It removed the old protocol header encryption and implemented the new MSE/PE to be compatible with Azureus and ŒºTorrent. * BitTornado supports MSE/PE as of build T-0.3.18. As of January 5, 2007, this build is still marked \\"experimental\\" on the Download page. * BitTorrent (Mainline) supports MSE/PE since version 4.9.2-beta on May 2, 2006. * Deluge supports MSE/PE as of Deluge-0.5.1. * KTorrent implemented MSE/PE in SVN version 535386SVN server. KDE.org. 2006-04-29.Subversion client required. on April 29, 2006. * libtorrent implemented protocol encryption in v0.13 released on 10 December 2011. * rTorrent supports MSE/PE as of rTorrent-0.7.0. * Transmission supports MSE/PE as of Transmission-0.90. * Vuze (formerly Azureus) supports the final spec since 25 January 2006 (CVS snapshot 2307-B33). Azureus version 2.4.0.0 was released 10 February 2006, and was the first stable version of a client to support MSE/PE. However, glitches in Azureus' implementation resulted in improperly encrypted pieces that failed hash checking. The glitches were rectified as of version 2.4.0.2. * ŒºTorrent premiered MSE/PE 4 days after Azureus with beta 1.4.1 build 407. ŒºTorrent version 1.5 (build 436) was released on 7 March 2006; it was the first stable version of ŒºTorrent with PE.\\"¬µTorrent 1.5 released\\" . uTorrent Announcements. 2006-03-07. Operation The BitComet PHE method used in versions 0.60 to 0.62 is neither published, nor is it compatible with MSE/PE. MSE/PE uses key exchange combined with the infohash of the torrent to establish an RC4 encryption key. The key exchange helps to minimize the risk of passive listeners, and the infohash helps avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. RC4 is chosen for its speed. The first kibibyte (1024 bytes) of the output is discarded to prevent the Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack. The specification allows the users to choose between encrypting the headers only or the full connection. Encrypting the full connection provides more obfuscation but uses more CPU time. To ensure compatibility with other clients that don't support this specification, users may also choose whether unencrypted incoming or outgoing connections are still allowed. Supported clients propagate the fact that they have MSE/PE enabled through PEX and DHT. Security The estimated strength of the encryption corresponds to about 60‚Äì80 bits for common symmetrical ciphers. Cryptographically, this effective key length is quite low, but appropriate in that the protocol was not designed as a secure transport protocol but rather as a fast and efficient obfuscation method. AES was proposed as the encryption method, but not adopted because it consumed too much CPU time. The required Diffie‚ÄìHellman keys to achieve a security equal to AES would have been much bigger or require elliptic curve cryptography, making the handshake more expensive in terms of used CPU time.  Effectiveness  Analysis of the BitTorrent protocol encryption (a.k.a. MSE) has shown that statistical measurements of packet sizes and packet directions of the first 100 packets in a TCP session can be used to identify the obfuscated protocol with over 96% accuracy. Criticism Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent, opposed adding encryption to the BitTorrent protocol. Cohen stated he was worried that encryption could create incompatibility between clients. He also stressed the point that the majority of ISPs don't block the torrent protocol. In 2006 Cohen wrote \\"I rather suspect that some developer has gotten rate limited by his ISP, and is more interested in trying to hack around his ISP's limitations than in the performance of the internet as a whole\\". Many BitTorrent community users responded strongly against Cohen's accusations. Cohen later added encrypted connections to his Mainline client with the ability to receive but not originate them. Notably, when ŒºTorrent was purchased by BitTorrent, Inc. and then became the next mainline release, the ability to originate encrypted connections was retained, but it became turned off by default. In an interview in 2007, Cohen stated \\"The so-called 'encryption' of BitTorrent traffic isn't really encryption, it's obfuscation. It provides no anonymity whatsoever, and only temporarily evades traffic shaping.\\"\\"Interview with Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent\\". TorrentFreak. 2007-01-17. Retrieved 2013-04-07.

It produces gaming headsets for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices (including tablets). The company has roots dating back to the 1970s where it developed sound cards, MIDI synthesizers, and various audio software packages and network audio devices. The company began making gaming headsets in 2005 and created the first ever gaming headset for game consoles with the launch of the X51. Turtle Beach is considered one of the leading gaming audio brands and is publicly traded on NASDAQ under the stock ticker symbol \\"HEAR.\\"  History =Early history: 1975‚Äì2005 Turtle Beach has roots dating back to 1975 in Elmsford, New York, founded as \\"Turtle Beach Softworks\\" by Roy Smith and Robert Hoke. The company's first product was a graphical editing system that supported the breakthrough Ensoniq Mirage sampling keyboard. The Mirage was the first low cost sampling device that allowed musicians to play realistic choirs, pianos, horns, and other instruments in their performances. The software, called \\"Vision\\", connected the Mirage to a PC and used the PC's screen and graphics to make the programming and editing of sounds much easier. Ensoniq decided to resell Vision through their dealer network and Turtle Beach Softworks became a profitable company. In 1988, Turtle Beach began to work on developing its first hardware product, a hard disk-based audio editing system. Among the first of its kind, the product was named the \\"56K digital recording system\\" and was released in 1990. In 1990, Turtle Beach began developing its second PC sound card. This card used high quality A/D and D/A, a high quality synthesizer from eMu, and an onboard DSP chip. This product was called \\"MultiSound.\\" The MultiSound product competed with more established products of the day from Advanced Gravis (now defunct), Ad Lib, Inc. (now defunct), Creative Labs, and Media Vision. CCRMA's Music Kit and DSP Tools running on Motorola 56001 DSP, initially developed for NeXTcube system, was later ported on NeXTSTEP with Turtle Beach Fiji/Pinnacle DSP cards. (also available in scanned PDF) In December 1996, the company was sold by ICS to Voyetra Technologies in Yonkers, New York. The new combined company would eventually be known as Voyetra Turtle Beach. Voyetra was originally founded by Carmine Bonanno and Fred Romano in 1975 as Octave-Plateau, one of the original companies included in the MIDI standard, and had developed drivers and software for nearly every sound card manufacturer in the world during the early 1990s. As Voyetra Turtle Beach, the company sold millions of sound cards to Dell in the late 1990s and early 2000s. 2005‚Äì2013: Rebranding as a headset manufacturer In 2005, the company released its first Ear Force gaming headset model, the X51. The headset was geared toward computer gamers. Over the following years, the company began focusing primarily on its lines of PC and console gaming headsets, steering away from sound cards almost completely (it did release updated versions of the Audio Advantage USB sound cards in 2010). By 2007, Voyetra Turtle Beach had released several headset models including those that were wireless and those that had surround sound capability. Its models were initially designed specifically for the Xbox 360, PC, or Nintendo Wii. Turtle Beach released its first pair of headphones designed specifically for the PlayStation 3 (Ear Force P21) in 2009. In October 2010, Stripes Group acquired a majority position in Turtle Beach. In 2011, the company released a limited-edition, officially licensed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 headset. In 2012, it entered into a partnership with Major League Gaming (MLG) that saw the release of headsets specifically designed for tournament gaming and consumer headsets that had official MLG branding. The same year, Turtle Beach acquired Lygo International, a United Kingdom-based distributor and supplier of gaming accessories that had already been Turtle Beach's exclusive distributor and support center for the UK and Ireland since January 2011. 2013-present: Parametric merger and eSports sponsorships In 2013, Turtle Beach began working on a deal that would eventually see them merge with the San Diego-based audio technology manufacturer, Parametric Sound Corporation, in January 2014. Parametric had gone public in 2010. In April 2014, the company's name was changed to Turtle Beach Corporation, it began trading under the stock ticker symbol \\"HEAR,\\" and opened a new corporate headquarters in San Diego, California. Parametric's \\"UltraSound\\" technology, which uses speakers to direct sounds only to specific areas, also came under the purview of Turtle Beach. In 2014 and 2015, the company released official Titanfall and Star Wars Battlefront-branded headsets. It also began releasing a collection of other gaming accessories like keyboards, computer mice, and mousepads. In 2016, the company entered a partnership with OpTic Gaming, an esports organization, for the team to use its Elite Pro Tournament Gaming Headset. Turtle Beach also released the Stream Mic for users who broadcast from their consoles and PC. In 2017, it released the first headsets (the Stealth 600 and 700) that could connect directly to the Xbox One console wirelessly. The Stealth 600 went on to be the best- selling Xbox One gaming headset for 2018. It also entered into a console-only sponsorship deal with Splyce. In 2018, the company launched a new line of PC- specific headsets called \\"Atlas.\\" It received input and feedback from esports teams, OpTic Gaming and Astralis, during the design process. It also released the Elite Pro 2 headset designed for console gaming. In December 2018, it released a line of earbuds (\\"Battle Buds\\") designed for mobile gaming.  Products and brands =Headsets Turtle Beach creates gaming headsets for consoles such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile and tablet devices. It is considered one of the leading gaming audio brands. Gaming headsets have been Turtle Beach's primary product offering since around 2005. It initially began releasing headsets for PCs and consoles of that generation including the Xbox 360, Wii, and the PlayStation 3. The early models were often given the Ear Force branding with a letter or number designation to differentiate between consoles (e.g. headsets for the Xbox 360 were a part of the \\"Ear Force X\\" series while those for the PlayStation 3 were part of the \\"Ear Force P\\" series). Turtle Beach headsets are generally cross- compatible between current-generation consoles like the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PCs, as well as most mobile and tablet devices. Many models are console-specific, but share the same branding and can often be used across platforms (e.g. the Stealth 300 has a model for both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, but both are technically compatible with one another and the Nintendo Switch, and PC, etc.). Certain features on console-specific models may not transfer from one platform to another. For instance, the Stealth 600 and 700 models for the Xbox One can wirelessly connect directly with the console. Those same models for the PlayStation 4 do not have that feature. In some cases, the differences between one console-specific model and another are cosmetic. As of 2018, Turtle Beach sells a number of wired and wireless headsets under several different families. These include: Elite (Elite Pro 2 + SuperAmp, Elite SuperAmp, Elite Pro Tournament Gaming Headset, Elite 800,); Stealth (Stealth 700, Stealth 600, Stealth 350VR, Stealth 300); Recon (Recon 200, Recon Camo, Recon 150, Recon 50, Recon Chat); Atlas (Elite Atlas, Atlas Three, Atlas One); and there are also standalone products, including the Stream Mic and Battle Buds. Recon products are generally entry- level and offer great game sound and microphone performance to better immerse players in their game and to allow them to communicate with other online players. Stealth products add premium features like wireless connectivity, surround sound, larger speakers, memory foam, etc. Elite series models are generally considered professional level and/or high-end gaming headsets. The Atlas series of headsets was designed specifically for use in PC gaming. The newest series, Battle Buds, is a set of gaming earbuds designed to be compatible with mobile devices along with PCs and all consoles. Sound cards and software Turtle Beach has also developed sound cards, MIDI synthesizers, and various audio software packages and network audio devices. In 1988, Turtle Beach developed its first product, a hard disk-based audio editing system. The product was named the \\"56K digital recording system\\" and was released in 1990 and was considered the first of its kind. Its card, 56K-PC, was based on a Motorola 56000 DSP chip, and offered non linear playlist editing of stereo audio files. The 56K system was popular among radio stations and mastering studios because it replayed exactly the same digital stream that it recorded. The company has also developed a few other programs that supported Ensoniq equipment. During its time as Voyetra Turtle Beach, it leveraged Voyetra's close ties with PC manufacturers by providing sound cards bundled with Voyetra software and drivers. It sold millions of sound cards to Dell Computer under the Turtle Beach brand. In 2001, Voyetra Turtle Beach developed AudioTron, one of the first standalone Internet audio receivers. The device enjoyed tremendous success in the first year of its release, but was soon faced with tremendous competition from similar products. Turtle Beach opted out of the network audio market in 2004.

Life and career Born in Northampton, Massachusetts Bay, he was the ninth child and second son of Jonathan Edwards and Sarah (Pierpont) Edwards. In 1751, the family moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where his exposure to language variation began. Both of Edwards parents died during the year of 1758. He graduated from Princeton in 1765, after which he studied theology under Joseph Bellamy of Bethlehem, Connecticut. He was a tutor at Princeton from 1767 to 1769, and a pastor in New Haven, Connecticut from 1769 to 1795, where he was dismissed from this position due to doctrinal conflicts in the church. Despite this dismissal, he was called back to another church in Colebrook, Connecticut that same year. After serving as pastor in Colebrook, Connecticut from 1795 to 1799, he moved to Schenectady, New York to serve as the president of Union College. Edwards died on August 1, 1801, and was buried in the churchyard of the First Presbyterian Church in Schenectady, New York. Contribution to theology As a theologian, his fame rests upon his reply to Charles Chauncy upon the salvation of all men, in which he defended the orthodox evangelical doctrine, his reply to Samuel West's Essays on Liberty and Necessity, in which he largely modified his father's theory of the will by giving it a liberal interpretation, and upon his sermons on the atonement. A great deal of religious controversy raged in New England during his lifetime. His works were published at Andover in two volumes, and were later re- published together along with a memoir by Tryon Edwards. Unlike his father, who was a slave-owner, Jonathan Edwards the younger supported abolition of the slave trade and of slavery. His anti-slavery viewpoint was first evidenced in 1773, when he wrote a series of articles entitled ‚ÄúSome Observations upon the Slavery of Negroes‚Äù in the Connecticut Journal and the New-Haven Post-Boy (Gamertsfelder, p. 137). These views were further articulated in his 1791 sermon, \\"The Injustice and Impolicy of the Slave trade.\\" It was his work and some of Samuel Hopkins's which were among the first direct appeals to the freedom of slaves from the New England ministry. While much of his work was spent defending the works of his father Jonathan Edwards, Joseph Bellamy, and Samuel Hopkins, he was a key part of the 1801 Plan of Union. He died in 1801. Contribution to linguistics Edwards was a pioneer in the historical linguistics of Native North America. He was raised in the community of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where Native American speakers of the Mohican language were the majority, and he became fluent in that language as a child. In 1755, Edwards's father sent him to stay in the Iroquois settlement of Onohoquaga, with the purpose of training him for future missionary work. Through this experience, Edwards acquired first-hand knowledge of Iroquoian and other Algonquian languages. In 1787, Edwards published a study of the Mohican language, which he referred to as Muhhekaneew. In it, he chronicled basic vocabulary and grammar rules and recorded the marked differences between Mohican and English. He argued against the misconception that Native Americans had no distinct parts of speech in their language, writing, \\"It has been said that savages have no parts of speech beside the substantive and the verb. This is not true concerning the Mohegans, nor concerning any other tribe of Indians, of whose language I have any knowledge. The Mohegans have all the eight parts of speech, to be found in other languages; though prepositions are so rarely used, except in composition, that I once determined that part of speech to be wanting.\\" In 1787, Edwards published a study of the Mohican language. In it, he presented evidence for the relatedness of Algonquian languages throughout northeastern North America and their distinctness from the neighboring Iroquoian languages. Edwards' work on New World linguistic classification paralleled that of his contemporary, William Jones, on the Indo-European languages. In his report, \\"Observation on the Language of the Muhhekaneew Indians...\\", Jonathan Edwards observes the Mohican language \\"have no diversity of gender, either in nouns or pronouns\\". He also observed that Mohican can also use plural forms just by adding an extra morpheme to the singular form. Such as the singular word for boy is penumpaufoo and the plural form is penumpaufoouk for boys. The Mohican language does not contain any adjectives, instead neuter verbs are used to express the qualities. References * Edwards, Jonathan, 1787.

Early life According to family archives, Meyer was born on Henry Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to Polish Jews who had only weeks earlier immigrated to New York via Stockholm, Sweden. In 1881, the family moved to Syracuse, New York, and then relocated to Rochester, New York one year later. Coming from a family of tailors, he worked for less than a week in a Rochester tailor shop before deciding to attend high school instead.Jacobstein Family History [unpublished family archive] Academic career After attending public schools in Rochester, New York, he attended the University of Rochester and graduated from Columbia University in 1904.

Techniques Poƒçernick√° street in Prague used to be four lanes wide. In 2010s, it got two parking lanes and bicycle lanes on each side of the road A typical road diet technique is to reduce the number of lanes on a roadway cross-section. One of the most common applications of a road diet is to improve safety or provide space for other modes of travel. For example, a two-way, four lane road might be reduced to one travel lane in each direction. The freed-up space is then used to provide or enhance some of the following features: *Adding or widening of footpaths/sidewalks *Adding or widening of boulevards (landscaping strips) *Adding cycle lanes on one or both sides of the road *Adding reserved tramtracks, usually in the middle of the road *Widening remaining traffic lanes (if previously unsafely narrow to allow four lanes) *Adding a center turn lane / flush traffic median for turning traffic *Adding a reversible center lane *Conversion of the rightmost or leftmost travel lane to a breakdown lane (The Lodge Freeway in metro Detroit is an example of this after I-96, the Jeffries Freeway, was built.) If properly designed, traffic does not divert to other streets after a road diet, because the road previously provided excessive capacity. In other scenarios, reduction of traffic (either local traffic or overall traffic) is intended in the scheme. Road diets are usually successful on roads carrying fewer than 19,000 vehicles per day. Road diets can succeed at volumes up to about 23,000 vehicles per day. However, more extensive reconstruction is needed. Examples include replacing signals with roundabouts, traffic calming on parallel streets to discourage traffic from diverting away from the main road, and other means to keep traffic moving smoothly and uniformly. Lane diets In a lane diet, the width of a lane is decreased to reduce vehicle speeds and yield space for other use. Typically vehicular travel lane widths are narrowed to no more than , and left turn (in countries where drivers use the right-hand side of the road) storage lanes to . Resulting space can be applied to pedestrian refuges, medians, sidewalks, shoulders, parking, or bike lanes. Lane width guidelines in the United States are offered as a range and lane diets fall within this range. In many cases of four-lane roadways with double- yellow, this can present a hazard for oncoming traffic in the \\"passing lane\\", as well as left-turners. Sometimes four-lane with double-yellow is upgraded to five-lane with center turn lane since that practice is more of an upgrade than a \\"diet\\" like three-lane with center turn lane is. Benefits Researchers have found that road diets can be expected to reduce overall crash frequency by 19% to 43%, with the higher crash reductions occurring in small urban areas than in metropolitan areas. A leading proponent of road diets is former Florida Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator Dan Burden, who now helms the Walkable and Livable Communities Institute. Burden and Peter Lagerwey published an article on the topic in 1999 noting that in two cases, 95% of residents were initially opposed to roadway constriction. Additional studies have shown that road diets often achieve these positive effects without reducing traffic volumes. Criticisms Not all multi-lane arterials are good candidates for road constriction. Added congestion can outweigh benefits if vehicle traffic volumes exceed the capacity of the three-lane roadway. This threshold is approximately 20,000 vehicles per day. Effects on evacuation speed during wildfires Other concerns regard public safety; police, fire and ambulances may be slowed and if an evacuation is ordered, the evacuation will be slower. One example of road diets being accused of this effect is during the evacuations of the 2018 Camp Fire which killed at least 88 people and destroyed the town of Paradise, California. Out of four evacuation routes out of Paradise, three of which were narrow, two-lane mountain roads, the fourth, Skyway Boulevard, was the only artery that could effectively handle high amounts of traffic. A grand jury investigation for a similar fire nearby in 2008 had recommended ‚Äúimmediate modification of Skyway, from Paradise to Chico, as an emergency evacuation route, by removing trees and brush and creating fire barriers on both sides of the road.‚Äù However, in 2012, the county government decided to narrow the boulevard by replacing traffic lanes with bike lanes, bulb-outs, and other traffic calming measures. Critics of road dieting blamed the narrowing of the boulevard for causing gridlock, thus trapping evacuating drivers in the fire. Examples of implementation in the United States Among American cities, San Francisco has completed the most road diet projects, over 40 since the late 1970s. Valencia Street, which was reduced from four to two travel lanes with a center turn lane and bike lanes added in March 1999, has become a national model for traffic engineers of the common \\"4-to-3 lane\\" road diet type. San Jose, California has implemented several road diets since November 2011, when the City Council unanimously adopted its \\"Envision 2040\\" General Plan, which calls for road diets on streets with excess vehicle capacity \\"to provide wider sidewalks, bicycle lanes, transit amenities, and/or landscaping\\". Road diets were completed on 3rd, 4th, 10th, and 11th streets in August 2012, and on Hedding Street in July 2013. Constricting traffic arteries has been controversial in Los Angeles, California, where traffic fatalities increased 32% since beginning its Vision Zero road diet plan in 2015.https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln- traffic-deaths-bike-pedestrian-los-angeles-vision-zero-20190425-story.html Palo Alto, California has studied reducing the number of travel lanes to improve safety on some of its busiest streets since adopting a new Comprehensive Plan in 1998. Design plans were made for road diets on Embarcadero Road and Middlefield Road in the early 2000s, but were never brought to the city council for approval. 75-yr-old local resident Ming Yuan Zuo was killed by a pickup truck driver while walking across Embarcadero Road in January 2013. Lane reductions were approved and then implemented on Charleston Road in 2006, Arastradero Road in 2010, and Deer Creek Road in 2011. In Tampa, Florida, Nebraska Avenue between its intersection with Hillsborough Avenue (US 92-US 41-FL 600) and Adamo Drive was reduced from four to three lanes, complete with bicycle lanes, a left turn lane and embedded bus stops for HART buses. Construction was completed in 2009.Redesigned Nebraska Avenue Significantly Safer, The Tampa Tribune. Retrieved 2015-06-15. In Rutland, Vermont, the city briefly converted Woodstock Avenue from a four-lane road to a three-lane road with bicycle lanes on each side.

The video was so popular that it spawned spin-offs, \\"Smash My Xbox\\", \\"Smash My PS3\\", and \\"Smash My Wii\\", in which the same group of Canadians purchased Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii consoles and destroyed them while onlookers waited in line to purchase them. The money needed to purchase the items is raised by the donations of visitors to the website. Since the smashing of the Xbox360 the SmashOurStuff crew were paid by a company named Tromsolan to smash an iPod nano, which led to a one-year ban from the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On January 16, 2007, the forums was closed by the administrators, due to legal issues with Apple. In response to Apple announcing the iPhone being launched in Canada, the SmashOurStuff team continued their legacy by assassinating an iPhone on the main stage at the Toronto Freedom Festival on May 3rd, 2008. The fans were so hyped that somebody threw their iPod on stage to be destroyed as well.

Milton S. Hershey established HE&R; in 1927 to distinguish and separate his chocolate manufacturing company from his other business ventures. All of his non-chocolate producing businesses were established as Hershey Estates, renamed Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company in 1980.  History =Predecessors In 1894, Milton S. Hershey founded the Hershey Chocolate Company as a subsidiary of his Lancaster Caramel Company. In 1900, the American Caramel Company offered to purchase the Lancaster Caramel Company for $1 million. Hershey accepted the offer, maintaining ownership of the Hershey Chocolate Company. In 1903, Hershey began purchasing land in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, not far from the family homestead he owned, to create a company town for his proposed chocolate factory. To build the structures of the town, Hershey created a subsidiary company called the Hershey Improvement Company. This company was the predecessor to Hershey Entertainment and Resorts. After the factory was completed and put in operation in 1904, the Hershey Improvement Company turned toward building the town, which included homes, stores and parks. Hershey Park was opened on May 30, 1906, with a dance hall pavilion, band shell for shows, tennis courts and a baseball field with a grand stand available for sporting events. As the park gained popularity, further improvements were made, such as a grand entrance for the park in 1916. In 1905, Hershey created the Hershey Trust Company to provide banking to the town of Hershey. In 1909, Hershey and his wife Catherine, who were unable to have children, established the Hershey Industrial School for orphan boys (renamed the Milton Hershey School in 1951). Hershey created a deed of trust establishing a trust fund for the school. He named the Hershey Trust Company as administrator of the school trust. In 1918, three years after Catherine Hershey died, Hershey transferred nearly all of his assets, including his control of the chocolate company, and various other entities, to the school. This made the Hershey Trust Company owner of the Hershey Improvement Company. In 1920, Hershey experienced financial difficulty following the collapse in sugar futures. Hershey was forced to sign a promissory note from National City Bank to keep the chocolate company in business. Under the terms of the note, National City Bank sent R.J. DeCamp to be on the board of managers, to assume management of the company. DeCamp remained on the board until 1922, when the company settled the debt. During that time period, DeCamp prevented substantial improvements to the park or the town, as it was considered too costly an investment. Once Hershey regained control of the company, this made him realize that he should split his operations such that if the chocolate company ever failed again as it had, it wouldn't directly impact the town as the DeCamp period had. Hershey Estates established In 1927, the Hershey Chocolate Company was reorganized and divided into several independent entities under the ownership of Hershey Trust Company. The chocolate company was incorporated and renamed Hershey Chocolate Corporation (today known as The Hershey Company) on October 24. (A prior company called Hershey Chocolate Corporation existed in the early 1920s when National City Bank took control of Hershey Chocolate Company.) On October 30, the company became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. The Cuban businesses held within the chocolate company were spun out into a wholly privately owned company called Hershey Corporation. The Hershey Industrial School remained a separate interest. All of Hershey's other non- chocolate business endeavors were incorporated into a separate entity known as Hershey Estates. The company was established on October 31, 1927, in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, with paperwork submitted on October 28. Milton S. Hershey owned 47 of the 50 shares in the company, and Ezra F. Hershey, John E. Snyder, and William F.R. Murrie each owned one share. A share was valued at $100, for a total capital stock of $5,000. On October 31, Hershey Estates elected to increase its capital stock from $5,000 to $50,000 and 46 of Hershey's shares were transferred to Murrie under Hershey Chocolate Company. The increase was issued for property. On November 12, Hershey Chocolate Company sold the property designated for Hershey Estates to the company for one dollar. On December 12, Hershey Estates relocated from Lebanon to Hershey. On December 20, Hershey Chocolate Company filed notice to the Dauphin County prothonotary's office and the Secretary of the Commonwealth's office that they were no longer connected in the operation of various companies including Hersheypark and Hershey Laundry. This formally separated operations between Hershey Estates properties and Hershey Chocolate Company operations. Company growth 1930s-1970s In 1933, The Hotel Hershey opened, becoming Hershey Estate's second hotel in Hershey. Hershey Estates was a conglomeration, having ownership of such things as a bakery, electric company, creamery, sports arena, air park, amusement park, and lumber yard. The Estates company maintained this kind of control until the 1960s, when they began selling off public works companies such as the electric company, gave control of the roads they owned to Derry Township, and began closing poor performing divisions. In 1971, Hershey Estates began a large renovation project for Hershey Park, involving new rides, a gate around the park, live acts, and other kinds of entertainment. The park was also renamed Hersheypark. HERCO / Hershey Entertainment & Resorts In 1976, the company changed its name from Hershey Estates to HERCO, Inc., because public perception led many to believe that Hershey Estates referred to land that Milton Hershey once owned. In 1980, the name was changed to the current name: Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company (HE&R;), a backronym.The Hershey Archives Between 1980 and 1987, HE&R; began expanding their presence to hotels in the Pocono Mountains, Philadelphia and Corpus Christi, Texas, as well as purchasing Lake Compounce in Bristol and Southington, Connecticut. However, economic and political circumstances caused the Philadelphia and Corpus Christi hotels to struggle substantially. This caused HE&R; to experience severe financial difficulties, leading to the promotion of J. Bruce McKinney as CEO of the company. One of his first significant decisions was the controversial move to sell Hershey Lake Compounce. Ultimately, McKinney successfully led the company back to financial stability, which led to substantial growth within Hersheypark and at the Hershey Lodge in the mid and late 1990s. McKinney retired in 2000 and was replaced by Scott Newkam. Newkam served as CEO of HE&R; until 2006, when Newkam was replaced by Ted Kleisner. On January 1, 2013, William F. Simpson Jr. replaced Kleisner as the CEO of Hershey Entertainment and Resorts. John Lawn succeeded Simpson as chief executive on June 14, 2017.

Early years Zook was born in Tredyffrin, Chester County, Pennsylvania. His parents were David and Eleanor Stephens Zook and his paternal ancestors were of the Mennonite faith. At an early age, he moved with his parents to the home of his maternal grandmother at Valley Forge and the tradition of George Washington's winter encampment there during the American Revolutionary War fueled a lifelong interest in military matters. His father, David Zook, had been a major during the American Revolution, further fueling his interests.The Grand Army of the Republic: Bean's 1884 History of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania From the time he was old enough to carry a musket, he participated in local militia activities. At the age of 19, he became a lieutenant in the Pennsylvania militia and the adjutant of the 100thWarner, p. 576. or 110thEide, Bradley, Gettysburg Discussion Group biography Pennsylvania regiment. Zook entered the emerging field of telegraphy, became a proficient operator, and worked on crews to string wires as far west as the Mississippi River. He moved to New York City in 1846Eicher, p. 586. or 1851 and became the superintendent of the Washington and New York Telegraph Company. He made several discoveries in electric science that helped establish his reputation. In New York City, he also joined the 6th New York Governor's Guard (militia) regiment and had achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel by the time the Civil War broke out. Civil War The 6th New York Militia helped out as a 90-day regiment during the first summer of the war. Zook served as the military governor in Annapolis, seeking support from politically influential men there to achieve a regimental command of his own. After he was mustered out, he raised the 57th New York Infantry (National Guard Rifles) and became its colonel on October 19, 1861. General Samuel K. Zook Zook's first combat was during the Seven Days Battles of 1862. His regiment was assigned to William H. French's brigade in Edwin V. Sumner's division of the Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan. Zook was personally scouting far out in front of his regiment in the run-up to the Battle of Gaines' Mill, got behind enemy lines, and found that Confederate Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder was conducting an elaborate deception, making it appear that he had significantly more troops in his sector than he actually had. Zook's discovery was reported up to McClellan, but it was ignored, and Union troops that could have been used successfully elsewhere remain tied down. Fredericksburg Zook was forced to go on medical leave, probably due to chronic and disabling rheumatism, thus missing the Battle of Antietam. When he returned to the Army he was given command of French's brigade (3rd Brigade, 1st Division, II Corps) under division commander Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock. The brigade was one of the first to arrive at Fredericksburg, Virginia, and he wanted to cross over the Rappahannock River as quickly as possible, before Confederate General Robert E. Lee could reinforce the town and the heights beyond it. However, Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside prevented the movement, wanting to wait for his army to concentrate and to receive pontoon bridges to make the river crossing. Zook wrote on December 10, \\"If we had had the pontoons promised when we arrived here we could have the hills on the other side of the river without cost over 50 men‚Äînow it will cost at least 10,000 if not more.\\" While waiting for the pontoons to arrive, Zook served as military governor of Falmouth, Virginia. When the Battle of Fredericksburg began in earnest on December 13, French's division was the first to assault Marye's Heights. After being repulsed with heavy losses, Hancock's division moved forward with Zook's brigade in the lead. Zook had his horse shot out from under him and was momentarily stunned, but managed to lead his men to within 60 yards of the Stone Wall, one of the farthest Union advances of the battle. His brigade suffered 527 of the 12,000 Union casualties that night. General Hancock praised Zook's attack for its \\"spirit\\". Zook wrote afterward, \\"Now by God, if I don't get my star, I'm coming home.\\" He was promoted to brigadier general in March 1863, to rank from November 29, 1862.Warner, p. 577. After the battle, Zook briefly assumed command of the division while Hancock was absent on leave. Despite his successful promotion, however, the Battle of Fredericksburg affected him deeply: At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Zook's brigade fought in the defensive line around the Chancellor Mansion, but facing east, where combat was lighter and his men suffered only 188 casualties. Disabled again by rheumatism, he left on medical leave to Washington, D.C., and rejoined his brigade at the end of June to march into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign. Gettysburg Zook Monument, The Wheatfield, Gettysburg Battlefield On July 2, 1863, the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell's division, including Zook's brigade, was sent to reinforce the crumbling III Corps line that was being assaulted by the Confederate corps of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet. Zook was directed by one of the III Corps staff officers toward the Wheatfield to reinforce the brigade of Col. R√©gis de Trobriand and to fill a gap near the Stony Hill. Zook, on horseback, led his men up the hill, which attracted the attention of men from the advancing 3rd and 7th South Carolina Infantry regiments, of Joseph B. Kershaw's brigade. He was struck by rifle fire in the shoulder, chest, and abdomen, and taken behind the lines for medical treatment at a toll house on the Baltimore Pike. He died from his wounds on July 3 and is buried near the grave of General Winfield Scott Hancock in Montgomery Cemetery in West Norriton Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, near Norristown, Pennsylvania. He received a brevet promotion to major general for Gettysburg, awarded as of July 2. A small monument near the Wheatfield Road commemorates Zook's death.Virtual Gettysburg One of his soldiers in the 57th New York later characterized Zook as \\"a good disciplinarian; he hated cowardice and shams; had no patience with a man that neglected duty; was blunt, somewhat severe, yet good hearted ... a born soldier, quick of intellect, and absolutely without fear.\\"New York (State) et al., p. 421.

The modern Centering Prayer movement in Christianity can be traced to several books published by three Trappist monks of St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts in the 1970s: Fr. William Meninger, Fr. M. Basil Pennington and Abbot Thomas Keating. The name was taken from Thomas Merton's description of contemplative prayer (a much older and more traditional practice) as prayer that is \\"centered entirely on the presence of God\\". In his book Contemplative Prayer, Merton writes ‚ÄúMonastic prayer begins not so much with ‚Äúconsiderations‚Äù as with a ‚Äúreturn to the heart,‚Äù finding one's deepest center, awakening the profound depths of our being‚Äù. The creators of the Centering Prayer movement claim to trace their roots to the contemplative prayer of the Desert Fathers of early Christian monasticism, to the Lectio Divina tradition of Benedictine monasticism, and to works like The Cloud of Unknowing and the writings of St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross. Advocates of Centering Prayer say it does not replace other prayer but encourages silence and deeper connection to God. Also advocates of Centering Prayer say it helps people be more present and open to God. Father Thomas Keating has promoted both Lectio Divina and Centering Prayer. However, some people consider Centering Prayer controversial. Some authors argue that Centering Prayer contradicts the teachings of the Carmelite saints. Others also argue that Centering Prayer is a distortion of the teachings of the Desert Fathers and The Cloud of Unknowing, and is in contradiction to Lectio Divina. Some consider it to fall afoul of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's caution against similar prayer forms in their Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation. History=Claimed origins Seeds of what would become known as contemplation, for which the Greek term theoria is also used, were sown early in the Christian era. The earliest Christian writings that clearly speak of contemplative prayer come from the 4th-century monk St. John Cassian, who wrote of a practice he learned from the Desert Fathers (specifically from Isaac). Cassian's writings remained influential until the medieval era when monastic practice shifted from a mystical orientation to Scholasticism. During the 16th century, Carmelite saints Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross wrote and taught about advanced Christian prayer, which was given the name infused contemplation. The 20th century Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton was influenced by Buddhist meditation, particularly as found in Zen. He was a lifetime friend of Buddhist Thich Nhat Hanh, praised Chogyam Trungpa who founded Shambhala Buddhism in the United States and was also an acquaintance of the current Dalai Lama. His theology attempted to unify existentialism with the tenets of the Roman Catholic faith. As such he was also an advocate of the non-rational meditation of contemplative prayer, which he saw as a direct confrontation of finite and irrational man with his ground of being. Development Cistercian monk Father Thomas Keating, a founder of Centering Prayer, was abbot all through the 60s and 70s at St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts. This area is thick with religious retreat centres, including the well-known Theravada Buddhist centre, Insight Meditation Society. Fr. Keating tells of meeting many young people, some who stumbled on St. Joseph's by accident, many of them born Catholic, who had turned to Eastern practices for contemplative work. He found many of them had no knowledge of the contemplative traditions within Christianity and set out to present those practices in a more accessible way. The result was the practice now called Centering Prayer. Practice Fr. M. Basil Pennington suggests these steps for practicing Centering Prayer: # Sit comfortably with your eyes closed, relax, and quiet yourself. Be in love and faith to God. # Choose a sacred word that best supports your sincere intention to be in the Lord's presence and open to His divine action within you. # Let that word be gently present as your symbol of your sincere intention to be in the Lord's presence and open to His divine action within you. # Whenever you become aware of anything (thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, associations, etc.), simply return to your sacred word, your anchor. In addition, Fr. Keating writes, In centering prayer, the participant seeks the presence of God directly (aided by the Jesus Prayer, perhaps) and explicitly rejects discursive thoughts and imagined scenes. The participant's aim is to be present to the Lord, to \\"consent to God's presence and action during the time of prayer.\\"Thomas Keating (2009), \\"Intimacy with God: an Introduction to Centering Prayer,\\" 23. Centering Prayer advocates link the practice to traditional forms of Christian meditation, such as on the rosary, or Lectio Divina. Although the practice makes use of a \\"sacred word,\\" Thomas Keating emphasizes that Centering Prayer is not an exercise in concentrating, or focusing one's attention on something (such as a mantra), but rather is concerned with intention and consent.Thomas Keating (2009), \\"Intimacy with God: an Introduction to Centering Prayer,\\" 15-28. In practice, the \\"sacred word\\" can integrate with breathing in and out. Thus, rather than being a tool to quiet the mind, consent to the presence and action of God within and \\"just be\\" with God, it can become too prevalent during the practice of Centering Prayer. Reception=From other Catholics Critics note that traditional prayers such as the Holy Rosary and Lectio Divina engage the heart and mind with Sacred Scripture, while Centering Prayer is \\"devoid of content\\". The Holy Rosary and Lectio Divina, in contrast, have some contemplative goal in mind: with the Rosary, the Mysteries of the Rosary are contemplated; with Lectio Divina, the practitioner thinks about the Scripture reading, sometimes even visualizing it. Critics also dispute the claim that Centering Prayer is in the tradition of the Desert Fathers and Carmelite saints, saying that traditional Catholic contemplative prayer is not so much a method of prayer as a stage of prayer in which God's action predominates. They cite the Catechism of the Catholic Church as evidence that meditation and contemplation are two different expressions of prayer. From the Holy See In 1989, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) issued Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation. The letter addresses problematic elements found in some modern prayer methods, many of which have been influenced by Eastern religions and the New Age movement. Contemplative Outreach, which was founded by Fr. Keating and others to promote Centering Prayer, denies that this letter applies to Centering Prayer and states that Centering Prayer is connected to the Holy Spirit. Opponents of the method, however, point to similarities between the teaching of Fr. Keating and his colleagues and specific criticisms made by the CDF. In 2003, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and the Pontifical Council for Culture published Jesus Christ, The Bearer of the Water of Life: A Christian Reflection on the \\"New Age\\". Critics of Centering Prayer once again say their concerns were addressed in this document. Centering Prayer practitioners respond that Bearer of the Water of Life does not have doctrinal authority, and neither Vatican document mentions Centering Prayer, Contemplative Outreach, or Fr. Keating by name. Pope Francis has not commented on Centering Prayer directly but has spoken very highly of Thomas Merton. Thomas Merton described contemplative prayer as prayer \\"centered entirely on the presence of God.\\" Pope Francis listed Thomas Merton as one of four great Americans in a speech before the U.S. Congress in September 2015 and encouraged sowing dialogue and peace in \\"the contemplative style of Thomas Merton.\\" Research Research has been conducted on the Centering Prayer program, indicating that it may be helpful for women receiving chemotherapy, and that it may help congregants experience a more collaborative relationship with God, as well as reduced stress. Andrew B. Newberg explained one study that examined the brains of nuns who engaged in Centering Prayer, which is meant to create a feeling of oneness with God. The nuns' brain scans showed similarities to people who use drugs like psilocybin mushrooms, Newberg said, and both experiences \\"tend to result in very permanent changes in the way in which the brain works.\\" See also * Christian contemplation * Jesus Prayer * Hesychasm  References Further reading * Sadhana: A Way to God. by Anthony de Mello. 1978. . * * Contemplative Prayer. by Thomas Merton.

He was educated at Bromsgrove School before joining the ; he was commissioned into the 6th Foot in 1860, but transferred to the 2nd West India Regiment in 1866. He became private secretary to Sir John Peter Grant, Governor of Jamaica from 1868 to 1873, and was invalided in the Ashanti campaign in West Africa. Colonial administration in Africa Lanyon served as administrator in southern African territories in the 1870s. His autocratic outlook and low opinion of the local peoples made him immensely unpopular during his terms of office.Selections from the correspondence of J. X. Merriman. Van Riebeeck Society. Cape Town. (1960) Administrator of the Griqualand West Colony (1873- Feb. 1879) Caricature from \\"Incwadi Yami\\", showing Major William Owen Lanyon being eaten by the Cape Colony. In South Africa, he served as Lieutenant Governor of Griqualand West from 1873 until 1879. Known at the time as \\"the Major\\", his term in office was beset with controversy. Racial tensions, lawsuits as well as territorial disputes with neighbouring states caused immense turmoil. He was also extremely unpopular with the local inhabitants and had to subdue armed rebellions. The neighbouring Cape Colony, semi-independent and the largest state in the region, was considered the only local entity with the resources to govern Griqualand West. The Cape Prime Minister John Molteno, after repeatedly refusing to annex the costly and unstable territory, eventually consented to incorporate it. With the Cape signing of the Griqualand West Annexation Act, direct British rule over the territory ended. Lanyon famously referred to Griqualand West as the most \\"hideous and disgusting\\" place he had ever seen. Acting-Administrator of the Transvaal Colony (1879-1881) He then took over administration of Transvaal from Sir Theophilus Shepstone on 4 March 1879, and assisted the Governor Henry Bartle Frere in dealing with the restive Boer population. As in his previous position, Lanyon was immensely unpopular, with both the Boer and the Black African populations. Boer unrest steadily increased but Lanyon remained in his position until 8 August 1881, when the disastrous outbreak of the First Boer War took place. This saw the British defeated and evicted from the Transvaal, which returned to being an independent state. Lanyon then served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. Later life and death Lanyon became a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1878 and a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1880. He died of cancer in 1887 in New York.

It was intended to replace the existing (first-round) simplified Chinese characters that were already in use. The complete proposal contained a list of 248 characters that were to be simplified, as well as another list of 605 characters for evaluation and discussion. Of these, 21 from the first list and 40 from the second served as components of other characters, amplifying the impact on written Chinese. Following widespread confusion and opposition, the second round of simplification was officially rescinded on 24 June 1986 by the State Council. Since then, the PRC has used the first-round simplified characters as its official script. Rather than ruling out further simplification, however, the retraction declared that further reform of the Chinese characters should be done with caution. Today, some second-round simplified characters, while considered nonstandard, continue to survive in informal usage. The issue of whether and how simplification should proceed remains a matter of debate. Second Chinese Character Simplification Scheme (Draft), published in May 1977.  History  The traditional relationship between written Chinese and vernacular Chinese has been compared to that of Latin with the Romance languages in the Renaissance era. The modern simplification movement grew out of efforts to make the written language more accessible, which culminated in the replacement of Classical Chinese (wenyan) with Vernacular Chinese (baihua) in the early 20th century. The fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 and subsequent loss of prestige associated with classical writing helped facilitate this shift, but a series of further reforms aided by the efforts of reformers such as Qian Xuantong were ultimately thwarted by conservative elements in the new government and the intellectual class. Continuing the work of previous reformers, in 1956 the People's Republic of China promulgated the Scheme of Simplified Chinese Characters, later referred to as the \\"First Round\\" or \\"First Scheme.\\" The plan was adjusted slightly in the following years, eventually stabilizing in 1964 with a definitive list of character simplifications. These are the simplified Chinese characters that are used today in Mainland China and Singapore.See for information on Singapore. Note that, while Singapore adopted the First Scheme, it did not follow suit with the Second Scheme. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau did not adopt the simplifications, and the characters used in those places are known as traditional Chinese characters. The writing on this wall is meant to say \\"production output will increase multiple times\\" (‰∫ßÈáèÁøªÂá†Áï™), but uses non- standard characters. During the Cultural Revolution, such sights were common as citizens were encouraged to innovate and participate in the character simplification process.. \\"The publication of the 1964 list was meant to clarify what the limits [of character simplification] were. These limits again became obscure, however, with the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Character simplification had been represented all along as a kind of Marxist, proletarian process; as a consequence, coining and using new characters became a popular way to show that one's writing was being done in right spirit. Wall slogans, signs, and mimeographed literature of all kinds began to be embellished with abbreviations never seen before. Within a short time the Committee on Language Reform had turned to the task of collecting characters 'simplified by the masses'...\\" (emphasis added) Also released in 1964 was a directive for further simplification in order to improve literacy, with the goal of eventually reducing the number of strokes in commonly used characters to ten or fewer. This was to take place gradually, with consideration for both \\"ease of production [writing] and ease of recognition [reading].\\" In 1975, a second round of simplifications, the Second Scheme, was submitted by the Script Reform Committee of China to the State Council for approval. Like the First Scheme, it contained two lists, one (comprising 248 characters) for immediate use and another (comprising 605 characters) for evaluation and discussion. Of these, 21 from the first list and 40 from the second also served as components of other characters, which caused the Second Scheme to modify some 4,500 characters. On 20 December 1977, major newspapers such as the People's Daily and the Guangming Daily published the second-round simplifications along with editorials and articles strongly endorsing the changes. Both newspapers began to use the characters from the first list on the following day. The Second Scheme was received extremely poorly, and as early as mid-1978, the Ministry of Education and the Central Propaganda Department were asking publishers of textbooks, newspapers and other works to stop using the second-round simplifications. Second-round simplifications were taught inconsistently in the education system, and people used characters at various stages of official or unofficial simplification. Confusion and disagreement ensued. The Second Scheme was officially retracted by the State Council on 24 June 1986. The State Council's retraction also emphasized that Chinese character reform should henceforth proceed with caution, and that the forms of Chinese characters should be kept stable. Later that year, a final version of the 1964 list was published with minor changes, and no further changes have been made since.  Methods of simplification  Traditional characters (left) and their proposed simplifications (right) right The second round of simplification continued to use the methods used in the first round. For example: In some characters, the phonetic component of the character was replaced with a simpler one, while the radical was unchanged. For example: * ‚Üí (Ëâπ + Êâç) * ‚Üí ¶¨Å (Ëâπ + Êâç) * ÈÖí ‚Üí Ê∞ø * Á®≥ ‚Üí Á¶æ + Êñá * ÂÑí ‚Üí ‰∫ª+ ÂÖ• * ÁÅå ‚Üí ÊµÇ * ÂÜÄ ‚Üí ‰∏† * Âªñ ‚Üí Âπø + ‰∫Ü * ÂÉö ‚Üí †Ü® (‰∫ª+ ‰∫Ü) In some characters, entire components were replaced by ones that are similar in shape: * Âπï ‚Üí Â§ß + Â∑æ * Êï¥ ‚Üí Â§ß + Ê≠£ * Ëøé ‚Üí Ëøä * Á≠î ‚Üí ËçÖ * Êí§ ‚Üí ¢™É (Êâå + Âàá) * Èòé ‚Üí Èó´ In some characters, components that are complicated are replaced with a simpler one not similar in shape but sometimes similar in sound: * Èûã ‚Üí Âèà + Âú≠ * Áü≠ ‚Üí Áü¢ + Âçú * ÈÅì ‚Üí Ëæ∫ * Âö∑ ‚Üí †Æµ (Âè£ + ‰∏ä) In some characters, the radical is simply dropped, leaving only the phonetic. This results in mergers between previously distinct characters: * Á®Ä ‚Üí Â∏å * ÂΩ© ‚Üí Èáá * Â∏Æ ‚Üí ÈÇ¶ * ËùåËö™ ‚Üí ÁßëÊñó * ËöØËöì ‚Üí ‰∏òÂºï * Ë±´ ‚Üí ‰∫à In some characters, entire components are dropped: * Á≥ñ ‚Üí Á±≥ + Âπø * ÂÅú ‚Üí ‰ªÉ * È§ê ‚Üí Ê≠∫ * Èõ™ ‚Üí ÂΩê * ÂÆ£ ‚Üí „ùâ Some characters are simply replaced by a similar- sounding one (a rebus or phonetic loan). This also results in mergers between previously distinct characters: * Ëêß ‚Üí ËÇñ * Ëõã ‚Üí Êó¶ * Ê≥∞ ‚Üí Â§™ * ÈõÑ ‚Üí Âé∑ * È≥ú ‚Üí Ê°Ç * Á±ç ‚Üí Á¨à * Ëä≠/Á≤ë/Á¨Ü ‚Üí Â∑¥ * Ëù¥/Á≥ä/Áå¢ ‚Üí ËÉ° Reasons for failure The Second Scheme broke with a millennia-long cycle of variant forms coming into unofficial use and eventually being accepted (90 percent of the changes made in the First Scheme existed in mass use, many for centuries) in that it introduced new, unfamiliar character forms. The sheer number of characters it changed -- the distinction between simplifications intended for immediate use and those for review was not maintained in practice -- and its release in the shadow of the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1978) have been cited among the chief reasons for its failure. As a result of the Cultural Revolution, trained experts were expelled and the Second Scheme was compiled by the Committee and its staffers without outside consultation, which may also have been a factor. The exact circumstances surrounding the creation and release of the Second Scheme remain shrouded in mystery due to the still-classified nature of many documents and the politically sensitive nature of the issue. However, the Second Scheme is known to have encompassed only about 100 characters before its expansion to over 850. A two-year delay from 1975 to 1977 was officially blamed on Zhang Chunqiao, a member of the Gang of Four; however, there is little historical evidence to support this. Against the political backdrop of the Cultural Revolution, a special section known as the \\"748 Project\\" was formed with an emphasis on non-experts, under whose supervision the lists grew significantly. The bulk of the work is believed to have been performed by staffers without proper oversight. The Second Scheme's subsequent rejection by the public has been cited as a case study in a failed attempt to artificially control the direction of a language's evolution. Indeed, it was not embraced by the linguistic community in China upon its release; despite heavy promotion by official publications, Rohsenow observes that \\"in the case of some of the character forms constructed by the staff members themselves\\" the public at large found proposed changes \\"laughable.\\" Political issues aside, Chen objects to the notion that all characters should be reduced to ten or fewer strokes. He argues that a technical shortcoming of the Second Scheme was that the characters it reformed occur less often in writing than those of the First Scheme. As such it provided less benefit to writers while putting an unnecessary burden on readers in making the characters more difficult to distinguish. Citing several studies, Hannas similarly argues against the lack of differentiation and utility: \\"it was meaningless to lower the stroke count for its own sake.\\" Thus, he believes simplification and character limitation (reduction of the number of characters) both amount to a \\"zero-sum game\\" -- simplification in one area of use causing complication in another -- and concludes that \\"the 'complex' characters in Japanese and Chinese, with their greater redundancy and internal consistency, may have been the better bargain.\\"  Effects  left While the stated goal of further language reform was not changed, the 1986 conference which retracted the Second Scheme emphasized that future reforms should proceed with caution. It also \\"explicitly precluded any possibility of developing Hanyu Pinyin as an independent writing system (w√©nz√¨).\\" The focus of language planning policy in China following the conference shifted from simplification and reform to standardization and regulation of existing characters, and the topic of further simplification has since been described as \\"untouchable\\" in the field. However, the possibility of future changes remains,See (chapter 7, section 3) \\"Crackling the Hard Nut: Dealing with the Rescinded Second Scheme and Banned Traditional Characters\\". and the difficulties the Chinese writing system presents for information technology have renewed the Romanization debate.See (chapter 7, section 2) \\"Romanization - Old Questions, New Challenge\\". Also see (chapter 10) \\"Phonetization of Chinese\\". A playful name for a restaurant in Shanghai, which says \\"‰∏Ä‰Ω≥Ê≠∫ÂéÖ\\" instead of the homophonous standard \\"‰∏ÄÂÆ∂È§êÂéÖ.\\" Today, second round characters are officially regarded as incorrect. However, some have survived in informal contexts; this is because some people who were in school between 1977 and 1986 received their education in second-round characters. For example, eggs at markets are often advertised as \\"È∏°Êó¶\\" rather than \\"È∏°Ëõã,\\" parking venues may be marked \\"‰ªÉËΩ¶\\" rather than \\"ÂÅúËΩ¶,\\" and street side restaurants as \\"Ê≠∫ÂéÖ\\" rather than \\"È§êÂéÖ.\\" Another example is handwritten license plates from Hebei and Henan provinces, which often use ‰∏† and ‰∫à as opposed to ÂÜÄ and Ë±´ to represent those provinces. In three cases, the second round split one family name into two. The first round of simplification had already changed the common surnames Ëï≠ (XiƒÅo; #30 most common in 1982) and Èñª (Y√°n; #50) into and . The second round adjusted these further and combined them with other characters previously much less common as surnames: and . Similarly, ÂÇÖ (F√π; #36) was changed to . Following the retraction of the second round, many people still kept the new forms as their surnames so that the three family names are now written six or seven different ways.  Technical information  Most systems of Chinese character encoding, including Unicode and GB 18030, provide only partial support for second-round characters, with many such characters unencoded or yet to be standardized. Mojikyo supports 248 characters on the first list. Also, the font \\"SongUni-PUA\\" is composed primarily of the second-round characters.

It is a turn-based air combat game taking place during the early half of World War II, including fixed-wing aircraft, air battles and operations by Luftwaffe, Royal Air Force and French Air Force in 1939‚Äì1943. Achtung Spitfire! is a prequel to the 1996 video game Over the Reich, which takes place during the latter half of the war. Another game in the series, Third Reich PC, was also released in 1996. Rather than being designed for serious flight simulation experts, Achtung Spitfire! is catered around the interests of all World War II hobbyists. Gameplay As a pilot in the French Air Force, the player is trying to fight some Luftwaffe pilots. Players must command a series of pilots as they try to achieve the goals of the current mission. Technological changes over the years of the war result in faster and better planes to fly in. After choosing the pilots, the player must either defend his own allies, combat enemy fighters/bombers or undertake an interception mission vital to the war effort. The game uses the same flight engine and graphic user interface of Over the Reich; granting the same amount of limited autonomy in every game. Players must watch their speed, torque and altitude. Otherwise, they could stall or simply crash into the ground. Many of the flying techniques found in the actual World War II cannot be recreated in this game due to in-game limitations. Players cannot do cover fire techniques in addition to being unable to advance fire towards the enemy. The entire game stops at 1943, which is between the Battle of Britain and the Invasion of Normandy. Scenarios can be quickly generated in a method similar to Jane's Advanced Tactical Fighters. There is a mini-encyclopedia containing vital information about 25 of the aircraft used in this game. Multiplayer gameplay is possible either through either Internet or play by e-mail. Squadrons which survive until 1943 can be transferred over to Over the Reich. Reception Critics widely agreed that Achtung Spitfire! is accessible and easy to play, yet offers a rich spectrum of challenges and strategic possibilities. GameSpot particularly noted the graduated skill system, saying this solves a common problem of wargames by allowing the player the option of gradually easing themselves into the game's mechanics. The large number of available scenarios was also praised, though Computer Games Magazine felt the Battle of Britain campaign to be the highlight. The reviewer called Achtung Spitfire! \\"a very rich wargame, one in which the player's decisions have an immediate and dramatic effect on the outcome.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, stating that \\"Achtung Spitfire isn't breaking new ground, but it is a solid and entertaining game, and a thoughtful diversion from the usually frenetic nature of computer games.\\" Achtung Spitfire! was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1997 \\"Wargame Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Sid Meier's Gettysburg! The editors called Spitfire! \\"simply the best Battle of Britain game ever.\\" ReferencesExternal links * *Achtung Spitfire at IGN *Achtung Spitfire! at GameSpot Category:1997 video games Category:Avalon Hill video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:North America- exclusive video games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Windows games Category:World War II video games ","title":"Achtung Spitfire!"},{"id":"3804115","text":"Bruno Manser (25 August 1954 ‚Äì presumed dead 10 March 2005) was a Swiss environmental activist. From 1984 to 1990, he stayed with the Penan tribe in Sarawak, Malaysia, organising several blockades against timber companies. After he emerged from the forests in 1990, he engaged in public activism for rainforest preservation and the human rights of indigenous peoples, especially the Penan, which brought him into conflict with the Malaysian government. He also founded the Swiss non-governmental organization (NGO) Bruno Manser Fonds in 1991. He disappeared during his last journey to Sarawak in May 2000 and is presumed dead.  Early life and education  Bruno Manser was born in Basel, Switzerland on 25 August 1954 in a family of three girls and two boys. During his younger days, Manser was an independent thinker. His parents wanted him to become a doctor, and he studied medicine informally. He later completed his upper secondary school, the first in his family to do so. Manser spent three months in Lucerne prison when he was 19 years old because, as an ardent follower of non-violent ideologies espoused by Mahatma Gandhi (Satyagraha) he refused to participate in Switzerland's compulsory military service. After leaving prison in 1973, he worked as a sheep and cow herder at various Swiss Alpine pastures for twelve years. During this time, Manser became interested in handicrafts, therapeutics, and speleology. He laid bricks, carved leather, kept bees, and wove, dyed, and cut his own clothes and shoes. He also regularly pursued mountaineering and technical climbing. At the age of 30, Manser went to Borneo, looking to live a simpler life. Searching for Penans In 1983, Manser went to the Malaysian state of Terengganu and stayed with a family. In 1984, while learning more about the rainforests, Manser learned of a nomadic tribe known as the Penan. After learning more about the tribe, he decided to attempt to live amongst them for a few years and traveled to the East Malaysian state of Sarawak in 1984 on a tourist visa. In Malaysia, Manser first joined an English caving expedition to explore Gunung Mulu National Park. After the expedition, he stepped deeper into the interior jungles of Sarawak, intending to find the \\"deep essence of humanity\\" and \\"the people who are still living close to their nature.\\" However, he quickly became lost and ran out of food while exploring the jungle, then fell ill after eating a poisonous palm heart. After these setbacks, Manser finally found Penan nomadic tribes near the headwaters of the Limbang river at Long Seridan in May 1984. Initially, the Penan people tried to ignore him. After a while, the Penan accepted him as one of their family members. In August 1984, Manser went to Kota Kinabalu, Sabah to obtain a visa to visit Indonesia. On the Indonesian visa, he entered Kalimantan, then illegally crossed the border back into Long Seridan. His Malaysian visa expired on 31 December 1984.  Life with the Penans  Bruno Manser, 1993 Manser learned about survival skills in the jungle and familiarized himself with the Penan's culture and language. The Penan tribal leader in Upper Limbang, named Along Sega, became Manser's mentor. During his stay with the Penan, Manser adopted their way of life. He dressed in a loincloth, hunted with a blowgun, and ate primates, snakes, and sago. Manser's decision to live as a member of the Penan was ridiculed in the West, and he was dismissed as a \\"White Tarzan\\". Within the Penan, however, Manser was known as \\"Laki Penan\\" (Penan Man), having earned the respect of the tribe that adopted him. Manser created notebooks that were richly illustrated with drawings, notes, and 10,000 photographs during his six-year stay from 1984 to 1990 with the Penan people. Some of his sketches include cicada wing patterns, how to carry a gibbon with a stick, and how to drill holes on a blowpipe. These notebooks were later published by Christoph Merian Verlag press in Basel. Manser also created audio recordings of oral histories told by Penan elders and translated them. He claimed that the Penan people were never argumentative or violent during his time with them. In 1988, Manser tried to reach the summit of Bukit Batu Lawi but was unsuccessful, finding himself hanging on a rope without anything to grab on for 24 hours. In 1989, he was bitten by a red tailed pit viper but was able to treat the snake bite himself. He also got a malaria infection while living in the jungles. Unfortunately, deforestation of Sarawak's primeval forests started during Manser's stay with the Penan. As a result, the Penan suffered from reduced vegetation, contaminated drinking water, fewer animals available for hunting, and the desecration of their heritage sites. Manser worked with Along Sega to teach the Penan how to organize road blockades against advancing loggers. Manser organised his first blockade in September 1985.  Activism  Manser gave many lectures in Switzerland and abroad, making connections to people within the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN). As an activist, he visited American and African jungles, staying in various locations for a few weeks. He returned almost every year after leaving the Penan to follow up with the logging activities and to provide assistance to the tribe, often entering these areas illegally, crossing the border with Brunei and Kalimantan, Indonesia. He discovered that logging conglomerates such as Rimbunan Hijau, Samling, and the WTK Group continued their operations in Sarawak rainforests. As a result, Manser organised the Voices for the Borneo Rainforests World Tour after he left the Sarawak forests in 1990. Manser, Kelabit activist Anderson Mutang Urud, and two Penan tribe members travelled from Australia to North America, Europe, and Japan.Tsing, A.L(2003). In Nature In The Global South - Volume 7 of New perspectives in South Asian history. Orient Blackswan. p. 332, 334. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 31 August 2014. On 17 July 1991, during the 17th G7 summit, Manser climbed unaided to the top of a 30-foot high lamp post outside of the summit's media centre in London. After reaching the top, he unrolled a banner that displayed a message about the plight of Sarawak rainforests. He chained himself to the lamp post for two and a half hours. His protest also coincided with protests by Earth First! and the London Rainforest Action Group. Police used a hoist to reach the top of the lamp post and cut his chains. Manser climbed down the lamp post without force at 1:40 PM. He was then taken to the Bow Street police station and held until the summit ended at 6:30 PM, when he was released without being charged with an offense. Later in 1991, Manser set up Bruno Manser Fonds (BMF), a fund designed to help conserve the rainforests and the indigenous population in Sarawak. He ran the fund from his home at Heuberg 25, Basel, Switzerland. Bruno Manser 1993 during a hunger strike In June 1992, Manser parachuted into a crowded stadium during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In December 1992, he led a twenty-day hunger strike in front of the Marubeni Corporation headquarters in Tokyo. In 1993, he went on a sixty-day hunger strike at the Federal Palace of Switzerland ('\\"Bundeshaus\\") to press the Swiss Federal Assembly on enforcing a ban on tropical timber imports and mandatory declarations of timber products. The hunger strike was supported by 37 organisations and political parties. Manser only stopped the hunger strike after his mother requested that he do so. After Manser's disappearance, the Federal Assembly finally adopted the Declaration of Timber Products on 1 October 2010, with a transition period allowed until the end 2011. In 1995, Manser went to Congo rainforests to document the effects of wars and logging on Mbuti people. In 1996, on the German-language programme f√ºnf vor zw√∂lf (At the Eleventh Hour), Manser and his friend Jacques Christinet used auxiliary cable to drop themselves down 800 meters onto the Klein Matterhorn aerial cable car and hung sizable banners there. They reached the dangerous speed of 140 kilometers per hour while riding on a self-made rider with steel wheels and ball bearings. In 1997, Manser and Christinet tried to enter Peninsular Malaysia from Singapore to fly a motorised hang- glider during the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. However, he was recognised at the border and denied entry into Malaysia. They then decided to swim across the Straits of Johor into Malaysia, but later abandoned the plan as it involved a lengthy 25-kilometer swim and a passage through a swamp across the straits. They planned an alternative route, opting to row a boat from an Indonesian island into Sarawak. However, BMF received a warning from Malaysian embassy warning of the consequences for such an act. In 1998, Manser and Christinet travelled to Brunei and swam across the 300-metre wide Limbang river at night. Christinet was almost fatally injured by drifting logs along the river. They spent three weeks in Sarawak hiding from the police. During that period, they attempted to order four tons of 25-centimeter nails for the Penan to hammer into the tree trunks, which could have caused serious injuries to loggers when the embedded nails inevitably came into contact with chainsaws. Impact In 1986, Manser's representative in Switzerland, Roger Graf, wrote about sixty letters to Western media outlets, but none took notice of them. It was only in March 1986 that Rolf B√∂kemeier, an editor for the GEO magazine based in Hamburg, Germany, who also specialised in indigenous people, wrote a letter of reply to Graf. In October 1986, GEO published a 24-page article entitled: \\"You have the world - leave us the wood!\\" which included photos taken during their undercover tours with Manser, as well as Manser's drawings. The article was later reprinted all over the world in Australia, Japan, and Canada, leading to the attention of human rights and environmental organisations and green parliamentarians around the world. After hearing of Manser's actions, then-Congressman Al Gore condemned logging activities in Sarawak. Prince Charles also described the treatment for the Penan as \\"genocide.\\" The BBC and the National Geographic Channel produced documentaries about the Penan, and Penan stories were also featured on ABC's Primetime Live. Universal Studios started to develop an action-adventure horror script where the Penan used their forest wisdom to save the world from catastrophe. The Penan also received coverage in Newsweek, Time, and The New Yorker. Warner Bros screenwriter David Franzoni also developed a script named My Friend Bruno after they signed a contract with Manser in January 1992. Manser received $20,000 a year until 1998 for the rights to film his life. However, due to its unsatisfying ending, the script was not taken up by the studio. Response from Malaysian authorities Manser's actions drew anger from Malaysian authorities, who declared him persona non-grata (an unwelcome person) in the country. A reported bounty for his capture ranging from US$30,000Human Rights Watch, Natural Resources Defense Council (1992). In Defending the Earth: Abuses of Human Rights and the Environment. Human Rights Watch. p. 62\\\\. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 11 August 2014. to US$50,000 has been circulated by word-of-mouth, but the source of the bounty is unknown. By 1990, Malaysia declared Manser as the \\"number one enemy of the state\\" and sent special units to search for him. Using a forged passport and styling his hair differently, Manser returned to Switzerland in 1990 to inform the public about the situation in Sarawak through the Swiss media. Response by Malaysian federal government Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad blamed Manser for disrupting law and order. Mahathir wrote a letter to Manser, telling him that it was \\"about time that you stop your arrogance and your intolerable European superiority. You are no better than the Penan.\\" In March 1992, Mahathir wrote another letter to Manser: Response by Sarawak state government The Sarawak government defended its logging policy by stating that revenue from timber sales is needed to feed more than 250,000 of the state population. Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud said, \\"It is hoped that outsiders will not interfere in our internal affairs, especially people like Bruno Manser. The Sarawak government has nothing to hide. Ours is an open liberal society.\\"Mitetelman, J.H. Othman, N. (2003). In Capturing globalisation. Routledge. p. 89\\\\. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 31 August 2014. Sarawak Minister of Housing and Public Health James Wong said that, \\"We don't want them [the Penan] running around [in jungles] like animals. No one has the ethical right to deprive the Penans of the right to assimilation into Malaysian society.\\"Davis, W.(2007). In Light at the Edge of the World: A Journey Through the Realm of Vanishing Cultures. Douglas & McIntyre. p. 140, 141. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 31 August 2014. The Sarawak government tightened the entry of foreign environmentalists, journalists, and film crews into the state, and allowed logging companies to hire criminal gangs to subdue the indigenous people. Arrest attempts Manser was first arrested on 10 April 1986 after being spotted by police inspector Lores Matios. He was delivering a document for Kelabit chiefs at Long Napir to sign to confirm their wish of further protecting their territories. At the same time, Matios was also on holiday at Long Napir. He immediately arrested Manser for breaking immigration law and brought him to Limbang police station for interrogation. Manser was not handcuffed, as the inspector did not carry them while on holiday. During the 90-minute ride to Limbang, the Land Rover that carried Manser came close to running out of petrol. While the vehicle stopped to refuel after crossing a bridge, Manser was urinating at the side of the road. While Matios was steps away giving orders to subordinates, Manser took the opportunity to run away, dive into dense undergrowth, and run across the Limbang river by jumping from stone to stone. Matios shouted at him and used his pistol to fire two shots at Manser, but he successfully escaped capture. On 14 November 1986, Manser met with James Ritchie, a reporter from the New Straits Times, in an isolated hut in the Limbang jungles. Ritchie came by helicopter to interview Manser. After the interview, Rithcie told Manser that: \\"As a human being, you are right. Yet as a citizen of this country I have to say no to you, Please don't be angry with me if the story doesn't sound too good.\\" After Ritchie's team left, Manser stayed in the hut until the next day. As he went to the mouth of the Met√© river to wash himself, he noticed a boat mooring at the river. He heard a friendly voice called him, \\"Oh, Laki Dja-au!\\" but instead saw two soldiers pursuing him. The soldiers were instructed to capture Manser alive without firing any bullets. Manser immediately put down his blowpipe and a rucksack on the river bank, then dove into the river and disappeared under the heavy undergrowth of the forest floor. Manser successfully evaded capture, but he lost seven months of his drawings and notebooks in the rucksack. Feeling betrayed, Manser wrote a complaint letter against Rithcie to New Straits Times and was published on 1 February 1987. However, Ritchie denied any involvement in Manser arrest. On 25 March 1990, Manser was disguised as \\"Alex Betge\\" to board MH 873 flight from Miri to Kuching. In the airport, Manser and his friend met police inspector Lores Matios at the boarding area. However, Matios was on his way to take a law exam at Kuching and he didn't notice the disguised Manser on board. Manser arrived Kuching uneventfully and then took a flight on 26 March to Kuala Lumpur. On 27 March, Swiss ambassador to Kuala Lumpur Charles Steinhaeuslin made a surprise visit to Sarawak chief minister in Kuching.  Dealing with Abdul Taib Mahmud  In mid-1998, Manser offered an end of hostilities with the Sarawak government if Chief Minister Taib Mahmud would be willing to cooperate with him in building a biosphere around the Penan's territory. Manser also wanted the government to forgive him for breaking Malaysian immigration laws. The offer was denied. His successive attempts to establish communications with Taib Mahmud failed. Manser planned to deliver a lamb named \\"Gumperli\\" to Taib Mahmud by air as a symbol of reconciliation during the Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebration. However, the Malaysian consulate at Geneva pressured airlines not to transport the lamb to Sarawak. Manser later carried the lamb with him on a plane and parachuted over the United Nations Office at Geneva, hoping to bring international attention to Sarawak. In March 1999, Manser successfully passed Kuching immigration by disguising himself in a business suit, carrying a briefcase, and wearing a badly knotted tie. On 29 March, he flew a motorised paraglider, carrying a toy lamb knitted by himself while wearing a T-shirt with the image of a sheep, and made a few turns above Taib Mahmud's residence in Kuching. There were ten Penan tribe members waiting on the ground to greet Manser. At 11:30 AM, he landed the glider beside a road just outside Taib Mahmud's residence and was immediately arrested. He was then transported to Kuala Lumpur, briefly imprisoned, then deported back to Switzerland via Malaysia Airlines Flight MH2683. Manser was seen playing with his knitted toy lamb by his jailers. By 2000, Manser admitted that his efforts did not bring positive changes to Sarawak. His success rate in Sarawak was \\"less than zero\\" and he was deeply saddened by the result. On 15 February 2000, just before his last trip to Sarawak, Manser said that, \\"[t]hrough his logging license policies, Taib Mahmud is personally responsible for the destruction of nearly all Sarawak rainforests in one generation.\\"  Disappearance  On 15 February 2000, Manser left to visit his Penan friends via the jungle paths of Kalimantan, Indonesia, accompanied by BMF secretary John Kuenzli and a film crew. After a period of time, Kuenzli and the film crew left Manser in the Kalimantan jungles. At the time, Manser was still writing postcards to his friends. Manser continued his journey with another friend who knew the way around the territory. The trip continued for two weeks, crossing mountains and rivers on foot and by boat. Manser slept on a hammock while his friend slept on the ground. On 18 May, they reached the Sarawak/Kalimantan border, spending their final night there. Manser asked his friend to carry a postcard back to Charlotte, his girlfriend in Switzerland. According to his friend, Manser looked healthy when they parted ways. Manser complained about diarrhea and a broken rib in the postcard. According to Kuenzli, Manser crossed the Sarawak/Kalimantan border on 22 May with the help of a local guide. His last known communication was a letter mailed to Charlotte while hiding in Bario. In the letter, Manser said he was very tired while waiting for the sun to set before continuing his journey along the logging roads. The letter was deposited at the Bario post office and reached Switzerland with a Malaysian stamp, but without a post office stamp. Manser was last seen carrying a 30-kilogram backpack by his Penan friend, Paleu, and Paleu's son on 25 May 2000. They accompanied Manser until they saw Bukit Batu Lawi. Manser stated his intention to climb the mountain alone and requested Paleu to leave him there. Manser has not been seen since. Search expeditions BMF and the Penan tried to search for Manser without any success. Areas around the Limbang river were searched by the Penan. Penan expedition teams tracked Manser to his last sleeping place. They followed Manser's machete cuts into the thick forests until the trail reached the swamp at the foot of Bukit Batu Lawi. There was no trace of him in the swamp, going back from the swamp, or trace of anyone else coming into the area. BMF sent a helicopter to circle the limestone pinnacles. However, none of the search teams were willing to scale the last 100 metres of steep limestone that formed the peak of Batu Lawi. It is possible that Manser fell down the side of the mountain, but neither his body nor his belongings have been found. However, two local guides who brought Manser across the jungles of Sarawak were found. In desperation, fortune tellers and Penan necromancers were called. All of them agreed Manser was still alive. On 18 November 2000, BMF requested that the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) search for Manser. Investigations were carried out at the Swiss Consulate in Kuala Lumpur and the Swiss Honorary Consulate in Kuching.  Aftermath  In January 2002, hundreds of Penan members organised a tawai ceremony to celebrate Manser. The Penan refer to Manser as Laki Tawang (man who has become lost) or Laki e'h metat (man who has disappeared), rather than his name, because speaking the names of the dead is taboo in Penan culture. On 18 Nov 2001, eighteen months after his disappearance, he was awarded the International Society for Human Rights prize for Switzerland. After search expeditions proved fruitless, a civil court in Basel-Stadt declared Manser to be legally dead on 10 March 2005. On 8 May 2010, a memorial service was held in Elisabethen church, Basel to mark the tenth anniversary of his disappearance. Roughly 500 people attended the service. To celebrate Manser's 60th birthday on 25 August 2014, a species of goblin spider that was discovered by a Dutch-Swiss research expedition in Pulong Tau National Park in the 1990s is now named after Manser: Aposphragisma brunomanseri.

The company is a minority owner of The Hershey Company and sole private owner of Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company and administrator of the 2,000 student Milton Hershey School. It manages the $13.751 billion USD (2015) endowment of the Milton Hershey School and School Trust. History On April 28, 1905, the Pennsylvania Department of State issued a charter creating the Hershey Trust Company. In 1909, when Hershey founded the Milton Hershey School, Hershey appointed the Trust as administrator of the school trust. 2011 investigation of the Hershey Trust Company In February 2011, Robert Reese (grandson of H. B. Reese the inventor of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups), a former board member and president of the Trust, filed a lawsuit against the Hershey Trust Company alleging that Trust had been improperly using the Trust's money. One particular issue was the purchase of the Wren Dale Golf Course, in which the Hershey Trust overpaid for the property, to the benefit of board members who were both owners of the Wren Dale Golf Course and on the Hershey Trust board. Reese withdrew the lawsuit in April 2011, due to deteriorating health. Reese suggested the Pennsylvania Attorney General had enough cause to investigate the Hershey Trust. In 2013, Kathleen Kane, the Pennsylvania Attorney General, announced the conclusion of a two-year investigation into the operations of the Hershey Trust Company, in which the Office of Attorney General and the Hershey Trust Company agreed that there was a finding of no wrongdoing, but reforms were required of the trust company. 2016 developments In May, 2016, the state attorney general asked the company to remove three members from the ten-person board. The attorney general said that the three had allowed \\"apparent violations\\" of the 2013 agreement. At about the same time, in an unrelated investigation, John Estey, former chief of staff to Gov. Ed Rendell and a high-ranking executive of the company was charged with wire fraud, having pocketed $13,000 that an FBI sting operation had given to him in an investigation into illegal lobbying of legislators.

History Plan of the fort The European history of this area starts with Henry Hudson sailing into Hudson Bay in 1610. The area was recognized as important in the fur trade and of potential importance for other discoveries. The fort is built in a star shape. Original (wood) fort This fort began as a log fort built in 1717 by James Knight of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) and was originally called the Churchill River Post. In 1719, the post was renamed Prince of Wales Fort. It was located on the west bank of the Churchill River to protect and control the HBC's interests in the fur trade. Construction of the present stone fort The original wooden fort was replaced by a massive stone fort, probably to abide by the Royal Charter which required that Rupert's Land should be fortified. Construction of this fort, a structure still standing today, was started in 1731 near what was then called Eskimo Point. It was in the form of a square, with sides long and walls tall and thick at the base. It had forty- two cannon mounted on the walls. There was also a battery across the river on Cape Merry meant to hold six more cannon. Work on the fort continued almost without break until 1771, but it was never truly completed. In battle In the 1780s, the French government launched a Hudson Bay expedition to damage HBC activities in that bay. Three French warships of the expedition, led by Jean-Fran√ßois de La P√©rouse, captured the Prince of Wales Fort in 1782. The fort was manned by only 39 (non-military) men at the time, and the fort's governor, Samuel Hearne, recognised the numerical and military imbalance and surrendered without a single shot being fired. The French partially destroyed the fort, but its mostly-intact ruins survive to this day. The fort returned to the HBC in 1783. Thereafter, its importance waned with the decline in the fur trade although the post was refounded a little way up the river. Map of Prince of Wales Fort prepared in black ink by R.I. Ruggles, from original manuscript (map G. 1/19) in the Archives, Hudson's Bay Company, London. Structures The remains of these buildings still stand in the Fort, although none of them are intact, with roofs long since deteroriated. * Rough Stone Dwelling House * Governor's Quarters * Storehouse * Men's Quarters and Barracks * Stonemason's Workshop * Cooper and Carpenter Workshops * Tailor's Room * Blacksmith Shop The courtyard is intact and all other exposed areas covered by grass. Restoration After the construction of the Hudson Bay Railway to Churchill was completed in 1929, railway labour and railway construction equipment was used to restore the fort. Restoration work was also performed in the late 1950s. Archaeological investigations at and around the fort began in 1958. Since 2005, Parks Canada archaeologists have been working in and around the fort in conjunction with a large-scale wall stabilization work and a fort interpretation program. Legacy In 1920, the site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. A series of journals written by explorer Samuel Hearne on a journey from Prince of Wales Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean was published by the Champlain Society in 1911. On 28 June 1985, Canada Post issued 'Fort Prince of Wales, Man.', one of the 20 stamps in the \\"Forts Across Canada Series\\". The fort is also the subject of one of the National Film Board of Canada's Canada Vignettes.

The player does not assign citizens to their various punishments and rewards since the game does this automatically. Instead, the player creates the infrastructure (roads, zones for the various sins/virtues, reincarnation centers) that allows the afterlife to function properly. Players are accountable for the job that they do because of their bosses, The Powers That Be, check in from time to time. The player also has the assistance of two advisors‚ÄîAria Goodhalo, an angel, and Jasper Wormsworth, a demon. Aria and Jasper provide warnings when things are going wrong with the afterlife, and offer tips on how to fix the problems. The game is very satirical, with various references to pop culture (such as a passing mention of a \\"San Quentin Scarearantino\\" or sending a Death Star to destroy buildings if the player cheats too much). Gameplay The primary goal of the game is to provide divine and infernal services for the inhabitants of the afterlife. This afterlife caters to one particular planet, known simply as the Planet. The creatures living on the Planet are called EMBOs, or Ethically Mature Biological Organisms. When an EMBO dies, its soul travels to the afterlife where it attempts to find an appropriate \\"fate structure\\". Fate structures are places where souls are rewarded or punished, as appropriate, for the virtues or sins that they practiced while they were alive. While the seven sins are based on the seven deadly sins, only two of the seven virtues correspond to the seven heavenly virtues. {Sins: *Envy *Avarice *Gluttony *Sloth *Pride *Wrath *Lust  Virtues: *Contentment *Charity *Temperance *Diligence *Humility *Peacefulness *Chastity } Alternatively, players can choose to lay down generic zones for fate structures, that can house all souls of all types easily. However, these structures do not support as much population or are as effective as the single virtues/sins, and are more of a short-term solution for lost souls who cannot find a reward/punishment. Jasper (left) and Aria (right), the player's advisors The paths that souls take through the afterlife depend largely on the tenets of the souls' belief systems. Depending on these tenets, a soul may visit a single fate structure or it may be rewarded/punished for multiple sins or virtues. Tenets also determine whether a soul will visit only Heaven, only Hell, or both, as well as whether that soul will reincarnate after it has received its final reward or punishment. The player can view of the current distribution of sins and virtues on the Planet, as well as the percentages of EMBOs who believe in each of the tenets. The player may spend a considerable amount of money to influence an important EMBO on the Planet. This influence can cause the EMBO to adopt one or more of the sins or virtues, as well as persuade him or her to believe in the tenet or tenets selected. This EMBO will then spread their newfound ideals, which will cause a shift in the beliefs and sins/virtues in the surrounding area. At the start of the game, the EMBOs on the planet will be at the lowest level of technology, which is fire. As the game progresses, new technologies are discovered, ranging from pottery to medicine to aviation. New technologies help the EMBOs to become more widespread on the planet, which means a larger population for the afterlife when they die. The development of new technologies can be assisted by wielding influence on an EMBO artist or inventor in the same way that EMBOs are persuaded to new tenets or sins and virtues. Screenshot from the game Most buildings in the afterlife produce Vibes, which are a measure of how buildings affect one another. Buildings can either produce \\"good vibes\\" or \\"bad vibes\\". Fate structures need to be under the appropriate type of vibe (good in Heaven, bad in Hell) in order to evolve into larger and more efficient structures. As Demiurge, the player receives a yearly paycheque from The Powers That Be. The amount received is based on a number of factors, such as the number of souls that passed through the gates of the afterlife in that year. The player's afterlife is staffed by angels (in Heaven) and demons (in Hell). At first, all workers are imported and must commute from other afterlives, which quickly becomes expensive. The costs can be lowered by building Topias to house workers in the player's afterlife, making the commute unnecessary. Employment costs can be further reduced by building training centers, which train processed souls to become angels and demons. Balance can be done in two ways. The first, the Micromanager, allows the player to browse a specific structure and adjust its balance level for free unless the player decides to lock the structure, in which case a maintenance fee is charged yearly. The balance level is measured in a grayscale bar, with the two extremes dedicating to research (permanent souls) or production (temporary souls). The Macromanager, on the other hand, allows the player to balance manually or automatically all fate structures of a specific virtue/sin simultaneously. \\"Bad Things\\", which are akin to natural disasters, occur at random. Each one can be repelled by one of the Special Buildings that are granted as rewards for reaching population milestones. Bad Things can be disabled via an in-game menu. However, doing so decreases the player's soul rate by half. Like most god games, Afterlife is open-ended and does not have set conditions for winning. There are, however, a few definite ways of losing the game. These include having an excessive number of unemployed workers (leading to an all-out war between Heaven and Hell), staying too deep in debt for too long, and the Planet's population being wiped out by either nuclear warfare or an asteroid event. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. A Next Generation critic called Afterlife \\"a title that will immediately attract anyone who was even mildly amused by the mother of all sim-builders, SimCity\\", and praised the vast number of options and responsibilities, the characters, and the complex government. They also made similar praises of the PC version, but with a lower score. Macworld gave Afterlife its 1996 \\"Best Simulation Game\\" award.

Biography He was a great-grandson of Rabban Gamaliel the Elder; he also purportedly traced his ancestry back to King David.Rabbi Yehiel Ben Shlomo Heilprin - Later Achronim Rashi, the great medieval commentator, was a 33rd-generation descendant of Rabbi Yochanan. The name \\"HaSandlar\\" may imply that Rabbi Yohanan earned his living as a shoemaker, but it could also indicate that he was a native of Alexandria, Egypt. He was one of the main students of Rabbi Akiva and a contemporary of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.Genesis Rabbah 61:3; Ecclesiastes Rabbah 11:6; compare Yevamot 62b Once, he went with several colleagues to the Valley of Rimmon to institute a leap-year. Rabbi Meir had just cited an opinion which he ascribed to Akiba, but the authenticity of which Johanan denied, adding, \\"I have waited on R. Akiba standing [by his side as an advanced student] longer than you did sitting [as a mere hearer].\\" The learned company took umbrage at this derogatory remark, and murmured, \\"Johanan ha-Sandalar is a true Alexandrian [given to boasting].\\" The incident, however, ended in reconciliation, and the disputants did not leave the session without kissing each other.Yerushalmi Hagigah 3 78d; see Rapoport, \\"'Erek Millin,\\" p. 102a Because he is called here \\"a true Alexandrian,\\" it is assumed that he was a native of Alexandria. Once, he once exposed himself to great danger to obtain an authoritative halachic decision. During the Hadrianic persecutions, when many rabbis had been put to death for teaching Judaism, Rabbi Akiva was imprisoned and awaiting his doom at the command of Rufus. A marital question agitated the rabbis, and Johanan undertook to procure the closely guarded Akiva's advice upon it. Disguised as a peddler, he offered some goods for sale near the prison: \\"Who wants needles? Who wants hooks? How about private halitzah?\\" Akiba, looking out through an aperture, said in reply, \\"Do you have spindles? Do you have kasher (= \\"valid\\")?\\"Yerushalmi Yevamot 12 12d At one time during the persecutions, Johanan and Eleazar ben Shammua left Palestine, intending to betake themselves to Judah ben Bathyra in Nisibis; but they did not carry out their intention. By the time they arrived at Sidon they felt too homesick to proceed any farther, and returned.

Scott built Pebble Hill in 1847 at the center of a plantation. The structure was built in the Greek Revival style with hand- hewn heart of pine floors and joists and rafters held together by wooden pegs. During the Civil War, Wilson's Raiders looted the home, but were unable to find many of the valuables, which had been buried near a spring on the property. By the end of the Civil War, Scott was forced to sell the home, which saw a number of different owners over the following decades. In 1912, the home was purchased by Cecil S. Yarbrough, a state representative and three-time mayor of Auburn. The home remained in the Yarbrough family until 1974, when it was purchased and restored by the Auburn Heritage Association.

After intersecting the southern terminus of County Road 591 (Rocky Ford Road), the Madison County Four Freedoms TrailFour Freedoms Trail (Madison County, Florida Recreation Department) begins along the southeast side of the road, which begins to curve toward the north and the street name is changed to Colin Kelly Highway. The surroundings along SR 145 north of Madison are typical of most state and county two-lane roads along the Florida Panhandle, consisting of random farms and forests with occasional embankments over wetlands. The road runs mostly northeast from the city, but straightens out briefly around the intersection of Rocky Springs Church Road. It curves back to the northeast after the intersection of two dirt roads named Northeast 113th and 115th Avenues. where the Four Freedoms Trail crosses from the east side to the west side. The closest resemblance to a major intersection at this point is with County Road 150, where a concurrency begins just before the road enters the unincorporated community of Pinetta. Within Pinetta, the trail moves away from SR 145/CR 150 just south of the intersection of Poppy Trail and runs along the parallel Northeast Persimmon Drive, while SR 145/CR 150 continues north through the town. The SR 145/CR 150 concurrency ends at Northeast Belleville Road where CR 150 turns east, and after this SR 145 curves even more toward the northeast than it was since leaving Madison. Eventually, that eastern trajectory begins to wane. As the road curves back toward the north, the last intersection in the state is with Northeast Oak Hill Road and the street name of SR 145 changes from Colin Kelly Highway to Madison Highway. State Road 145 ends at the Florida-Georgia State Line, becoming Georgia State Route 31 as it crosses a bridge over the Withlacoochee River.

Uchtred or Uhtred, called the Bold (died 1016), was the ealdorman of all Northumbria from 1006 to 1016, when he was assassinated. He was the son of Waltheof I, ealdorman of Bamburgh, whose ancient family had ruled from the castle of Bamburgh on the Northumbrian coast. Career In 995, according to Symeon of Durham, when the remains of St Cuthbert were transferred from Chester-le-Street to Durham, Uhtred went to Durham with his monks to clear the site of the new cathedral. The new cathedral was founded by Bishop Aldhun, and Uhtred married Aldhun's daughter, Ecgfrida, probably at about this time. From his marriage he received several estates that had belonged to the church.Oxford DNB login In 1006 Malcolm II of Scotland invaded Northumbria and besieged the newly founded episcopal city of Durham. At that time the Danes were raiding southern England and King Ethelred was unable to send help to the Northumbrians. Ealdorman Waltheof was too old to fight and remained in his castle at Bamburgh. Ealdorman √Ülfhelm of York also took no action. Uhtred, acting for his father, called together an army from Bernicia and Yorkshire and led it against the Scots. The result was a decisive victory for Uhtred. Local women washed the severed heads of the Scots, receiving a payment of a cow for each, and the heads were fixed on stakes to Durham's walls. Uhtred was rewarded by King Ethelred II with the ealdormanry of Bamburgh even though his father was still alive. In the meantime, Ethelred had Ealdorman √Ülfhelm of York murdered, and he allowed Uhtred to succeed √Ülfhelm as ealdorman of York, thus uniting northern and southern Northumbria under the house of Bamburgh. It seems likely that Ethelred did not trust the Scandinavian population of southern Northumbria and wanted an Anglo-Saxon in power there.Kapelle, William E., The Norman Conquest of the North, 1979, University of North Carolina Press, , (pages 15‚Äì16) After receiving these honours Uhtred dismissed his wife, Ecgfrida, and married Sige, daughter of Styr, son of Ulf. Styr was a rich citizen of York. It appears that Uhtred was trying to make political allies amongst the Danes in Deira. Through Sige, Uhtred had two children, Eadulf, later Eadulf III, and Gospatric. This Gospatric's grandson was the infamous Eadwulf Rus who murdered Bishop Walcher. In 1013 King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark invaded England, sailing up the Humber and Trent to the town of Gainsborough. Uhtred submitted to him there, as did all of the Danes in the north. In the winter of 1013 Ethelred was forced into exile in Normandy. After London had finally submitted to him, Sweyn was accepted as king by Christmas 1013. However he only reigned for five weeks, for he died at, or near, Gainsborough on 2 February 1014. At Sweyn‚Äôs death, Ethelred was able to return from exile and resume his reign. Uhtred, along with many others, transferred his allegiance back to Ethelred, on his return. Uhtred also married Ethelred‚Äôs daughter √Ülfgifu about this time. In 1016 Uhtred campaigned with Ethelred's son Edmund Ironside in Cheshire and the surrounding shires. While Uhtred was away from his lands, Sweyn's son, Cnut, invaded Yorkshire. Cnut's forces were too strong for Uhtred to fight, and so Uhtred did homage to him as King of England. Uhtred was summoned to a meeting with Cnut, and on the way there, he and forty of his men were murdered by Thurbrand the Hold, with assistance from Uhtred's own servant, Wighill and with the connivance of Cnut. Uhtred was succeeded in Bernicia by his brother Eadwulf Cudel. Cnut made the Norwegian, Eric of Hlathir, ealdorman (\\"earl\\" in Scandinavian terms) in southern Northumbria. Descendants The killing of Uhtred by Thurbrand the Hold started a blood feud that lasted for many years. Uhtred's son Ealdred subsequently avenged his father by killing Thurbrand, but Ealdred in turn was killed by Thurbrand's son, Carl. Ealdred's vengeance had to wait until the 1070s, when Waltheof, Ealdred‚Äôs grandson had his soldiers kill most of Carl's sons and grandsons. This is an example of the notorious Northumbrian blood feuds that were common at this time.Kapelle, William E., op. cit., (pages 17‚Äì19) Uhtred's dynasty continued to reign in Bernicia through Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh (killed 1038) his son from his marriage to Ecgfrida, and Eadulf (killed 1041) his son from his marriage to Sige, and briefly Eadulf's son Osulf held the earldom of northern Northumbria 1067 until he too was killed. Eadulf's brother Gospatric began the Swinton Family dynasty, his son Eadulf Rus famously murdering William Walcher, Bishop of Durham which led to William the Conqueror sending an army northwards to harry the region again. Uhtred‚Äôs marriage to √Ülfgifu produced a daughter, Ealdgyth, who married Maldred, brother of Duncan I of Scotland and who gave birth to a son, Gospatric, who was Earl of Northumbria from 1068 to 1072. Among his descendants is Oliver Cromwell.Kapelle, William E., op. cit., (table 2, page 18) Issue Uchtred married 3 times and had children from each marriage. 1st marriage: Ecgfrida, daughter of Aldhun Bishop of Durham * Ealdred Earl of Bernicia, died 1038 2nd marriage: Sige Styrd√≥ttir * Eadwulf III of Bamburgh Earl of Bernicia after Ealdred, died 1041 * Gospatric, grandfather of Eadulf Rus 3rd marriage: √Ülfgifu, daughter of King √Üthelred the Unready * Ealdgyth. In popular culture Bernard Cornwell was inspired to write his series The Saxon Stories after learning he was a descendent of Uhtred the Bold, who is the inspiration behind the series protagonist Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg. Several events in the series are based on events in Uhtred the Bolds life such as the siege of Bebbanburg by the Scots and the severed heads on poles. The Last Kingdom, a television series, is based on The Saxon Stories. Adrian Mourby's two Radio Plays, The Corsaint (c.1986) and its sequel, The King of the North Rides his Horse through the Sky (1992) provide convincing dramatic realisations of the story of the siege of Durham and the severed heads on poles as told about the historical Uhtred.

She worked to raise funds for medical research and founded the Lasker Foundation. Early life Mary Woodard was born in Watertown, Wisconsin, the daughter of Sara Johnson Woodard and Frank Elwin Woodard. Lasker attended the University of Wisconsin, Madison and graduated from Radcliffe College with a major in Art History. While Lasker was growing up her mother, an active civic leader, instilled in Lasker the values of urban beautification. Lasker worked as an art dealer at Reinhardt Galleries in New York City. She married the owner Paul Reinhardt. After divorcing, she created a fabric company, Hollywood Patterns. Health Advocate In 1938 she became the president of the Birth Control Federation of America, the precursor of the Planned Parenthood Federation. Her second marriage was to Lord and Thomas advertising executive Albert Lasker until his death in the early 1950s of colon cancer. Ironically, her husband's ad agency had promoted smoking with the slogan, \\"L.S.M.F.T.‚ÄîLucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco\\" back when the dangers of smoking were not well known. Indeed, Albert's special charge at his firm was to get more women to smoke, as they lagged far behind men as smokers. The Laskers supported the national health insurance proposal under President Harry S. Truman. After its failure, Mary Lasker saw research funding as the best way to promote public health. With her husband, they created the Lasker Foundation in 1942 to promote medical research. The Lasker Award is considered the most prestigious American award in medical research. As of 2015, eighty- seven Lasker laureates have gone on to receive a Nobel Prize. Together, they were the first to apply the power of modern advertising and promotion to fighting cancer. They joined the American Society for the Control of Cancer which at the time was sleepy and ineffectual and transformed it into the American Cancer Society. The Laskers ousted the board of directors. Afterwards, they raised then record amounts of money and directed much of it to research. The American Cancer Society also fought lung cancer through prevention via anti-smoking campaigns. Using TV equal-time provisions, they were able to counter cigarette advertising with their own message. In 1970, Congress passed a law banning the advertising of cigarettes on television, so the anti-smoking commercials likewise went off the air. https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/01/this-day-in-politics-april-1-1244832 Following her husband's death, she founded the National Health Education Committee. She played major roles in promoting and expanding the National Institutes of Health, helping its budget expand by a factor of 2000 times from $2.4 million in 1945 to $5.5 billion in 1985.Joel L. Fleishman, et al. Casebook for the Foundation: A Great American Secret (2007) Page 50 Lasker was prominent in lobbying Eleanor Roosevelt to endorse Lyndon Johnson's efforts to become the 1960 Democratic nominee. Lady Bird Johnson wrote about Lasker numerous times in her book A White House Diary, calling her house \\"charming ... like a setting for jewels\\" and thanking her for gifts of daffodil bulbs for parkways along the Potomac River and for thousands of azalea bushes, flowering dogwood and other plants to put along Pennsylvania Avenue. Lasker was also instrumental in getting the US government to fund the War on Cancer in 1971.  Braniff Airways Board Member  On September 15, 1971, Mrs. Lasker was elected to the Board of Directors of Braniff Airways, Incorporated. She became only the second female board member of Braniff following Braniff cofounder Thomas Elmer Braniff's wife, Bess Clark Braniff, who was elected to the board after the untimely death of her husband in January 1954. Mary Lasker's appointment to the Braniff board was rare and she joined a very small group of women who were directors at large American corporations.  Awards and recognition  Mary Lasker is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, the Four Freedoms Award 1987 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1989. The Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service was renamed in her honour in 2000. On May 14, 2009 the United States Postal Service honored Lasker with the issuance of a stamp of face value 78 cents, designed by Mark Summers. The stamp was released, in part, as recognition of a renewed US government commitment to funding of biomedical research. A release ceremony was held in Lasker's hometown on May 15, 2009.

The Bigraphical Model, University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, UK. Each node of the bigraph is part of a graph and also part of some tree that describes how the nodes are nested. Bigraphs can be conveniently and formally displayed as diagrams. They have applications in the modelling of distributed systems for ubiquitous computing and can be used to describe mobile interactions. They have also been used by Robin Milner in an attempt to subsume Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) and œÄ-calculus. They have been studied in the context of category theory. Anatomy of a bigraph Aside from nodes and (hyper-)edges, a bigraph may have associated with it one or more regions which are roots in the place forest, and zero or more holes in the place graph, into which other bigraph regions may be inserted. Similarly, to nodes we may assign controls that define identities and an arity (the number of ports for a given node to which link-graph edges may connect). These controls are drawn from a bigraph signature. In the link graph we define inner and outer names, which define the connection points at which coincident names may be fused to form a single link. Foundations A bigraph is a 5-tuple: (V,E,ctrl,prnt,link) : \\\\langle k,X \\\\rangle \\\\to \\\\langle m,Y \\\\rangle, where V is a set of nodes, E is a set of edges, ctrl is the control map that assigns controls to nodes, prnt is the parent map that defines the nesting of nodes, and link is the link map that defines the link structure. The notation \\\\langle k,X \\\\rangle \\\\to \\\\langle m,Y \\\\rangle indicates that the bigraph has k holes (sites) and a set of inner names X and m regions, with a set of outer names Y. These are respectively known as the inner and outer interfaces of the bigraph. Formally speaking, each bigraph is an arrow in a symmetric partial monoidal category (usually abbreviated spm-category) in which the objects are these interfaces. As a result, the composition of bigraphs is definable in terms of the composition of arrows in the category. Extensions and variants=Bigraphs with sharing Example bigraph with sharing in which the node of control M is shared by the two nodes of control S. This is represented by M being in the intersection of the two S-nodes. Bigraphs with sharing are a generalisation of Milner's formalisation that allows for a straightforward representation of overlapping or intersecting spatial locations. In bigraphs with sharing, the place graph is defined as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), i.e. prnt is a binary relation instead of a map. The definition of link graph is unaffected by the introduction of sharing. Note that standard bigraphs are a sub-class of bigraphs with sharing. Areas of application of bigraphs with sharing include wireless networking protocols, real-time management of domestic wireless networks and mixed reality systems.  Implementations  * BigraphER is a modelling and reasoning environment for bigraphs consisting of an OCaml library and a command-line tool providing an efficient implementation of rewriting, simulation, and visualisation for both bigraphs and bigraphs with sharing.

History South Pacific Airlines of New Zealand (SPANZ) was founded in 1960 by Bob Anderson and Rex Daniell, who had formerly been pilots for the National Airways Corporation, the state airline of the time. Ansett Transport Industries had a 49% shareholding. SPANZ was established in direct competition with National Airways Corporation, although the airline's policy to link larger secondary towns. The New Zealand aviation industry at the time was highly regulated in favour of the state carrier, and SPANZ struggled financially. In 1966, the airline was forced to call in the receivers, making its last commercial flight on 28 February.[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/105892916 ¬£382,086 loss by SPANZ Canberra Times 22 March 1966 page 14 Aircraft SPANZ owned three Douglas DC-3s, named after New Zealanders Jean Batten, George Bolt and Ernest Rutherford. It also leased a number of other aircraft. The DC-3s were unique as they were equipped with enlarged elongated cabin windows, giving them the name \\"Viewmaster\\". They also had refurbished interiors up to the standard of more modern types then operating. This caused the National Airways Corporation to upgrade its large fleet of DC-3s.

During the SPANZ era, it as well as Ansett-ANA and Braniff all shared the same style of livery in anticipation of this. In the era of heavy global regulation of air routes, this plan was not to eventuate. It was only realised when the Virgin Group expanded into Australasia with Virgin Blue in 2001 and NZ subsidiary Pacific Blue Airlines in 2004. This airline then created a seamless service in the Pacific with the creation of V Australia in 2009.

They were thus called from the Greek word , \\"principalities\\", or \\"rulers\\", by reason that they held the world to have been created and ruled by malevolent Archons. Epiphanius of Salamis seems to be the earliest Christian writer who speaks of this sect. He relates that a young priest in Palestine named Peter had been charged with heresy, deposed from the office of the priesthood and expelled by Bishop A√´tius. He fled into a part of Arabia, where there was a center of Ebionitism. In his old age, he returned to Palestine, where he lived the life of an anchorite in a cave near Jerusalem and attracted followers by the austerity of his life and the practice of extreme poverty. Shortly before the death of Constantius II (337-361), Eutactus, coming from Egypt, visited the anchorite Peter and was imbued by him with the doctrines of the sect and carried them into Greater and Lesser Armenia. Beliefs The Archontics held that there were Seven Heavens, ruled by the Demiurge surrounded by Archons begotten by him, who are the jailers of the souls. In the eighth heaven dwells the supreme Mother of light. The king or tyrant of the seventh heaven is Sabaoth, the god of the Jews, who is the father of the Devil. The Devil, dwelling upon earth, rebelled against his father, and opposed him in all things, and by Eve begot Cain and Abel. Cain slew Abel in a quarrel about their sister, whom both loved. \\"They say,\\" records Epiphanius, \\"that the soul is the food of the Archons and Powers without which they cannot live, because she is of the dew from above and gives them strength.

Attributed to Archimedes, the problem involves computing the number of cattle in a herd of the sun god from a given set of restrictions. The problem was discovered by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript containing a poem of forty-four lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb√ºttel, Germany in 1773. From pp. 422‚Äì423: \\"Denn, wie gesagt, das Problem soll, wenn es nicht von dem Archimedes selbst abgefa√üt worden, doch von ihm f√ºr werth erkannt seyn, da√ü er es den Eratosthenes geschicket h√§tte, um es den Me√ük√ºnstern zu Alexandria zur Aufl√∂sung vorzulegen.

The title says this; ‚Ä¶ ) See pages 423‚Äì424 (in Greek). The problem remained unsolved for a number of years, due partly to the difficulty of computing the huge numbers involved in the solution. The general solution was found in 1880 by Carl Ernst August Amthor (1845‚Äì1916), headmaster of the Gymnasium zum Heiligen Kreuz (Gymnasium of the Holy Cross) in Dresden, Germany.Biographical information about August Amthor: * Amthor's full name appears in: * Brief biography about Amthor appears in: The problem was solved independently in 1895 by Adam Henry Bell, a surveyor and civil engineer of Hillsboro, Illinois, USA. See:  Bell's full name appears in: ; see p. 1050. * Bell's occupations appear in: ; see p. 664. Using logarithmic tables, he calculated the first digits of the smallest solution, showing that it is about 7.76 \\\\times 10^{206544} cattle, far more than could fit in the observable universe. The decimal form is too long for humans to calculate exactly, but multiple precision arithmetic packages on computers can write it out explicitly.  History  In 1769, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was appointed librarian of the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb√ºttel, Germany, which contained many Greek and Latin manuscripts. A few years later, Lessing published translations of some of the manuscripts with commentaries. Among them was a Greek poem of forty-four lines, containing an arithmetical problem which asks the reader to find the number of cattle in the herd of the god of the sun. It is now generally credited to Archimedes.  Problem  The problem, from an abridgement of the German translations published by Georg Nesselmann in 1842, and by Krumbiegel in 1880, states: > Compute, O friend, the number of the cattle of the sun which once grazed > upon the plains of Sicily, divided according to color into four herds, one > milk-white, one black, one dappled and one yellow. The number of bulls is > greater than the number of cows, and the relations between them are as > follows: :White bulls =\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right) black bulls + > yellow bulls, :Black bulls =\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\right) dappled > bulls + yellow bulls, :Dappled bulls =\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{6} + \\\\frac{1}{7}\\\\right) > white bulls + yellow bulls, :White cows =\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3} + > \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\right) black herd, :Black cows =\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{4} + > \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\right) dappled herd, :Dappled cows =\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{5} + > \\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\right) yellow herd, :Yellow cows =\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{6} + > \\\\frac{1}{7}\\\\right) white herd. If thou canst give, O friend, the number of > each kind of bulls and cows, thou art no novice in numbers, yet can not be > regarded as of high skill. Consider, however, the following additional > relations between the bulls of the sun: :White bulls + black bulls = a > square number, :Dappled bulls + yellow bulls = a triangular number. If thou > hast computed these also, O friend, and found the total number of cattle, > then exult as a conqueror, for thou hast proved thyself most skilled in > numbers.  Solution  The first part of the problem can be solved readily by setting up a system of equations. If the number of white, black, dappled, and yellow bulls are written as W, B, D, and Y, and the number of white, black, dappled, and yellow cows are written as w,b,d, and y, the problem is simply to find a solution to: : \\\\begin{align} W &{}=\\\\frac{5}{6}B+Y \\\\ B &{}=\\\\frac{9}{20}D+Y \\\\ D &{}=\\\\frac{13}{42}W+Y \\\\ w &{}=\\\\frac{7}{12}(B+b) \\\\ b &{}=\\\\frac{9}{20}(D+d) \\\\ d &{}=\\\\frac{11}{30}(Y+y) \\\\ y &{}=\\\\frac{13}{42}(W+w) \\\\end{align} which is a system of seven equations with eight unknowns. It is indeterminate, and has infinitely many solutions. The least positive integers satisfying the seven equations are: : \\\\begin{align} B &{}=7{,}460{,}514 \\\\ W &{}=10{,}366{,}482 \\\\ D &{}=7{,}358{,}060 \\\\ Y &{}=4{,}149{,}387 \\\\ b &{}=4{,}893{,}246 \\\\ w &{}=7{,}206{,}360 \\\\ d &{}=3{,}515{,}820 \\\\ y &{}=5{,}439{,}213 \\\\end{align} which is a total of 50,389,082 cattle and the other solutions are integral multiples of these. Note that the first four numbers are multiples of 4657, a value which will appear repeatedly below. The general solution to the second part of the problem was first found by A. AmthorB. Krumbiegel, A. Amthor, Das Problema Bovinum des Archimedes, Historisch-literarische Abteilung der Zeitschrift f√ºr Mathematik und Physik 25 (1880) 121‚Äì136, 153‚Äì171. in 1880. The following version of it was described by H. W. Lenstra, based on Pell's equation: the solution given above for the first part of the problem should be multiplied by : n = \\\\frac{(w^{4658j} - w^{-4658j})^2}{(4657)(79072)} \\\\, where : w = 300426607914281713365 \\\\sqrt{609} + 84129507677858393258 \\\\sqrt{7766} and j is any positive integer. Equivalently, squaring w results in, : w^2 = u+v\\\\sqrt{(609)(7766)} \\\\, where {u, v} are the fundamental solutions of the Pell equation : u^2-(609)(7766)v^2 = 1 The size of the smallest herd that could satisfy both the first and second parts of the problem is then given by j = 1, and is about 7.76 \\\\times 10^{206544} (first solved by Amthor). Modern computers can easily print out all digits of the answer. This was first done at the University of Waterloo, in 1965 by Hugh C. Williams, R. A. German, and Charles Robert Zarnke. They used a combination of the IBM 7040 and IBM 1620 computers. (includes pictures) Pell equation The constraints of the second part of the problem are straightforward and the actual Pell equation that needs to be solved can easily be given. First, it asks that B+W should be a square, or using the values given above, :B+W = 7{,}460{,}514k + 10{,}366{,}482k = (2^2)(3)(11)(29)(4657)k \\\\, thus one should set k = (3)(11)(29)(4657)q2 for some integer q. That solves the first condition. For the second, it requires that D+Y should be a triangular number, :D+Y = \\\\frac{t^2+t}{2} Solving for t, :t = \\\\frac{-1\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{1+8(D+Y)}}{2} Substituting the value of D+Y and k and finding a value of q2 such that the discriminant of this quadratic is a perfect square p2 entails solving the Pell equation, :p^2-(4)(609)(7766)(4657^2)q^2 = 1 \\\\, Amthor's approach discussed in the previous section was essentially to find the smallest v such that it is integrally divisible by 2 ¬∑ 4657\\\\. The fundamental solution of this equation has more than 100,000 digits.

Briggs was best known for his later comic strips When a Feller Needs a Friend, Ain't It a Grand and Glorious Feeling?, The Days of Real Sport,\\"Claire Briggs - Cartoon Genius Dies at 54\\" and Mr. and Mrs.. Early life Born in Reedsburg, Wisconsin, Briggs lived there until the age of nine. In 1884, his family moved to Dixon, Illinois, where he started his newspaper career at age ten, delivering the local paper to subscribers for 40 cents a week while wearing a red, white and blue cap with the name of the newspaper. Briggs had three brothers, who grew up to all have creative careers, one as a musician, one as a writer, and the third in advertising. After five years in Dixon, Briggs was 14 when his family relocated to Lincoln, Nebraska, where he lived until 1896 when he was 21. Life in the Midwest gave Briggs the source material for the small town Americana that he later depicted in his cartoons. A push from Pershing Clare Briggs' Danny Dreamer (November 22, 1908) While attending the University of Nebraska for two years, he studied drawing and stenography. Employment as a stenographer brought him six dollars a week when the work was available. One of his art instructors was an editor with Western Penman, where his first published drawings appeared. His mathematics teacher was Lieutenant John J. Pershing. \\"If ever a fellow needed a friend, I did in mathematics,\\" said Briggs. \\"It happened that Lieutenant Pershing was my instructor, and I believe he will testify that it was easier to conquer Germany than to teach me math. One day he ordered me to the blackboard to demonstrate a theorem, and while I was giving the problem a hard but losing battle, he remarked: 'Briggs, sit down, you don't know anything.' Right then and there, I decided to become a newspaper man.\\" On July 18, 1900, he married Ruth Owen of Lincoln. He began his career as a newspaper sketch artist in St. Louis, Missouri with the Globe- Democrat, which sent him off to cover the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War as an editorial cartoonist. Relocating in New York, his drawings for the New York Journal prompted William Randolph Hearst to send Briggs to the Chicago Herald and the Chicago's American, where he created A. Piker Clerk, often described as the first daily continuity comic strip. After 17 years in Chicago, Briggs returned to New York to spend the remaining 13 years of his life with the New York Tribune. He lived in to the suburban community of New Rochelle, a well-known art colony and home to a majority of the top commercial illustrators of the day. During the 1920s, the New Rochelle Art Association commissioned its best known artists to create a series of signs on major roadways to mark the borders, including \\"New Rochelle The Place To Come When a Feller Needs a Friend\\", which was created by Briggs representing one of his major comics, \\"When a Feller Needs a Friend\\". Clare and Ruth Owen Briggs were together for 29 years and had three children. They divorced in February 1929. Briggs died ten months later, leaving his estate of $90,067 to Ruth Briggs. However, the will was challenged by his second wife, Marie C. Briggs, aka Maggie Touhey.\\"A final decree of divorce was granted today by Supreme Court Justice Joseph Morschauser to Mrs. Ruth Owen Briggs, ...\\" (pay per view)\\"Mrs. Marie Briggs, second wife of Clare A.

He accepted a five-week contract for $500 a week to appear on the vaudeville circuit in 1914. In 1919, he produced four comedy film shorts for Paramount Pictures. The Mr. and Mrs. radio series, based on Briggs' strip, starred Jack Smart and Jane Houston as Jo and Vi. The series was broadcast on CBS from 1929 to 1931. National catchphrases caught on from the titles of some of his newspaper cartoon features: Ain't It a Grand and Glorious Feeling?, Danny Dreamer, The Days of Real Sport, Movie of a Man, Mr. and Mrs, Real Folks at Home, Someone's Always Taking the Joy Out of Life, There's at Least One in Every Office and When a Feller Needs a Friend.

For a given value of a hyperbolic function, the corresponding inverse hyperbolic function provides the corresponding hyperbolic angle. The size of the hyperbolic angle is equal to the area of the corresponding hyperbolic sector of the hyperbola , or twice the area of the corresponding sector of the unit hyperbola , just as a circular angle is twice the area of the circular sector of the unit circle. Some authors have called inverse hyperbolic functions \\"area functions\\" to realize the hyperbolic angles. Hyperbolic functions occurs in the calculations of angles and distances in hyperbolic geometry. It also occurs in the solutions of many linear differential equations (such as the equation defining a catenary), cubic equations, and Laplace's equation in Cartesian coordinates. Laplace's equations are important in many areas of physics, including electromagnetic theory, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and special relativity. Notation The most common abbreviations are those specified by the ISO 80000-2 standard. They consist of ar- followed by the abbreviation of the corresponding hyperbolic function (e.g., arsinh, arcosh). However, arc- followed by the corresponding hyperbolic function (e.g., arcsinh, arccosh) is also commonly seen, by analogy with the nomenclature for inverse trigonometric functions. The former are misnomers, since the prefix arc is the abbreviation for arcus, while the prefix ar stands for area.As stated by Jan Gullberg, Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1997), , p. 539: > Another form of notation, , , etc., is a practice to be condemned as these > functions have nothing whatever to do with _arc_ , but with _ar_ ea, as is > demonstrated by their full Latin names, > > arsinh area sinus hyperbolicus > > arcosh area cosinus hyperbolicus, etc. As stated by , Wolfgang Hackbusch and Hans Rudolf Schwarz, translated by Bruce Hunt, Oxford Users' Guide to Mathematics (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), , Section 0.2.13: \\"The inverse hyperbolic functions\\", p. 68: \\"The Latin names for the inverse hyperbolic functions are area sinus hyperbolicus, area cosinus hyperbolicus, area tangens hyperbolicus and area cotangens hyperbolicus (of x). ...\\" This aforesaid reference uses the notations arsinh, arcosh, artanh, and arcoth for the respective inverse hyperbolic functions.As stated by Ilja N.

For complex arguments, the inverse hyperbolic functions, the square root and the logarithm are multi-valued functions, and the equalities of the next subsections may be viewed as equalities of multi-valued functions.

For such a function, it is common to define a principal value, which is a single valued analytic function which coincides with one specific branch of the multivalued function, over a domain consisting of the complex plane in which a finite number of arcs (usually half lines or line segments) have been removed. These arcs are called branch cuts. For specifying the branch, that is, defining which value of the multivalued function is considered at each point, one generally define it at a particular point, and deduce the value everywhere in the domain of definition of the principal value by analytic continuation. When possible, it is better to define the principal value directly‚Äîwithout referring to analytic continuation. For example, for the square root, the principal value is defined as the square root that has a positive real part. This defines a single valued analytic function, which is defined everywhere, except for non-positive real values of the variables (where the two square roots have a zero real part). This principal value of the square root function is denoted \\\\sqrt x in what follows. Similarly, the principal value of the logarithm, denoted \\\\operatorname{Log} in what follows, is defined as the value for which the imaginary part has the smallest absolute value. It is defined everywhere except for non-positive real values of the variable, for which two different values of the logarithm reach the minimum. For all inverse hyperbolic functions, the principal value may be defined in terms of principal values of the square root and the logarithm function. However, in some cases, the formulas of do not give a correct principal value, as giving a domain of definition which is too small and, in one case non-connected. Principal value of the inverse hyperbolic sine The principal value of the inverse hyperbolic sine is given by :\\\\operatorname{arsinh} z = \\\\operatorname{Log}(z + \\\\sqrt{z^2 + 1} \\\\,)\\\\,. The argument of the square root is a non-positive real number, if and only if belongs to one of the intervals and of the imaginary axis. If the argument of the logarithm is real, then it is positive. Thus this formula defines a principal value for arsinh, with branch cuts and . This is optimal, as the branch cuts must connect the singular points and to the infinity. Principal value of the inverse hyperbolic cosine The formula for the inverse hyperbolic cosine given in is not convenient, since similar to the principal values of the logarithm and the square root, the principal value of arcosh would not be defined for imaginary . Thus the square root has to be factorized, leading to :\\\\operatorname{arcosh} z = \\\\operatorname{Log}(z + \\\\sqrt{z+1} \\\\sqrt{z-1} \\\\,)\\\\,. The principal values of the square roots are both defined, except if belongs to the real interval . If the argument of the logarithm is real, then is real and has the same sign. Thus, the above formula defines a principal value of arcosh outside the real interval , which is thus the unique branch cut. Principal values of the inverse hyperbolic tangent and cotangent The formulas given in suggests : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{artanh} z &=\\\\frac12\\\\operatorname{Log}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1+z}{1-z}\\\\right) \\\\ \\\\operatorname{arcoth} z &= \\\\frac12\\\\operatorname{Log}\\\\left(\\\\frac{z+1}{z-1}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} for the definition of the principal values of the inverse hyperbolic tangent and cotangent. In these formulas, the argument of the logarithm is real if and only if is real. For artanh, this argument is in the real interval , if belongs either to or to . For arcoth, the argument of the logarithm is in , if and only if belongs to the real interval . Therefore, these formulas define convenient principal values, for which the branch cuts are and for the inverse hyperbolic tangent, and for the inverse hyperbolic cotangent. In view of a better numerical evaluation near the branch cuts, some authors use the following definitions of the principal values, although the second one introduces a removable singularity at . The two definitions of \\\\operatorname {artanh} differ for real values of z with z > 1 . The ones of \\\\operatorname {arcoth} differ for real values of z with z \\\\in [0, 1) . : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{artanh} z &= \\\\tfrac12\\\\operatorname{Log}\\\\left({1+z}\\\\right) - \\\\tfrac12\\\\operatorname{Log}\\\\left({1-z}\\\\right) \\\\ \\\\operatorname{arcoth} z &= \\\\tfrac12\\\\operatorname{Log}\\\\left({1+\\\\frac{1}{z} }\\\\right) - \\\\tfrac12\\\\operatorname{Log}\\\\left({1-\\\\frac{1}{z}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} Principal value of the inverse hyperbolic cosecant For the inverse hyperbolic cosecant, the principal value is defined as :\\\\operatorname{arcsch} z = \\\\operatorname{Log}\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{z} + \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{1}{z^2} +1 } \\\\,\\\\right). It is defined when the arguments of the logarithm and the square root are not non-positive real numbers. The principal value of the square root is thus defined outside the interval of the imaginary line. If the argument of the logarithm is real, then is a non-zero real number, and this implies that the argument of the logarithm is positive. Thus, the principal value is defined by the above formula outside the branch cut, consisting of the interval of the imaginary line. For , there is a singular point that is included in the branch cut. Principal value of the inverse hyperbolic secant Here, as in the case of the inverse hyperbolic cosine, we have to factorize the square root. This gives the principal value : \\\\operatorname{arsech} z = \\\\operatorname{Log}\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{z} + \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{1}{z} + 1 } \\\\, \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{1}{z} -1 } \\\\right). If the argument of a square root is real, then is real, and it follows that both principal values of square roots are defined, except if is real and belongs to one of the intervals and . If the argument of the logarithm is real and negative, then is also real and negative. It follows that the principal value of arsech is well defined, by the above formula outside two branch cuts, the real intervals and . For , there is a singular point that is included in one of the branch cuts. Graphical representation In the following graphical representation of the principal values of the inverse hyperbolic functions, the branch cuts appear as discontinuities of the color. The fact that the whole branch cuts appear as discontinuities, shows that these principal values may not be extended into analytic functions defined over larger domains. In other words, the above defined branch cuts are minimal.

The liver, spleen, and central nervous system can also be affected. Histiocytes are a component of the immune system that proliferate abnormally in this disease. In addition to its importance in veterinary medicine, the condition is also important in human pathology.Malignant histiocytoses. DermNet NZ Histiocytic disorders A histiocyte is a differentiated tissue cell that has its origin in the bone marrow. The source for histiocytes is the monocyte/macrophage line. Monocytes (found in the blood) and macrophages (found in tissue) are responsible for phagocytosis (ingestion) of foreign material in the body. Langerhans cells are dendritic cells found in the skin and function by internalizing antigens (foreign particles) and presenting them to T cells. They arise from monocytes. Histiocytic disorders refer to diseases that are caused by abnormal behavior of these cells. They include the following: *Reactive diseases of Langerhans cells (most important feature in immune histochemistry is expression of E-cadherin) **Histiocytomas *Reactive histiocytosis (immunohistochemical features show that interstitial/dermal DCs are involved) **Cutaneous histiocytosis (CH) **Systemic histiocytosis (SH) *Reactive diseases of macrophages **Hemophagocytic syndrome ‚Äì a condition where macrophages phagocytose myeloid and erythroid precursors (similar to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in humans) *Histiocytic sarcoma complex (immunohistochemical features of dendritic cells, possibly interdigitating or perivascular DCs) **Malignant histiocytosis **Diffuse histiocytic sarcoma **Localized histiocytic sarcoma *Malignant diseases of macrophages **Histiocytic lymphoma Breed disposition Up to 25 percent of Bernese Mountain Dogs may develop malignant histiocytosis in their lifetime.E Cadieu, B Hedan, G Parker H, Gr Rutteman, A Baffoe-Bonnie, et al..

Signs and symptoms The disease in the lungs is characterized by enlargement of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes and infiltration of the lungs, sometimes leading to lung lobe consolidation and pleural effusion. Signs and symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, weight loss, anemia, and difficulty breathing. Seizures and rear limb weakness can be seen. Invasion of the bone marrow can cause pancytopenia. Diagnosis requires a biopsy. Treatment Treatment with chemotherapy has been used with some success, particularly using lomustine, prednisone, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Because of the rapid progression of this aggressive disease, the prognosis is very poor. Other histiocytic diseases in Bernese Mountain Dogs A similar disease is diffuse histiocytic sarcoma, a term used to designate a localized histiocytic sarcoma that has spread throughout the body.

The game was released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, and ported to Microsoft Windows in 2008. Like the Dynasty Warriors series, an Empires expansion was released as well, and an Xtreme Legends expansion followed on August 23, 2007 in Japan. The game, alongside its two expansions, Xtreme Legends and Empires also receive a HD-enhanced port for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita under the name Sengoku Musou 2 with Moushouden & Empires: HD Version. Samurai Warriors 3, the sequel to Samurai Warriors 2 and the third game in the series was released in December 2009 for the Wii. Gameplay The gameplay of Samurai Warriors 2 builds on the first Samurai Warriors by adding new characters and new features, such as the removal of the traditional range attacks in favor of the addition of two unique special abilities that differ from character to character. For example, Oichi can either summon new soldiers to the battlefield or improve the combat abilities of nearby allies, Yukimura Sanada can either whistle to call his mount to his side or perform a flaming charge, and Ginchiyo Tachibana can either increase the strength of her weapon or summon lightning to stun nearby enemy soldiers. In addition, characters movesets can evolve in a larger variety as they level up, elaborating on either their combo, charge or special attacks, with the progression of each character being different from the next. This leads to the characters having 1 of 3 different button combos. A returning element from Samurai Warriors is the Survival Mode (Infinite Castle in Sengoku Musou 2). In this mode, the player chooses a character and fights through an endless castle. After choosing the character, 4 random missions will be given to the player to choose from. To choose a mission the player must pay a fee to perform the mission, though there are certain missions that do not require a fee. After that, the player enters the castle, and a mission will be triggered. After succeeding in the mission, the stairway to the next floor opens, and the player will be able to proceed to the next floor where there will be another mission to complete in order to proceed to the next floor, and so on. Playable characters in the game (except for Ranmaru Mori and Okuni) have their own stories. Each story contains five stages (except for Ieyasu Tokugawa and Mitsunari Ishida, who both have six stages), plus a \\"Dream Stage\\" or \\"Gaiden\\" (Side Quest) in the Japanese version, that effectively asks \\"what if\\". For example, Yukimura Sanada's Dream/Gaiden stage (Battle of Sekigahara) puts him into a battle that took place historically between his fourth and fifth stages (Ueda Castle and Osaka Castle respectively). Correspondingly, since Mitsuhide Akechi and Nobunaga Oda both have endings where they won their historically final battles and survived, their Dream stages have them mopping up their gathered opposition. This game also contains a Sugoroku mini-game as an additional feature. Up to four players can participate in this mode, and each player has to choose a character. The game's goal is to collect the requested amount of gold (depending on the player's settings). At the beginning of the game, three flags for each player will be divided in the map, and players can earn gold and raise their ranks by collecting their respective flags and returning to their home square. Additionally, a player can buy territories on the map, or challenge another player for the control of a territory. There are six types of challenges in the game: Annihilate (requires the players to defeat as many enemies as possible), Chase (requires the players to defeat as many fleeing Fire Ninjas as possible), Destroy (requires the players to destroy as many boulders as possible), Race (requires the players to break through the doors to reach the end before the opponent does), Reveal (requires the players to uncover as many Sky Ninjas as possible), and Steal (requires the players to collect as much gold as possible). The New Officer mode from Samurai Warriors has been removed, but it was reintroduced in Samurai Warriors 2: Empires. Characters The game features a total of 26 characters, 16 returning and 10 new, some of them former unique NPCs from previous game. Almost all characters from previous game (including Xtreme Legends additions) return with the exception of Goemon Ishikawa, Kunoichi, and Yoshimoto Imagawa, although the new character Nene seems to be a replacement for Kunoichi due to similarities in combat characteristics and skills. Two returning characters, Okuni and Ranmaru Mori do not have their own story mode, although they still can be played in Free Mode, Survival Mode and Sugoroku (Including Mercenary Mode). Similar to previous games, the game also features two unique NPCs: Katsuie Shibata and Kojiro Sasaki that can be unlocked as unplayable special bodyguards.

The game was first released in Japan on November 16, 2006. Very similar to both Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires and Dynasty Warriors 5: Empires, the game features the strategic and tactical Empire Mode that combines the gameplay of Samurai Warriors and several turn- based strategy elements from Nobunaga's Ambition and Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The Empire mode allows the player to select from some of Japan's greatest battles such as the battle of Kawanakajima, the battle of Anegawa, the incident at Honn≈ç-ji and the battle of Sekigahara. In the New Officer Mode, the options are limited to 13 models with 10 color patterns each, as well as four different voices. Fortunately, a new feature is added to the mix: the ability to copy movesets of other characters. Unlike Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends, the game does not feature new characters for the series. However, Kojiro Sasaki and Katsuie Shibata, who were unplayable special bodyguards in Samurai Warriors 2, are now playable characters in Samurai Warriors 2: Empires with special movesets. Samurai Warriors 2: Xtreme Legends Samurai Warriors 2: Xtreme Legends (Êà¶ÂõΩÁÑ°Âèå2: ÁåõÂ∞Ü‰ºù Sengoku Musou 2: Moushouden) was first released on August 23, 2007 in Japan for the PlayStation 2. It is the fifth Xtreme Legends expansion by Koei, and also the first (and only) Xtreme Legends expansion since Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends to be released after Samurai Warriors 2: Empires (Other Xtreme Legends expansions are released shortly after the release of the original game). It shares the same achievements with the parent game on the Xbox 360. The expansion introduced new characters to the series, including Toshiie Maeda, Gracia and Motochika Chosokabe. Yoshimoto Imagawa from Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends returned in the expansion with an updated character design, Katsuie Shibata and Kojir≈ç Sasaki from Samurai Warriors 2: Empires are also playable and have new weapons. Katsuie Shibata wields two hand axes, while Kojir≈ç Sasaki still carries a nodachi, but can now summon an ex-dimensional sword during battle. Because Yoshimoto Imagawa was put back into the game, the previously omitted battle of Okehazama is brought back, and Hideyoshi's Shikoku campaign against Motochika Chosokabe is also included. A new mode known as Mercenary Mode is in the game. It resembles Xtreme Mode from Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends. Playable characters can now be upgraded to level 70; in the original the highest level was 50. Bodyguards can also level up to 30, when in the original 20 was the highest level. Fifth weapons are present in the game, however, unlike the first game, the weapons has the same attack base as the original (before, the fifth weapon would have a higher attack base). Some considered it as an \\"alternative fourth weapon\\". In Samurai Warriors 2, the highest upgrade is fourth weapons. In order to play the full functionality of this game the original is required. \\"Import\\" selected on the main menu will guide you though a disk switching process. Xbox 360 players must download the expansion via the Xbox Marketplace as there is no stand alone disc available in stores. As for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita players, the game is bundled along with the two other versions of this game (the original and Empires), thus the players are no longer required to use the \\"Import\\" feature. There is a cutscene in the game (Toshiie Maeda's ending) that was censored in the Xbox 360 version because it was seen as a bit violent so it can only be viewed in the PS2 version. Reception=Samurai Warriors 2 Reviews of Samurai Warriors 2 ranged from very mixed to negative. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 62% and 58 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 56% and 52 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; and 49% and 43 out of 100 for the PC version. The only positive review came from Famitsu, which gave the PS2 version a score of 36 out of 40. Empires Empires was met with a little more mixed reception than the original Samurai Warriors 2. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 57% and 55 out of 100 for the PS2 version, and 55% and 53 out of 100 for the X360 version.

Brejo Alegre was the name of the small village (arraial) composed of some buildings, among them a small chapel, simple houses, a few stores, and a lot of cattle ranches. In 1843 the village was raised to the status of district with the name of Sant‚ÄôAna do Rio das Velhas. In 1882 the district was declared a \\"vila\\" (town) and in 1888 it was raised to the category of \\"cidade\\" or city, with the new name of Araguari. At this time the town consisted of the Igreja Matriz (Main church) of Senhor Bom Jesus da Cana Verde with its colonial style; the cemetery located behind the church; the houses with tiles but no ceilings, called casas de ‚Äútelhas ao vento‚Äù; and in the center flowed a stream dividing the settlement, one part called Goi√°s, and the other, Minas. The small commerce consisted of a bakery, a shoe store, two pharmacies and some general stores, called ‚Äúvendas‚Äù. The great change in the town's situation occurred with the arrival of the railroad, the Cia. Mogiana de Estrada de Ferro, in 1896. In 1906 this railroad, called Estrada de Ferro Goi√°s, was extended to Goi√°s, further increasing the growth of the city.Araguari em dados e fotos Partial view of the downtown ReferencesExternal links (in Portuguese) *lista telefonica de Araguari *Site with useful information Category:Municipalities in Minas Gerais ","title":"Araguari"},{"id":"3804647","text":"The piano is often used to provide harmonic accompaniment to a voice or other instrument.

The transistor's body forms a capacitor against the insulated substrate. The charge accumulates on this capacitor and may cause adverse effects, for example, opening of parasitic transistors in the structure and causing off- state leakages, resulting in higher current consumption and in case of DRAM in loss of information from the memory cells. It also causes the history effect, the dependence of the threshold voltage of the transistor on its previous states. In analog devices, the floating body effect is known as the kink effect. One countermeasure to floating body effect involves use of fully depleted devices. The insulator layer in FD devices is significantly thinner than the channel depletion width. The charge and thus also the body potential of the transistors is therefore fixed. However, the short-channel effect is worsened in the FD devices, the body may still charge up if both source and drain are high, and the architecture is unsuitable for some analog devices that require contact with the body. Hybrid trench isolation is another approach. While floating body effect presents a problem in SOI DRAM chips, it is exploited as the underlying principle for Z-RAM and T-RAM technologies. For this reason, the effect is sometimes called the Cinderella effect in the context of these technologies, because it transforms a disadvantage into an advantage.Z-RAM Shrinks Embedded Memory, Microprocessor Report AMD and Hynix licensed Z-RAM, but as of 2008 had not put it into production.

ICAO location indicator The International Civil Aviation Organization establishes sets of 4-letter location indicators which are published in ICAO Publication 7910. These are used by air traffic control agencies to identify airports and by weather agencies to produce METAR weather reports. The first letter indicates the region; for example, K for the contiguous United States, C for Canada, E for northern Europe, R for the Asian Far East, and Y for Australia. Examples of ICAO location indicators are RPLL for Manila Ninoy Aquino Airport and KCEF for Westover Joint Air Reserve Base. IATA identifier The International Air Transport Association uses sets of 3-letter IATA identifiers which are used for airline operations, baggage routing, and ticketing. There is no specific organization scheme to IATA identifiers; typically they take on the abbreviation of the airport or city such as MNL for Manila Ninoy Aquino Airport. In the United States, the IATA identifier usually equals the FAA identifier, but this is not always the case. A prominent example is Sawyer International Airport, Michigan, which uses the FAA identifier SAW and the IATA identifier MQT. FAA identifier The Federal Aviation Administration location identifier (FAA LID) is a three- to five- character alphanumeric code identifying aviation related facilities inside the United States, though some codes are reserved for, and are managed by other entities. For nearly all major airports, the assigned identifiers are alphabetic three-letter codes, such as ORD for Chicago O‚ÄôHare International Airport. Minor airfields are typically assigned a mix of alphanumeric characters, such as 8N2 for Skydive Chicago Airport and 0B5 for Turners Falls Airport. Private airfields are assigned a four-character identifier, such as 1CA9 for Los Angeles County Fire Department Heliport. The location identifiers are coordinated with the Transport Canada Identifiers described below. In general, the FAA has authority to assign all three-letter identifiers (except those beginning with the letters K, N, W, and Y), all three and four character alphanumeric identifiers, and five-letter identifiers for the United States and its jurisdictions. The Department of the Navy assigns three-letter identifiers beginning with the letter N for the exclusive use of that Department. Transport Canada assigns three character identifiers beginning with Y. The block beginning with letter Q is under international telecommunications jurisdiction, but is used internally by FAA Technical Operations to identify National Airspace equipment not covered by any other identifying code system. The block beginning with Z identifies United States Air Route Traffic Control Centers. In practice, the assigned identifiers are not always consistent with the current \\"encoding\\" rules adopted by the FAA, nor are all the assigned identifiers unique between the United States and Canada. The coding system has evolved over time, and to ensure safety and reduce ambiguity, many \\"legacy\\" codes have remained intact, even though they violate the currently ordered rules. For this reason, the FAA regularly publishes detailed listings of all codes it administers  General Assignment Patterns  In general, three-letter identifiers are assigned as radio call signs to aeronautical navigation aids; to airports with a manned air traffic control facility or navigational aid within airport boundary; to airports that receive scheduled route air carrier or military airlift service, and to airports designated by the United States Customs Service as Airports of Entry. Some of these identifiers are assigned to certain aviation weather reporting stations. Most one-number, two-letter identifiers have been assigned to aviation weather reporting and observation stations and special-use locations. Some of these identifiers may be assigned to public-use landing facilities within the United States and its jurisdictions, which do not meet the requirements for identifiers in the three-letter series. In this identifier series, the number is always in the first position of the three-character combination. Most one-letter, two-number identifiers are assigned to public- use landing facilities within the United States and its jurisdictions, which do not meet the requirements for identifiers in the three-letter series. Some of these identifiers are also assigned to aviation weather reporting stations. * One-letter, two-number identifiers are keyed by the alphabetical letter. The letter may appear in the first, middle or last position in the combination of three characters. When the letter signifies an Air Traffic Control Center's area, the assignment will not change if the Center's boundaries are realigned. * Identifiers in this series which could conflict with the Victor, Jet or colored airway numbers are not assigned. Two-letter, two-number identifiers are assigned to private-use landing facilities in the United States and its jurisdictions which do not meet the requirements for three-character assignments. They are keyed by the two-letter Post Office or supplemental abbreviation of the state with which they are associated. The two letter code appears in the first two, middle, or last two positions of the four character code. The use of the FAA identifier system in meteorology ended in 1996 when airways reporting code was replaced by METAR code. The METAR code is dependent wholly on the ICAO identifier system. Transport Canada identifier Transport Canada assigns two, three, and four character identifiers, including three letter identifiers beginning with letters Y and Z, for its areas of jurisdiction. These identifiers are designed to mesh with the FAA Identifier system described above, though a few conflicts exist. Direction General of Civil Aeronautics Code The airfields code of Direction General of Civil Aeronautics of Mexico is a designator airfields code compound 3 alphabetic characters used to identify all fields of civil aviation in Mexico (these characters are chosen with the same methodology for IATA Code, i.e. , taking 3 letters of the airfield, for example ZPU Zacapu Airstrip), these airfields can be airports, regional airports, private airstrips, heliports, boat-heliports and helipads platform-; if more substantial airports IATA designator code is used, for example TLC for Toluca International Airport, although there are some exceptions, such IATA: XAL and DGAC: ALA to Alamos National Airport, Sonora. Russian location identifier Within Russia (and before 1991 within the Soviet Union), there are airport identifiers (–≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–µ–π –∫–æ–¥ - internal code) having three Cyrillic letters.–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –∞—ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ—Ä—Ç—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ They are used for e.g. ticket sales. Some small airports with scheduled flights have no IATA code, only this code and an ICAO code. Unlike the IATA codes, they changed when renaming some cities of the former USSR in the 1990s, e.g. Saint Petersburg (was Leningrad) - was –õ–ï–î, became –°–ü–¢. As of 2009, about 3,000 code combinations of internal code are in use. WMO station identifiers The World Meteorological Organization uses a system of five-digit numeric station codes to represent synoptic weather stations. An example is 72295 for Los Angeles International Airport. The first number specifies the region: 0 to 1 for Europe, 2 to 3 for Russia, 4 for Asia, 5 for the Far East, 6 for Africa, 7 for North America, 8 for South America and Antarctica, and 9 for the Pacific. The remainder of the numbers are set at the regional and national level. United States weather agency identifiers The National Weather Service uses several schemes for identifying stations. It typically relies on the ICAO and WMO identifiers, although several weather forecast offices (WFOs) and weather radar sites that have moved away from airports have been given their own codes which do not conflict with existing codes. These typically end in X, such as where Birmingham, Alabama (BHM) had its radar site replaced by one south of the city (BMX), or where the Knoxville (TYS) office was moved to nearby Morristown, Tennessee (MRX). Others have changed such that Miami, Florida is now MFL instead of MIA, and Dallas/Fort Worth (formerly DFW) is now FWD. Climatological applications use the WBAN (Weather Bureau Army Navy) system, which is a five-digit numeric code for identifying weather stations under its jurisdiction. Recently it began using four-letter-plus-one-number identifiers for specialized weather requirements such as hydrometeorological stations. These are used by the USFS RAWS system, and by the stream gauges operated by the USGS, both of which report through GOES weather satellites operated by NOAA. These use three letters which are a mnemonic for the location, followed by the first letter of the U.S. state, followed by a numeral indicating the alphabetical order within that letter (for example, North Carolina stations end with N7). The mnemonic may be the nearest town, or the name of the stream, or a combination of the two; and the same names may be rearranged into different mnemonics for different nearby locations. For example, VING1 is the gauge at Vinings, Georgia, and is differentiated from other stations along the Chattahoochee River (such as CHAG1 in nearby Oakdale) which are also at the Atlanta city limit like Vinings is, and from other streams in Atlanta such as Peachtree Creek (AANG1). The United States Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), acting on behalf of all the American military services, assigns special use ICAO identifiers beginning with \\"KQ\\", for use by deployed units supporting real-world contingencies; deployed/in-garrison units providing support during exercises; classified operating locations; and units that have requested, but not yet received a permanent location identifier. One system still used by both the Air Force and National Climatic Data Center is the Master Station Catalog or MASLIB code. This is a 6-digit numeric code that is essentially the same scheme as the WMO station identifier but adds an extra digit, allowing many more stations to be indexed. This extra digit is always \\"0\\" when referencing an actual WMO station using the 5-digit identifier, but may be 1..9 to reference other stations that exist in the vicinity. The MASLIB identifiers are not generally recognized outside the United States. Transplanted identifiers There have been rare instances where identifiers have been transplanted to new locations, mainly due to the closure of the original airport. Prominent examples are DEN/KDEN, which migrated from Stapleton International Airport to Denver International Airport in 1996, and AUS/KAUS, which migrated from Austin Mueller Municipal Airport to Austin- Bergstrom International Airport in 1999. Both of these cases occurred because the original locations were closed. Occasionally a code will be discontinued entirely, with no successor. Sometimes this is a small airport that has closed, such as Stone Mountain Airport, whose identifier 00A is now used for an R/C heliport in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. In another case, the identifiers for Idlewild Airport in New York were changed to JFK and KJFK when it was renamed after John F. Kennedy, and its original IDL and KIDL were later reused for Indianola Municipal Airport in Indianola, Mississippi. Transplanted identifiers tend to be poorly documented, and can cause problems in data systems and software which process historical records and in research and legal work. A similar problem also exists for broadcast callsigns.

On an early morning on May 24, 1987, Kenneth Parks drove 20 kilometers from Pickering, Ontario to the house of his in-laws in Scarborough, Ontario. He entered their house with a key they had previously given him and used a tire iron to bludgeon his mother-in-law to death. He then turned on his father-in-law, attempting unsuccessfully to choke him to death. Parks got back in his car and, despite being covered with blood, drove straight to a nearby police station and confessed, turning himself in, stating \\"I think I have just killed two people\\".http://toronto.citynews.ca/2006/10/27/man-acquitted-of-sleepwalking- murder-running-for-school-trustee-in-durham/ At trial, Parks argued that he was automatistic and not criminally liable. In his defence, a doctor testified as to his mental state at the time of the murder. From the doctor's evidence, it was determined that the accused was sleepwalking at the time of the incident, and that he was suffering from a disorder of sleep rather than neurological, psychiatric, or other illness. Five neurological experts also confirmed that he was sleepwalking during the time of the incident. The jury acquitted Parks. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the condition of sleepwalking can be classified as non-insane automatism or should it be classified as \\"disease of the mind\\" (i.e. mental disorder automatism) and warrant a verdict of \\"not guilty for reason of insanity\\". This distinction is a matter of law and decided by the judge. Opinion of the Court The court upheld the acquittal as the evidence presented a reasonable doubt that Parks acted voluntarily. Chief Justice Antonio Lamer held that the trial judge was correct in his analysis of the evidence and his decision not to characterize sleepwalking as a mental disorder. La Forest, writing for L'Heureux-Dub√© and Gonthier JJ., agreed with Lamer in the characterization of the evidence, but looked further into the public policy of the defence. La Forest noted that the defence of mental disorder provides for a criminal exception which must be weighed against the interest in public safety. The applicability of the defence must focus on the likelihood of recurrence. For a person to be exempt from criminal liability under the \\"disease of the mind\\" defence they must be a \\"continuing danger\\" to the public and the condition must be an \\"internal cause\\" that stems from the accused's emotional or psychological state.

Acrylate polymer is commonly used in cosmetics, such as nail polish, as an adhesive. Structure of a polyacrylate polymer. Acrylic elastomers Acrylic elastomer is a general term for a type of synthetic rubber whose primary component is acrylic acid alkylester (ethyl or butyl ester). Acrylic elastomer possesses characteristics of heat and oil resistance, with the ability to withstand temperatures of 170‚Äì180 ‚ÑÉ. It is used primarily for producing oil seals and packaging related to automobiles. Acrylic elastomer can generally be characterized as one of two types. \\"Old\\" types include ACM (copolymer of acrylic acid ester and 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether) containing chlorine and ANM (copolymer of acrylic acid ester and acrylonitrile) without chloride. \\"New\\" types do not contain chlorine and are less prone to mold-related staining. Other than the slightly better water resistance of ANM there are no physical differences between the two types. The material is less resistant in terms of cold weather with a saturation point of ‚àí15 ‚ÑÉ for old types and ‚àí28 to ‚àí30 ‚ÑÉ for new types. In terms of vulcanization, the standard method for the old type is amine vulcanization. To minimize permanent deformation, the old type requires curing for 24 hours at a temperature of 150 ‚ÑÉ. On the other hand, for the new type, the press curing time and follow-up vulcanization time are significantly reduced by combining metal soap and sulfur. It has no special characteristics. The rebound resilience and abrasion resistance of the new type are poor, and even its electrical characteristics are considerably poor compared with acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber and butyl rubber.

It operates Boeing C-17 Globemaster III heavy airlifters from RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. The squadron has seen active service flying transport aircraft during World War II, the Korean War, the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia Konfrontasi, the Vietnam War, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It has also supported Australian humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the world, including Somalia, Cambodia, East Timor and Indonesia. The squadron was formed at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, in March 1942, and equipped with Douglas DC-2s, among other aircraft. Later in the war it began operating Douglas C-47 Dakotas. From 1946 to 1953 it was controlled by No. 86 (Transport) Wing, which was based in New South Wales at RAAF Station Schofields and, later, RAAF Station Richmond. In 1953 it was re-formed at Iwakuni, Japan, as part of No. 91 (Composite) Wing. It returned to Australia and the aegis of No. 86 Wing in 1955. The squadron began re-equipping with Lockheed C-130 Hercules at Richmond in 1958, becoming the first non-US operator of the type. Over the next half-century it flew two models of Hercules, the and . The squadron transferred to Amberley in 2006, when it took delivery of its first Globemaster. Role and equipment alt=Four-engined military jet transport plane parked on airfield at night with moon overhead No. 36 Squadron is responsible for strategic air transport in Australia and overseas, conducting missions as part of military operations and humanitarian efforts. It is located at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and controlled by No. 86 Wing, which is part of Air Mobility Group. The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components. As well as aircrew, the squadron is staffed by maintenance personnel responsible for regular servicing of equipment; they are frequently required to accompany the aircraft on deployments overseas. More complex servicing is conducted by Boeing. No. 36 Squadron's official crest, approved in May 1966, depicts a horse intended to symbolise strength, speed, mobility and dependability. The unit's motto is \\"Sure\\".No. 36 Squadron, Operations Record Book, p. 696 The squadron operates eight Boeing C-17 Globemaster IIIs, the first of which entered service in December 2006. The eighth and last was delivered in November 2015. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster, the latter being responsible for the loading, carriage and unloading of cargo or passengers. The C-17 can carry 70 tonnes of equipment, and is large enough to accommodate helicopters, tanks and other military vehicles. It can also carry over 130 passengers, and is designed for aerial despatch of paratroops or cargo. The C-17 has a range of some and is able to operate from short and unsealed airstrips. Flown with a joystick and fly-by- wire controls, the aircraft is also highly manoeuvrable and responsive considering its size.McPhedran, Air Force, pp. 228‚Äì231 It can be refuelled in flight by the Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports operated by No. 33 Squadron. History=World War II Dakota of No. 36 Squadron at alt=Twin-engined transport plane parked on a field near a fence During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four transport units: Nos. 33, 34, 35 and 36 Squadrons. No. 36 Squadron was established on 11 March at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, under the control of Southern Area Command.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 481 Its initial strength was twenty-six personnel and one Douglas DC-2.No. 36 Squadron, Operations Record Book, p. 674 This was gradually built up to a force of six DC-2s, as well as examples of various de Havilland types including the DH.84 Dragon, DH.86 Express, DH.89 Dragon Rapide, and Tiger Moth.Eather, Flying Squadrons, pp. 73‚Äì74RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, pp. 55‚Äì57 Tasked with transport operations throughout Australia and to Port Moresby, New Guinea, the squadron relocated to Essendon, Victoria, on 17 July.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 92‚Äì93 One of the DC-2s crashed at Seven Mile Aerodrome, Port Moresby, on 14 September; all aboard were killed. The squadron was transferred to Townsville, Queensland, on 11 December 1942. During 1943, it maintained detachments at Essendon and in New Guinea, and began re-equipping with twelve Douglas C-47 Dakotas. On 27 March 1943, a Dakota of No. 36 Squadron crashed on takeoff in pre-dawn fog at RAAF Station Archerfield, killing all twenty-three occupants, twenty of whom were RAAF or Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force personnel. The squadron relocated to Garbutt on 20 February 1944. During the New Guinea campaign it was responsible for carrying troops and cargo, and undertaking courier runs and supply drops. In 1945, a detachment of No. 36 Squadron Dakotas augmented No. 84 Wing's operations in Bougainville, flying almost 800 sorties between January and June.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 326 The squadron lost two Dakotas on supply missions in Aitape during February 1945. In August, it flew paratroopers into Singapore as part of the reoccupation of the city, after which it continued to transport troops and cargo, and repatriate prisoners of war. Following the end of hostilities, in March 1946, a detachment of six Dakotas established a courier service between Morotai and Japan, where Australian units had joined the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Berlin Airlift and Korean War Former prisoners of war board a Dakota of No. 36 Squadron in alt=Uniformed personnel boarding a twin-engined transport plane On 19 August 1946, No. 36 Squadron transferred to RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, where it came under the control of No. 86 (Transport) Wing along with Nos. 37 and 38 Squadrons, also operating Dakotas, and No. 486 (Maintenance) Squadron. No. 486 Squadron provided day-to-day servicing for each of the flying squadrons, deeper maintenance being handled by No. 2 Aircraft Depot, based at the nearby RAAF Station Richmond. Courier flights to Japan continued until December 1947, a round trip from Schofields.Parnell; Lynch, Australian Air Force Since 1911, p. 165 On 25 August 1948, twenty staff from No. 36 Squadron joined five crews from No. 38 Squadron to take part in the Berlin Airlift, a commitment that lasted almost a year.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 196 The Australians delivered over of supplies, and over 7,000 passengers. In the absence of these crews, Nos. 36 and 38 Squadron operations were amalgamated, flying hours being recorded under the latter's auspices. During June 1949, No. 36 Squadron and the other extant components of No. 86 Wing, Nos. 38 and 486 Squadrons, relocated from Schofields to Richmond.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, pp. 57‚Äì59 Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons began to operate separately again in June 1950, following the return of crews from Berlin and No. 38 Squadron's departure for service in the Malayan Emergency.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 247‚Äì249 No. 36 Squadron assumed control of the Governor-General's Flight in October 1950.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, p. 184 On 21 November 1952, the squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup for its proficiency. The return of No. 38 Squadron from Malaya in December stripped No. 36 Squadron of crews to ensure an even distribution of personnel among the two units. This led to No. 36 Squadron again merging with No. 38 Squadron. The former disbanded at Richmond on 9 March 1953, re-forming the next day from No. 30 Transport Unit at Iwakuni, Japan.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 116No. 36 Squadron, Operations Record Book, p. 41 Here it was part of No. 91 (Composite) Wing, which controlled the RAAF's units during the Korean War and its immediate aftermath.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 232 Its complement included eight Dakotas and one CAC Wirraway.No. 36 Squadron, Operations Record Book, p. 36 In July and August, the squadron evacuated over 900 Commonwealth prisoners of war. It departed Japan on 13 March 1955, having carried over 42,000 passengers and of cargo, and was re-established on 1 May at RAAF Base Canberra, where No. 86 Wing had transferred the previous year. Hercules era alt=Four-engined military transport plane parked on airfield No. 36 Squadron handed over its six Dakotas to No. 38 Squadron in July 1958, prior to re-equipping with the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. It returned to Richmond in August, followed by the rest of No. 86 Wing a month later.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 114‚Äì118 After conversion training of its personnel in the United States, No. 36 Squadron became the first non-US operator of the Hercules in December 1958, when it began taking delivery of twelve C-130As; deliveries completed in March 1959.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 97‚Äì98 The official history of the post-war Air Force described the Hercules as \\"probably the biggest step-up in aircraft capabilities\\" the RAAF had ever received, considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota, taking into account the improvements in payload, range, and speed.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 417 In September 1960, No. 36 Squadron began parachute trials on the Hercules. It made the Hercules' first troop-carrying flights into a combat zone in December 1962, joining a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the onset of the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia; similar missions were undertaken over the next five years. The squadron was again awarded the Gloucester Cup in 1963. In August 1964, No. 36 Squadron became an independently operating unit under the command of Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond, following the disbandment of No. 86 Wing. No. 486 Squadron was disbanded at the same time, leaving No. 36 Squadron responsible for its own day-to-day maintenance until 1966; No. 486 Squadron was re-formed that year to service both No. 36 Squadron and No. 37 Squadron, the latter having taken delivery of twelve C-130E Hercules.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 102, 114Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 424‚Äì425 During the Vietnam War, both squadrons undertook long-range transport and medical evacuation flights between Australia and South East Asia, servicing Phan Rang, Vung Tau, and Nui Dat.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 100 No. 36 Squadron was presented with its own standard by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on 1 April 1971, in recognition of a quarter-century's service. Eight of its twelve Hercules were involved in relief efforts after Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin, Northern Territory, on Christmas Eve 1974; the aircraft flew over 550 hours, carrying 2,864 passengers and almost of cargo. Having remained in service for twenty years, clocking up 147,000 accident-free flying hours, the C-130As were replaced by C-130Hs in 1978. alt=Colour photo of a four-engined aircraft painted in a camouflage pattern In November 1978, one of No. 36 Squadron's C-130Hs became the first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica, at McMurdo Sound. The squadron reached a total of 200,000 accident-free flying hours in C-130s during 1984.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 105 When No. 86 Wing was re-formed at Richmond on 2 February 1987, under the newly established Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group), No. 36 Squadron formed part of its complement.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 107‚Äì108, 115 The unit again received the Gloucester Cup in 1989. That year, it provided transport for civilian passengers during the pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines; three aircraft and five crews undertook this task, over and above their normal duties.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 110‚Äì111 The squadron reached 100,000 accident-free flying hours on the C-130H during 1990. In December 1990 and January 1991, it flew missions to Dubai in support of Australia's naval contribution to the Gulf War, and in 1993 transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of Operation Solace. Four of its C-130Hs were equipped with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs, including radar and missile warning systems, and countermeasures such as chaff and flares, in 1994. Later in the decade, one of the C-130Hs was fitted with signals intelligence equipment and crewed by RAAF and Defence Signals Directorate personnel. Six of No. 36 Squadron's Hercules evacuated over 450 civilians from Cambodia following the coup in July 1997. The unit again became responsible for its own routine maintenance in 1998, when No. 486 Squadron was disbanded. A detachment from No. 36 Squadron supported INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. The squadron was assigned four C-130Es previously operated by No. 37 Squadron during the latter's transition to the new C-130J Super Hercules, which commenced in 1999; the E models were retired the following year. No. 36 Squadron was once more awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001. It took part in relief efforts following the Bali Bombings in October 2002. In February 2003, it deployed a detachment of two Hercules to the Middle East as part of the Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq. The aircraft arrived on 10 February, and began flying transport sorties less than two weeks later. A No. 36 Squadron Hercules became the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase, west of Baghdad, after it was secured by Australian special forces personnel. One aircraft was hit by ground fire near Baghdad on 27 June 2004, killing a coalition passenger. The detachment remained in Iraq until September 2004, when it was relieved by two C-130Js from No. 37 Squadron. No. 36 Squadron also participated in Operation Sumatra Assist in the wake of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. Globemaster era alt=Four-engined jet transport plane on dirt airfield In May 2006, No. 36 Squadron personnel began conversion training in the US in preparation for re-equipping with Boeing C-17 Globemaster III heavy transports. It transferred its C-130Hs to No. 37 Squadron on 17 November 2006, prior to relocating to Amberley. Also on 17 November, Wing Commander Linda Corbould took command of the unit, becoming the first woman to lead an RAAF flying squadron. Corbould was responsible for delivering the first Globemaster from the United States to Australia on 4 December. No. 36 Squadron achieved initial operating capability with the C-17 on 11 September 2007, following eight months' work-up training. In June 2008, it received the Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most proficient flying squadron of 2007 \\"for achieving all training objectives, supporting air lift activities globally and nationally and fulfilling short-notice, high priority tasks, despite the squadron's expertise being in its infancy\\". Corbould completed her posting as commanding officer on 8 December 2008, the day the squadron marked the second anniversary of C-17 operations by conducting the RAAF's first flight with an all-female aircrew. Since re-equipping with the Globemaster, No. 36 Squadron has continued to support Coalition forces in Afghanistan, as well as humanitarian operations worldwide. In 2011, it took part in relief efforts following the floods in Queensland, the Christchurch earthquake, and the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The Queensland floods necessitated the evacuation of two C-17s to Richmond, when Amberley was threatened by rising waters; of the other two Globemasters, one was in the Middle East and the other was undergoing maintenance at Amberley and could not be flown but was moved onto high ground and escaped damage. The deployment to Japan involved all three of the squadron's available C-17s, the fourth still being serviced at Amberley. On 11 May 2012, a C-17 flew an Australian Army M1 Abrams tank from RAAF Base Darwin to Shoalwater Bay for a training exercise; it was the first time an RAAF Globemaster had airlifted an Abrams, which at 61 tonnes was among the largest single items the 70-tonne-capacity aircraft could carry. In November that year the squadron took delivery of its sixth Globemaster. It was again awarded the Gloucester Cup in March 2013, for its proficiency the previous year. C-17 loading a Japan Ground Self-Defense Force truck as part of the humanitarian response to the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami In September 2014, RAAF C-17s were used to airlift arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq following an offensive by ISIL militants. On 10 April 2015, Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the purchase of two more C-17s, which would bring No. 36 Squadron's complement to eight aircraft. Concurrent with delivery of the new C-17s by year's end, No. 36 Squadron's facilities were to be improved, obviating the need for maintenance to take place in No. 33 Squadron hangars. Also on 10 April, the squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup a record seventh time, and the RAAF's Maintenance Trophy a record fourth time. Later the same month, an Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport of No. 33 Squadron carried out the RAAF's first in-flight refuelling of a No. 36 Squadron Globemaster. The Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove, presented the squadron with a new standard on 19 May; the old standard was laid up in Holy Trinity Chapel at RAAF Williams, Victoria. No. 36 Squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation in the Queen's Birthday Honours on 13 June 2016 for \\"sustained outstanding service in warlike operations throughout the Middle East Area of Operations over the period January 2002 to June 2014\\".

Biography Bolm graduated from the Russian Imperial Ballet School in Saint Petersburg in 1904 (the teacher was Platon Karsavinru: Biographies of figures of ballet), and that same year he became a dancer with Mariinsky Ballet. In 1908 and 1909 he ran a European tour with Anna Pavlova. He then collaborated with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris, along with several other dancers from Mariinsky. In 1917, during the second part of a two-part American tour by the Ballets Russes (without Diaghilev, but with Nijinsky), Bolm was injured during the ballet Thamar. The injury was serious, and he was taken to the hospital for a long time and left the tour to stay in the United States. In 1917 he also provided instruction to the young ballerina Ruth Page. New York Public Library Archives - Ruth Page Collection 1918-70 at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts - Jerome Robbins Dance Division, New York City, USA on archives.nypl.org He went on to organize Ballet Intime in New York and choreographed for the New York Metropolitan Opera. Bolm and dancer Ruth Page appeared together in an experimental dance film Danse Macabre (1922) directed by Dudley Murphy. In 1919 he moved to Chicago, which served as his base from which he taught widely across the country. From 1921 to 1923, for example, he was invited by Nellie Cornish to direct the summer intensive program in dance at The Cornish School (now Cornish College of the Arts) in Seattle.Cornish, Nellie Centennial. Miss Aunt Nellie; Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1964. p 139 ff. There he produced original works, such as The Gargoyles of Notre Dame in 1922.Cornish, Nellie Centennial.

No fewer than three of his students and dancers headed the program at the school from the 1910s to the 1950s: Mary Ann Wells, Caird Leslie, and Lee Foley. In 1929, Bolm moved to California. In 1933, following the opening of the War Memorial Opera House, the San Francisco Opera established the San Francisco Opera Ballet (SFOB) under Bolm's direction as the ballet master. On June 2, 1933, even before he produces dances for operas, SFOB begins presenting independent, all-dance programs. Bolm continued to work in California and New York through 1947. He was one of the five choreographers involved in the 1940 founding season for New York's Ballet Theatre. His last appearance on stage was in 1943, as the Moor in Petrushka at the Hollywood Bowl with the Ballet Theatre. His last choreography was for San Francisco Ballet (the successor to SFOB): \\"Mephisto\\" in 1947, from Mephisto Waltzes by Franz Liszt (revived in 1948).

Biography  Messas was born in Meknes, Morocco in 1909. He was the son of Rabbi Mimoun Messas and his wife, Rachel. In his youth, he studied with his father and with Rabbi Yitzhak Sabag, Dayan and Rosh Yeshiva in Meknes. Messas also attended an Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle school. He was a promising Torah prodigy at a very young age, and was a leading student of Morocco's Chief Rabbi Yehoshua Berdugo. The Messas family is an old one, with roots deep within Spain and Portugal. Shalom Messas was appointed Chief Rabbi of Casablanca at the young age of 36; he later served as Chief Rabbi of all Morocco. In 1978, then Israeli Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef asked Rabbi Messas to come to the holy city and become its Chief Sephardic Rabbinical authority. When he departed for Israel, Messas was escorted to the airport by Morocco's King Hassan II himself, who requested that the Rabbi bless him one last time before his departure, and with that was his last official act in Moroccan. Ovadia Yosef consulted with Messas in matters of Jewish law and scholarship, often citing him as his support in issuing bold halachic decisions. Messas worked on important matters of Halacha right up to his last days. He was said to be very exact in preserving Sephardic customs, and would work full days and nights to try to find a Halachic way to solve the issue at hand. As an author of many books, he wrote his first significant scholarly work, Mizrach Shemesh in 1930, and his last work, V'Cham HaShemesh was written in 2002. Messas died on Shabbat Hagadol (April 12), 2003, at the age of ninety. He was buried in Har HaMenuchot in Jerusalem. His many works include: Mizrah Shemesh, Tevouot Shemesh, Shemesh Umagen, Beit Shemesh and Veham Hashemesh. He also edited and published the following books: * Divre Moshe by Chief Rabbi Moses ben Abraham Berdugo, called \\"Mashbir\\" * Divre Mordechai by Rabbi Mordechai Berdugo, Hamarbitz * Torot Emet, Me Menuhot, Rav Peninim and Messamehe Lev by his great-great-great-grandfather Rabbi Raphael Berdugo * Lev Mevin and Penei Mevin by Rabbi Mimoun Berdugo * Edout Beyaakov by his great-grandfather Rabbi Yaacov Berdugo. * Divre Chalom by his grandfather also named Rabbi Chalom Messas. * Guevoul Binyamine * Divre Yossef See also * David Messas (his son).

Following the end of the war its role expanded to become a large-scale developer and public housing authority, but since the 1980s this has been curtailed. From the early 2000s to the 1st of July 2018 SAHT Services were administered through Housing SA, a division within the Department for Human Services. From the 1st of July 2018 Housing SA and Renewal SA were merged into the South Australian Housing Authority. History South Australia's Liberal and Country League (LCL) government established the SAHT as Australia's first state housing authority in 1936. It was conceived not as a means of improving living standards through improved housing or town planning but as a tool in the government's emerging plan for attracting industrial investment by keeping labour costs below those in the main rival states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria. This role was most developed during Thomas Playford's 26 years as LCL premier (1938‚Äì1965). Playford supported the expansion of the SAHT as a major state enterprise and as a key instrument in the economic policies initiated by his predecessor as premier, Richard Butler.Susan Marsden (1986): Business, charity and sentiment: the South Australian Housing Trust 1936 - 1986 Wakefield Press, Adelaide. As these policies were principally concerned with promoting industrial development and population growth, their effects were concentrated on Adelaide. Most scholars acknowledge that the main outcome of Playford's administration was a hastened rate of industrialisation. Rather than industrialisation itself, the most tangible outcome of Playford era policies was a new metropolitan Adelaide. A role as urban developer was implicit in the Trust's founding purpose of constructing workers' cottages on a scale sufficient to restrain rents in Adelaide generally and stimulate the private building industry. From its inauguration in 1937, the SAHT board embarked upon a wider metropolitan planning role in its selection of sites for housing estates. These inadvertent urban planning roles became more self-conscious and more extensive from the late 1940s as Playford supported industrial development by creating or greatly expanding State enterprises such as the Electricity Trust of South Australia and the SAHT. The urban policy role of the SAHT was part of the government's strategies of general industrial development. The undertaking of explicitly urban development roles was also due to the restructuring of the SAHT during the mid-1940s, with additional staff and responsibilities, a new chairman (Jack Cartledge) and general manager (Alex Ramsay). Cartledge and Ramsay were highly intelligent and capable men who created the post-war organisation with its pervasive powers and directed the SAHT for the remaining years of the Playford government. Both men were conscious of the role of the SAHT in determining the overall direction of urban growth, and not merely contributing to it. Post-World War II Seaton, showing little exterior modification of the original design After the Second World War the Trust became one of the most powerful of the State authorities. Many new activities were supported by Playford, which enabled the SAHT to act as a total development authority, so that it could foster new suburban areas, industrial and economic development, and population expansion. The SAHT thus operated as \\"metropolitan planner\\" at several levels simultaneously: as formal town planner (at Elizabeth); as de facto metropolitan planner, integrating factory development and housing and extending the suburbs; and as a major State planner, particularly in relation to industrialisation and immigration.Susan Marsden (1994): Constructing Playford‚Äôs city: the South Australian Housing Trust and the transformation of Adelaide, 1936-1966, PhD thesis, Flinders University of South Australia. 1960s-late 1990s The Trust's wide roles as a large-scale developer and public housing authority were curtailed from the late 1980s. The statutory authority also came under departmental control, at first under the Department of Human Services, and from 2004 under the Department for Families and Communities. In its 70th year the functions of the SAHT were taken over by Housing SA, a division within that department.Susan Marsden (2011): Business, charity and sentiment: Part Two, The South Australian Housing Trust 1987-2011 Wakefield Press, Adelaide.

He bats right-handed and bowls right-arm fast. International career Having previously represented his country at Under-15 level, he made his ODI debut for Pakistan in 2000 when he was 17 years old against Sri Lanka in Karachi and took his first wicket in this match. He played just one more match the following year before being dropped. He was given a second chance at international cricket in the last ODI against England in December 2005 and was retained for the series against India in February 2006, but was left out of the ODI squad for the subsequent tour in England. His next chance at international cricket came in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy when he was one of the players called up to the Pakistan squad for the Champions Trophy to replace Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif who had both failed drug tests. In March 2007, he and Mohammad Sami were called up as replacements in Pakistan's squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup after Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif were ruled out through injury. On 8 December 2007, Arafat made his Test match debut for Pakistan against India in Bangalore in the third and final Test of the series. He displayed his all-round abilities by taking 7 wickets in the match including a 5-wicket haul, and scoring 44 in the first innings. It had been reported (2 August 2008, Hindustan Times, Karachi) that he has signed with the Kolkata Knight Riders to play in the second season of the Indian Premier League 20/20 tournament in 2009 although as Pakistanis were not allowed to play in the tournament, no deal was reached. Domestic career In English domestic cricket, he was signed as an overseas player for Scotland as a replacement for Rahul Dravid, and played for them in the 2004 and 2005 seasons. He was signed as an overseas player for Sussex for the 2006 season to line-up alongside fellow countrymen Mushtaq Ahmed and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan, and helped the team to win the double of the County Championship and the C&G; Trophy as well as mount a serious challenge in the Pro40 League. He was signed up to play for Kent in the 2007 season. In 2004, Arafat performed the extremely rare feat of taking five wickets in six balls for Rawalpindi against the national champions Faisalabad in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. This had only been achieved three times previously in the entire history of first-class cricket: by Bill Copson in 1937, William Henderson in 1938 and Pat Pocock in 1972. Arafat was the only bowler to take the wickets spread over two innings. Following the 2008 season, Arafat signed once more for Sussex as their overseas player for 2009, signing to return again for another season in 2010. In 2011 he signed for Surrey County Cricket Club. He joined Lancashire as an overseas player for the 2012 Friends Life t20. Arafat was signed to play in Big Bash League franchise Perth Scorchers in December 2013.

It has also supported Australian humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the world, including in Somalia, East Timor, Bali, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. The squadron was formed at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, in July 1943, and equipped with Lockheed C-60 Lodestars that it operated in Australia, New Guinea and the Dutch East Indies. Towards the end of the war it began flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas. It became part of No. 86 (Transport) Wing, headquartered at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, in 1946 but was disbanded two years later. In response to Australia's increasing air transport needs during the Vietnam War, the squadron was re-formed at Richmond in February 1966, and equipped with the Hercules. It converted to the C-130J model in 1999, and between 2006 and 2012 also operated C-130Hs formerly of No. 36 Squadron.

The squadron contributed eleven aircraft to the relief effort, carrying 4,400 passengers and of cargo. No. 37 Squadron aircraft took part in Operation Babylift, the US-led effort to evacuate the orphaned children of American servicemen from Vietnam in April 1975. Later that month, two of the squadron's aircraft were assigned to the United Nations (UN) to transport supplies throughout South East Asia; the C-130s' Australian roundels were painted over with UN symbols to signify the mission's neutrality. Commencing operations in May, the aircraft flew supplies into Laos and transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore, completing ninety-one sorties by the time the mission ended in early June. The Hercules also evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Saigon, South Vietnam, and Phnom Penh, Cambodia, following the end of the Vietnam War.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 274 No. 37 Squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup by the Governor General in June 1976 for its performance in 1974‚Äì75. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1979, two No. 37 Squadron C-130Es evacuated Australian and other foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. The same year, the squadron began operations with two ex-Qantas Boeing 707s, handing them over to No. 33 Flight (later No. 33 Squadron) at the beginning of 1981. No. 37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles on John Paul II's 1986 tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a stud bull presented to the Chinese government, kangaroos and sheep to Malaysia, and an exhibition of China's Entombed Warriors.

No. 37 Squadron was strengthened to create a \\"super squadron\\" on 17 November 2006, when its force of twelve C-130Js was augmented by No. 36 Squadron's twelve C-130Hs, prior to the latter re- equipping with Boeing C-17 Globemasters and relocating to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. Two of the C-130s joined DHC-4 Caribous from No. 38 Squadron as part of the RAAF's initial contribution to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist following Cyclone Guba in November 2007. No. 37 Squadron took over full responsibility for the Hercules detachment to the MEAO in mid-2008, and in March 2010 one of its C-130Js completed the detachment's 20,000th hour of flying operations.McPhedran, Air Force, p. 11 The squadron was transferred from No. 86 Wing to No. 84 Wing on 1 October 2010, as part of a restructure of Air Lift Group. It was presented with the Gloucester Cup for its proficiency in 2011 at a ceremony on 31 May 2012. The C-130Hs were retired the same year, the last pair at Richmond on 30 November. In January 2013, No. 37 Squadron undertook a successful search-and-rescue mission for Alain Delord, a missing round-the-world yachtsman who was found approximately south of Tasmania. Crews located Delord adrift in a life raft before airdropping supplies, maintaining watch and ultimately guiding in a rescue vessel fifty-eight hours later. No. 37 Squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency in March 2013. It celebrated its 70th Anniversary on 17 July, undertaking a two-ship flight over Sydney and the Blue Mountains. That November, the squadron deployed to the Philippines to participate in humanitarian relief operations in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. In August 2014, aircraft from No. 37 Squadron based in the Middle East were involved in the airdrop of humanitarian supplies to civilians in Iraq following an offensive by Islamic State forces. The first drop occurred on the night of 13/14 August, when one of the squadron's C-130Js took part in a 16-aircraft mission including US C-17s and C-130Hs and a British C-130J that delivered supplies to Yezidi civilians trapped on Mount Sinjar. According to the Australian Department of Defence, it was the RAAF's \\"most complex operational humanitarian air drop mission in more than a decade\\". A second drop was conducted to deliver supplies to isolated civilians in the northern Iraqi town of Amirli. By September 2014, the RAAF's C-130Js had accumulated over 100,000 flying hours. Later that month, a C-130J took part in the airlift of arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq; the involvement of RAAF transport aircraft in operations in Iraq is ongoing. From 7 to 10 December 2015, a C-130J of No. 37 Squadron flying out of Guam joined American and Japanese aircraft in Operation Christmas Drop, a humanitarian aerial supply operation in the west Pacific and Micronesia. No. 37 Squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation in the Queen's Birthday Honours on 13 June 2016 for \\"sustained outstanding service in warlike operations throughout the Middle East Area of Operations over the period January 2002 to June 2014\\". The squadron commemorated sixty years of RAAF Hercules operations in December 2018, and twenty years of C-130J operations in September 2019. One of the C-130s flew from Australia to Antarctica in February 2020, the first time a RAAF Hercules had done so since 1983, to provide equipment for the Australian Antarctic Division near Casey Station.

These sculptures were typically finished with automobile paint although some were left to develop a natural patina during display outdoors. He was also recognized internationally for his fine, architectural, landscape, and whimsical monumental art as well as abstracts. Sculpture and life figures by Gary often included intricate use of stained glass and his works were frequently composed of, or included, hardware, machine parts, and tools. He employed painted steel in many works, it being his metal of choice. One of his signature works, Universal Woman, a life-sized figure of a woman composed entirely of hardware gained the admiration of renowned sculptor Jacques Lipchitz at a sidewalk show in New York in the early 1960s. Both are modernist sculptors. The Washington Post featured a zoom image from their files of this sculpture in its electronic edition of their 2006 tribute to Gary at his death. A 1971 museum exhibit of his fine art in Washington, D.C. was cited in his listing in Who Was Who in American Art, 1564-1975: 400 Years of Artists in America, a standard library art reference.Who Was Who in American Art, 1564-1975: 400 years of artists in America, Peter Hastings Falk, editor-in-chief, Sound View Press, Madison, Connecticut, September 1999, in three volumes In 2011 the Asbury Park Press referred to Gary as an icon in the arts.

During the same month, on January 24, 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported in an article, Jim Gary, 66; Artist Who Created Playful Dinosaur Skeletons From Car Parts, that some critics compared Jim Gary's sculptures with Pablo Picasso's famous bull's head made from a bicycle seat and handlebars.

For almost a year he secretly slept in the garage of the Sterner family, a prominent Monmouth County couple in the same community, who employed him regularly. Once the family discovered this, they provided space in their home for him. He remained close to them until they died.Navarra, Tova, Jim Gary: his life and art, 1987, HFN, Inc., p. 13-14 Gary attended Freehold High School, where he developed an interest in sculpting with wood; he was inducted into the school's hall of fame in 2007.Celano, Clare Marie. \\"Freehold alumni join school‚Äôs hall of fame\\", news Transcript, April 18, 2007.

Accessed January 11, 2017. \\"He graduated from Freehold Regional High School, where he became interested in wood working and began to make wooden sculptures.\\" From junk parts, Jim Gary built what he needed to get about, first a bicycle and soon‚Äîlong before he was old enough to drive on the roads legally‚Äîautomobiles. He competed in gymnastics as a student. After serving in the United States Navy he taught welding and gymnastics in a federal program. During this period he developed a deft hand at welding. Shortly thereafter, applying these welding skills, he began making sculptures that he marketed as architectural elements, and showing his fine art in the New York metropolitan area.Benz, Kafi, Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs, Kafi Benz Productions, 2001 The admiration of welders regarding his welding skills also is documented on his official web site. Early career Reassured of the caliber of his work by the compliments he received in the encounter with Lipchitz (who made a professional suggestion for a better method of preparing a stand for the life-sized torso Gary had on display), he established his gallery, Iron Butterfly, in Colts Neck featuring the works of other artists he selected as well as his own work, later moving the gallery to Red Bank. The multitalented Gerald Lubeck was one such artist featured at Gary's fledgling gallery. Classes were offered at the gallery by Jim Gary and Virginia Laudano (who later, would manage the gallery when Gary was on tour and currently is an instructor Virginia Laudano is an instructor at the Art Club of Sun City Center at an art center in Florida). Gary's fine art‚Äîsuch as the life-sized Universal Woman‚Äîwall units, bronze portraits and busts, and abstracts consistently won top prizes when submitted in the professional show circuits of New York and the surrounding states. He featured stained glass in many of his formal sculptures. It was often used for accent, but some life- sized figurative studies such as Stained Glass Woman with Tattoo were constructed entirely of multi-colored glass sections welded together. He was commissioned to create entire suites of rooms, integrating his sculpture into furniture he built. Commissions included ornate metal doors made to order. He sometimes used the products of clients to create fine art for their offices. Brewers especially liked to give huge seasonal wreaths he constructed from their original cans. One of his works had brass fish swimming through copper seagrass. Some of his sculptures were kinetic. Commissions from clients often asked merely for his interpretation of their favorite subject. Examples of his many architectural sculptures include his baptismal font for Saint Benedict's Catholic Church in nearby Holmdel, a Holocaust memorial commissioned in Springfield, his life-sized nudes in metal and stained glass for the Monmouth County Opera Society, and the September 11 memorial at the Municipal Building in Colts Neck. As he gathered parts for the unique automobiles he constructed when he was young, Jim Gary said he realized that these parts resembled anatomical structures of insects, large birds, reptiles, and especially the bones of dinosaurs. Early in his career, he began to construct sculptures of those animals by assembling the automobile parts into almost life-sized models. He used as many as eight to ten vehicles to create his large dinosaur sculptures and the unaltered parts are identifiable. Common tools became pivotal structures in some of his sculptures. Volkswagens metamorphosed into turtles and prehistoric dinosaurs. Gary had to invent equipment to build and move the huge sculptures, creating the scaffolding, hoists, and even special vehicles that featured cranes to haul the sculptures around at his rural workshop and to place them onto trucks for transportation. He also relied upon blacksmith skills to fashion unique hand tools when no standard ones were useful for his needs. International traveling exhibition launched These sculptures provided a unique display that became Jim Gary's hallmark by the early 1970s and soon it became the traveling exhibition, Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs, which appealed to toddlers through grandparents. Some of his signature sculptures in the exhibition exceeded sixty feet and Gary frequently painted them in bright colors using automobile paints. They were often transported to exhibitions on huge, open flatbed trucks, fascinating fellow travelers on the roads. Impromptu parades formed as drivers followed the dinosaurs to their destination or a stopping point, where people milled around the trucks asking questions and admiring the sculptures. In 1979 the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia contracted with Gary for an exhibition of his sculptures.Twentieth Century Dinosaurs return to Tallahassee Museum, August 26, 2011 It is the oldest institution of its kind in the entire hemisphere. The implications of their acceptance of his work as interesting to scientists and their audiences as well as to art lovers and popular culture audiences set Gary on a course for his career that garnered invitations from all over the world through marketing targeted to diverse types of museums and venues. Steve Miller of the New York Sun noted in his news breaking obituary in 2006 Miller, Stephen, Jim Gary, 66, Made Dinosaurs From Auto Parts, New York Sun, January 17, 2006 that the museum exhibit at the academy brought national attention to Jim Gary.Benz, Kafi, Sculptor Jim Gary Memorial Fund and early tributes, Kafi Benz Productions, January‚ÄìFebruary 2006 In 1982 his sculpture was hosted by Carnegie.The Pittsburgh Post Gazette, April 16, 1982, page 25 Once asked why he built all of the enormous dinosaur sculptures, the typically quiet sculptor responded, \\"Because people like them.\\" The huge crowds who flocked to his exhibits demonstrated their immense popularity. Grinning Jim Gary birds, critters, and dinosaurs have been featured in articles and on the covers of magazines from Smithsonian and Sculpture Review (publication of the National Sculpture Society) to National Geographic World (now called, National Geographic Kids) and Time. His work has been featured in textbooks, encyclopedias, educational videos, newspapers, on the Internet, and on television shows around the world. In January 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported that \\"one of his works, Stegosaurus, is included in Alphabet Animals, a children's book by Charles Sullivan that includes depictions of animals by John James Audubon, Alexander Calder, and Marc Chagall.\\" All of the letters of the alphabet were taught using works of fine art through illustrations or professional photographs of artworks. \\"S\\" was taught with Gary's green dinosaur, Stegosaurus. After the display became the permanent Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs exhibition, it traveled internationally to museums and universities; was used as sets for films, plays, and operas; was presented as exhibits for national auto shows and racing events as well as the premier international auto shows such as New York and Detroit; and was presented as landscape displays in the most elegant of botanical gardens, such as Longwood Gardens on the Pierre S. du Pont estate. The premier research and development center for revolutionary technologies, Bell Laboratories, booked a private exhibition of fifty of Gary's sculptures in 1981 for the atrium lobby of their Holmdel facility for the benefit of its employees, as the first in a diversified art program planned to provide the enhancement of the environment and enrichment and cultural benefits for the employees and the visitors to the center. A well-publicized reception for the opening of the solo show at the corporation was attended by the family and friends of the staff.Wils-Fontaine, Hildy, Gary's art turns back clock, The Register, Shrewsbury, New Jersey, August 16, 1981 The exhibition was booked for a tour of Japan that began in April 1984. The poster displayed to the right was for the opening exhibition at a national museum in Tokyo that lasted through May, before making a six- month tour to museums in other Japanese cities. Posters were distributed in the cities that were included in the tour and they were displayed in buses, trains, and other public places to announce the exhibition in each museum.

Jim Gary, 66; sculptor created his art using junked auto parts , Associated Press, posted January 22, 2006 on Boston.com Gary is the only living sculptor ever invited for a solo show and the museum director indicated that it exceeded the number of visitors to any other exhibitions. Commissioned work and fees for the exhibitions of his work that were so heavily attended became his mainstay. His gallery was closed in favor of marketing through his studio. Signature sculptures of Gary's fine art were among the works displayed in these solo shows and tours, attracting many commissions for private collections. Selected works offered for sale sometimes accompanied the permanent exhibition as it was booked for displays, shows, and exhibits. In 1993 the award-winning Nicky Silver play, Pterodactyls, featured Jim Gary sculptures in its sets when it opened in Manhattan. When the state of New Jersey held the gala opening of its first major science museum, the Liberty Science Center, just across the harbor from lower Manhattan on January 28, 1993, the entire first floor exhibition space was devoted to what the museum director called \\"the spectacular dinosaur sculptures made by... Jim Gary\\".Kolata, Gina, Science Gets Its Chance to Dazzle, New York Times, January 22, 1993 A Jim Gary dinosaur is in the collection of Ripley's Believe It or Not!, which displays the sculpture in its museums and features the Gary \\"Stegosaurus\\" in its publications. Ripley first exhibited it in their museum in Daegu, Korea and the sculpture travels to other locations. Many fledgling nonprofit organizations raising funds to build museums and creating parks for children held an exhibition of Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs by covering the expense of the complicated shipping alone, as he donated his normal fees to the cause. Some were able to raise enough funds from fees paid by the visitors to the popular exhibits that, eventually, they could afford to purchase one of his dinosaurs in a permanent acquisition to their collection. Great numbers of museums especially designed to engage children have hosted exhibitions of Gary's sculpture. Generations have grown up with vivid memories of his work and his encouragement for them to follow his dynamic example. Astounding attendance records demonstrated a cross-cultural popularity in Australia, China, and Japan. The last solo shows featuring the Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs exhibition on tour during the lifetime of the sculptor were two related ones in North Carolina in 2004. First the exhibition was displayed at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord for its Spring Extravaganza, after which the sculptures traveled to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte for an exhibition hosted by its Belk College of Business. The sculptures were featured both indoors and outside on the large campus with walking and driving tours offered to the public, and the tour was extended twice. > Jim Gary is a self-taught sculptor whose works include abstracts, three- > dimensional portraits, architectural, and functional pieces, as well as the > celebrated collection of \\"Twentieth Century Dinosaurs\\"...

Coverage was frequent by the mass media, both published and broadcast, not only for openings of exhibitions of his work, but as a featured sculptor whose work remained interesting and popular with the public. Gary always took the time to make appearances at schools to show children how he made his sculptures and to encourage them to pursue their own creative talents. Along with typical pieces of his work he also provided small sculptures made of materials familiar to children at school lectures. He personally answered every letter sent to him by a youngster. As reported by Karen DeMasters in The New York Times on December 16, 2001, in Hark, the Pterodactyl's Wing, every year Jim Gary provided hot chocolate, coffee, and cookies to those visiting an illuminated display of his sculpture, open to the public at his home, to celebrate the holidays in December. Lights were strung on the sculptures to delineate the structure of each dinosaur. During these displays Gary gave lectures and led discussions about his work. In 2005, Gary became too ill to manage his traditional and festive seasonal event, choosing instead to display a few works at a gallery in a nearby community. Gary was quite welcoming to people who stopped by his home to admire the sculptures that he always kept among his well-tended gardens. It was not unusual for him to invite visitors to sit down and chat for a while. Garysaurus ‚Äî and other neologisms A tribute to the sculptor was published on February 14, 2006, in the British newspaper, The Guardian, by Andrew Roth, a well known biographer and journalist whose detailed obituaries were composed for national and international figures of note.Guardian profile of Andrew Roth obituaries includes a catalogue of his work that is valued for biographical and historical interests In this tribute the author coined a new word, Garysaurus, a neologism to describe a dinosaur sculpture created by Jim Gary. The memorials, tributes, and obituaries for Jim Gary were numerous, the international recognition reflecting the widespread appeal of his work. Roth's apt name for Gary's dinosaur sculptures has begun to be used by others. Stegosaurus by Jim Gary Early in his career, the invention of neologisms arose for Gary's dinosaurs. Chevrosaurus was among the first when it was published in the New York Times in May 1979.Cummings, Sandra; Artist's Palette Is the Junkyard; The Chevrosaurus Lives in Monmouth; May 20, 1979, New York Times, Sunday, Section: New Jersey Weekly, Page NJ1 Another New York Times writer described one of Gary's works as a Diner-saurus in 1993, because when the green Stegosaurus was not traveling on exhibition, he usually displayed it at the diner he frequented. None of these stuck for long without the Gary name as part of the new words, as Roth's clever title does in his tribute.

In other words, both place of birth and Belgian parentage are relevant for determining whether a person is a Belgian citizen. It is regulated by the Code of Belgian Nationality. In some circumstances citizenship is granted to children born in Belgium to non-Belgian parents; however, this is not the case if the parents are temporary or short-term visitors. Birth in Belgium A person born in Belgium (to non-Belgian parents) is a Belgian citizen if that person: * holds no other nationality at the time of birth (i.e., is stateless) OR; * loses any other nationality before turning 18 OR; * has a parent who was born in Belgium and who has lived in Belgium for at least five years during the last 10 years OR; * is adopted (while under 18) by a parent holding another nationality who was born in Belgium and who has had their main place of residence in Belgium for five years during the 10-year period before the adoption takes effect. * has two parents or adoptive parents born abroad who submitted a declaration before that person's twelfth birthday requesting that the person be granted Belgian nationality. Belgium must have been the parents' main place of residence during the 10 years preceding the declaration, and the person must have lived in Belgium since birth. Effectively this means that: * the children of long- resident immigrants can acquire Belgian citizenship * the Grandchildren of immigrants to Belgium are normally Belgian by birth Birth to a Belgian parent Access to Belgian citizenship depends on one's date of birth: Before 1 January 1967 Belgian citizenship is acquired by: * the legitimate child of a father who is a Belgian citizen OR; * a person born outside wedlock who was acknowledged by one's mother who is a Belgian citizen, at least until being acknowledged by one's father (if happening before majority age : 21 years old). That person is definitely Belgian after one's majority if no change occurred. 1 January 1967 to 31 December 1984 Belgian citizenship is acquired by: * birth in Belgium to a Belgian citizen OR; * birth outside Belgium where the person is the legitimate child of a father who is a Belgian citizen OR; * birth outside Belgium to a mother who is a Belgian citizen and who was born in Belgium or in Belgian Congo before 30 June 1960 or in Rwanda or Burundi before 1 July 1962. On or after 1 January 1985 Belgian citizenship is acquired by: * birth in Belgium to a Belgian citizen OR; * One was born abroad AND: **1. the Belgian parent was born in Belgium or in Belgian Congo before 30 June 1960 or in Rwanda or Burundi before 1 July 1962 OR; **2. the Belgian parent was born abroad and makes a declaration, within a period of five years following the child's birth, requesting that he be granted Belgian nationality. This declaration (declaration d'attribution/toekenningsverklaring) must be submitted to the Belgian embassy or consulate in the main place of residence of the Belgian parent abroad, or the registrar in the parent's municipality (if the parent lives in Belgium). Belgian nationality is obtained on the date upon which the declaration is made. Where a person is born outside Belgium and the Belgian parent who was born abroad does not submit a \\"d√©claration d'attribution/toekenningsverklaring\\" within a period of five years following the child's birth, a late declaration is allowed provided the child does not have another. If the child risks becoming stateless due to the other parent not being able to transfer their nationality, or the country of birth not granting nationality, the child will acquire Belgian nationality automatically. If the child then acquires another nationality before age 18, Belgian nationality is lost. Naturalisation as a Belgian citizen Before January 1 of 2013 (when modifications to the Belgium Nationality Code entered into force) after three years of legal residence in Belgium any person aged 18 or more years, could apply for a naturalisation. Since 1 of January 2013, naturalisation has only been granted as an exceptional act resulting in appreciation that the applicant possesses exceptional merits in the fields of sport, culture, or science.Naturalisations: FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions No residence period is formally required. The process of \\"declaration of nationality\\" is essentially a form of naturalisation without formality. Belgian citizenship by declaration Unlike naturalisation (a privilege), declaration of Belgian citizenship is a right of those legal aliens who respond to certain criteria defined in Nationality Code of Belgium. Nationality declaration From the age of 18 a person can obtain Belgian nationality by signing a nationality declaration if that person meets one of the following criteria: * born in Belgium and with main place of residence in Belgium, without any interruptions since birth OR; * a declaration may be made by a foreigner who is the parent of a Belgian child OR; * one is married to a Belgian citizen and has been living together during the past three years and provided the foreign spouse has legally resided in Belgium for five years OR; * if one has resided in Belgium for five years provided the person is handicapped, invalid, or retired OR; * a former Belgian citizen who lost citizenship other than by forfeiture OR; * the person has had a main place of residence in Belgium for at least five years. The integration requirement applies to all the previous criteria except those who were born in Belgium and those who are handicapped, invalid, or retired. Being integrated is defined as knowing one of the three national languages and being duly 'socially integrated' and 'economically active'.http://eudo- citizenship.eu/admin/?p=file&appl;=countryProfiles&f;=2013-27-Belgium.pdf The nationality declaration can only be signed in front of the registrar in the applicant's municipality in Belgium. This declaration cannot be approved by a Belgian embassy or consulate. Opting for Belgian nationality between 18 and 22 years of age Effective January 1, 2013, the option procedure was abolished by the Act of 4 December 2012. A person aged between 18 and 22 can sign a declaration indicating opting for Belgian nationality if that person meets one of the following criteria: * born in Belgium OR; * born abroad and one of the person's adoptive parents is a Belgian citizen at the time the declaration opting for Belgian nationality is made OR; * born abroad and one of the person's parents or adoptive parents was a Belgian citizen when the person was born OR; * born abroad and with a main place of residence in Belgium with the person's parents or adoptive parents for at least one year before the child turned six. All applicants must also meet the following criteria: * main place of residence must have been in Belgium during the 12-month period preceding the declaration; and * main place of residence in Belgium either between the ages of 14 and 18 or for a period of at least nine years. The applicant is exempt from these latter two criteria if one the person's parents or adoptive parents was a Belgian citizen or had previously held Belgian citizenship at the time of the person's birth. Residence abroad can be equated with residence in Belgium if one can prove that one has genuine ties with Belgium. Belgian citizenship by marriage Since 1 January 1985, marriage does not give any direct claim to Belgian citizenship. However, a spouse may request Belgian nationality after the marriage has taken place. Belgian citizenship by adoption From 1 January 1988, children adopted by Belgian citizens generally acquire Belgian citizenship on the same basis as those born to Belgian citizens. Different rules apply for adoptions completed prior to 1988. Loss of Belgian citizenship A person at least 18 years old who voluntarily obtained another nationality before 9 June 2007 automatically lost their Belgian nationality. A person at least 18 years old who voluntarily obtained the nationality of Austria, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain or the United Kingdom between 9 June 2007 and 28 April 2008 automatically lost their Belgian nationality. A person who voluntarily obtains another nationality after 28 April 2008 will no longer lose their Belgian nationality, regardless of the nationality acquired. It is also possible to lose Belgian citizenship in the following circumstances Residence overseas A Belgian citizen born outside Belgium on or after 1 January 1967 will lose Belgian citizenship at age 28 if: * between the ages of 18 and 28, the person's main place of residence was not in Belgium AND; * the person holds one or more other nationalities AND; * the person has not made a d√©claration de conservation/behoudsverklaring (declaration stating ones intention to retain Belgian nationality) between the ages of 18 and 28. Previously, to avoid losing ones Belgian nationality a person not only had to make a d√©claration de conservation/behoudsverklaring between the ages of 18 and 28, it also had to be made again every 10 years.Belgium Today, Vol. 12, Issue 1 Renunciation A Belgian citizen aged 18 and over may renounce Belgian citizenship by declaration lodged with the Belgian authorities. Children A child under 18 will lose Belgian citizenship if a responsible parent loses Belgian citizenship. Exceptions include cases where: * the child is stateless * the other parent remains a Belgian citizen Children aged under 18 also lose Belgian citizenship if adopted by a non-Belgian, and the child acquires another nationality upon adoption. An exception applies if one of the adoptive parents is a Belgian citizen. A child who has acquired Belgian citizenship on the grounds of being stateless, who acquires another nationality before age 18, loses Belgian citizenship. Deprivation of Belgian citizenship Belgian nationality can be withdrawn (d√©claration de d√©ch√©ance/vervallensverklaring) if a person has acquired Belgian citizenship through one of the provisions for those with non-Belgian parents AND the person is \\"in serious breach\\" of his or her obligations as a Belgian citizen. Resumption of Belgian citizenship A former Belgian citizen (other than a person deprived of citizenship) may resume Belgian citizenship by declaration after a 12-month period of residence and have an unlimited stay in Belgium, which means a B, C, D, E, E+, F or F+ card is required.Regaining Belgian Nationality https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/services_abroad/nationality/losing_retaining_and_regaining/regain Residence abroad can be equated with residence in Belgium if the person can prove genuine ties with Belgium. The conditions under which the person lost his Belgian nationality and the reasons for wishing to regain it will be taken into account. Children aged under 18 automatically acquire Belgian citizenship if a responsible parent resumes Belgian citizenship. Dual citizenship Since 28 April 2008, Belgian law permits all Belgian nationals to voluntarily obtain any other nationality without losing their Belgian nationality (unless the law about the other newly acquired citizenship or nationality requires the loss).; ^ ; . Citizenship of the European Union Because Belgium forms part of the European Union, Belgian citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Belgian embassy, Belgian citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor- Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Belgian citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Travel freedom of Belgian citizens Visa requirements for Belgian citizens. Visa requirements for Belgian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Belgium. In 2015, Belgian citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 170 countries and territories, ranking the Belgian passport 4th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index. The Belgian nationality is ranked fourteenth in Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

Construction Grand Forks, originally classified as patrol gunboat, PG-119, was reclassified as a patrol frigate, PF-11, on 15 April 1943. She was laid down on 29 September 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1429, at the Permanente Metals Richmond Shipyard #4, Richmond, California. Grand Forks was launched on 27 November 1943, sponsored by Mrs. T. H. Thoreson; and commissioned on 18 March 1944, with Lieutenant Commander Christian W. Peterson, USCG, in command. Service history After shakedown, on 7 August 1944, Grand Forks sailed from San Francisco, California, to take station in the Northern Pacific off the California coast as a plane guard ship, returning to San Francisco, on 3 September. She continued on this duty until decommissioning, spending an average of 3 weeks at sea and 2 in port. Late in the night 11 October 1944, Grand Forks picked up a distress call from a Consolidated PB2Y Coronado about to make an emergency landing. Sending up flares and star shells to guide the plane through the dark, Grand Forks rescued 15 crewmen and passengers from the sea, as well as 114 sacks of mail. While in port from guard duty on 31 May 1945, Grand Forks was toured by several members of the American delegation to the San Francisco Peace Conference, including Secretary of State and Mrs. Edward Stettinius, Nelson Rockefeller, and Alger Hiss. She continued on plane guard duty until 19 March 1946, and then sailed from San Francisco to Charleston, South Carolina, where she decommissioned on 16 May 1946. Grand Forks was stricken from the Navy Register on 19 June 1946; sold to J. C. Berkwit & Company of New York on 19 May 1947, and scrapped starting on 1 November 1947.
