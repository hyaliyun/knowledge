N. John Barraclough Fell, Railway Contractor (1996, Reeds Limited) (no ISBN) Fell spent the early part of his life in London, living with his parents. About 1835 he moved with them to the Lake District. In 1840, he married a 25-year-old woman named Martha in Kirkstall, West Yorkshire.\\"Bilbroughs of Gildersome and Morley, Third Generation\\", ancestry.com In the 1840s he worked on the first of several railways he would help construct: the Furness and Whitehaven Railway. He continued working professionally on railways while living in Italy in the 1850s. Fell helped construct several early Italian lines, including the Central of Italy, the Maremma, and the Genoa and Voltri. He frequently crossed Mont Cenis, between Italy and France, by road, and this reportedly inspired him to create his Fell Centre-Rail System. The Fell Centre-Rail System tackled the problem of trains climbing and descending steep gradients, which was often necessary until improvements in tunnelling were developed. In Fell's system, a third rail was run between the two rails of the train tracks, and was gripped on its sides by additional drive wheels on a specially designed locomotive as well as the brake pads of a special brake van. Back in England, a patent was issued to Fell for the idea in 1863. He conducted experiments with his system in 1864‚Äì65 on a purpose built railway near Whaley Bridge adjacent to - and, at one point, passing under - the Bunsal Incline of the Cromford and High Peak Railway at gradients of 1 in 13 and 1 in 12, with curves up to 2.5 chains radius W.H. Hoult (1961) Fell's Experimental Railway in Derbyshire, The Railway Magazine, January, p. 48-51 (Maps and photographs included). The tests attracted attention of the governments of Britain and France, and the first railway using the Fell Centre-Rail System was a temporary one built in 1866‚Äì67 over the Mont Cenis Pass, the same Mont Cenis that had served as Fell's inspiration. This railway was used from 1868 to 1871, primarily to transport English mail to India as part of the All Red Route. It was replaced by the then in progress Mont Cenis Tunnel after only three years because improvements in tunnelling shortened construction time of the 13.6 kilometre tunnel. Its worth proven in practice, other railways subsequently used the Fell system, including the Estrada de Ferro Cantagalo (Cantagalo Railway) in Brazil, and the New Zealand Railways Department for the Rimutaka Incline and for braking only on the Rewanui and Roa Inclines. Several other railways used the system for many years, sometimes only for braking. Fell also experimented with other kinds of railways, including early light rail systems, such as the Yarlside Iron Mines tramway; and rapid-construction field railways for the British War Office, such as the Aldershot Narrow Gauge Suspension Railway. His son, G. Noble Fell, helped him with some of his research. Fell related in his later years his three greatest achievements: # launching the first steamer on the English Lakes # starting the first railway in Italy # carrying the first railway over the Alps He pioneered the Malta Railway, now defunct, the only railway system ever built in Malta. The zoologist Dr Barry Fell was a grandson.  Legacy  The Snaefell Mountain Railway on the Isle of Man still uses the Fell system for braking. A steam engine which entered service in 1877 is preserved in the Fell Locomotive Museum at Featherston, New Zealand. References Further reading * The Mont Cenis Fell Railway, P. J. G.

His major storylines were a relationship with Gail Tilsley (Helen Worth) following the death of her estranged husband Brian (Christopher Quinten) and the birth of their child David (Jack P. Shepherd); a feud with Gail's former mother-in-law Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie); the adoption of Brian's children Sarah (Tina O'Brien) and Nick (Ben Price); affairs with Cathy Power (Theresa Brindley) and Rebecca Hopkins (Jill Halfpenny); his relationship with 16-year-old Katy Harris (Lucy-Jo Hudson); and his involvement in the rescue of Gail and her family from Richard Hillman (Brian Capron). He left on 9 November 2005. In January 2018, it was confirmed that he would be returning for a short period. He returned on 22 March 2018 and left on 26 March 2018 to go to New Zealand with Robyn and Charlotte. Storylines Teenager Martin Platt is first seen in 1985 as a school-leaver working in Jim's Cafe. He had two GCEs and was studying at Salford Technical College. In February 1989, Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten) is murdered and Martin begins comforting his widow and former employer at the caf√©, Gail (Helen Worth). They gradually fall for each other and in 1990, Gail finds she is pregnant. Feeling Martin is too young to settle down, she is about to have an abortion when Martin stops her. Their son, David, is born on Christmas Day 1990. Martin helps raise Gail's two older children, Sarah-Louise (Lynsay King) and Nicky (Warren Jackson) from her marriage to Brian. He develops a father-daughter relationship with Sarah but Nicky does not like him and is often keen to remind him that he is not his real father, and for this reason he cannot tell him what to do. Brian's mother, Ivy (Lynne Perrie), is also hostile towards Martin, especially when he decides that he wants to adopt Nicky and Sarah. Supported by Ivy's husband Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff), the adoption later goes through, despite opposition from Ivy, who even told Social Services that Gail was an unfit mother, but Martin allowed her to visit Nicky and Sarah. When Ivy died in 1995, she presented more trouble for Martin and Gail due to the terms of her will, changes made during the adoption dispute, left her estate and house to Nicky, on the condition by changing his name back to Tilsley with Sarah and Don left nothing. Upon discovering this, Martin is angry because he legally adopted him and wanted to keep him under the Platt surname, however Gail tells him to accept it because she knew that Ivy wanted Nicky to have Brian's surname knowing that she is to blame for Brian's death. In the mid-1990s, Martin becomes friendly with fellow nurse, Carmel Finnan (Catherine Cusack). Carmel makes Gail believe she is having an affair with Martin and is pregnant by him, but the problem is solved by Carmel's father, John (Shay Gorman) from Ireland coming to take her home. Martin later sleeps with nurse Cathy Power (Theresa Brindley) on Christmas Day, while working as a student nurse. Martin confesses, and Gail finds it difficult to forgive him, but they are reconciled after Martin passes his nursing exam. Martin's 13-year-old adoptive daughter Sarah (now Tina O'Brien) finds out she is pregnant and she cannot have an abortion. Despite him and Gail planning to go to Canada and adopt the baby, Sarah gives birth to Bethany Platt (Amy and Emily Walton). In 1999, Martin becomes friendly with Rebecca Hopkins (Jill Halfpenny), and Gail accuses him of having an affair, but is reassured. Martin and Rebecca subsequently do have an affair, which Martin confesses to Gail only after Rebecca has left him. After an unsuccessful attempt to patch up the marriage, Martin goes to live in a nearby flat and Gail divorces him. Martin remains close to Gail, even after the divorce, and often comes round to have tea with Gail, Sarah, Bethany and David (now played by Jack P. Shepherd). After his divorce Martin unexpectedly begins a romance with Gail's best friend, Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor). The romance causes controversy due to Gail and Sally's friendship and Martin's friendship with Sally's ex-husband Kevin (Michael Le Vell), but Gail's happiness with new boyfriend Richard Hillman (Brian Capron) leads her to give the new couple her blessing. However, the relationship eventually fizzles out and Sally reunites with Kevin. When Richard - revealed to have committed a string of murders - tries to kill Gail and the children by driving his car into the canal, Martin and Tommy Harris (Thomas Craig) jump into the canal and swim down to the sunken car and rescue them - although Richard dies. Martin later falls in love with Tommy's sixteen-year-old daughter Katy (Lucy-Jo Hudson). Tommy, who had previously been Martin's friend, is outraged when he finds out about their relationship, and attacks Martin physically, whilst Katy's brother, Craig Harris (Richard Fleeshman), attempts to kill Martin by tampering with the brakes on his car. Katy's parents are even more unhappy when she leaves school to move in with Martin. When Sarah discovers her boyfriend Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) is gay and had been having an affair with Martin's nurse colleague Karl Foster (Chris Finch), she gives birth prematurely to her son Billy Platt who then dies and she and David are angry with Martin when he continues to date Katy, who knew about Todd's sexuality. An angry Martin then attacks Karl at the hospital and is suspended from his job but later reinstated. Katy then falls pregnant with Martin's child. When Sally begins having an affair with colleague Ian Davenport (Philip Bretherton), her previous relationship with Martin, who is working late hours, leads Tommy and his wife Angela Harris (Kathryn Hunt) to believe they are having an affair. They tell Katy, who moves out of Martin's flat and has an abortion. When Gail tells them the truth, Katy is devastated. She confronts Tommy in a rage, and attacks him with a wrench, killing him. Because of the bad blood between Martin and Tommy, Martin is at first arrested for the murder. Even though Angela only witnesses the murder of Tommy, she confesses to doing it to protect Katy. Martin is released. Katy is hysterical, and as a diabetic, decides to commit suicide by forgoing her insulin injections and eating sugar. Martin, Sarah and Sarah's boyfriend Scooter (Sushil Chudasama) manage to get her to hospital, but she later dies. Martin decides to move to Liverpool with his new girlfriend Robyn (Clare Calbraith). David is devastated when he hears that Martin is leaving and does not talk to Martin for a while; however, the two of them reconcile just before Martin leaves. Martin and Robyn drive off to Liverpool for their new life together. Robyn falls pregnant and gives birth to her and Martin's daughter. In January 2006, David returned after visiting Martin and revealed that Martin and his girlfriend were expecting a baby. Martin was supposed to return for Sarah's wedding to Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) in 2007 to give her away, however couldn't make it as his daughter was ill. David went to visit Martin in 2009 as he had enough of his mother Gail and her boyfriend Joe McIntyre and returned a couple of weeks later. He was not in attendance at David's wedding to Kylie Turner (Paula Lane) in April 2011. By May 2015, Martin still had contact with his family. In July 2015, David went to stay with Martin in order to take a break from problems at home, involving stepson Max Turner's (Harry McDermott) behavioural problems and also conflicts with Max's biological father, Callum Logan (Sean Ward). When he returned, he told Gail that Martin had bought a new house with a big garden and a posh kitchen and had received a promotion at work. Although Martin sent his love on to Gail, David pointedly told her that his father had done really well in life since he had split from her. After Kylie is murdered and her killer, Clayton Hibbs (Callum Harrison), is imprisoned for her murder, David, Max and daughter Lily Platt (Brooke Malonie) went to see Martin in November 2016. After being raped by Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton), David decides to visit Martin with Max and Lily. It is revealed that Martin and Robyn are expecting their second child together, and are planning to emigrate to New Zealand. Martin realised that David was upset, though came to the conclusion that David was furious with him for leaving for New Zealand, which David says is the truth, too ashamed to open up to his father over being raped. Martin then assured David that he was free to visit him anytime, and this made David think about emigrating over there permanently. As David returned home, he informed his maternal family about his plans to move to New Zealand, much to their surprise, devastation and disappointment. Martin then arrives back in Weatherfield for the first time in over twelve years, and met David's new girlfriend Shona Ramsey (Julia Goulding). When Josh overheard Martin and Shona discussing David's decision to leave his life-long home, he expressed his concern for David's welfare. After finding out, David told Martin that Josh was no friend of his. Despite Max and Lily telling him that they wanted to remain in Weatherfield, David's mind was made up to emigrate. Martin reassured David that he could come and visit him anytime he wished, but his David told Martin that he could not live in the same street where Kylie was murdered, and thus refused to say goodbye to his father. However, as Martin prepared to leave for his new life in New Zealand, David came to see his father off, and told him that he intended to stay in Weatherfield and not make the hasty decision to emigrate after all. Development Actor Sean Wilson was axed from Coronation Street when a major storyline conference decided the character of Martin had been \\"played out\\". Wilson later reflected that the producers had \\"done him a favour by axing his character\\", and Wilson has since said that if he were to return to the soap, the producers would have to be \\"very persuasive\\". He claimed he was dropped from the show, due to his refusal to portray a storyline in which Martin would be jailed for having a relationship with an underage girl. In January 2018, it was announced that Wilson would be reprising the role of Martin for a short period as part of David's male rape storyline. Reception The character has been described as the \\"only properly functional husband\\" of Gail, who had been married a total of five times by 2016.

The unit's mission is to carry out amphibious special operations in order to protect the nation's maritime interests. The group has 460 members divided in two groups of 230 members for each Naval Force (Pacific and Gulf). The special forces course lasts 53 weeks. These forces are capable of carrying out non-conventional warfare in the air, sea and land, by utilizing all means of infiltration available to develop the most variable operational incursions with the use of military diving techniques, parachuting, vertical descent, urban combat, sniping and use of explosives. They are units organized, trained and equipped to operate independently in maritime, lake, riverine or terrestrial scenarios. The existence of an alleged Tier 1 type unit composed of the best operators in the force has been cited in social media and news media outlets.  Operations  Operations undertaken by the Special Forces of the Mexican Navy are classified, as well as casualties and collateral damage. It has played a major active role in the Mexican Drug War, undertaking direct action missions, intelligence gathering, reconnaissance operations, personnel, weapons and facility seizures, law enforcement arrests and kill or capture missions.

Oxford High School was opened on 3 November 1875, with twenty-nine girls and three teachers under headmistress Ada Benson, at the Judge's Lodgings (St Giles' House) at 16 St Giles', central Oxford.St Giles' House (Judge's Lodgings), 16 St Giles' Street, Oxford (where OHS was founded). It was the 9th school opened by the Girls' Public Day School Company. Pupils were given a holiday when the Assize Judge visited. The school moved to 38 St Giles' in 1879 and then to 21 Banbury Road at the start of 1881, in a building designed by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson, just south of the location of another Jackson building, the Acland Nursing Home.Sherwood, Jennifer, and Pevsner, Nikolaus, The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire, Penguin Books, 1974. . Page 317. By this time the headmistress was Matilda Ellen Bishop. Rapid expansion led to the ultimate removal of the school to Belbroughton Road in 1957. It became a direct grant grammar school in 1945 under the Education Act 1944 and chose to become independent in 1976 after the scheme was abolished. The junior section was opened in 1989 and further expanded in the 1990s to meet the growing demand. It absorbed two preparatory schools, Greycotes and The Squirrel, which meant girls could now be educated at Oxford High School from age 3 to Sixth Form. Academics Oxford High School regularly ranks as one of the country's highest achieving independent schools in terms of examination results. The school was ranked first in the South East in a Sunday Times survey based on exam results and \\"value for money\\". In the 2011 examinations it was ranked amongst the top 20 independent schools nationwide for GCSE results and the best performing girls' school in the A Levels. In 2006, the school became the first in Oxfordshire to make Mandarin a compulsory subject.

Its dominant southern crests, WSW and ESE, mark the border with Slovakia. It is accessible in most conditions by foot and daily by cablecar.  Geography  The mountain is at the crossroads of four crests, two of which coincide with footpaths, incorporating steps, bounding Poland and Slovakia and in times without snow the steep paths heading into both countries south and north are quite easily traversable. The slight apex of the four steep crests (peak itself) is just north of the border, which is deemed to be a straight line relative to the two dominant ridges. Crossing the border between Poland and Slovakia is not restricted, since both countries are members of the Schengen area.Crossing the border on Kasprowy Wierch was strictly prohibited between 1918 (breakup of Austria-Hungary) and 2007 (Poland and Slovakia entering the Schengen Area). Users of the cable car change cars midway in their ascent/descent, at mount My≈õlenicke Turnie. At the top station is a large restaurant/cafe/information office building with further ski lifts outside. The mountain is very popular among hikers from Poland, because of its easy accessibility, both on foot and by the cable car. However, it's much less visited from the Slovak side, because the ascent from the nearest settlement in Slovakia involves a lengthy (11 km) approach up a remote valley Tich√° dolina. =Climate= Without the existence of a summer, the climate is of tundra (K√∂ppen: ET), as found in the highest areas of the Alps. Cable cars and chairlifts The cable cars are extremely popular and tourists regularly have to wait up to 3 hours to buy tickets - roughly the same time it would take to ascend the mountain on foot. The cable car service has caused environmental concerns and protests in 1935 and 2006. In 1961-1962 and in 1967-1968 chairlifts were built on the slopes and they run in two sections.  History  From 1910 onwards Kasprowy Wierch became very popular among ski tourists so much so an aerial tramway or t√©l√©ph√©rique, reaching almost to the summit, was built between 1935-1936 as such it is one of the oldest in Europe. As part of its modernization, the cabin aerial ropeway was closed for a period until December 2007. In 1938 meteorological and astronomical observatories were built here.

In 1991, he became, together with Sofia Pilyavskaya, the last person to be named a People's Artist of the USSR. Biography =Early life= Oleg Ivanovich Yankovsky was born on 23 February 1944 in Jezkazgan, Kazakh SSR (now Kazakhstan). His family was of noble Russian, Belarusian and Polish ancestry. His father, Ivan Pavlovich, was Life-Guards Semenovsky regiment's Stabskapit√§n. Yankovsky's father was arrested during the purges in the Red Army after the Tukhachevsky case and was deported with his family to Kazakhstan, where he died in the camps of the Gulag system. After the death of Stalin, the Yankovsky family was able to leave Central Asia for Saratov. Oleg's eldest brother, Rostislav, after graduating from the Saratov Theater School, went to Minsk to play at the Russian Theater. He took 14-year-old Oleg with him due to financial concerns, as in the family there was only one breadwinner ‚Äì middle brother Nikolay. In Minsk, youngest Yankovsky made his debut on the stage ‚Äì it was necessary to substitute the sick performer of the episodic role of the boy in the play The Drummer. =Career= After leaving school, Yankovsky returned to Saratov, where in 1965 he graduated from the Saratov Theater School. After graduation, he was accepted into the troupe of the Saratov Drama Theater, where for eight years of work he played a number of leading roles. After success in the role of Prince Myshkin in the play The Idiot in 1973, he was invited to the Lenkom Theatre. Yankovsky's film career was launched when he was cast in two movies The Shield and the Sword (1968) by director Vladimir Basov about World War II and Two Comrades Were Serving (1968) by Yevgeni Karelov about Russian Civil War. During his prolific screen career, Yankovsky appeared in many film adaptations of Russian classics, notably A Hunting Accident (1977) and The Kreutzer Sonata (1987). A leading actor of Mark Zakharov's Lenkom Theatre since 1975, he starred in the TV versions of the theatre's productions, An Ordinary Miracle (1978) and The Very Same Munchhausen (1979) being the most notable. For his role in Roman Balayan's Flights in Dreams and Reality (1984), Yankovsky was awarded the USSR State Prize. He has been better known abroad for his parts in Tarkovsky's movies Mirror (as the father) and Nostalghia (in the main role). In the early 1990s, Yankovsky also played quite different roles in Georgiy Daneliya‚Äôs tragic comedy Passport (1990) and in Karen Shakhnazarov‚Äôs historical and psychological drama The Assassin of the Tsar (1991). In 1991, he was the President of the Jury at the 17th Moscow International Film Festival. Starting in 1993, Yankovsky ran the Kinotavr Film Festival in Sochi. He continued to receive awards for his work with several Nika Awards from the Russian Film Academy for his directorial debut Come Look at Me (2001) and Valery Todorovsky's Lyubovnik (2002). He appeared as Count Pahlen in Poor Poor Paul (2004) and as Komarovsky in a TV adaptation of Doctor Zhivago (2006), directed by Oleg Menshikov. The last film Yankovsky appeared in was Tsar, which was released in 2009 and demonstrated at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2009, just three days before his death. Yankovsky played the sophisticated role of Metropolitan Philip in his last film. =Death= On 20 May 2009, Yankovsky died from pancreatic cancer in Moscow, aged 65. A civil funeral took place at Lenkom theater. His burial was held on 22 May 2009 at Novodevichy Cemetery in the presence of his close relatives only.

(), commonly known as ZIM, is an Israeli international cargo shipping company in Israel, and one of the top-20 global carriers. The company's headquarters are in Haifa; it also has a North American headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia. Originating in 1945, ZIM traded from 1948 to 2004 as ZIM Israel Navigation Company. History ZIM was founded in 1945, as the ZIM Palestine Navigation Company Ltd, by the Jewish Agency, the Israel Maritime League and the Histadrut (General Federation of Laborers in the Land of Israel). The first ship was purchased in partnership with Harris and Dixon (based in London) in 1947. This vessel was refurbished, renamed SS Kedma, and sailed to the future state of Israel in the summer of 1947. After the state of Israel was established in 1948, the company was renamed ZIM Israel Navigation Company Ltd. During her first years, her main task was transporting hundreds of thousands of immigrants to the emerging state. Some of the other ships that had been used for clandestine immigration before the establishment of Israel as a state were confiscated by the British mandate authorities and later joined the company's fleet. The company continued to purchase more ships, among them SS Negba, SS Artza and SS Galila. During the 1948 war, the company was the sole maritime connection with the state of Israel, supplying food, freight and military equipment. In 1953, some of the money from the reparations agreement between Israel and West Germany was allocated to the purchase of new ships. The , renamed Jerusalem, sailed the Israel-New York route, Another ship purchased with reparations money was the SS Etzel.Children at Heart, Jerusalem Post Magazine The , acquired in 1956, was renamed SS Zion. In 1950s and 1960s, ZIM concentrated on passenger ships, alongside a constant expansion of the cargo shipping business. Passenger liners were a common means of international transport before the emergence of cheap air transport, and pleasure cruises were also popular. ZIM sailed the Mediterranean Sea, as well as having regular routes to the United States. Some of its ships cruised to the Caribbean during the winter. 1964 saw the completion of the ocean liner , which turned out to be a failure, marking the end of the ZIM passenger shipping era. ZIM was invited in 1957 by the Government of Ghana to assist the setting up and management of a national shipping line. Black Star Line was formed with a 40% participation by Zim and principally operated cargo services from West Africa. A similar joint venture - Burma Five Star Line - was made with the Burmese Government in 1959. During the 1960s, ZIM started to turn its focus to cargo ships, and obtained several special-purpose vessels, including refrigerated ships and oil tankers. ZIM transported crude oil from Iran to Israel and oil byproducts from Israel to Europe. In the 1970s, ZIM expanded into the container shipping business. ZIM ordered six such ships, and gradually made this its main line of business. In 1981, one of the company's ships, Mezada, was lost at sea. Despite a lull in maritime shipping at the beginning of the 1980s, the company built 15 more ships in Germany in the 1990s. At this time, the ownership of ZIM was divided between the Israeli government and Israel Corporation. In 2014, unloading of a Zim ship at the Port of Oakland was delayed by anti-Israel protesters. Longshoremen declined to load the ship out of safety concerns, taking no position on the underlying dispute, but unloaded the ship after their safety was assured. Other protests in Los Angeles and Tacoma, Washington failed to stop the unloading of cargo from Zim ships. A second demonstration bypassed Oakland for Los Angeles when longshoremen, not participating in the protest, refused to unload the ship after being physically threatened and their vehicles blocked when they tried to report for work. Protesters' claim they impacted Zim's shipping schedule was denied by the company, and the local Jewish Community Council denounced the \\"hateful\\" rhetoric of the demonstrators. In mid to late 2015, plans to revive an initial public offering were implemented. The listing will likely take place on the New York Stock Exchange in 2016. Both Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays will lead the IPO. Privatization In 2004, the Israel Corporation (which is controlled by the Ofer Brothers Group) purchased 49% of Zim's shares held by the Israeli government, becoming the sole owner of the company. The new official name after privatization became Zim Integrated Shipping Services. The purchase deal for about five hundred million New Israeli Shekels was severely criticized by the pressSecrets of shakshuka, Haaretz and the State Comptroller of Israel as being undervalued and becoming just another flag of convenience company. In 2007, Zim sold its maritime logistics and forwarding services subsidiary NewLog to UTi Worldwide. Planned stock offering ZIM Barcelona off California, 2008 In 2008, ZIM planned to launch an initial public offering and selling 25% of its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, but due to the onset of the global economic crisis it was called off. In 2009, ZIM required a cash injection of $450 million by the Ofer family and debt restructuring following the world's container shipping downturn.

She became managing director of the revived Euston Films in summer 2014. Early life Kate graduated from the University of Birmingham with a degree in Drama before becoming an Arts Council Trainee director with Century Theatre and then Literary Manager of the Royal Court Theatre. Television career Harwood spent over 15 years working at the BBC, and became an executive producer in the BBC Drama Serials department. As a producer, she has worked on dramas including The Beggar Bride, Close Relations, The Echo, David Copperfield, Man and Boy and BAFTA winner Charles II: The Power and The Passion (released in the US under the title The Last King: the Power and the Passion of Charles II, in a heavily edited version on the A&E; cable network). In her role as executive producer in BBC drama serials, she was responsible for programmes including Crime and Punishment, Daniel Deronda, The Lost World, and Final Demand. Harwood was appointed the executive producer of EastEnders in February 2005, a position she retained until October 2006, when she was succeeded by Diederick Santer. As well as being responsible for the introduction of several new families, such as the Brannings and the Foxes, she introduced such characters as Sean Slater and May Wright, as well as the departures of many popular characters such as Sharon Watts and Dennis Rickman, Chrissie Watts, Kat Moon and Alfie Moon, Sam Mitchell, Nana Moon, Jake Moon, Little Mo Mitchell, Johnny Allen and Pauline Fowler and oversaw numerous high-profile storylines, such as Pauline Fowler‚Äôs murder; Billy and Honey‚Äôs wedding and daughter being born with Down's Syndrome; and the domestic abuse storyline between Denise Fox and Owen Turner as well as the discovery of Den Watts' body under the Queen Vic. She was also responsible for such ratings-winners as Dennis Rickman‚Äôs stabbing and the critically acclaimed return of the Mitchell brothers, which drew respective audiences of 12 and 13 million viewers. Other storylines, however, such as a brief lesbian affair between Sonia and Naomi, \\"Get Johnny Week\\", and the handling of Pauline Fowler's departure were not as well received, and prompted further media criticism; in July 2006, EastEnders fell to just 3.9 million viewers, its lowest-ever viewing figure. Her final episode aired on 4 January 2007. In December 2012, Harwood took the position of BBC Head of Drama, replacing John Yorke. In March 2014, it was announced that Harwood was to leave the BBC to take up a position as managing director of Euston Films, previously a successful producer of British television drama from the 1970s to the early 1990s, then being revived as a company by owners Fremantle Media. Family Her grandfather, Commodore Henry Harwood, was commander of Force G during the pursuit that resulted in the scuttling of the German 'pocket battleship' Admiral Graf Spee after the Battle of the River Plate, off Uruguay, during the Second World War (these events were later the basis of the 1956 film The Battle of the River Plate).

It is or closely matches the concept of the Uniform Resource Locator, or URL, as used on the World-Wide Web: The concept of CRID permits to reference contents unambiguously, regardless of their location, i.e., without knowing specific broadcast information (time, date and channel) or how to obtain them through a network, for instance, by means of a streaming service or by downloading a file from an Internet server. The receiver must be capable of resolving these unambiguous references, i.e., translate them into specific data that will allow it to obtain the location of that content in order to acquire it. This makes it possible for recording processes to take place without knowing that information, and even without knowing beforehand the duration of the content to be recorded: a complete series by a simple click, a program that has not been scheduled yet, a set of programs grouped by a specific criterion‚Ä¶ This framework allows for the separation between the reference to a given content (the CRID) and the necessary information to acquire it, which is called a ‚Äúlocator‚Äù. Each CRID may lead to one or more locators which will represent different copies of the same content. They may be identical copies broadcast in different channels or dates, or cost different prices. They may also be distinct copies with different technical parameters such as format or quality. It may also be the case that the resolution process of a CRID provides another CRID as a result (for example, its reference in a different network, where it has an alternative identifier assigned by a different operator) or a set of CRIDs (for instance, if the original CRID represents a TV series, in which case the resolution process would result in the list of CRIDs representing each episode). From the above it can be concluded that provided that a given content can belong to many groups (each possibly defined by distinctive qualities), it is possible that many CRIDs carry the same content. That is, several CRIDs may be resolved into the same locator. A CRID is not exactly a universal, unique and exclusive identifier for a given content. It is closely related to the authority that creates it, to the resolution service provider, and to the content provider in such a way that the same content may have different CRIDs depending on the field in which they are used (for example, a different one for each television operator that has the rights to broadcast the content).  Format  A CRID is specified much like URLs. In fact, a CRID is a so-called URI. Typically, the content creator, the broadcaster or a third party will use their DNS-names in a combination with a product-specific name to create globally unique CRIDs. That is, the syntax of a CRID is: crid://authority/data The authority field represents the entity that created the CRID and its format is that of a DNS name. The data field represents a string of characters that will unambiguously identify the content within the authority scope (it is a string of characters assigned by the authority itself). As an example, let's assume that BBC wanted to make a CRID for (all the programs of) the Olympics in China. It may have looked something like this crid://bbc.co.uk/olympics/2008/ This would be a group CRID, that is, a CRID representing a group of contents. Then, to refer to a specific event ‚Äì such as the women's shot-put final ‚Äì they could have used the following inside their metadata. crid://bbc.co.uk/olympics/2008/final/shotput/women Currently, four types of CRIDs are playing a major role in some unidirectional television networks: programme CRID, series CRID, group CRID, and recommendation CRID. One of the most important applications of CRIDs is the so-called series link recording function (SL) of modern digital video recorders (DVR, PVR). In turn, a locator is a string of characters that contains all the necessary information for a receiver to find and acquire a given content, whether it is received through a transport stream, located in local storage, downloaded as a file from an Internet server, or through a streaming service. For example, a DVB locator will include all the necessary parameters to identify a specific content within a transport stream: network, transport stream, service, table and/or event identifiers. The locators' format, as established in TV-Anytime, is quite generic and simple, and corresponds to: [transport- mechanism]:[specific-data] The first part of the locator‚Äôs format (the transport mechanism) must be a string of characters that is unique for each mechanism (transport stream, local file, HTTP Internet access‚Ä¶). The second part must be unambiguous only within the scope of a given transport mechanism and will be standardized by the organism in charge of the regulation of the mechanism itself. For instance, a DVB locator to identify a content within the transport stream of networks that follow this standard would be: dvb://112.4a2.5ec;2d22~20121212T220000Z‚ÄîPT01H30M which would indicate a content (identified by the string ‚Äú2d22‚Äù) that airs on a channel available on a DVB network identified by the address ‚Äú112.4a2.5ec‚Äù (network ‚Äú112‚Äù, transport stream ‚Äú4a2‚Äù and service ‚Äú5ec‚Äù), on 12 December 2012 at 10 p.m. and with a duration of 90 minutes.  The location resolution process  The location resolution process is the procedure by which, starting from the CRID of a given content, one or several locators of that content are obtained. Resolving a CRID can be a direct process, which leads immediately to one or many locators, or it may also happen that in the first place one or many intermediate CRIDs are returned, which must undergo the same procedure to finally obtain one or several locators. This procedure involves some information elements, among which we find two structures named resolving authority record (RAR) and ContentReferencingTable, respectively. Consulting them repeatedly will take the receiver from a CRID to one or many locators that will allow it to acquire the content. The RAR table The RAR table is one or many data structures that provide the receiver, for each authority that submits CRIDs, information on the corresponding resolution service provider. Among other things, it informs about which mechanism is used to provide information to resolve the CRIDs from each authority. That is, one or many RAR records must exist for each authority that indicate the receiver where it has to go to resolve the CRIDs of that particular authority. For example, in the record of the figure (expressed by means of a XML structure, according to the XML Schema defined in the TV-Anytime) there is an authority called ‚Äútve.es‚Äù, whose resolution service provider is the entity ‚Äúrtve.es‚Äù, available on the URL \\"http://tva.rtve.es/locres/tve\\", which means there is resolution information in that URL. RAR table in XML format These RAR records will have reached the receiver in an indefinite form, unimportant for the TV-Anytime specification, which will depend on the specific transport mechanism of the network to which the receiver is connected. Each family of standards that regulates distribution networks (DVB, ATSC, ISDB, IPTV...) will have previously defined such procedure, which will be used by devices certified according to those standards. The ContentReferencingTable table The second structure involved in the location resolution process is a proper resolution table which, given a content's CRID, returns one or several locators that enable the receiver to access an instance of that content, or one or many CRIDs that allow it to move forward in the resolution process. The figure shows an example of this second structure, an XML document according to the specifications of the XML Schema defined in TV-Anytime. In it, several sections are included ( elements) that structure the information that describes each resolution case. an example of a ContentReferencingTable The first one declares how a CRID (crid://tv.com/Friends/all), which corresponds to a group content that encompasses several episodes (two) of the ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù series is resolved. The result of the resolution process provides two new CRIDs each of them corresponding to one of the two episodes. The second element resolves the CRID of the first episode of the first season. The result of the resolution process is two DVB locators. The ‚Äúacquire‚Äù attribute with ‚Äúany‚Äù value indicates that any of them are good (the second one is a repetition broadcast a week later). The third element gives information about the second episode. It indicates that it cannot be resolved yet (‚Äústatus‚Äù attribute with the ‚Äúcannot yet resolve‚Äù value), indicating a date on which the request for resolution information must be repeated. The process Once the user has selected a given content (identified by the corresponding CRID) to perform some action upon it, the receiver begins the location resolution process that shall lead to specific location information that allows access to a copy of the content. This procedure depends mainly on the receiver‚Äôs connectivity. It is possible to make a basic distinction between unidirectional networks, where the receiver can only receive information through the broadcast channel, and bidirectional networks, where there is also a return channel through which the receiver can communicate with the outside (typically an Internet access). For receivers connected only to a broadcast channel, it is clear that the resolution information must come directly from that channel, or be available somehow in an existing local storage system. After selecting a CRID, the first thing the receiver needs to do is check the information about where to find the resolution table. For this, it must find a RAR record associated with the authority of the selected CRID. Once a RAR record corresponding to that authority is found, the receiver will know, by referring to the URL field, where to access (or, in this case, where to listen) to obtain the resolution information. The information that will receive through that access point will consist of a message for each of the consulted CRIDs (for example, a element in the ContentReferencingTable).  In web casting  To make the CRID even more globally available the IETF will publish a request for comments specifying the use of the CRID over the web. This will allow consumer devices to hook up to content provider servers, much like current browsers look up webservers, requesting content by CRID. In May 2005, an Informational RFC, No 4078, was published as the start of this work. The long-term goal is that CRIDs should be available for use by cell phones, PDAs, digital TV receivers and other consumer devices for fetching content, either from a broadcast stream or over IP-based networks.

When Trumpets Fade was produced by HBO Pictures and first aired the HBO television network on June 27, 1998. When Trumpets Fade is set in World War II during the Battle of H√ºrtgen Forest in late 1944. Plot Private David Manning is a soldier in the 28th Infantry Division and the only survivor in his platoon as a result of the horrendous fighting in the Battle of H√ºrtgen Forest. Manning attempts to save the severely wounded Private Robert \\"Bobby\\" Miller, but seemingly mercy kills him when he refuses to be carried anymore. Manning is promoted to Sergeant and assigned to lead a squad of new reinforcements as the sole survivor of his platoon. Manning tries to get out of it, saying he is unqualified for the position, but his company commander, Captain Roy Pritchett, thinks otherwise. Manning then tries to back out of responsibility by asking to be filed on a Section 8 (designating him mentally unfit due to combat stress), but his request is denied. Manning is confronted by Sergeant Patrick Talbot, who accuses him of holding back from the front line and not performing his duties to save himself. Manning meets with his new men: Privates Warren Sanderson, Sam Baxter, Doug Despin, and Andrew Lonnie at the Siegfried Line, and later that evening leads them into position on the frontline. The next morning, Manning puts the inexperienced Sanderson on point while on patrol, but Sanderson goes forward too quickly and gets separated from the squad. Sanderson narrowly avoids a German patrol and returns to the squad just after Manning decides to leave without him. After learning of this incident, Manning is scorned by his peers and berated by his platoon leader, First Lieutenant Terrence Lukas. Manning's company makes a push toward the town of Schmidt in order to take and hold a key bridge, but advance into an German minefield and are shelled by Flak 88mm guns, causing the company to retreat. Pritchett approaches Manning with a mission to flank the 88s that he requires volunteers for, offering Manning his Section 8 if he volunteers and succeeds. Manning accepts, but Baxter panics during the mission and starts to flee, and the other men follow suit. To stop them, Manning shoots Baxter, hitting the M1A1 flamethrower he is carrying on his back, which causes it to explode and burn him to death. Although the rest of Manning's men are horrified by this, they stop fleeing and assault the German position where the two 88s are located. Led by Sanderson, who is armed with another flamethrower, the group eventually succeeds in destroying the 88s. Manning's company eventually secures the bridge after suffering heavy casualties, but is soon attacked by German tanks and forced to retreat. Lonnie is killed and Despin is captured by pursuing Germans during the squad's retreat back to the American lines. Manning and Sanderson escape, but Pritchett, who has also survived the ordeal but cracked under pressure, is ordered off the lines before he can uphold his promise to Manning. Lieutenant Colonel George Rickman, the battalion commander, appears and asks Lukas about the status of his platoon, but a traumatized Lukas snaps and assaults him. Manning confronts Rickman, picking up the mass of blood-soaked dog tags Lukas dropped and pressing them against Rickman's chest as his answer to the platoon's status. As a result of Manning's insubordination, Rickman recognises him and orders him to the command post. Rickman subsequently promotes Manning to Second Lieutenant and gives him command of the platoon. Manning is confronted by Talbot and Corporal Toby Chamberlain, the platoon medic and Manning's friend, for shooting Baxter, but defuses the situation by revealing another push is planned for the morning. Manning argues that if they do not destroy the German tanks before the assault, then the entire battalion - including them - will be slaughtered. Chamberlain states they have no proof that Manning will not just shoot them, as he did Baxter. Sanderson, who survived the retreat, defends Manning's conduct by acknowledging the fact that everybody would have fled instead of fighting had Manning not shot Baxter. Manning leads Talbot, Chamberlain, and Sanderson in a pre-dawn raid on the German tanks without the battalion's knowledge or support. Manning clears a minefield and cuts the barbwire, enabling the group to continue on and destroy the tanks with a bazooka, but Talbot and Chamberlain are killed. Manning is wounded and loses consciousness while being carried back to friendly lines by Sanderson, and seemingly dies from his wounds. An epilogue states that after three months of heavy combat, the Allies eventually took the H√ºrtgen Forest and that the battle itself was overshadowed by the Battle of the Bulge soon afterward.

Overview The vocals in the song is sung by Andru Donalds, who also lent his voice in the fourth and fifth Enigma albums. On its release, listeners thought that, like previous standalone single \\"Turn Around\\", the song might not be part of any released album: however, it was later released in September 2006, with a new mix, on A posteriori. The song will also be the walk-in music for the German boxer, Felix Sturm. According to information provided by Crocodile Music Management, the single was originally scheduled to be released first in October 2005 but the date was moved to 25 November 2005, a day before Sturm's fight with Maselino Masoe for the WBA Championship title. But due to an injury that Sturm picked up just weeks before the fight, the single's release date was pushed further back until 10 March 2006, just a day before Sturm's rescheduled match. On 7 November 2005, the video to the song was first released for public viewing by Virgin Germany through the German edition of LAUNCHcast. The video features Sturm in training and previous battles with his opponents in the ring. However two days later, Virgin Germany announced that the single will be postponed to a later date and all information about the single, including the music video, were taken off from their websites. On the release day of the single, the official Enigma website was updated and finally the video was made available streaming through Windows Media Player and RealPlayer.

C2 L) p.217, note to line 18) is an enchanted wild boar in the Matter of Britain that King Arthur or his men pursued with the aid of Arthur's dog Cavall (, ). Pronunciation of Twrch trwyth The names of the hound and boar are glimpsed in a piece of geographical onomasticon composed in Latin in the ninth century, the Historia Brittonum. However, a richly elaborate account of the great hunt appears in the Welsh prose romance Culhwch and Olwen, probably written around 1100. A passing reference to Twrch Trwyth also occurs in the elegy Gwarchan Cynfelyn preserved in the Book of Aneirin. hints that Trwyth is mentioned in an obscure poem in the Book of AneirinThe Lay of Cynfelyn, at the Celtic Literature Collective of the Mary Jones website The name in Welsh can be construed to mean \\"the boar Trwyth\\", and may have its analogue in the boar Triath of Irish mythology (see #Etymology and Irish cognate below). Historia Brittonum The earliest reference to the boar Trwyth occurs in the tract De Mirabilibus Britanniae (or Mirabilia in shorthand), variously titled in English as \\"Wonders of Britain\\". The Mirabilia is believed to be near- contemporaneous to Nennius' ninth century Historia Brittonum, p.56, note 3 \\"De mirabilibus Britanni√¶. Although this apparently forms no part of the original work of Nennius..\\"Geoffrey Ashe, under entry \\"Nennius\\", in: Lacy, Norris J., ed., The Arthurian Encyclopedia, Peter Bedrick Books, 1986 and is found appended to it in many extant manuscripts. It gives a list of marvels around Britain, one of them being the footprint left in rock by Arthur's dog Cavall (here Latinized as Cabal), made while chasing the great boar (here called Troynt): Culhwch and Olwen Twrch is named as the son of Prince Tared (or Taredd Wledig, p.98), cursed into the form of a wild creature; he has poisonous bristles, and carries a pair of scissors, a comb and a razor on his head between his ears. In French romances such as by Chr√©tien de Troyes, Ares is the father of a knight called Tor. Some scholars consider that Tor son of Ares is the Twrch son of Tared of Culhwch and Olwen and that the authentic name is probably Ares.Goulven Peron, Un g√©ant nomm√© Sp√©zet, pages 48 √† 52, Cahier du Poher, n¬∞26, octobre 2009, in french Culhwch is given the task by Ysbaddaden, the giant whose daughter Olwen Culhwch seeks, of obtaining the comb and scissors from Twrch's head. Later in the story it transpires there is also a razor secreted there. These implements are then to be used to cut and treat Ysbaddaden's hair (most of the tasks on the giant's long list are ultimately to do with this ceremony of hair-cutting). Further, Ysbaddaden states that the only hound who can hunt Twrch is Drudwyn, the whelp of Greid, and then goes on to list the requirements of the leash to hold Drudwyn, the only man strong enough to hold the leash. Ultimately Ysbaddaden calls on Culhwch to seek out Arthur, Culhwch's cousin, to help him hunt Twrch. Prior to the hunt, Menw son of Teirgwaedd is sent to verify that the comb and scissors are between Twrch's ears. He takes the form of a bird and flies to Twrch's lair, encountering the boar with seven piglets. Menw then tries to swoop down and snatch one of the implements from Twrch's scalp, but only manages to take one silver bristle; Twrch is agitated and shakes himself, scattering venom onto Menw, wounding him. The hunt for Twrch takes up the greater portion of the latter half of Culhwch and Olwen, and it is described in great detail the geographical route of the pursuit, and those who take active part in it. Although it is Culhwch who is given the task, it is Arthur and his men who take the most prominent role in the chase, Culhwch having successfully enlisted his aid. After causing the death of several of Arthur's troop, the boar surrenders the razor, scissors, and later the comb by force, and he is driven into the sea off Cornwall and drowned. Yet another boar, Ysgithyrwyn or \\"White-Tusk, Chief of Boars\\", had to be captured for its tusk to complete the grooming of Ysbadadden. Etymology and Irish cognate As previously noted, the Welsh word twrch means \\"wild boar, hog, mole\\", so Twrch Trwyth means \\"the boar Trwyth\\". Its Irish cognate may be Triath, King of the Swine () or the Torc Triath mentioned in Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn,Macalister ed., tr., LGE 1st Red. ¬∂ 317, LGE 2nd Red. ¬∂344, 3rd Red. ¬∂369) also recorded as Old Irish Orc tr√©ith \\"Triath's boar\\" in Sanas Cormaic. Rachel Bromwich regards the form Trwyth as a late corruption. In the early text Historia Brittonum, the boar is called Troynt or Troit, a Latinisation likely from the Welsh Trwyd. Further evidence that Trwyd was the correct form appears in a reference in a later poem.

It was developed by Crawfish Interactive and released in November 2001. The game is based on an early script of the 2002 film Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, and is the first video game released, before the film it is based on had even begun production. The sequel Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever was released within a week of the film and follows its plot line more closely than the first game does. Gameplay At the beginning of the game, players choose which character, Ecks or Sever, they wish to control. Both characters' plots intertwine and are given different level designs for each of their missions. The Gameplay is similar to other early FPS titles such as Doom, in that all of the graphics for enemies and weapons are 2D sprites in a 3D setting. Development A gameplay screenshot for Ecks vs. Sever. The game utilized a 3D raycasting engine for the GBA, which was developed by Crawfish. Ecks vs. Sever was developed by Crawfish Interactive, which obtained the license to create the game based on an early rendition of a script for Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, an upcoming action film which had not yet entered production. The close relationship between game publisher Bam! Entertainment and Franchise Pictures allowed for the option to develop games based on any of the film company's received scripts. Video game producer Tim Mawson explained that the decision to release the game prior to the film was based on the confidence by Bam! and Crawfish that Ecks vs. Sever was \\"a good enough game to stand on its own two feet\\". Mawson further stated that the creative team was \\"given free to a degree\\", allowing them mold a gameplay model around the base narrative, characters, and environments already provided. The team constantly referred to the film script during the early developmental phases \\"to ensure the gameplay elements were relevant to the license in terms of atmosphere, theme and content\\". The Ecks vs. Sever video game was in development for about ten months. Because the game began production long before the release of the film, adjustments had to be made based on the changing screenplay. Most notably, the titular lead Sever was switched from male to female, forcing Crawfish to replace the graphical artwork for that character. Ecks vs. Sever utilizes a homebrew graphics engine, first showcased by Crawfish with the opening level of Doom II, leading up to the launch of the GBA. This \\"pseudo-3D\\" engine lacks sloping floors, rooms above rooms, and textured ceilings so the game can run quicker. Mawson admitted that building a proprietary, first-person engine for the GBA was very difficult, requiring much trial and error. Crawfish's 3D raycasting engine for Ecks vs. Sever was originally written in C, but was later optimized into machine code for higher processing speeds. Lighting effects and more sprites existed in early stages of the project's development, but were scrapped to maintain acceptable frame rates. Multiplayer levels were also adjusted to prevent engine slowdown. Bam! European developmental director Joe Booth felt that although the game's engine was meant to \\"push the GBA envelope\\" of environment interaction and background animation, its multiple game modes set it apart from other FPSs on the handheld. Reception and legacy Ecks vs. Sever received positive reviews, garnering an aggregate score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic. IGN gave the game an \\"outstanding\\" 9.0/10 and an Editor's Choice award, calling it \\"the best GBA first person shooter to date\\" and \\"one of the best four player games made yet for the Game Boy Advance.\\" A PlayStation 2 version of Ecks vs. Sever was in development by Zombie Studios slated for release on November 2002. However, it was eventually cancelled.

History The hospital was founded by William Bromfeild at Grosvenor Place in London as a hospital for the treatment of venereal disease and opened on 31 January 1747. The religious commentator, Thomas Scott, who published a Commentary on the Whole Bible and who became the founding Secretary of the Church Missionary Society, founded the Lock Asylum for the Reception of Penitent Female Patients in 1787 as a refuge for women who had been treated at the hospital. The Lock Asylum opened in Osnaburg Row in 1792 and moved, first to Knightsbridge in 1812, then to Lower Eaton Street in 1816 and finally co- located with the Lock Hospital in 1849. Meanwhile the Lock Hospital had moved to 283 Harrow Road in Westbourne Grove in 1842. It was renamed the Female Hospital when a new site in Dean Street, Soho, opened for male outpatients in 1862. It was expanded as a result of the Contagious Diseases Act 1864 in 1867. The Lock Asylum, which had continued to occupy a wing in the Female Hospital, became known as the 'Rescue Home' in 1893. The whole facility (the Female Hospital and the Lock Asylum) became known as the London Lock Hospital and Rescue Home at that time. A maternity unit opened in 1917, followed by an ophthalmology unit and a genitourinary unit that treated venereal and non- venereal gynaecological disorders. A new maternity centre opened at 283A Harrow Road in 1938. During the Second World War the facility was used as a Military Isolation Hospital. It joined the National Health Service in 1948 when it became an outpatients department for Paddington Hospital. After it closed in 1952, the hospital was demolished and the site is now occupied by flats. History of the name The Oxford English Dictionary states that the single word term 'lock' was used to describe a leper hospital in Southwark, where lepers were isolated and treated. The sources for this usage go back to 1359. A 1375 source states that the foreman, William Cook, was sworn to prevent lepers from entering the City of London. The same source asserts that eventually the term 'lock' came to be used attributively, as in 'lock hospital'. The memory of the London Lock Hospital continues with the London Lock Hospital Memorial Prize in Sexually Transmitted Diseases at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, which was established by bequest in 1965 by an old student and staff member of the school. With subsequent mergers of London medical schools, it is now part of the awards in communicable diseases for final-year medical students at the UCL Medical School. Traditional folk song The Lock Hospital is just one of the many alternative titles for a popular traditional British folk song, The Unfortunate Lad, a warning against venereal disease, dating from the late 18th century. The hospital is mentioned by name in the first verse: :As I was walking down by the Lock Hospital, :As I was walking one morning of late, :Who did I spy but my own dear comrade, :Wrapped in flannel, so hard is his fate. Subsequent lines mention the \\"salts and pills of white mercury\\" that might have saved the unfortunate youth's life if only his lover had warned him in time. There are many variants of the song (such as St. James Infirmary Blues, Streets of Laredo, The Trooper Cut Down in His Prime, etc.) in which the personae are variously a gambler, cowboy, soldier, sailor, or even a young girl, \\"cut down in their prime\\".

According with Angelos Chaniotis and Rudolph F. Peters, Divine laws are typically perceived as superior to man-made laws, sometimes due to an assumption that their source has resources beyond human knowledge and human reason. Believers in divine laws might accord them greater authority than other laws, for example by assuming that divine law cannot be changed by human authorities. According with Chaniotis, Divine laws are noted for their apparent inflexibility. The introduction of interpretation into divine law is a controversial issue, since believers place high significance on adhering to the law precisely. Opponents to the application of divine law typically deny that it is purely divine and point out human influences in the law. These opponents characterize such laws as belonging to a particular cultural tradition. Adherents of divine law, on the other hand, are sometimes reluctant to adapt inflexible divine laws to cultural contexts. Medieval Christianity assumed the existence of three kinds of laws: divine law, natural law, and man-made law. Theologians have substantially debated the scope of natural law, with the Enlightenment encouraging greater use of reason and expanding the scope of natural law and marginalizing divine law in a process of secularization. Since the authority of divine law is rooted in its source, the origins and transmission-history of divine law are important. Conflicts frequently arise between secular understandings of justice or morality and divine law. Religious law, such as canon law, includes both divine law and additional interpretations, logical extensions, and traditions. Treatise on Law In Thomas Aquinas's Treatise on Law, divine law comes only from revelation or scripture, hence biblical law, and is necessary for human salvation. According to Aquinas, divine law must not be confused with natural law. Divine law is mainly and mostly natural law, but it can also be positive law.

It tells the story of a prolonged feud between two stage magicians in late 1800s England. It is epistolary in structure; that is, it purports to be a collection of real diaries that were kept by the protagonists and later collated. The title derives from the novel's fictional practice of stage illusions having three parts: the setup, the performance, and the prestige (effect). ‚Äì Christopher Priest states he created the terms in 1995. The novel received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for best fiction and the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. Plot The events of the past are related through the diaries of 19th century magicians Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden. The diaries are read by their great-grandchildren, Kate Angier and Andrew Westley (born Nicholas Borden) who meet in the present day, with the two diary accounts being interspersed with events of Kate's and Andrew's framing story throughout the novel. The central plot focuses on a feud between the magicians, begun in the fledgling years of their careers when Borden disrupts a fake seance being conducted by Angier and his wife after having conducted a previous one for one of Borden's relatives (Borden was upset that they were presenting it as real when he realized it was in truth an illusion). During a scuffle, Angier's pregnant wife Julia is thrown to the ground, resulting in a miscarriage. The two men are mutually antagonistic for many years afterwards as they rise to become world-renowned stage magicians, with the feud affecting the later generations of their families to come. Borden develops a teleportation act called \\"The Transported Man\\", and an improved version named \\"The New Transported Man\\", which appears to move him from one closed cabinet to another in the blink of an eye without appearing to pass through the intervening space. The act seems to defy physics and puts all previous magic acts to shame. The reader learns that Alfred Borden is actually not one man but two: identical twins named Albert and Frederick who share the identity of \\"Alfred Borden\\" secretly to ensure their professional success with \\"The New Transported Man\\". Angier suspects that Borden uses a double, but dismisses the idea because he thinks it is too easy. Angier desperately tries to equal Borden's success. With the help of the acclaimed inventor Nikola Tesla, Angier develops an act called \\"In a Flash\\", which produces a similar result through a starkly different method. Tesla's device teleports a human being from one place to another by creating an exact physical duplicate at the required destination, into which the person's consciousness is instantly transmitted thus leaving the original subject behind. Because of this method, Angier is forced to devise a way to conceal the original (in order to preserve the illusion) whenever the trick is performed. He clinically refers to these near- lifeless shells in his diary as \\"the prestiges\\". Angier's new act is as successful as Borden's. The infuriated and obsessed Borden attempts to discover how \\"In a Flash\\" is performed. During one performance he breaks into the backstage area and turns off the power to Angier's device, mistakenly believing the generator powering it is about to catch fire and turn the theatre ablaze. The subsequent teleportation is incomplete, and both the duplicated Angier and the \\"prestige\\" Angier survive as separate persons after this incident, but the original feels increasingly weak while the duplicate seems to lack physical substance. The original Angier fakes his own death as part of a previous plan to put behind his public persona of a magician, and returns as the heir to his family estate of Caldlow House without any publicity. While there, he becomes terminally ill. Angier had discovered Borden's secret prior to the accident that created his duplicate. Now alienated from the world by his ghostly form and consumed with thoughts of revenge, the Angier duplicate attacks one of the twins before a performance. However, Borden's apparent poor health and the duplicate Angier's resurgent sense of morality prevent the assault from becoming murder. It is implied that this particular Borden twin dies a few days later, and the incorporeal Angier travels to meet the corporeal Angier, now living as the 14th Earl of Colderdale. They come into possession of Borden's diary courtesy of a disgruntled third party in need of money, but publish it without revealing the twins' secret. Shortly afterwards, the corporeal Angier dies and his ghostly duplicate uses Tesla's device one last time to teleport himself into the body; hoping that either he will reanimate it and become whole again, or kill himself instantly and so reunite with his other self in death. In the final section of the novel it is revealed to Kate Angier and Andrew Westley that in Caldlow House, some form of Rupert Angier has continued to survive to the present day.  Critical reception  David Langford wrote in a 1996 review, \\"It seems entirely logical that Christopher Priest's latest novel should centre on stage magic and magicians. The particular brand of misdirection that lies at the heart of theatrical conjuring is also a favourite Priest literary ploy ‚Äì the art of not so much fooling the audience as encouraging them to fool themselves... The final section is strange indeed, more Gothic than science fiction in flavour, heavy with metaphorical power. There are revelations, and more is implied about the peculiar nature of the Angier/Tesla effect's payoff or 'prestige' ‚Äì a term used in this sense by both magicians. The trick is done; before and after, Priest has rolled up both sleeves; his hands are empty and he fixes you with an honest look. And yet ... you realise that it is necessary to read The Prestige again. It's an extraordinary performance, his best book in years, perhaps his best ever. Highly recommended.\\" Publishers Weekly said, \\"This is a complex tale that must have been extremely difficult to tell in exactly the right sequence, while still maintaining a series of shocks to the very end. Priest has brought it off with great imagination and skill. It's only fair to say, though, that the book's very considerable narrative grip is its principal virtue. The characters and incidents have a decidedly Gothic cast, and only the restraint that marks the story's telling keeps it on the rails.\\" Elizabeth Hand wrote, \\"There is a certain amount of grim humor to The Prestige, the blatant Can-You-Top-This? careerism of dueling prestidigitators whose feud is carried out against the lush backdrop of fin- de-si√®cle London. And the novel provides the pleasures of a mystery as well, as the reader attempts to find the man (or men) behind the curtain, and discover the true parentage of Andrew Westley, who may or may not be related to Borden. But at its core The Prestige is a horror novel, and a particularly terrifying one because its secret is revealed so slowly, and in such splendid language... The Prestige is both disturbing and exhilarating ‚Äì one closes the book shaken, wondering how it was done; and eager to see what the master illusionist will produce for his next trick.\\" Adam Kirkman called the novel \\"vastly underrated... Priest weaves together a tale of two feuding stage magicians at the turn of the century, a dark but mesmerising story that sees two men become consumed with, and eventually destroyed by, obsession. While the film hammers you over the head with clues about the final twist, so much so that you feel embarrassed when re-watching it, Priest's novel is more subtle, although a smart reader is in on the trick from the start. The real beauty of this novel is the characters, who are fleshed out more fully here than on screen, and the magical elements of the story achieve a fantastical, creepy edge. If you enjoyed the film, then Priest's novel is grander in scope and more chilling in nature, and is a gem that should not be ignored.\\" The Guardian review said, \\"Behind all the surface trickery lies an intelligent and thoughtful novel about the nature of illusion and secrecy, and about the damage done to those who appoint themselves keepers of such dangerous secrets.\\" A review in Kliatt of the audiobook version narrated by Simon Vance described it as \\"a spellbinding and entirely original neo-gothic thriller that moves the listener adroitly from the world of staged illusion to the otherworldly, from the historical...to the horror-laden, with all sorts of strange and dazzling stops along the way. The plot is convoluted and occasionally technical, spanning generations and incorporating multiple narrators and a large cast of characters. A lesser audiobook narrator might inadvertently muddle the story, but, as usual, Vance displays a dramatic and vocal range that is more than equal to his task. He enhances Priest's novel with superb pacing and a host of highly convincing voices and accents.\\" Awards and nominations *British Fantasy Award nominee, 1995 *James Tait Black Memorial Prize winner, 1996 *Bram Stoker Award nominee, 1996 *World Fantasy Award winner, 1996 *Arthur C.

History Gilbern Sports Cars (Components) Ltd was founded by Giles Smith (previously a butcher, who died in 2003) and Bernard Friese, a German engineer with experience in glass fibre mouldings, and was one of the few cars to be made in Wales. Friese had made a one-off car for himself and the two partners used this as the basis for the first Gilbern car. The premises were a tiny workshop in Church Village, Pontypridd but when production started the business moved to a new location at the old Red Ash Colliery at nearby Llantwit Fardre. The cars were available at first only as kits but later complete cars were also available. The name, Gilbern, was a combination of the first three letters of the name of founder Giles Smith and the first four letters of the name of his co-founder Bernard Friese. Farewell to Welsh sports car pioneer BBC News, September 2003 Retrieved 2014-09-18 Gilberns have often been entered in competition at the Wiscombe Park Hillclimb, first appearing there in 1962 in the hands of an Aston Martin Owners Club member. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders accepted Gilbern as a member in 1965, and the company was permitted to operate a stand at the British International Motor Show at Earls Court thereafter. In 1968, following a search for a cash injection, Gilbern was taken over by Ace Capital Holdings Ltd, whose main business was the manufacture of slot machines. Following the takeover Giles Smith left the company to be replaced by Mike Leather and Maurice Collins as joint managing directors. In 1970 Ace was bought by entertainment group Mecca Ltd, who sold the company to Maurice Collins; in 1972 he in turn sold it to Mike Leather. The cars were expensive for the time and became more so with taxation changes that added Value Added Tax to kit cars.Writer fights to save Welsh car firm, Bruce Wallace, The Guardian, 28 July 1973, Page 4. Production ceased in 1973. A one-off concept car, the T11, was produced, just prior to the company's closure, and was restored in 2009‚Äì10, appearing in some classic car articles in early 2010. Gilbern GT The GT, a 2+2 two-door coup√© was the company's first car and was made between 1959 and 1967. The GT Mk 1 was initially available with either 948 cc BMC A-Series engine with an optional Shorrock supercharger or Coventry Climax 1098 cc engines. The chassis was fabricated from square steel tubing and the front suspension was initially from the Austin A35. The body was a one-piece moulding. Although usually supplied in kit form, the body was provided fully trimmed and painted leaving the purchaser to only complete the mechanical items. Later versions came with a B-series 1500 or 1600 cc MGA or 1800 cc MGB engine and coil-sprung BMC rear axle. With the coming of the larger engine, the car was renamed the GT1800. A car with 1600 cc (ex MGA) engine was tested by the British The Motor magazine in 1961 and was found to have a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 13.8 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£978 including taxes of ¬£251. Rear Gilbern Genie In 1966 a larger, more up- market model, the Genie, appeared at the London Motor Show. It could be had with either a 2.5- or 3-litre Ford Essex V6 engine and gearbox with optional overdrive, but the steering and back axle were still BMC units from the MGB. The engine was fitted with a twin-choke Weber carburetor on most cars, although a small number were built with Tecalemit Jackson fuel injection. The rear suspension differed from the MG in having coil-spring/damper units and trailing arms. On early Genies, the rear axle was located with a Panhard rod, which was then changed to a Watts linkage on later examples. The 2.5-litre version was dropped in 1968. In 1969, a complete car cost around ¬£2000. Rear Gilbern Invader The final car was the Invader, introduced in July 1969 and based on the Genie but with improved chassis and larger brakes. The front suspension now came from the MGC and the chassis was strengthened. It took the brand further upmarket with fittings such as electric windows and walnut- veneered dashboard. The Invader was available as a complete car and from 1970 an estate version was also produced. Automatic or manual gearbox with overdrive were available. It was updated to the Mk II version in 1971. Launched in September 1972, the Mk III version had a Ford Cortina front suspension and was restyled front and rear. The engine was the higher tune unit from the Ford Capri 3000GT. The body was produced using new moulds and was both wider and lower than that of the earlier Invader. Track was extended by four inches (10 cm). The wider axle led to wheel spats being added to the sides of the car. At the back the live rear axle was located by trailing links and a Panhard rod: adjustable shock absorbers were fitted all round. It was only available as a factory-built car and cost ¬£2,693 in 1972. 1973 Gilbern Invader Mk III with flared wheelarches 1972 Gilbern Invader estate T11 Concept Designed by British designer Trevor Fiore, the T11 was built in 1970, and was due to show at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show. It was equipped with a lightly tuned 1.5-litre Austin Maxi drivetrain turned by 180 degrees. The company recalled the project, however. Three chassis were built but only one example was finished. These were restored and completed in 2009‚Äì2010.

The province's name derives from Sino-Vietnamese Ê≤≥Âçó, meaning \\"south of the river\\". History H√† Nam, and Vietnam as a whole, implemented the second five-year plan between 1975 and 1980. This plan included protecting the country's national border and gradually overcoming difficulties within the country itself. Between 1981 and 1985, the administration attempted to improve the society and culture of Vietnam. The years between 1975 and 1985 were a difficult time for the country in general and for H√† Nam province in particular. In this period, the society and economy of Vietnam went through a number of severe difficulties and the majority of the population's standard of living was very low. Despite these events, H√† Nam still managed to make some important gains. Administration divisions H√† Nam is subdivided into six district-level sub-divisions: * 4 districts: ** B√¨nh L·ª•c ** Kim B·∫£ng ** L√Ω Nh√¢n ** Thanh Li√™m * 1 provincial city: ** Ph·ªß L√Ω * 1 town: ** Duy Ti√™n They are further subdivided into seven commune-level towns (or townlets), 98 communes, and 11 wards. Improved crops Throughout this period, H√† Nam Province concentrated their efforts on implementing an extensive irrigation system, widening the area suitable for growing crops, developing the manner in which cattle were raised in the area and applying technical scientific advances. As a result of these operations, a high number of co-operatives in the province reached five tons per hectare by 1987. Furthermore, agrarian districts supplied tens of thousands of tonnes of food for the state. The handicraft industries continued to develop in both the quantity and the quality of the products being produced. Basic education standards developed quickly and equally. The areas of information culture, medical and sports were opened and intensified at a grassroots level. The Sino-Vietnamese War, which broke out during February 1979, had a direct influence on the socio-economic situation in H√† Nam province in particular. H√† Nam province's population became involved in the struggling movement via military enrollment and the local military force began assisting the defense and security plans of the nation. Throughout the early years of the 1980s, Vietnam became involved in implementing the Third five-year plan as a result of changes in the global climate. The population and the various sectors faced a number of difficulties, including the delivery of raw materials and food. The instability of the economy intensified, resulting in rapid inflation and soaring prices. The release of Decree 100/CT/TW on January 13, 1981 was an effective measure to boost activeness and creation in production and delivery. This managed to bring the nation's agriculture problems under control. From 1981 to 1985, H√† Nam's co-efficient use of land increased from 1.5 to 1.76 and food productivity continued to rise throughout this period. The industrial and small handicraft services created plenty of jobs for laborers. Furthermore, localities became increasingly involved in exporting goods such as jute, groundnut, garlic and sesame. The standards of education were maintained and continued to follow the objectives of the reforms passed. Oriental and western medicine were integrated effectively in examination procedures. The media soon gained access to undiscovered knowledge and continued to help meet political aims in the province. An embroidering enterprise (Thanh H√† - Thanh Li√™m) In 1986, the country became involved in a renovation process. The administrative subsidy mechanism was erased, creating favorable conditions for developing a multi-sector economy. The economic and investment structure focused on four socio-economic programs. Social-cultural, technical science and medical activities were intensified and agriculture increased remarkably. The private economy continued to develop, attracting many laborers and banking and financial operations found their place in society. A corner of Ph·ªß L√Ω Park In late 1966, H√† Nam's agricultural production gained a total productivity value of VND960.84 billion: food production achieved 319.435 tons. The average food allowance was 402 kg per head. In addition to the main rice crop, maize, groundnut and peanut crops continued to strengthen. Cattle and poultry production rose 3-5% per annum. Water surface areas were used to develop aquatic products. For example, thousands of bamboo trees were planted to protect dikes, millions of cubic meters of land was dug, covered and dredged and thousands of cubic meters of stones were used to cover the channels. Street in safety In the field of industry and small handicraft production, during the era of the early 1990s, despite a number of difficulties in obtaining materials, certain products were still being developed. For example, Thanh H√† embroidery, Ki·ªán Kh√™ stone, An ƒê·ªï smoothing, ƒê·ªông S∆°n knitting and ƒê·∫°i Th√†nh weaving. The industrial production value of 1996 was VND286.75 billion, including VND19.11 billion from the central industry and VND267.64 from the local industries. At this time, a private enterprise consisting of nine bases was set up and attracted nearly 400 laborers.

He was credited with reforming the tax system to reduce burdens on the peasants and to bring merchants into the rank of taxpayers, but was blamed for using his position to take vengeance on political enemies. He was removed in 781 and soon executed.  Background  Yang Yan was born in 727, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Fengxiang (È≥≥Áøî, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and claimed ancestry through officials of the Warring States period state Han), Qin Dynasty, Han Dynasty, and Sui Dynasty, although the lineage was not completely traceable.New Book of Tang, vol. 71. His great-grandfather Yang Dabao () served as a county magistrate during the reign of Tang Dynasty's founder Emperor Gaozu and was killed when resisting a rival contender for the throne, Liu Wuzhou the Dingyang Khan, and therefore was posthumously honored. His grandfather Yang Zhe () was known for his filial piety. His father Yang Bo () was known for having passed the imperial examinations but then declined official offices to support his parents, an act for which he was honored by both Emperor Xuanzong and Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong.Old Book of Tang, vol. 118.  Early career  Yang Yan was known in his youth for his handsome eyebrows and beard, his ability to stand up against monetary enticements, and his beautiful writing. In his home region, he became known as the younger Yang Shanren (), implying that he was a Taoist hermit. Later, he took off his hermit robes and served as a secretary under L√º Chongbi () the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hexi Circuit (Ê≤≥Ë•ø, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu). He had previously been humiliated by Li Dajian (), and he became a colleague of Li's after he came to serve under L√º, and he took the opportunity, on one occasion, to batter Li severely along with his guards, almost causing Li's death. L√º, however, favored his talent and did not punish him. Later, when the major general Li Guangbi invited him to serve as an assistant, he declined, and he also declined a promotion to serve as an imperial chronicler at the capital Chang'an. Instead, he returned home to support his mother. After his mother died, he was honored for his filial piety to her‚Äîand it was said that it was unprecedented, at that point, that a household would be decorated for three straight generations for their filial piety. After Yang completed his period of mourning, he became Sixun Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu), and later served at the ministries of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu) and the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, Libu). While serving at the ministry of rites, he became one of the main drafters of edicts for Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong. Both he and his colleague Chang Gun were known for the beautiful language they used in writing edicts‚Äîwith Chang being known for his ability to cite ancient precedents, and Yang known for the ability to use appropriate praises. When he wrote the text of a monument dedicated to the general Li Kailuo (), the writing was so beautiful that the scholars at the time all took pains to memorize it. He later became the deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang) and was put in charge of editing the imperial history. He also became well regarded by the powerful chancellor Yuan Zai and was fostered by Yuan to be his successor. After Yuan was executed for corruption in 777, Emperor Daizong initially wanted to execute Yang and some other close associates of Yuan's as well, but Emperor Daizong's uncle Wu Cou () persuaded him not to do so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 225. Instead, Yang was demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Dao Prefecture (ÈÅìÂ∑û, in modern Yongzhou, Hunan).  During Emperor Dezong's reign  In 779, Emperor Daizong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. Emperor Dezong, wanting to reform government, was willing to promote people in exceptional manners, and in fall 779, based on the recommendation of the chancellor Cui Youfu, Emperor Dezong promoted Yang from exile to be the Menxia Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto, serving alongside Cui and Qiao Lin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226. As chancellor, Yang quickly carried out a number of actions that were praised by contemporaries and/or later historians: * Promoting Li Gao () the Prince of Cao, a capable official of imperial descent who had been demoted due to false accusations by Xin Jinggao (). * Keeping the general Cui Ning, the military governor of Sichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), who had controlled the circuit semi-independently from the imperial government, at Chang'an when Cui arrive at Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Dezong, thus allowing the imperial government to take back control of Sichuan. * Convincing Emperor Dezong to return the responsibility of collecting and storing money and silk revenues from Daying Storage (), inside the palace and managed by eunuchs, to the ministry of storage (Â§™Â∫úÂØ∫, Taifu Si), thus restoring accountability. What Yang became most known for, however, was his reform of the taxation system, introduced in an edict by Emperor Dezong in 780. As described by the Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian, of the problems of the taxation system at the time and what Yang's reforms were intended to address:Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 54 [780]. Meanwhile, though, Yang was also said to be vindictive. Blaming the senior official Liu Yan, one of the judges that adjudicated Yuan Zai's guilt, for Yuan's death and for his own demotion, he accused Liu of having encouraged Emperor Daizong to make his favorite concubine Consort Dugu empress‚Äîwhich would have endangered Emperor Dezong's position as crown prince since he was not Consort Dugu's son, and Consort Dugu had her own son, Li Jiong () the Prince of Han. At Cui Youfu's urging, who argued that such matters should no longer be considered since Emperor Dezong had issued a general pardon when he declared the Liangshuifa, Emperor Dezong did not, for the time being, investigate Liu. Still, at Yang's urging, he removed Liu from his various posts as directors of specialized financial agencies and returned the responsibilities to the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). (Subsequently, however, with the executive bureau agencies unable to handle these financial matters, the specialized agencies were restored, although the responsibilities were given to Han Hui () and Du You, not back to Liu.) Liu was also soon demoted and exiled to be the prefect of Zhong Prefecture (Âø†Â∑û, in modern Chongqing). By spring 780, With Cui Youfu seriously ill at that point and Qiao having been removed by Emperor Dezong due to incompetence, Yang was solely in charge of the government, and he revived major military projects that Yuan had advocated until his downfall‚Äîto rebuild Yuan Prefecture (ÂéüÂ∑û, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia), formerly Tang territory but which had become part of the no man's land between territories held by Tang and Tufan, as a forward advance base for a campaign to recapture lands lost to Tufan; and to conscript labor from the regions of the two capitals (Chang'an and Luoyang) and Guanzhong to reopen Lingyang Aqueduct (ÈôµÈôΩÊ∏†, flowing through Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia) in order to promote agriculture in the region by soldiers. When Duan Xiushi, the military governor of Jingyuan Circuit (Ê∂áÂéü, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) opposed the projects on account that it would provoke a Tufan attack, Yang, angered by Duan's opposition, had Duan recalled to the capital to serve in the relatively powerless post as minister of agriculture. When the disciplinarian general Li Huaiguang was subsequently named to succeed Duan, Duan's soldiers, fearing Li Huaiguang's harshness, rebelled under the leadership of the officer Liu Wenxi (). While Liu was quickly killed by his own subordinates, and the rebellion dissipated, neither Yuan Prefecture nor Lingyang Aquedate was actually ever rebuilt. Notwithstanding these projects, one of the agendas that Emperor Dezong had early in his reign was peace with Tufan, and he ordered a general release of Tufan captives. He also sent the official Wei Lun () as an emissary to Tufan. When Wei requested that Emperor Dezong personally sign a letter offering peace addressed to the king of Tufan, Yang believed that this would overly dignify the Tufan king, and therefore requested that the senior general Guo Ziyi sign the letter, with Emperor Dezong writing, \\"approved,\\" on the letter. Emperor Dezong agreed. In fall 780, at Yang's direction, Liu Yan's superior Yu Zhun () the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), accused Liu of complaining about Emperor Dezong in a letter to the general Zhu Ci, and of preparing to commit treason. Yang \\"confirmed\\" Yu's accusations, and Emperor Dezong had Liu put to death‚Äîdrawing mourning from throughout the realm over the unfair treatment of the well-respected Liu. The warlord Li Zhengji, the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), in particular, was submitting repeated petitions criticizing the imperial government for executing Liu. Yang, in fear, sent his associates to the circuits to blame Liu's death on Emperor Dezong personally, over Emperor Dezong's resentment for Liu's support of Consort Dugu, and disavowing personal responsibility in Liu's death. When Emperor Dezong became aware that Yang was blaming him, he began to be resentful of Yang and considered killing him, but did not do so immediately. Rather, he promoted Lu Qi to also be a chancellor to divide Yang's power. Yang, looking down on Lu, as Lu was known to be ugly in appearance and untalented, would often refuse to have lunch with Lu even though chancellors were, by custom, to have lunches with each other on a regular basis. This thus drew resentment from Lu as well. In 781, after Li Zhengji and fellow warlord Li Baochen, the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), died, Emperor Dezong refused to let their sons (Li Na and Li Weiyue, respectively) to inherit their posts. Li Na and Li Weiyue, along with their allies Tian Yue the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) and Liang Chongyi the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), thereafter prepared for war against the imperial government. One of the main advocates for an immediate attack against Liang was Li Xilie, the military governor of Huaixi Circuit (Ê∑ÆË•ø, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), and Emperor Dezong put Li Xilie in charge of the campaign against Liang. Yang objected‚Äîpointing out that Li Xilie was himself disobedient of imperial edicts and had expelled his predecessor Li Zhongchen despite Li Zhongchen's kind treatment of him, and argued that if Li Xilie were successful, he would be so overconfident that the imperial government would no longer be able to control him. Emperor Dezong did not listen to Yang and became increasingly repulsed by Yang due to his opposition. When Li Xilie's army was not launched for sometime due to rain, Lu secretly suggested to Emperor Dezong that it was actually because Li Xilie was resentful of Yang and that Emperor Dezong should remove Yang to placate Li Xilie. Emperor Dezong agreed, and in fall 781, he made Yang Zuo Pushe (), one of the heads of the executive bureau, but no longer chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. While Yang Yan was chancellor, he had demoted Yan Ying () the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region) because he disliked Yan Ying. Lu, knowing this, had Yan Ying made the chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu). At Lu's direction, Yan Ying soon exposed an incident in which Yang had asked Zhao Huibo () the mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region) to sell Yang's mansion for him‚Äîand, at Yan's manipulation, this incident was increased in severity from the lesser charge of conflict of interest to embezzlement. Meanwhile, Lu also secretly told Emperor Dezong that Yang had built his family shrine on land that was said to be greatly blessed, and accused Yang of intending to try to become emperor himself. In winter 781, Emperor Dezong demoted and exiled Yang to the post of military advisor to the prefect of the extremely remove Yai Prefecture (Â¥ñÂ∑û, in modern Sanya, Hainan). However, even before Yang reached Yai Prefecture, Emperor Dezong sent executioners to intercept him and execute him.

A fishmonger (historically fishwife for female practitioners) is someone who sells raw fish and seafood. Fishmongers can be wholesalers or retailers, and are trained at selecting and purchasing, handling, gutting, boning, filleting, displaying, merchandising and selling their product. In some countries modern supermarkets are replacing fishmongers who operate in shops or fish markets. Worshipful Company of Fishmongers A 16th-century fishmongers stall. Bartolomeo Passarotti. The fishmongers guild, one of the earliest guilds, was established in the City of London by a Royal Charter granted by Edward I shortly after he became king in 1272. Partnership with foreigners was forbidden and the sale of fish was tightly controlled to ensure freshness and restrain profit, which was limited to one penny in the shilling. Nevertheless, the guild grew rich and, after Edward's victory over the Scots, was able to make a great show, including one thousand mounted knights. During the reign of Edward II, the political power of the fishmongers waned and Parliament decreed that no fishmonger could become mayor of the city. This was soon rescinded and their wealth increased further so that, during the reign of Edward III, the guild could provide ¬£40 to the war against the French, this being a great sum at that time. The guild was then reformed by Great Charter as the Mystery of the Fishmongers of London. They were given a monopoly over the crying and selling of fish and they regulated the catching of fish in the Thames which teemed with fish such as salmon at that time. The guild still continues today as one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies. Tools A fishmonger prepares to clean and butcher a pair of large fish in Mal√©. The tools used by fishmongers include: * Pliers to pull out pinbones * A fish scaler to remove scales * A filleting knife to cut away the flesh from the bones * Short strong knives for opening oysters and other shellfish * Protective gloves * A curved knife for gutting and removing roe Fishmongers in culture The fishwife Molly Malone of \\"Cockles and Mussels\\" fame. In many countries, the fishwife was proverbial for her sharp tongue and outspoken speech. In Medieval France, the ones in Paris were known for their special privilege of being able to speak frankly to the King himself, when he ventured into the marketplace, and voice criticism without fear of punishment. Molly Malone is a character from a popular Irish song about a young fishwife who tragically dies at a young age. Charles Fort in his book Lo! compiles the story of the Mad Fishmonger or \\"St. Fishmonger\\", which later may or may not appear in the Schr√∂dinger's Cat Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson. St. Fishmonger allegedly caused crabs and periwinkles to fall from the sky. In the English translation of the Asterix series, the village fishmonger is called Unhygienix. In the film The Beach, the Island's chef has only fish as a source of meat, and is named Unhygienix in reference to the Asterix character. In Shakespeare's Hamlet, some contend that the word fishmonger was a euphemism for a \\"fleshmonger,\\" or pimp.Steve Roth, Hamlet: The Undiscovered Country, 2009Hamlet's Puns and Paradoxes , Click NotesShaaber MA (1971) \\"Polonius as Fishmonger\\" Shakespeare Quarterly, 22 (2).

Martin Company in the United States as the A-30. The model was originally ordered by the French in May 1940 as a follow-up to the earlier Martin Maryland, then in service in France. With the fall of France, the production series was diverted to Great Britain and after mid-1941, supplied by the U.S. as Lend Lease equipment. Development of the Baltimore was hindered by a series of problems, although the type eventually became a versatile combat aircraft. Produced in large numbers, the Baltimore was not used operationally by United States armed forces but eventually served with the British, Canadian, Australian, South African, Hellenic and the Italian air forces. it was subsequently used almost exclusively in the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II. Design and development Initially designated the A-23 (derived from the A-22 Martin 167 Maryland design), the Model 187 (company designation) had a deeper fuselage and more powerful engines. The Model 187 met the needs for a light-to-medium bomber, originally ordered by the Anglo-French Purchasing Commission as a joint project in May 1940. The French Air Force sought to replace the earlier Maryland; 400 aircraft being ordered. With the Fall of France, the Royal Air Force (RAF) took over the order and gave it the service name Baltimore. To enable the aircraft to be supplied to the British under the Lend-Lease Act the United States Army Air Forces designation A-30 was allocated.Note; under the provisions of Lend-Lease, aircraft supplied to Allied nations had first to be purchased by the USAAC and be taken onto that service's inventory. Thus aircraft not requested by the USAAC had still to be allocated a USAAC designation, in this case 'A-30'. With the passing of the Lend Lease Act two further batches of 575 and then 600 were provided to the RAF. Operational history USAAF colors prior to delivery The first British aircraft were delivered in late 1941 to equip Operational Training Units. The RAF only used the Baltimores operationally in the Mediterranean theater and North Africa.Rickard, J. \\"Martin Baltimore ‚Äì Development and Combat Record.\\" historyofwar.org, 2 September 2008. Retrieved: 17 June 2010. Many users were impressed by the step up that the Baltimore represented from older aircraft like the Bristol Blenheim. Users of the Baltimore and Martin pilot Benjamin R. Wallace, praised the aircraft for its heavy armament, structural strength, manoeuvrability, bombing accuracy and relatively high performance but crews complained of cramped conditions similar to those in the earlier Maryland bomber. The narrow fuselage made it nearly impossible for crew members to change positions during flight if wounded (the aircraft's interior structure separated the pilot and observer from the wireless operator and rear gunner, a characteristic shared with several light and medium bomber designs of that era e.g. Handley Page Hampden, Douglas Boston and Blenheim). Crews also complained about the difficulties in handling the aircraft on the ground. On takeoff, the pilot had to co-ordinate the throttles perfectly to avoid a nose-over or worse.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 63. Thrown into action to stop Rommel's advance, the Baltimore suffered massive losses when it was used as a low-level attack aircraft, especially in the chaos of the desert war where most missions went unescorted. Operating at medium altitude with fighter escorts, the Baltimore had a very low loss rate, with the majority of losses coming from operational accidents. Undertaking a variety of missions in the Middle East, Mediterranean and European theaters, the Baltimore's roles included reconnaissance, target-towing, maritime patrol, night intruder and even served as highly uncomfortable fast transports. The Baltimore saw limited Fleet Air Arm service with aircraft transferred from the RAF in the Mediterranean to equip a squadron in 1944. Used in the anti-submarine role during the war, the Baltimore achieved moderate success, sinking up to eight U-boats. The RAF also transferred aircraft to other Allies in the Mediterranean area. The Baltimore was used intensively in the Italian campaign to clear the road to Rome for advancing Allied forces after the capitulation of Italy in 1943. After the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces an Italian-manned squadron, the 28th Bomber Wing, was equipped with ex-RAF Baltimores, becoming the co-belligerent Stormo Baltimore.Caliaro 2000, p. 25. The Italians suffered considerable attrition during their training phase on the Baltimore. The majority of accidents were during takeoffs and landings due to the aircraft's fairly high wing loading, high approach speed and a directional stability problems during takeoffs. The Italians operated the Baltimore for about six months. Many of those operations were in Yugoslavia and Greece, providing air support for partisan forces or dropping supplies. Most Baltimores were scrapped soon after the war, although one RAF squadron continued to use the type in Kenya where the aircraft were used in aerial mapping and locust control until 1948. In post-war service, the Baltimore took part in United States Navy instrument and control surface tests in the effort to break the sound barrier. With its powerful engines and light, yet robust construction, the aircraft was able to be dived at high speed, reaching Mach .74 in tests.\\"Martin Model 187.\\" marylandaviationmuseum.org.

The Mint was the sponsor of the Mint 400, the largest off road race from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. The Mint was made famous (or infamous) as the first night's stay in Hunter S. Thompson and Oscar Acosta's legendary 1971 weekend trip to Las Vegas, immortalized in Thompson's novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  History  The Mint opened in 1957. One of the original owners was Milton Prell, who also owned the Hotel Sahara and later the Aladdin hotel-casino. Prell and his associates had engaged a firm to use a computer to come up with a list of possible names for this new addition to downtown Las Vegas. They had been working late into the night in Prell's home, when his wife Debbie came into the room and suggested the place be named The Mint. Del Webb assumed ownership around 1961 when he acquired other properties owned by Prell. On April 6, 1962, Sahara-Nevada Corporation ‚Äì the operating group of the Sahara and Mint ‚Äì announced plans for a 22-story hotel skyscraper addition to the Mint. The addition was expected to be completed within 16 months, at a cost of $5 million. The addition would be built on the Mint's north parking lot, and was to include 300 additional hotel rooms and suites. A six-story, parking garage would be connected to the new hotel building, and would include more than 550 parking spaces. In May 1962, the city planned to review the permit for the new tower. A groundbreaking ceremony was held for the tower in July 1962. Construction was still ongoing in July 1964, at which point the tower was planned to include 24 floors. Construction reached the 24th floor at the end of the year, with plans for an additional four floors. The hotel tower was ultimately built with 26 stories, and was topped out on March 20, 1965, with plans to open later that month. The new tower stood , and was one of the tallest buildings in the state at the time, ranking only behind The Landmark Hotel and Casino, which stood . Renovations were also done to the existing building, which included work to the Merri Mint Theatre, and expanded dining areas. In 1988, The Mint was sold and became part of Binion's Horseshoe. Shows Patsy Cline performed at the Mint Casino's \\"Merri-Mint Theater\\" from November 23 - December 28, 1962, three months before her fatal plane crash. She appeared with Tompall & the Glaser Brothers, and at one point developed \\"Vegas Throat\\" due to the dry desert heat. For several shows, Cline lip- synched to her records. Kitty Wells followed Patsy into The Mint. Tompall & the Glaser Brothers were headliners at The Mint for six weeks from May to June 1963. The Wilburn Brothers, with Loretta Lynn as part of their act, played the Merri-Mint for a couple of nights in October 1962. According to author Larry Jordan, in his book \\"Jim Reeves: His Untold Story,\\" Reeves also played at the Mint Casino in the early-1960s. Peter Urquidi, \\"Man of Many Sounds\\", played the Top of the Mint for more than a decade until the early-1970s. Upstairs in the lounge was the Johnny Elvis Foster show For The Love Of Elvis. The Memphis Sound also played at the Mint. Sidney Fields of Abbott and Costello fame appeared on the same bill in a comedy act. In popular culture =Film history= The Mint's casino appears in the 1964 film Viva Las Vegas and in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever. The Mint's building can be seen in the background toward the end of the 1984 film Starman. It can also be seen in the background of the 1968 film They Came to Rob Las Vegas. The casino can also be seen several times towards the end of the 1987 U2 music video \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", which was filmed entirely on Fremont Street. A computer-generated reconstruction of the casino can be seen in the 1998 film Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas. A casino in Tunica, Mississippi was used to depict the Mint in the 2005 film Walk the Line. The Mint is also seen in music videos by Panic! at the Disco from their 2013 album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die! and also featured in Father John Misty's video for \\"Mr. Tilman\\". =Television history= In the 1975 episode of Kojak titled \\"A House of Prayer, a Den of Thieves\\", a sniper shoots a witness who Kojak has arrested from a room at the Mint. The hotel building can also be seen in the closing credits of the ABC television show Vega$ (1978-1981), which starred Robert Urich. The Mint is also a backdrop in Crime Story (1980'S) season 2 episode 18 , a sniper shoots at a witness being held to testify against organized crime in Las Vegas. The Mint was featured in an episode of Ghost Adventures entitled Binion's Hotel and Casino where they investigated claims of paranormal activity and full-bodied apparitions inside the 25-story tower, which has been sealed off since its closing.

These bacteria are known for their unusually large size, many ranging from 200‚Äì700 Œºm in length. Until the discovery of Thiomargarita namibiensis in 1999, Epulopiscium spp. were thought to be the largest bacteria. They are still the largest known heterotrophic bacteria. In addition to their large size, Epulopiscium, commonly referred to as \\"epulos,\\" are morphologically diverse and extremely polyploid. Epulos also have unique reproductive strategies in which certain cells can form intracellular offspring, similar to microbial sporulation; furthermore, several epulo morphologies exhibit sporulation. While the bacteria have not been successfully grown in the lab, scientists have gained a better understanding of Epulopiscium spp. through microscopic, phylogenetic, and genomic analyses. Naming and discovery Epulopiscium means \\"a guest at a banquet of fish\\" in Latin, from ' (\\"feast\\" or \\"banquet\\") and ' (\\"of a fish\\"), as the organism was found inside the gut of marine surgeonfish. Epulopiscium cells were initially classified as protists on the basis of their large size and unusual ultrastructure. Originally, Epulopiscium populations were thought to be a single species and given the name Epulopiscium fishelsoni in 1988, by Montgomery (one of the co-discovers) and Pollak. The epithet fishelsoni honors Lev Fishelson, a Polish-born Israeli ichthyologist who was part of the group that made the discovery while studying the intestines of a brown surgeonfish from the Red Sea in 1985. Later, however, Epulopiscium fishelsoni was shown to comprise two phylogenetically distinct groups of bacteria by Angert and collaborators using rRNA gene sequence comparisons. Subsequent studies illustrated the relationship between these symbionts and the host surgeonfish.  Physiology  The largest Epulopiscium cells can be seen with the naked eye. However, because of their size, Epulopiscium spp. must compensate for their small surface-to-volume ratio, compared to other bacteria. One distinct feature is the cell membrane, which contains many folds to increase the effective surface area. Additionally, Epulopiscium spp. are extremely polyploid, with individuals containing hundreds of thousands of copies of the genome. Since bacteria rely on diffusion rather than cytoskeletal transport as in eukaryotes, this extreme polyploidy allows for the production of gene products at numerous sites in the cell to produce biomolecules where they are needed.  Reproduction  Epulopiscium spp. type B life cycle. The largest Epulopiscium morphologies exhibit a unique viviparous reproduction. This unusual and derived form of sporulation produces anywhere from one to twelve daughter cells that grow inside of the parent cell, until the parent eventually lyses, and dies. These cells appear to not use binary fission for reproduction. Some morphologies use endospore formation for reproduction. However, there are some smaller morphologies that reproduce through binary fission and spore formation. Although sporulation is widespread among other bacteria (such as Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium spp.) in the phylum Firmicutes, spore formation is usually brought about by overcrowding, the accumulation of toxins in the environment, or starvation, rather than a standard form of reproduction. The production of multiple endospores has been observed in other large gut symbionts such as Metabacterium polyspora, which are phylogenetically related to Epulopiscium spp. Since sporulation affords bacteria much more protection from the outside environment than binary fission, it is thought that the evolution of this unusual life cycle may assist transfer of the bacteria from one host to another.  Symbiosis  Epulopiscium spp. and their surgeonfish hosts are suggested to have a nutritional symbiotic relationship: Epulopiscium spp. have only been found in surgeonfish that eat algae and detritus. It is suggested that Epulopiscium spp. assist in the fish's digestion. However, scientists have been unable to culture Epulopiscium outside of its natural habitat.

History =Feudal dynasties= The area of the province of H∆∞ng Y√™n has been inhabited for millennia. During the legendary H∆∞ng Kings period, H∆∞ng Y√™n belonged to Giao Ch·ªâ, in Du Chien district. Under the Ng√¥ dynasty, it was called Dang Chau. It was then renamed Th√°i B√¨nh ph·ªß (ph·ªß is an administrative unit) under the Early L√™ dynasty, Dang Chau and Kho√°i Ch√¢u ph·ªß under the L√Ω dynasty and Long Hung lo (lo is an administrative unit) and Kho√°i lo under the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty. Under the Later L√™ dynasty, H∆∞ng Y√™n belonged to S∆°n Nam and then divided into S∆°n Nam Th∆∞·ª£ng lo and S∆°n Nam H·∫° lo. The Nguy·ªÖn dynasty implemented administrative reforms in 1831 to dismantle the tr·∫•n administrative units and establish provinces. Five districts of ƒê√¥ng Y√™n, Kim ƒê·ªông, Thi√™n Thi, Ph√π C·ª´ and Ti√™n L·ªØ were separated from Kho√°i Ch√¢u ph·ªß of S∆°n Nam Th∆∞·ª£ng tr·∫•n and three districts of Th·∫ßn Kh√™, H∆∞ng Nh√¢n and Duy√™n H√† were separated from Ti√™n H∆∞ng ph·ªß of Nam ƒê·ªãnh tr·∫•n of lower S∆°n Nam town to establish H∆∞ng Y√™n Province. The initial centre of the province was located in An Vu and Luong Dien communes and then moved to Nhi Tan of X√≠ch ƒê·∫±ng commune (now H∆∞ng Y√™n city). This area has favourable transport conditions with communes and markets lying side by side, enabling trading activities to be busier and busier. The Chronicle of H∆∞ng Y√™n Province stated: \\"The streets are very busy and bustle, crowded with vehicles; the old images of Ph·ªï Hi·ªÅn in S∆°n Nam can be seen now in this land\\". =French colonization= The name H∆∞ng Y√™n officially appeared in the directory of the country in 1831. For that reason, prior to the French occupation of Vietnam, H∆∞ng Y√™n was a province located on both sides of the Lu·ªôc River. Since its establishment, the province's territory has changed many times. On March 27, 1833, French troops led by Captain Henri Rivi√®re moved along the Red River from Hanoi and defeated Nam ƒê·ªãnh citadel. He then demanded Sub lieutenant Edgard de Trentinian to lead a unit of troops to attack H∆∞ng Y√™n citadel. After occupying H∆∞ng Y√™n, they made many efforts to strengthen their puppet government and establish various troop stations on one hand while speeding up the measuring and mapping work for deep involvement into communes and hamlets. However, they met many difficulties, confronting resistance by the B√£i S·∫≠y uprising. In 1890, the French set up the B√£i S·∫≠y area consisting of Y√™n M·ªπ, Yen Hao, VƒÉn L√¢m and Cam Luong districts for the purpose of easier suppression of revolts. After the failure of the B√£i S·∫≠y rebellion, they merged Van Lam, Y√™n M·ªπ and Yen Hao districts into H∆∞ng Y√™n Province and returned Cam Luong district (now C·∫©m Gi√†ng) to H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng Province. Also in 1890, the French split Th·∫ßn Kh√™ district from Ti√™n H∆∞ng ph·ªß of H∆∞ng Y√™n province and Th√°i B√¨nh ph·ªß and Ki·∫øn X∆∞∆°ng ph·ªß from Nam ƒê·ªãnh province and set up a new province called Th√°i B√¨nh. Afterwards, they went on to cut H∆∞ng Nh√¢n and Duyen Ha districts and transferred Ti√™n L·ªØ district (formerly belonging to Ti√™n H∆∞ng) to merge into Kho√°i Ch√¢u ph·ªß. Ever since, the Lu·ªôc River has served as the natural border between H∆∞ng Y√™n and Th√°i B√¨nh. This period lasted from French colonization to the August Revolution in 1945. =Modern Vietnam= When the anti-French resistance war was won and peace was restored in the north, district-level administrative units remained unchanged, except the changes in the administrative names of some wards and communes. On January 26, 1968, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly approved a resolution on the unification of H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng and H∆∞ng Y√™n into H·∫£i H∆∞ng Province. After that, on March 11, 1977, VƒÉn Giang and Y√™n M·ªπ districts were unified into VƒÉn Y√™n district; Ti√™n L·ªØ and Ph√π C·ª´ districts were unified into Ph√π Ti√™n district; VƒÉn L√¢m and M·ªπ H√†o districts were unified into VƒÉn M·ªπ. On February 24, 1979, Kim ƒê·ªông and √Çn Thi districts were unified into Kim Thi district. VƒÉn Y√™n and VƒÉn M·ªπ districts were unified into M·ªπ VƒÉn; Kho√°i Ch√¢u district and a part of VƒÉn Giang district were unified into Ch√¢u Giang district. On November 6, 1996, the National Assembly approved the division of H·∫£i H∆∞ng into H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng and H∆∞ng Y√™n. After that, the unified districts were split as the former administrative units. H∆∞ng Y√™n now has ten district and town-level administrative units: H∆∞ng Y√™n city and the districts of VƒÉn L√¢m, VƒÉn Giang, M·ªπ H√†o, Y√™n M·ªπ, Kho√°i Ch√¢u, √Çn Thi, Kim ƒê·ªông, Ti√™n L·ªØ and Ph√π C·ª´, with a total 161 communes, districts and towns.  Location  H∆∞ng Y√™n is a province located in the Red River Delta, in the Northern Focal Economic Zone and the Hanoi-Haiphong-Qu·∫£ng Ninh Economic Triangle. The eastern gateway to Hanoi, H∆∞ng Y√™n, has 23 km of the 5A National Highway and over 20 km of the Hanoi-Haiphong railway route. In addition, the national highways 39A and 38, which are prolonged from the National Highway 5, passes by H∆∞ng Y√™n city, running to the National Highway 1A through Y√™n L·ªánh Bridge and to the National Highway 10 through Tri·ªÅu D∆∞∆°ng Bridge. This is an important transportation axis linking southwestern provinces in the Northern Delta (H√† Nam, Ninh B√¨nh, Nam ƒê·ªãnh and Thanh H√≥a) with H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng, Haiphong and Qu·∫£ng Ninh provinces. H∆∞ng Y√™n is close to Haiphong and C√°i L√¢n seaports and Noi Bai International Airport. It has borders with Hanoi and the provinces of B·∫Øc Ninh, H√† T√¢y, H√† Nam, Th√°i B√¨nh and H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng. Administrative divisions H∆∞ng Y√™n is subdivided into 10 district-level sub-divisions: * 8 districts: :* √Çn Thi :* Kho√°i Ch√¢u :* Kim ƒê·ªông :* Ph√π C·ª´ :* Ti√™n L·ªØ :* VƒÉn Giang :* VƒÉn L√¢m :* Y√™n M·ªπ * 1 district-level town: :* M·ªπ H√†o * 1 provincial city: :* H∆∞ng Y√™n (capital) They are further subdivided into nine commune-level towns (or townlets), 145 communes, and seven wards. Climate Like other provinces in the Red River Delta, H∆∞ng Y√™n is affected by the hot and damp tropical monsoon climate. Every year, there are two separate hot and cold seasons in the province. The sun shines on average 1,519 hours per year and the average number of sunny days per month is 24. The average temperature is 23.2 ¬∞C in the summer and 16 ¬∞C in the winter. The average rainfall is between and and the rainfall from May to October accounts for up to 70% of the year's total. The average humidity in the air is 86%; the highest level of humidity is 92% while the lowest level is 79%. Natural resources H∆∞ng Y√™n has the features of a delta province: flat topography without hills and mountains. There are 61,037 hectares of agricultural land, of which 55,645 hectares (91%) are for yearly cultivation and the remainder are for cultivation of perennial plants, fish farming, specialized cultivation and other purposes. The area of unused natural land is about 7,471 hectares, which are all available for agricultural production and development. H∆∞ng Y√™n has a plentiful fresh water source because it is surrounded by the H·ªìng River and Lu·ªôc River. Its underground water source is also bountiful with a huge reserve. In the area along the 5A National Highway, from Nh∆∞ Qu·ª≥nh to Qu√°n G·ªèi, there lie mammoth underground water mines with a reserve of millions of cubic metres, which not only can supply water for industrial development and urban daily consumption but also can supply a big water volume for neighbouring localities. H∆∞ng Y√™n's lignite source, which is a part of the brown basin in the Red River Delta and has a 30-billion-tonne reserve, has not been exploited yet. However, there is big potential to develop the mining industry, meeting the energy demand in the domestic market and exports. Workforce The natural population growth rate is 1% per year. H∆∞ng Y√™n has 57,000 young and highly educated people of working age, representing 51% of the provincial population. The number of workers having attended training courses accounts for 25% of the population, mainly graduates from universities, colleges and high schools; and technical workers.  Etymology  The province's name derives from the Sino-Vietnamese ËààÂÆâ, meaning \\"prosperous and peace\\".

The main rivers that flow across Ph√∫ Y√™n are the ƒê√† R·∫±ng River (the largest river in Central Vietnam), B√†n Th·∫°ch River and K·ª≥ L·ªô River. S√¥ng Hinh Lake, a large artificial lake, is located in the southwest of the province. Ph√∫ Y√™n has various picturesque landscapes, such as the √î Loan Lagoon, S√¥ng C·∫ßu coconut ranges, ƒê√° Bia and Nh·∫°n mountains, R√¥ Bay, Xep Beach and Long Th·ªßy Beach. The beautiful nature of Ph√∫ Y√™n has been used for the movie Yellow Flowers on the Green Grass, which is adapted from same novel by Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫≠t √Ånh. Administrative divisions Ph√∫ Y√™n is subdivided into nine district- level sub-divisions: * 6 districts: :* ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n :* Ph√∫ H√≤a :* S∆°n H√≤a :* S√¥ng Hinh :* T√¢y H√≤a :* Tuy An * 2 district-level towns: ** ƒê√¥ng H√≤a ** S√¥ng C·∫ßu * 1 provincial city: ** Tuy H√≤a (capital) They are further subdivided into eight commune-level towns (or townlets), 88 communes, and 16 wards. Demography As of 2007 Ph√∫ Y√™n has a population of 880,700. It has a relatively small urban population (178,600), making up 20% of the province's population. With 174 people per square kilometer, it is also one of the least densely populated provinces of the South Central Coast. Population density is relatively high (exceeding 500/km2) along the lower ƒê√† R·∫±ng River, but is lower than 50/km2 in much of the western part of the province. Average yearly population growth between 2000 and 2007 has been 1.3%, close to the regional average. Urban population growth has been faster with 2.2% per year on average. The vast majority of the population is ethnic Kinh. There are also minorities of Cham, E De, and Ba Na people.

Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi in 2007 and a relatively small industrial sector, Ph√∫ Y√™n is one of the less developed provinces of the South Central Coast. Ph√∫ Y√™n has had a trade deficit. In 2007, it exported goods worth US$72.7 million while importing goods worth US$116.25 million, mainly fuel, raw materials, machinery, and medical goods.General Statistics Office (2009): Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities, Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi Total employment was at 482,800 in 2007. The vast majority (361,400) are still employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. 45,600 people were employed in industry and construction and 75,800 in the service sector. Both industry and service have showed little employment growth between 2005 and 2007. Service employment has actually declined significantly since 2000. =Agriculture, forestry and fishing= The main agricultural regions of the province are the plains around Tuy H√≤a and the lowlands along the ƒê√† R·∫±ng River. In 2007 the rice harvest was 321,800 t. It is the South Central Coast's largest producer of sugar-cane with a harvest of 1.051 million t (6% of Vietnam's total harvest). Cultivation of cotton and tobacco is also significant, with 800 t (5% of the national total) and 700 t (2.2%) respectively. Other crops include peanuts, cashew nuts, pepper, and coffee. Ph√∫ Y√™n has a relatively large fishing sector. Its gross output is the third largest in the South Central Coast after Kh√°nh H√≤a Province and B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province. Aquaculture, mostly shrimp farms, make up around one third of the fishing output, while using 2300 ha. =Industry= Ph√∫ Y√™n is one of the less industrialized provinces of the South Central Coast. Its industrial production is mostly based on the processing of local primary products such as fish, shrimp, cashew nuts and sugar. The province also produces mineral water, beer, garments, and cement. Industrial parks are located in the north of Tuy H√≤a and S√¥ng C·∫ßu, near Qui Nh∆°n. The province is zoning and developing a large economic zone, namely the Nam Ph√∫ Y√™n Economic Zone in southern ƒê√¥ng H√≤a District. Upon completion, it will become an oil-refining hub in Vietnam and potentially provide high profits for the province. Infrastructure =Transport= National Route 1A as well as the North‚ÄìSouth Railway run through the province. Ph√∫ Y√™n's main railway station is Tuy H√≤a Railway Station.

Punting is boating in a punt. The punter generally propels the punt by pushing against the river bed with a pole. A punt should not be confused with a gondola, a shallow draft vessel that is structurally different, and which is propelled by an oar rather than a pole. Punts were originally built as cargo boats or platforms for fowling and angling, but in modern times their use is almost exclusively confined to pleasure trips with passengers. The term \\"punt\\" has also been used to indicate a smaller version of a regional type of long shore working boat, for example the Deal Galley Punt. This derives from the wide usage in coastal communities of the name \\"punt\\" for any small clinker-built open-stem general purpose boat.According to March and The Chatham directory (see above) there were punts peculiar to Happisburgh (Norfolk), Yarmouth (Norfolk), Broadstairs (Kent), Dover (Kent), Hastings (East Sussex), Eastbourne (East Sussex), Itchen Ferry (Hampshire), and Falmouth (Cornwall). In Canada, the term punt can also refer to any small flat-bottomed boat with a square-cut bow, regardless of purpose, building material, or propulsion source. In Australia, cable ferries are commonly referred to as punts.  Construction  A traditional river punt differs from many other types of wooden boat in that it has no keel, stem, or sternpost. Instead, it is built rather like a ladder with the main structure being two side panels connected by a series of 4 in (10 cm) cross planks, known as \\"treads\\", spaced about 1 foot (30 cm) apart. The first punts are traditionally associated with the River Thames in England and were built as small cargo boats or platforms for fishermen. Pleasure punts ‚Äì specifically built for recreation ‚Äì became popular on the Thames between 1860 and 1880.Rivington 1983, p.1 Some other boats have a similar shape to a traditional punt ‚Äì for example the Optimist training dinghy or the air boats used in the Everglades ‚Äì but the most similar boat is the European Weidling a type that can be tracked back to Celtic boats built more than 2,000 years ago. The Cherwell Boathouse, a punt builder's workshop in Oxford established in 1904Since a punt has no keel, it draws only a few inches even when fully laden; this makes it very manoeuvrable and suitable for shallow water. A punt can be punted with equal facility in either direction; this is handy in narrow streams where turning round may be difficult. The square-cut bow gives greater carrying capacity for a given length than a boat of the same beam with a narrow or pointed bow; it also makes the boat very stable, and suitable for passengers. Punts are still made in England to supply the tourist trade in Oxford and Cambridge or for racing purposes. The construction material of choice for most punts is wood. Fibreglass is used for some very light and narrow racing punts. The sides, the ends (known as \\"huffs\\"), and the \\"till\\" are normally made of hardwood such as mahogany. The treads are often made from teak. The bottom is made of softwood and may be replaced several times during the life of a particular boat. A traditional punt is about long and wide. The sides are about 18 inches (0.5 m) deep. Both the bow and the stern are cut square, with a long shallow \\"swim\\"; this is to say, the underside of the boat slopes very gently at the front and the back. Both smaller and wider punts are made. Extra large and wide punts known as ferry punts may be seen in Cambridge, where many are used as water-borne tourist vehicles. Single seater Thames punts were normally made only 2 feet (60 cm) wide, and somewhat shorter than a standard punt; very few of these are still afloat. Racing punts, which are still used by a few specialist clubs on the lower Thames, may be built even narrower. Thames punts have occasionally been adapted for other means of propulsion: including sails, tow-ropes, and paddle wheels. With the addition of iron hoops and canvas awnings, punts have also been used for camping. The construction of a Thames pleasure punt The bottom of the punt is made with long, narrow planks stretching fore and aft, attached to the flat sides and the treads. To allow the wood to swell when it gets wet, the planks are set a small distance apart (traditionally the width of an old penny, about 1‚Äì2 mm). The gaps are caulked; this caulking normally needs to be renewed annually. The treads are attached to the sides with small wooden \\"knees\\", which may be vertical or set at an angle.Rivington 1983, pp.5‚Äì9 The diagram above shows a punt without seats. The seats are usually just a simple board fitting against blocks on the sides, with cushions. The gaps between the treads are normally fitted with gratings to allow the passengers to keep their feet dry. A punt can be punted with equal facility in either direction, so it is not obvious to the novice which end is the bow and which the stern; however, one end of the boat is strengthened with a short deck, usually called a \\"counter\\" or a \\"till\\" (terms from cabinet making), that extends some six feet (2 m) from that end. The Thames punt-building tradition was that the end with the till was the stern, as shown in the diagram. The till provides some extra torsional rigidity, and is normally closed in; occasionally a locker may be built into it. A small minority of punts, such as those made from fibreglass at Magdalen College, Oxford have no single till in the usual sense, instead having very small tills at either end.A Thames punt adapted as a pedalo The forerunners of pleasure punts, fishing punts, usually had an additional compartment, called a \\"well,\\" which extended across the width of the punt a little way in front of the till. This compartment was made water-tight, and had holes in the bottom or sides so that it could be flooded with water. It was used for keeping any caught fish. Punt poles Three punt pole shoes in varying states of wear A traditional punt has no tiller nor any provision for oars, sails, or motor; instead it is propelled and directed with a pole. Poles for pleasure punts are normally made of spruce or aluminium. A normal pole is about 12‚Äì16 feet (4‚Äì5 m) long and weighs about 10 lb (5 kg). In both Oxford and Cambridge, long poles tend to be used exclusively. The bottom of the pole is fitted with a metal \\"shoe\\", a rounded lump of metal to protect the end ‚Äì the shoe is sometimes made in the shape of a swallow tail. Traditional wooden poles are preferred by many experienced punters; they are more sympathetic on the hands (at least when in good condition; a splintered surface is less so) and make less noise on contact with the river bottom or the punt compared with an aluminium pole. Aluminium poles are considerably cheaper and stronger, so may be preferred by punt stations offering punts for hire to inexperienced punters; however, it is normally possible to choose either type. Racing poles are generally a great deal lighter than pleasure punt poles, and aluminium is the preferred material. It is usual to carry one or two spare poles in a race, so that one can keep punting if a pole gets stuck or is dropped. A punt pole differs from the Fenland quant in that it does not have a cross piece at the top, and from the more generally used setting pole in that it only has a metal shoe on one end.Rivington 1983, p.160  Punting technique  For another description, see Using a quant (quanting). The basic technique of punting is to shove the boat along with a pole by pushing directly on the bed of the river or lake. In the 1870s, when punting for pleasure first became popular, the normal approach was for the passengers to sit at the stern on cushions placed against the till, and for the punter to have the run of the rest of the boat. The punter started at the bow, planted the pole, and then walked towards the stern, shoving the punt forwards. This is known as \\"running\\" the punt. It was the normal technique used to move heavy fishing punts. As pleasure punts became lighter, it became more usual for the punter to stand still ‚Äì normally towards the stern ‚Äì while shoving. This is called \\"pricking\\" the punt. Pricking has the advantages that the punter is less likely to walk off the end of the punt inadvertently, and that more of the punt can be used to carry passengers.Rivington 1983, p.10 For pleasure punting, the best way to learn is to start out in a boat with a competent punter to watch him or her at work. After this there is no substitute for extensive hands-on practice on different stretches of river. For racing punting it is best to join a club, and to work on one's balance. Some punt racers practise by punting in canoes.Rivington 1983, pl. 40 One of the keys to punting well is that the steering is done during the stroke, rather than by using the pole as a paddle or rudder; steering in this way requires less physical effort if the punter stands in the centre of the boat (or at least as far forward as is compatible with not wetting the passengers). Once the punt is under way, it is easier to keep it in a straight line if the weight in the punt is all on the same side, to tilt the punt slightly and to form a keel. For racing, therefore, the leading foot is placed to one side against the knee that is at, or just forward of, the centre of the boat, and does not move from that position; only the rear foot moves during the stroke. For pleasure punting the precise stance does not matter so much; it is more important that the punter remains relaxed and does not shove too hard.Rivington 1983, p.188‚Äì9 Two rather different traditions have grown up in Oxford and Cambridge: in Cambridge most punters stand on the till and punt with the open end forward, while in Oxford they stand inside the boat and punt with the till forward. Since the rivers in both cities are narrow and often crowded, the opportunities for punting \\"at full pressure\\" are rare, so these variations in stance are of little practical importance. Nevertheless, the traditions are often strongly held; students at Oxford and Cambridge frequently believe that theirs is the only correct style, to the extent that the till end is often known as the \\"Cambridge End\\", and the other as the \\"Oxford End\\". = For the beginner = Punting on the Cherwell, under Magdalen Bridge, Oxford RivingtonRivington, 1983, p.190 recommends that the beginner should: * Stand near the back of the punt (that is, on the \\"till\\" in Cambridge or on the \\"swim\\" in Oxford) and as near to the side as confidence and balance allow, facing over the side of the punt. * With the forward hand throw the pole vertically down close to the side of the punt, guiding it with the lower hand. * Let it fall all the way until it touches the bottom and then reach forward with both hands and gently push the pole past your chest. If you shove gently, you are less likely to steer wildly. * At the end of the stroke, relax and allow the pole to float up like a rudder behind you. * When the punt is going straight, recover the pole hand over hand until you can throw it down again and begin the next stroke. The habit of relaxing at the end of the stroke helps to avoid falling in should the pole unexpectedly get stuck. If it does stick, let it go and use the paddle to bring the punt back to it. = For the more experienced = More experienced punters steer during the stroke instead of using the pole as a rudder. To do this they stand further forward and keep to one side of the punt. To turn towards the side the punter is facing, the pole is thrown close to the punt and pulled towards the punter during the stroke (this is called \\"pinching\\" the punt); to turn the other way the pole is thrown slightly further out and the feet are pulled towards the pole (this is called \\"shoving around\\").Rivington 1983, p.193 Some experienced punters punt one-handed. This technique is slower and harder to master than punting with both hands, and consists of a \\"bucket\\" recovery of the pole (where the pole is thrown forward rather than just pulled up), except that this recovery is done with one hand. It is also feasible to punt one-handed while turning the punt pole over, in the manner of a paddle wheel. The advantage this gives the punter is that the pole can be dropped onto the river bed at an angle forward of the punter's position, while the momentum of the punt continues. When the pole comes vertical, pressure can be applied immediately to drive the punt forwards. This style of punting is particularly effective at providing power more continuously in fast-flowing streams or when the punt is moving quickly. This technique is more easily executed in shallow rivers. Racing punters tend to stand in the middle of the punt, because it is more efficient to do so. Indeed, many racing punts have cross braces with canvas covers both fore and aft, so it is only possible to stand in the middle. Pleasure punters may like to try punting from the middle, but it is probably advisable to remove the seats and the passengers first. It is also possible to punt tandem, that is with two punters standing one behind another in the middle of the boat, and generally punting from the same side. Some punt races are organised for pairs punting tandem. Punting in England Punts and passengers in Cambridge, England The pleasure punts in use in England today were first built around 1860, becoming increasingly popular in the early 1900s. The evidence indicates that pleasure punting initially started on the non-tidal Thames and quickly spread across the country.Rivington 2012, p.74 The first punting company (Scudamore's Punting Company) in the UK was founded in 1910. This company was bought out by a newer operation established in 1993 - who then changed their name to Scudamores and claim continuity with the older company.Companies House ListingsVisit Cambridge Listings . Retrieved 11 December 2012 Pleasure punting declined across much of England in the 1950s and 1960s in proportion to the increase in motor boat traffic on English rivers, but has since increased again as the tourist industry has grown in England. Punting is a popular leisure activity on the rivers of several well-known tourist destinations: there are commercial organisations that offer punts for hire on the Avon in Bath, the River Avon in Salisbury, the Cam in Cambridge, the Cherwell & Isis in Oxford, at Stratford-on-Avon, and on the lower Thames near Sunbury. A small number of private punts are also registered on these rivers, specifically by the colleges in Oxford and Cambridge, and most often by those colleges that lie along the river. In June 2012, Norwich City Council gave the go-ahead to introduce punting on the River Wensum.BBC news report. Retrieved 24 November 2012 =Punting in Cambridge= Summer on the Cam Punting in summer on the Cam Traditional Thames pleasure punts were not introduced to Cambridge until about 1902‚Äì1904, but they rapidly became the most popular craft on the river,Rivington 1983, p.155 and today there are probably more punts on the Cam than on any other river in England. This is partly because the river is shallow and gravelly (at least along The Backs) which makes it ideal for punting, but mainly because the Cam goes through the heart of Cambridge and passes close to many attractive college buildings. The popularity of punting beside the old colleges in Cambridge can produce significant congestion on this relatively narrow stretch of the river during the peak tourist season, leading to frequent collisions between inexperienced punters. These collisions are mostly harmless, but visitors to the city may prefer the calmer experience offered on the river above the weir. Further upstream, the river enters some particularly beautiful and tranquil countryside as it approaches the village of Grantchester. Less formal punting on the River Cam at Grantchester A popular summer pastime for Cambridge students is to punt to Grantchester and back, stopping for lunch in a pleasant Grantchester pub.Rivington 1983, p.171 The Cam, on its upper reaches, is known as the River Granta. During tourist season, students have been known to steal the poles of tourist punts as they pass below the College bridges.Rivington 1983, p.159 There are several companies on the Cam operating tours and hiring punts to visitors and, while most of the colleges along the river keep punts for the exclusive use of their students, at Trinity College the punts are also available for hire to the public. Cambridge punting technique The tradition in Cambridge is to punt from the till (locally known as the \\"deck\\") at the back of the punt. There are some advantages to this: punters are less likely to drip on their passengers and can steer more easily by swinging the pole behind them, but it is not how Thames punts were traditionally propelled. Nor was the till originally designed for standing on; Cambridge-built punts are made with extra strong decks, and sometimes with a deck at both ends.Rivington 1983, p.169 Photographs of punting on the Backs in 1910 show that the practice was well established by then; according to an old Cambridge boat man, Don Strange interviewed in the 1970s, the practice was started by women from Girton anxious to show off their ankles.Rivington 1983, p.162 Quayside by Magdalene Street, Cambridge From late in the 19th century until at least 1989,The Archimedeans ‚Äì The Archimedeans an undergraduate social club called the Damper Club, (or Dampers Club after 1958) took a loose responsibility for the interests of punting on the Cam. Membership was open to \\"all those who have unwillingly entered the Cam fully clothed\\". The future Python Graham Chapman was president in 1961‚Äì62.Rivington 1983, p.164 The Dampers Club has been succeeded by the Cambridge University Punting Society (\\"the Granta Rats\\"), an undergraduate student society in the University of Cambridge, founded in 2010.http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/business/2010fairlayout.pdfhttp://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/societies/directory/grantarats/ Cambridge towpath Where the River Cam flows through the town in Cambridge, experienced punters follow the path of a gravel ridge that makes for easier punting. This ridge has a curious history. It is the remains of an old towpath built when the Cam was still used for commercial river traffic. The banks on either side of the river belong to various university colleges; faced with their combined opposition to a conventional towpath on one side or the other, the river tradesmen were forced to build the towpath in the course of the stream, and to make the tow horses wade along it.The Canals of Eastern England, (1977), John Boyes and Ronald Russell, David and Charles, Weir and slipway A punt being pulled up rollers on the slipway between the upper and lower levels of the River Cam near the Mill Pool in Cambridge The part of the Cam in Cambridge where punting normally occurs is separated into two levels by a weir at the Mill Pool near the University Centre. (Punting on the lower river below Jesus Lock is not normally allowed.) Punters wishing to move from one level to the other drag their punts between the levels via a slipway with rollers. Tourists wishing to visit only one level can hire punts at the appropriate level to avoid the transfer, which requires about four average adults.Punting allows a relaxing ride and a view of English countryside to boot, (1985), Martha Bayless, Chicago Tribune, 27 October 1985, page 14 Most punt hirers only allow use of their punts on one level, and do not allow use of the rollers with their punts. =Punting in Oxford= Mesopotamia\\" on the Cherwell Except in the immediate vicinity of Magdalen Bridge, punting in Oxford is a surprisingly quiet and rural experience. Most of the punting is done on the River Cherwell, which flows through Oxford's protected green belt of fields and woods for the last few miles before it joins the Thames just south-east of Christ Church Meadow.Rivington 1983, p.128 Unfortunately this tranquillity comes at a price, for the Cherwell is both deep and muddy, and the muddy patches cling tenaciously to the pole's shoe at unexpected moments.Rivington 1983, pp.132, 152 Punting on the Thames below Folly Bridge is often less enjoyable, mainly because of the competition from eights and sculls and motor boats; punts are recommended to keep close in beside the towpath.Rivington 1983, p.154 The best punting to be had in Oxford is on the Isis alongside Port Meadow to the west of the town; this stretch of river is both shallow and gravelly, has attractive scenery, and is well supplied with pubs (such as The Trout Inn, Wolvercote where some of the Inspector Morse dramas were filmed). The tradition at Oxford is to punt from inside the boat rather than from on top of the till (or \\"box\\" as it tends to be called in Oxford) and to propel the punt with the till end facing forwards. The tradition dates from before 1880.Rivington 1983, p.125 =Punting elsewhere in England= Punting can now be done in London on the Regent's Canal from Mile End Park. There is some punting on the River Wear in Durham and some of the colleges of Durham University own punts; however, small rowing boats are more popular and better suited to the Wear. Specifically, University College owns punts for the use of its students. In Bath, it is possible to punt on the Avon from the town centre. The river however is deep and shared with large motor vessels. The puntable stretch of river runs beside Brunel's Great Western Railway line. It is also possible to punt on the Lancaster Canal from Lancaster and on the River Avon in Stratford-upon-Avon. Punting is possible on most of the Thames above the tidal limit at Teddington; even in places where the river is broad it is often surprisingly shallow, especially at the edges. Commercial punts have been available for hire near Sunbury-on- Thames in recent times, but most Thames punting is now confined to a few Skiff and Punting clubs. There are active clubs at Thames Valley Skiff Club in Walton-on-Thames, Dittons Skiff and Punting Club in Thames Ditton, The Skiff Club in Teddington, Wraysbury Skiff and Punting Club in Wraysbury, Wargrave & Shiplake and Sunbury on punting ledges. These clubs concentrate on racing punts and leisurely club-organised meanders. Punting takes place on the Great Stour river in Canterbury.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36241589 Punting has also been known on the River Nidd near Harrogate in Yorkshire\\"Hearts, Tarts and Rascals ‚Äì The Story of Betty's\\" [the tearoom chain], by Jonathan Wild, published 2005, contains a photograph from approximately 1912 showing the tearooms' founder Fritz Butzer punting with the caption \\"Fritz and Claire courting on the River Nidd\\". and at St Ives in Cambridgeshire. =Racing= A pair of 2-foot racing punts A pair of best-and-best punts, with 2-foot punts at the ryepecks in the background Punt racing in England is governed by the Thames Punting Club, which maintains lists of umpires and publishes a handbook containing rules and bye-laws for those organising punt races on the Thames. Races are normally held over a distance of up to 880 yards (800 m) along a straight reach of the river, each end of the course being marked by a pair of poles called \\"ryepecks\\" which are firmly pushed into the river bed before the race. Races are always one punt against another, one having the inner lane and the other the outer lane. If the outer lane has consistently deeper water, then the length of the outer course may be reduced to make the race more even. The competitors usually start with their punts' sterns level with the line between the downstream ryepecks, punt to the upstream ryepecks, and then back. The winner is the first to pass the line of the starting ryepecks (or the first one to hit his or her own ryepeck). The turn at the upstream ryepecks is done by \\"stopping-up\\"; that is the competitor passes the ryepeck on the outside, stops his or her punt with the pole just upstream of the ryepeck, turns to face the stern of the boat and punts back in the other direction, passing the ryepeck on the inside. Handicap races are normally held in standard \\"2-foot punts\\", that is punts that are 2 ft (60 cm) wide in the middle and about 18 inches (45 cm) wide at each end. There are no restrictions on width or length for non-handicap races; punts used for these races are called \\"best boats\\" or \\"best-and-best\\" punts; the name comes from the \\"best\\" boat that you can find and the \\"best\\" boat that your opponent can. The narrowest of these boats are no more than 15 inches (40 cm) wide. All racing punts generally have a till at both ends, and may have canvas covers to reduce the amount of water splashing into the boat. Punt racing has been a part of the various summer regattas along the Thames, since the early 1890s with punt races held at Sunbury, Chertsey, Walton, Wraysbury, Thames Ditton, Wargrave & Shiplake and Teddington, where there are punting ledges. The annual Thames Punting Championships are held at Maidenhead. The Punting Championships have been held for well over 100 years, one of the earliest champions being the all-rounder Lord Desborough. Punt racing under Thames Punting Club rules has never taken hold at either Oxford or Cambridge, where serious watermen and women have always preferred rowing,Rivington 1983, p.150 but varsity punt races were held on the lower Thames in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 2007 the first official varsity race for around thirty years was held with victory going to the Cambridge team. A Varsity Punt race between the two University punting societies is planned on the Cam for 2014. Less formal punt races have also been conducted between the Cambridge Dampers Club, and its one-time Oxford rival the Charon Club. Races were conducted on the Cam or the Cherwell using normal pleasure punts in relays, traditionally with female undergraduates on each side as the batons, jumping between boats on each leg of the race.Rivington 1982, p.165 For a number of years after 1983, the Cambridge Dampers Club also took part in the annual Scottish Boat Race against the Honourable Society of Edinburgh Boaters, racing along the Union Canal between Hermiston and Ratho for the Antlers Trophy. In May 2011 Red Bull held the \\"Punt to Point\\" competition in Oxford, featuring head to head checkpoint racing. In T√ºbingen, Germany, a race with similar punts () on the Neckar river, has been performed annually since 1956, with about 50 punts taking part.  Punting around the world  Punting on the River Avon in Christchurch Traditional \\"Thames\\" punts are also popular on a few other rivers outside England. These include: * The Avon in Christchurch, New Zealand where commercialised punting is a major tourist attraction. * The Mutha River in Pune, India at the Boat Club (BC) of the College of Engineering, Pune. Punting here is mainly a leisure activity, but there are also punting activities organised as part of the annual regatta, including the spectacular \\"Punt Formation\\" where several illuminated punts are used to create a night time display. * Along the Cherry Creek, in Denver, Colorado in the USA. The Greenway Foundation sponsors the \\"Venice on the Creek\\" program in this area from June to August. Despite the allusion to gondolas, the boats involved are chauffeured fibreglass punts made in Cambridge. This site contains the following Q&A; \\"Q: Is Venice on the Creek the same as Punt the Creek? A: Yes we changed our name to Venice on the Creek to better describe what we do.\\" The technique of using a pole to propel a narrow boat in confined waters has developed in many other cultures, especially in marshy or swampy areas where transport on land is difficult. These include: hippo *The Okavango Delta in Botswana, using dug-out canoes called makoros. The boats are punted from the rear and are used for getting around the shallow waters of the swamp. A makoro's shape is determined by the tree from which it was made, and the punter simply stands in the bottom. Bucket-seats are sometimes added for passengers' comfort. * The Marais Poitevin, an area of marsh land criss- crossed with canals north of La Rochelle in Poitou-Charentes, France. Here the boats (called barques) are somewhat shorter than a Thames punt, and may have a pointed bow and stern. The punting pole (la pigouille) may be a rough cut branch or coppice pole. Originally used for transporting goods and livestock, today boats are available for hire to tourists. * In the marshy Overijssel, the Netherlands there is a boat called the punter. They are about in length and have a pointed bow and stern. Originally used for transporting agricultural goods, turf and livestock, most newly built boats are either privately owned or hired to tourists. Stocherkahnrennen (Puntrace) in T√ºbingen (2006), with the Stocherkahn of Landsmannschaft Schottland on the right. The punts are passing the bottleneck known as the \\"Nadel√∂hr\\" (eye of the needle) * Depending on water depth punting is often used to propel boats called \\"Weidling\\" in Switzerland and Germany. These boats are very similar in design to Thames punts. On the River Neckar in T√ºbingen, Germany, punting boats called Stocherkahn is a university tradition. These boats are larger and deeper, and have a narrower bow and stern than Thames punts. Bench seats for passengers are provided down each side, and the punter stands on a small triangular deck at the stern. There are about 130 Stocherk√§hne at T√ºbingen, most of them owned by student fraternities of the University, the Studentenverbindungen. There is a traditional annual race for these boats in June, the '. It is a light-hearted event; the winning fraternity or other student club has to give a party (at its fraternity house) and the losers have to drink a glass of Cod liver oil, as well as to organise the following year's race. * Punting had a resurgence in Scotland in the 1980s as the Honourable Society of Edinburgh Boaters took to the waters of the Union Canal on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The Society staged regattas and engaged in the Scottish Boat Race with the Cambridge University Dampers Club.\\"Messing about in the River\\", The Glasgow Herald 15 April 1985 * Bamboo rafts of proportions similar to punts' are used on various rivers in northern Thailand; the technique for punting them is identical to that used in Cambridge. * The \\"takasebune\\" boats are found in various parts of Japan. The canals developed for such boats are often named takasegawa. The fast punting boats for passengers in Tokyo are called \\"choki\\" or \\"choki-bune\\".

For the semi-final she sang \\"Don't Let Go\\" by En Vogue. The judges were disappointed, saying that her vocal was pitchy. However, despite the poorly judged performance, Gissara made the finals on the public's votes alongside Kate DeAraugo and Milly Edwards. On the Australian Made theme night, Top 13, Gissara had to prove that the voting public made the correct decision in voting her through. She sang Cilla Black's \\"You're My World\\" as covered by local artist, Daryl Braithwaite. All three judges said it was the best they had ever heard her sing. On the Live Verdict the next day she was told she was safe for another week. A week later, on '60s night, Gissara sang \\"Don't Play That Song\\" by Aretha Franklin. The judges said it was pretty good but she did not put enough feeling into the song. The next night she was told she was part of the bottom three along with James Kannis and Natalie Zahra; Zahra was eliminated and Gissara was safe for another week. On the Supergroups theme, a week later, Gissara performed \\"The Greatest View\\" by Silverchair. All judges were disappointed with her performance, she was part of the bottom three along with Kannis and Daniel Spillane. Gissara was told she had the fewest votes and was eliminated. She then sang \\"The Greatest View\\" again. During her time in the Top 13, allegations were made that her father, a Telstra employee, had tampered with the telephone voting results. An investigation ensued which discounted the claims.

An infusion pump infuses fluids, medication or nutrients into a patient's circulatory system. It is generally used intravenously, although subcutaneous, arterial and epidural infusions are occasionally used. Infusion pumps can administer fluids in ways that would be impractically expensive or unreliable if performed manually by nursing staff. For example, they can administer as little as 0.1 mL per hour injections (too small for a drip), injections every minute, injections with repeated boluses requested by the patient, up to maximum number per hour (e.g. in patient-controlled analgesia), or fluids whose volumes vary by the time of day. Because they can also produce quite high but controlled pressures, they can inject controlled amounts of fluids subcutaneously (beneath the skin), or epidurally (just within the surface of the central nervous system ‚Äì a very popular local spinal anesthesia for childbirth). Types of infusion The user interface of pumps usually requests details on the type of infusion from the technician or nurse that sets them up: * Continuous infusion usually consists of small pulses of infusion, usually between 500 nanoliters and 10 milliliters, depending on the pump's design, with the rate of these pulses depending on the programmed infusion speed. * Intermittent infusion has a \\"high\\" infusion rate, alternating with a low programmable infusion rate to keep the cannula open. The timings are programmable. This mode is often used to administer antibiotics, or other drugs that can irritate a blood vessel. To get the entire dose of antibiotics into the patient, the \\"volume to be infused\\" or VTBI must be programmed for at least 30 CCs more than is in the medication bag; failure to do so can potentially result in up to half of the antibiotic being left in the IV tubing. * Patient-controlled is infusion on- demand, usually with a preprogrammed ceiling to avoid intoxication. The rate is controlled by a pressure pad or button that can be activated by the patient. It is the method of choice for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), in which repeated small doses of opioid analgesics are delivered, with the device coded to stop administration before a dose that may cause hazardous respiratory depression is reached. * Total parenteral nutrition usually requires an infusion curve similar to normal mealtimes. Some pumps offer modes in which the amounts can be scaled or controlled based on the time of day. This allows for circadian cycles which may be required for certain types of medication. Types of pump A Baxter International Colleague CX infusion pump There are two basic classes of pumps. Large volume pumps can pump fluid replacement such as Saline solution, medications such as antibiotics or nutrient solutions large enough to feed a patient. Small-volume pumps infuse hormones, such as insulin, or other medicines, such as opiates. Within these classes, some pumps are designed to be portable, others are designed to be used in a hospital, and there are special systems for charity and battlefield use. Large-volume pumps usually use some form of peristaltic pump. Classically, they use computer-controlled rollers compressing a silicone- rubber tube through which the medicine flows. Another common form is a set of fingers that press on the tube in sequence. Small-volume pumps usually use a computer-controlled motor turning a screw that pushes the plunger on a syringe. The classic medical improvisation for an infusion pump is to place a blood pressure cuff around a bag of fluid. The battlefield equivalent is to place the bag under the patient. The pressure on the bag sets the infusion pressure. The pressure can actually be read-out at the cuff's indicator. The problem is that the flow varies dramatically with the cuff's pressure (or patient's weight), and the needed pressure varies with the administration route, potentially causing risk when attempted by an individual not trained in this method. Places that must provide the least-expensive care often use pressurized infusion systems. One common system has a purpose-designed plastic \\"pressure bottle\\" pressurized with a large disposable plastic syringe. A combined flow restrictor, air filter and drip chamber helps a nurse set the flow. The parts are reusable, mass-produced sterile plastic, and can be produced by the same machines that make plastic soft-drink bottles and caps. A pressure bottle, restrictor and chamber requires more nursing attention than electronically controlled pumps. In the areas where these are used, nurses are often volunteers, or very inexpensive. The restrictor and high pressure helps control the flow better than the improvised schemes because the high pressure through the small restrictor orifice reduces the variation of flow caused by patients' blood pressures. An air filter is an essential safety device in a pressure infusor, to keep air out of the patients' veins. Small bubbles could cause harm in arteries, but in the veins they pass through the heart and leave in the patients' lungs. The air filter is just a membrane that passes gas but not fluid or pathogens. When a large air bubble reaches it, it bleeds off. Some of the smallest infusion pumps use osmotic power. Basically, a bag of salt solution absorbs water through a membrane, swelling its volume. The bag presses medicine out. The rate is precisely controlled by the salt concentrations and pump volume. Osmotic pumps are usually recharged with a syringe. Spring-powered clockwork infusion pumps have been developed, and are sometimes still used in veterinary work and for ambulatory small-volume pumps. They generally have one spring to power the infusion, and another for the alarm bell when the infusion completes. Battlefields often have a need to perfuse large amounts of fluid quickly, with dramatically changing blood pressures and patient condition. Specialized infusion pumps have been designed for this purpose, although they have not been deployed. Many infusion pumps are controlled by a small embedded system. They are carefully designed so that no single cause of failure can harm the patient. For example, most have batteries in case the wall-socket power fails. Additional hazards are uncontrolled flow causing an overdose, uncontrolled lack of flow, causing an underdose, reverse flow, which can siphon blood from a patient, and air in the line, which can cause an air embolism. Safety features available on some pumps The range of safety features varies widely with the age and make of the pump. A state of the art pump may have the following safety features: *Certified to have no single point of failure. That is, no single cause of failure should cause the pump to silently fail to operate correctly. It should at least stop pumping and make at least an audible error indication. This is a minimum requirement on all human-rated infusion pumps of whatever age. It is not required for veterinary infusion pumps. *Batteries, so the pump can operate if the power fails or is unplugged. *Anti-free-flow devices prevent blood from draining from the patient, or infusate from freely entering the patient, when the infusion pump is being set up. *A \\"down pressure\\" sensor will detect when the patient's vein is blocked, or the line to the patient is kinked. This may be configurable for high (subcutaneous and epidural) or low (venous) applications. *An \\"air-in-line\\" detector. A typical detector will use an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver to detect when air is being pumped. Some pumps actually measure the volume, and may even have configurable volumes, from 0.1 to 2 ml of air. None of these amounts can cause harm, but sometimes the air can interfere with the infusion of a low-dose medicine. *An \\"up pressure\\" sensor can detect when the bag or syringe is empty, or even if the bag or syringe is being squeezed. *A drug library with customizable programmable limits for individual drugs that helps to avoid medication errors. *Mechanisms to avoid uncontrolled flow of drugs in large volume pumps (often in combination with a giving st based free flow clamp) and increasingly also in syringe pumps (piston-brake) *Many pumps include an internal electronic log of the last several thousand therapy events. These are usually tagged with the time and date from the pump's clock. Usually, erasing the log is a feature protected by a security code, specifically to detect staff abuse of the pump or patient. *Many makes of infusion pump can be configured to display only a small subset of features while they are operating, in order to prevent tampering by patients, untrained staff and visitors. Safety issues Infusion pumps have been a source of multiple patient safety concerns, and problems with such pumps have been linked to more than 56,000 adverse event reports from 2005 to 2009, including at least 500 deaths.Pharmacy Practice News, May 2010 As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a comprehensive initiative to improve their safety, called the Infusion Pump Improvement Initiative.https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/InfusionPumps/ucm205424.htm The initiative proposed stricter regulation of infusion pumps. It cited software defects, user interface issues, and mechanical or electrical failures as the main causes of adverse events.

It was built for the Rhymney Railway in 1899 and taken over by the Great Western Railway at amalgamation in 1923. Much of its initial work was in refurbishing older locomotives with new boilers and covered cabs. In 1906, C.H. Riches who had been at Gorton locomotive works became Locomotive Superintendent and appointed J.H. Sellars as Works Foreman. Their policy was to modernise and standardise the locomotive stock, and Riches designed a standard boiler and cylinders for all the railway's tank engines. He also designed a new class of 0-6-2 tank engine to be built by Robert Stephenson and Company who had provided six of their own design in 1903. In 1919 Sellars became the Works Manager. Until 1922 the works only repaired its own locomotives, but they began to be sent from the Barry Railway and in 1924 the first Swindon-built locomotive arrived. The works was enlarged with a new erecting shop in 1926. The works also maintained a variety of wagons and passenger vehicles, building new mineral wagons and a few carriages, with a new workshop in 1901. However a new wagon works was built at Cardiff and, with work finishing its main work of converting Westinghouse air brakes to GWR vacuum brakes, the carriage and wagon works was phased out. However, in 1939 new workshops were built for carriage repairs only. Until 1952 only tank engines had been repaired, but the efficiency of the works was such that they were asked to handle the smaller two-cylinder tender engines. They were so successful that larger engines were sent, the first being the 4-6-0 Number 5955 Garth Hall. Around 1958 Swindon was committed to diesel locomotives and Caerphilly was sent Castle class and BR Standard locomotives. With the withdrawal of steam on British Railways, the works closed in 1963 and the site converted into an industrial estate.

In 2014, it celebrated its 1000-year anniversary as a full diocese.  Catholic diocese  It was suffragan to the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen (990-1104), to the Archdiocese of Lund (1104‚Äì64), and finally to the Archdiocese of Uppsala (1164-1530). This diocese, the most ancient in Sweden, included the provinces of V√§sterg√∂tland and V√§rmland. = Early history = It was founded about 990 at Skara, the capital of the country of the Geats (Gauthiod), the whole of which it embraced until about 1100, when the eastern portion of the Diocese of Skara was formed into that of Link√∂ping. At the beginning there was no strict division of the country into dioceses, and the missionary bishops went about preaching wherever they would. Thus it is that, though Odinkar Hvite the Elder was apparently the first bishop stationed at Skara about 990, Sigurd, a court bishop of King Olaf Tryggveson of Norway, is named as the first Bishop of Skara in the list of bishops written down about 1325 as an appendix to the Laws os the Western Geats (V√§stg√∂talagen). It is added that he founded three churches in V√§sterg√∂tland, and he also seems to have baptized Olof Sk√∂tkonung, first Christian King of Sweden, at Husaby near Skara in 1008. Odinkar's successor was Thurgaut, first diocesan Bishop of Skara (about 1012-30). He was nominally succeeded by Gotskalk, a monk of the Benedictine abbey at L√ºneburg, who never left his abbey, although he had been consecrated to the See of Skara by Archbishop Liavizo of Hamburg (1030‚Äì32). Meanwhile, Sigurd, or Sigfrid, an Englishman of Scandinavian origin and a monk of Glastonbury (?), took possession of the See of Skara about 1031, and remained there till after 1043. Although he entered into communication with Bremen and sent his relative and successor Osmund to be educated there, both Sigurd and Osmund seem to have been regarded as intruders by the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. Osmund was consecrated in Poland, and refused to acknowledge the primacy of Hamburg. In this refusal he was supported by King Anund Jacob. Consequently, when Adalvard the Elder, subdean of Bremen, who had been consecrated Bishop of Skara by Archbishop Adalbert on the death of Bishop Gotskalk, came to Skara about 1050 to take possession of his see, he was prevented from doing so, and had to wait for Osmund's departure for England in 1057 (?) before he could become Bishop of Skara de facto. Adalvard the Elder died in 1060 and was buried near the first Cathedral of St. Mary, which he had built. Acelin, dean of Bremen, was consecrated bishop in 1061, but never took possession of the see. Adalvard the younger, who had visited and buried his elder namesake in 1060, was invited on his expulsion from the See of Sigtuna in 1067 to become Bishop of Skara, but was recalled to Bremen by Archbishop Adalbert. Of the next four bishops of Skara hardly anything is known. Concerning Bishop Oedgrim the following facts are recorded. He was present at the consecration of Lund Cathedral in 1145. During his episcopate the abbey at Varnhem was founded (1150) by some Cistercians of Clairvaux who came from Alvastra. Finally in 1151 Bishop Oedgrim consecrated part of the present cathedral, which Bishop Benedict I (1158‚Äì90) enlarged and furnished. The latter also built the Churches of St. Nicholas and of St. Peter at Skara as well as many roads and bridges. Bishop Jerpulf (1191‚Äì1201) persuaded a popular assembly at Askubeck to assign to the bishop part of the tithe. Benedict II (1217‚Äì30) founded several secular canonries in 1220, and thus originated the cathedral chapter. St. Bryniolph Algotsson is the best known bishop. He studied for eighteen years at Paris, became dean of Link√∂ping, and in 1278 Bishop of Skara. He issued statutes in 1231, and composed hymns and other works, amongst them a Life of St. Helena of Sk√∂vde (Schedvia), who was murdered in 1140 and was canonized by Pope Honorius III, and whose remains were translated to Uppsala in 1164. She was also greatly venerated at Tidsvilde (Zealand) and elsewhere in Denmark. St. Bryniolph died on 6 February 1317. In 1499 Alexander VI granted leave for the translation of his relics, but St. Bryniolph was never formally canonized. Under him and his successor, Bishop Benedict III Tunnesson (1317‚Äì21), that is between 1312 and 1320, the whole of the cathedral was restored. Bishop Sven the Great (1435-48?) painted it in fresco. =15th and 16th centuries= Bishop Bryniolph III Gerlaktsson (1478‚Äì1505) regulated the frontier between his diocese and that of the Archdiocese of Lund. His successor, Bishop Vincent Hennings, was beheaded by Christian II at the Stockholm bloodbath on 8 November 1520, although he protested aloud on his way to the scaffold against the injustice of his condemnation. Then came Magnus Haraldsson (1523), whose election was not confirmed by the pope in spite of King Gustavus I Vasa's request. Johannes Franciscus de Potentia, a Franciscan, was nominated Bishop of Skara the same year by papal provision, but the king refused to receive him. Bishop Magnus Haraldsson, though at first submissive towards Gustavus I, led his diocesans to Larv to take part in the rising of 1529. He was accordingly deposed by the king, who appointed in 1530 a Protestant, Svend Jacobsson, in his place.

The ƒë√†n nguy·ªát's strings, formerly made of twisted silk, are today generally made of nylon or fishing line. They are kept at a fairly low tension in comparison to the guitar and other European plucked instruments. This, and the instrument's raised frets, allow for the bending tones which are so important to the proper interpretation of Vietnamese traditional music. Such bending tones are produced by pressing the string toward the neck rather than bending to the side. The strings are generally plucked with a small plectrum; often a plastic guitar pick is used.

It is the capital of H√† Giang Province. The city has an area of 135.33 km¬≤ and a population of 71,689 inhabitants. The population is composed of 22 different ethnicities, of which 55.7% are Kinh and T√†y people. History Up until the 19th century the settlement of V·ªã Xuy√™n, to the south of H√† Giang (chu Han: Ê≤≥Ê•ä), was the principal market town in the area. Under the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty the town of H√† Giang, in what is now Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫ District, began to grow in size. In 1842 the town was included in the former Tuy√™n Quang Province. The town became an important French military outpost after 1886.Tim Doling North East VietNam: mountains and ethnic minorities 2000 Page 98 \\"Throughout the medieval and early modern period, the largest settlement in the area was at V·ªã Xuy√™n, south of H√† Giang, but under the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty (1802-1945) the town of H√† Giang - located on the east bank of the L√¥ River in what is now the Tr·∫ßn Ph·ªß District- began to grow steadily in size. In 1842 H√† Giang was incorporated into the new Tuy√™n Quang Province, which at that time stretched north as far as the Chinese border. Following the French conquest of the area in 1886, H√† Giang became an important colonial military outpost ...\\" On August 12, 1991, the province of H√† Giang was re- established and separated from Tuy√™n Quang Province. When separated, H√† Giang Province contained 10 administrative units, and H√† Giang town became the provincial town of H√† Giang. On September 27, 2010, H√† Giang town was officially upgraded into a provincial city. In March 2014, the urban development project type II was approved by the Prime Minister in Decision No. 190, which includes the provinces of Vƒ©nh Ph√∫c, H√† Giang, and Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø, thanks to a non-refundable aid package from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). With regards to H√† Giang province, the project includes upgrading of roads, construction of 2 new bridges, and upgrading the sewage system. This investment in H√† Giang will promote economic and social sustainable development, a prerequisite for the development of the area. Administration The following administrative units are recognized as part of H√† Giang city: * Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫ Ward * Minh Khai Ward * Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i Ward * Quang Trung Ward * Ng·ªçc H√† Ward * Ph∆∞∆°ng Thi·ªán * Ph∆∞∆°ng ƒê·ªô * Ng·ªçc ƒê∆∞·ªùng Economy H√† Giang province is a highly mountainous region. Much of the province is too mountainous for agriculture, leaving much of the land covered by forests. H√† Giang's central plateau is good for growing plums, peaches, and persimmons, which the province exports. Tea is also grown. H√† Giang is one of the poorest provinces of Vietnam. Traditionally, the vast majority of its economic activity revolved around agriculture and forestry, but in recent years, there have been attempts to establish a manufacturing industry. Infrastructure in H√† Giang has seen improvement, but remains poor - roads, schools, and health services are less developed than in many other parts of Vietnam. Since the designation of Dong Van Karst Plateau Geopark in 2010, the tourism industry has been growing. Demographics Many people in H√† Giang belong to one of Vietnam's ethnic minorities. Aside from the Viet (or Kinh), the most numerous ethnic groups in H√† Giang are the T√†y, the Dao, and the Hmong. Climate Like most of northern Vietnam, H√† Giang has a dry-winter humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Cwa).

It's the capital of H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng Province and a highly industrialized province in the Hanoi Capital Region and the Red River Delta in Northern Vietnam. The name \\"H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng\\" (Êµ∑ÈôΩ) comefrom Sino-Vietnamese mean \\"ocean sun\\" in English. The city is at the midpoint between the capital Hanoi and major port Haiphong, and is part of the Northern Key Economic Zone. In 2019, Hai Duong city had a population of 507,469. Name The name first appeared officially in 1498. In feudal times, H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng indicated a vast area from east of Hanoi to the sea. This area corresponds to all of modern H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng, Haiphong, most of H∆∞ng Y√™n and the southwestern corner of Qu·∫£ng Ninh. H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng city is in the middle of this historical area and was the location of a citadel defending the capital. Because of this historical location, Th√†nh ƒê√¥ng (eastern citadel) is a common nickname of H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng. Geography H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng city is bordered to the north-east by Nam S√°ch and Thanh H√† districts, to the west by C·∫©m Gi√†ng District, and to the south by Gia L·ªôc and T·ª© K·ª≥ districts, and also a branch of the Sat River. A branch of the C√°i River (literally, \\"mother river\\" in Vietnamese) divides the city into two parts, on one side the urban area, and on the other side rural and industrial outskirts. The city is located in the centre of both the Northern Economic Area and of the Hanoi‚ÄìHaiphong‚ÄìQu·∫£ng Ninh development region as well. H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng is located from Hanoi, from Haiphong, and from Halong Bay.

Nowadays, highways make it easier to commute between Haiphong, H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng and Hanoi. Since October 2017 it takes between 45 minutes and one hour to travel from H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng to Hanoi. Administrative divisions H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng city was built in 1804, and was first called \\"Th√†nh ƒê√¥ng\\" (Sino-Vietnamese for eastern citadel), referring to the citadel east of Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. During the French colonial period, H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng was a town. Before 1968, H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng was a town in H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng Province. Between 1968 and 1996 it was the capital of H·∫£i H∆∞ng Province after the provinces of H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng and H∆∞ng Y√™n merged to form H·∫£i H∆∞ng.

Eddy sold off its match division in 1927 and it was merged with World Match Corp. Ltd., Dominion Match Co. Ltd. and Canadian Match Co. Ltd.. The company became the first manufacturer of book matches in Canada in 1929 and was the largest producer of this product in Canada. Its operations included a second plant in Mission, British Columbia. Eddy Match had a capital structure where 2/3 of the stock were held by British Match Corporation in London, England and 1/3 by Diamond Match in the United States. In the 1950s, Diamond Match sold its shares to the public in Canada by listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange. J. Alex Lawrason became President and CEO in June 1969 in Toronto, Ontario.

The original PZA Loara prototype was based on the chassis of the T-72M tank. The production version known as PZA Loara-A is based on the chassis of the PT-91 MBT. Description The system was developed in Poland in the late 1990s by RADWAR S.A. in cooperation with numerous state and industry partners. Work on the project began in 1994 with an emphasis on the PZA variant of the vehicle. A working prototype was completed by the year 2000, which was subsequently submitted for live fire trials in September. It was originally planned that the LOARA program would also include a missile- armed version of the system - called the PZR Loara - a missile-armed version of the vehicle based on the PZA and sharing approx. 70% parts commonality. The PZR was ultimately canceled. Early prototypes were built on a modified T-72M tank chassis, which saw the driver's compartment relocated to the left side of the hull, the torsion bar suspension system reinforced and the vehicle received an auxiliary power unit with larger capacity batteries necessary to operate the on-board electronics. The current production vehicle is based around the chassis of the PT-91 \\"Twardy\\" tank, and mounts a large, armored rotary turret manned by the vehicle commander and gunner/operator. The turret is a welded plate design capable of protecting the crew against small arms fire and shell splinters. The turret contains two banks (2x6) of smoke dischargers and two Oerlikon KDA 35 mm automatic cannons linked to a fire control radar(like on Flakpanzer Gepard). The KDA is license-built in Poland by Huta Stalowa Wola. It is a gas-operated weapon with a dual belt feed mechanism, driven by a laterally-mounted gas piston operating rod. The air- cooled, fluted barrel has a variable rifling twist and is equipped with a muzzle device that relays muzzle velocities to the fire control computer. The left and right cannons are not interchangeable since their feed systems require a different mounting configuration for each gun. The cannon fires the 35x228 mm round with several types of ammunition, including Ahead \\"smart\\" rounds (which have a programmable fuse and directional payload ejection capability, allowing engagement of missiles and other very small targets) and subcaliber FAPDS. The HE ammunition is stored in a magazine at the base of the turret basket and has a capacity for 2x210 rounds. Belts with armour-piercing ammunition (20 rounds per belt) are carried in large magazines on the turret exterior. The turret and gun drive systems are electrical. The Loara is an autonomous fire unit capable of performing its tasks independently or acting as a component in a wider air defence net. The system has two radars: a 3D search radar with a built-in IFF interrogator and an Ericsson Eagle Mk 1 engagement radar. The search radar has a range of 26 km and is capable of tracking and identifying up to 64 targets at once. The radar system can also be operated on the move, refreshing its data every second. The system also has a DL-1 laser range-finder, a KTVD-1 daytime TV camera as well as a SAGEM Iris FLIR giving the system both all-weather day/night capabilities and the ability to operate entirely passively in a heavily saturated ECM environment. The Loara has a reaction time of under 10 seconds; initial target scanning and acquisition while on the move is carried out by the vehicle commander by means of his stabilized panoramic 8x PSPD-1 periscope sight developed PCO S.A. The system can engage aircraft flying at very low altitudes up to 5,000 m, and flying at speeds of up to 500 m/s. It is also effective against lightly armored ground and naval targets. The PZA Loara is additionally equipped with a full NBC suite, air-conditioning of the crew compartment. Currently the only user of this system is the Polish army which ordered a small number.

Together with neighboring Ko Lanta Noi, which forms Ko Lanta archipelago and several other islands it forms the amphoe of Ko Lanta District. The island is long and wide, with an area of , and a small portion of it belongs to the Mu Ko Lanta National Park. The area was designated as the 62nd national park of Thailand in 1990. Recently, it has become well known, especially in Sweden. The island is relatively less developed with most of the accommodation available being basic bamboo huts. In 2015, a new bridge was built connecting it to the island of Ko Lanta Noi. There are very few paved roads on the island, mostly in the north, and they deteriorate gradually towards the south. Ban Saladan, the main town and port, is at the northern tip of the island and is served by ferries from Krabi, Phuket, and Phi Phi. The main beaches are on the western shores of the island, the largest being Klong Dao, Pra-Ae (Long Beach), and Klong Khong Beach. There are other, much less accessible, beaches at the southern end. Lanta escaped the worst of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Although there was widespread devastation along the west coast, significantly fewer injuries and fatalities were reported in comparison to the Phi Phi Islands.

He was a leading figure in the rebellion against President Francisco I. Madero during the Mexican Revolution. He was nephew of president Porfirio D√≠az.Henderson, Peter V.N. \\"F√©lix D√≠az\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 404. Biography F√©lix D√≠az graduated as an engineer from the Colegio Militar in 1888. Well- connected socially in Mexico City and in Veracruz, F√©lix D√≠az accumulated wealth from real estate, but his uncle Porfirio D√≠az did not include his nephew in politics, due to his \\"limitations,\\" but did give him low-level positions as inspector general of the Mexico City police force and as a deputy in the congress, which was completely controlled by D√≠az. Although F√©lix sought more powerful positions, D√≠az was not supportive, and sent him away to Chile as a Mexican consul to prevent him from running in the Oaxaca gubernatorial elections.Henderson, p. 405. F√©lix D√≠az resented the Cient√≠ficos, (\\"scientists\\") who had a powerful influence in D√≠az's government, and F√©lix allied himself with General Bernardo Reyes, the Cient√≠ficos' political rival. Reyes had been a possible candidate for the newly created office of vice president, but D√≠az blocked him and he went into exile. Some suggested F√©lix as a candidate, but D√≠az dismissed that. When Porfirio D√≠az was forced into exile by revolutionary forces in May 1911, most of his family went with him. F√©lix stayed in Mexico. In October 1912, he rose in an unsuccessful revolt against Madero, failing to inspire even those longing for the old Porfirian order from supporting him. He was jailed and sentenced to death for treason, although Madero commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Also incarcerated at the same time was General Reyes. D√≠az escaped from Lecumberri prison during La decena tr√°gica (\\"Ten Tragic Days\\"), the coup against Madero led by General Victoriano Huerta in February 1913. Reyes was killed in the fighting, but D√≠az held out in the downtown military arsenal of the Ciudadela, bombarding federal targets and the civilian population. D√≠az and Huerta came to a negotiated settlement and D√≠az signed the Pact of the Embassy (Pacto de la Embajada), facilitated by United States ambassador Henry Lane Wilson. The agreement installed Huerta as provisional President and allowed D√≠az to run as presidential candidate in the next election. Huerta did not honor his part of the agreement and sent D√≠az to Japan as an ambassador. At his return D√≠az was constantly harassed by Huerta causing him to go into exile to New York City and later Havana. He opposed the regime of Venustiano Carranza, who as head of the Constitutionalist faction of the revolution had taken power in 1915. He returned to Mexico in May 1916 and became the leader of the National Reorganizer Army (Ej√©rcito Reorganizador Nacional). In 1917 he rebelled from his base in Veracruz, issuing the Plan de Tierra Colorada. His new efforts were not successful and was forced to retreat to the south of Mexico where he officially remained in arms. In 1920, with the ouster of Carranza, D√≠az sought an opportunity to make peace with the new regime of the Sonoran generals. Interim President Adolfo de la Huerta allowed D√≠az to leave the country and even offered him 20,000 pesos. De la Huerta had already come to a peace agreement with Pancho Villa, so now with the easing of D√≠az out of the country, hardliners considered De la Huerta a reactionary.Dulles, John W.F. Yesterday in Mexico: A Chronicle of the Mexican Revolution, 1919-1936. Austin: University of Texas Press 1936, p. 71-72. However, making peace with these two potential threats to the new regime can be seen as political pragmatism. D√≠az went into exile once again, in New Orleans. In 1922, D√≠az issued a manifesto against the Constitution on 1917, but again his agitation went nowhere.Dulles, Yesterday in Mexico, p. 115. At the invitation of President L√°zaro C√°rdenas, D√≠az returned to Mexico in 1937 and settled in Veracruz, where he died on 9 July 1945.  Government of Victoriano Huerta  The commitments were not honored by Victoriano Huerta. A few months later he modified the cabinet and maneuvered to postpone or suspend the elections. To get him out of the political scene, Huerta sent Diaz to Japan on a supposed special mission. However, Diaz resided in Europe and did not go to Japan. Until Victoriano Huerta was in power, Diaz was a Victim of increasing hostilities. He, therefore, had to flee to Cuba and to the United States in October 1913.

Letyat zhuravli) is a 1957 Soviet film about World War II. It depicts the cruelty of war and the damage suffered to the Soviet psyche as a result of World War II (known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War). It was directed at Mosfilm by the Georgian-born Soviet director Mikhail Kalatozov in 1957 and stars Aleksey Batalov and Tatiana Samoilova. It was adapted by Viktor Rozov from his play. It won the Palme d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, the only Soviet film to win that award, although The Turning Point (1946) was one of eleven films awarded that year's Grand Prix, the predecessor of the Palme d'Or.Palme d'Or Synopsis Moscow, June 22, 1941, Veronika and her boyfriend Boris watch cranes fly over the city as the sun rises, then sneak back into their families‚Äô apartments. Hours later, Boris‚Äôs cousin Mark wakes him with news. The Germans have invaded. Veronika soon learns Boris volunteered for the army. Boris asks his grandmother to give Veronika her birthday gift, a stuffed squirrel toy (\\"squirrel\\" is Boris's pet name for Veronika), into which he slides a love note. Veronika arrives too late to see Boris at his apartment, but his grandmother gives Veronika the stuffed squirrel. Veronika searches for Boris at the assembly station, but misses finding him there too, as he marches off to war. Veronika remains in Moscow with her parents, who are killed in a German air raid, which also destroys their apartment building. Boris's family invites the orphaned Veronika to stay with them. Boris serves at the Front. He gets into an argument with another soldier, Volodya, who insults a photo of Veronika. Their commanding officer catches them fighting and assigns them a dangerous reconnaissance mission. Boris saves Volodya‚Äôs life, but Boris gets shot. In his final moments, he has a vision of the wedding he and Veronika never had. Back in Moscow, Boris‚Äôs cousin Mark tells Veronika he loves her, but she faithfully waits for Boris. Veronika and Mark are alone in the apartment when another air raid occurs. Mark makes a pass at her. She rebuffs him. Furious at being rejected, he rapes her. Mark shames Veronika into marrying him. She despises him, but does not tell the family about the rape, thus they believe she betrayed Boris, who they all think is still alive. To escape the German offensive, the family is relocated to Siberia. Veronika works as a nurse in a military hospital run by Boris's father Fyodor. Mark and Veronika are miserable in their marriage. When a soldier in the hospital becomes hysterical upon receiving a letter saying his girlfriend left him, Veronika rushes to get Fyodor, who is processing arriving wounded troops. She barely misses seeing the injured Volodya, who is about to be admitted to the hospital, before Fyodor says the hospital is full. Fyodor admonishes the distraught soldier to forget his unfaithful girlfriend. Veronika overhears Fyodor‚Äôs speech and becomes upset, since she appears to be such a woman. Overwhelmed with guilt, Veronika tries to throw herself in front of a train. Just before she attempts suicide, she sees a young boy about to be hit by a car and rescues him. The boy has been separated from his mother and his name is Boris. Veronika takes the boy home and looks for her squirrel toy from Boris. Boris‚Äôs sister Irina spitefully tells Veronika that Mark is giving the toy to his mistress, at her birthday party. Veronika races over to the party, where a partygoer has finally found the note Boris hid. Veronika grabs it, and Boris narrates this final tender love note to her. Fyodor learns Mark bribed his way out of being drafted into the Red Army. Fyodor realizes Mark betrayed Russia and the family, and has taken advantage of Veronika. Fyodor kicks Mark out, and Veronika is forgiven by the family for \\"betraying\\" Boris. The boy Veronika saved becomes part of the family. Later, Volodya, having recovered, comes in search of Boris's family, and tells them Boris is dead. In 1945, the war has ended and Veronika and Volodya stroll by the river back in Moscow. They are very close, but Veronika still refuses to believe Boris is dead, since Volodya was injured himself and never saw Boris die. When Boris‚Äôs unit returns, Veronika carries a huge bouquet of flowers, intending to give them to him, and hunts for him and his friend Stepan during a celebration at the train station. Veronika finds Stepan and finally learns Boris is indeed dead. Veronika stumbles in tears through the celebrating crowd. As Stepan gives a rousing speech, asserting that those who died in the war will never be forgotten, Veronika goes from grieving to handing out her flowers to the returning soldiers. When she looks up, cranes are flying again in the sky over Moscow. Reception and influence As film scholar Josephine Woll observes, the protagonist Veronika was instrumental in shaping the post-Stalinist Soviet movies by heralding more complicated, multi-dimensional celluloid heroines, as well as focusing on the impact of war on common people. It was not only Soviet audiences that accepted and sympathized with Veronika‚Äòs story. The lead actress of Cranes, the beautiful Tatiana Samoilova, who was frequently identified with her role, took Europe by storm. Following the film's victory at the Cannes Film Festival in 1958, where it earned the event‚Äòs prestigious Grand Prize, the world celebrated the film‚Äòs main protagonist, and critics hailed the production for its stunning cinematography, acting, direction, and editing. Woll notes that the French Liberation commentator, for example, approvingly contrasted Samoilova‚Äòs purity and authenticity with that of Brigitte Bardot, a Western female icon.Josephine Woll, The Cranes are Flying (London: I. B. Tauris, 2003), 77.

It is the capital and largest city of Th√°i Nguy√™n Province. The city is listed as a first class city and is the ninth largest city in Vietnam. It has long been famous throughout Vietnam for its T√¢n C∆∞∆°ng tea. In 1959, it become the site of Vietnam's first steel mill, and is now home to a large and growing major regional university complex. Geography Th√°i Nguy√™n City is located on the C·∫ßu River. It's area is approximately 189.705 km2 and the population was 420,000 in 2018. Climate History The city played an important role in Vietnam's struggles for independence during the French colonial era. The Th√°i Nguy√™n uprising in 1917 was the \\"largest and most destructive\\" anti-colonial rebellion in French Indochina between the Pacification of Tonkin in the 1880s and the Nghe-Tinh Revolt of 1930‚Äì31. In August 1917, Vietnamese prison guards mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary, the largest one in the region. With the aid of the freed inmates - common criminals as well as political prisoners - and weapons captured from the provincial arsenal, the rebels were able to take over control of local government offices. They then established a fortified perimeter, executed French officials and local collaborators, and called for a general uprising. Although they were only able to hold the city for five days, French forces were not able to pacify the surrounding countryside until six months later, leaving many casualties on both sides. During the First Indochina War, the province played an important role as a safe area (abbreviated ATK in Vietnamese for An Toan Khu, ÂÆâÂÖ®Âå∫) for the Viet Minh. In 1956 the town became the headquarters of the northernmost military region, called Viet B·∫Øc, until reunification in 1975. Originally a small township including four residential quarters, two towns, and six communes with a combined population of approximately 140,000, Th√°i Nguy√™n became a city on 19 October 1962. Before that date, the area was a part of ƒê·ªìng M√¥ commune, ƒê·ªìng H·ª∑ district. Commerce and industry Th√°i Nguy√™n City has long been famous throughout Vietnam for the quality of its green tea, with T√¢n C∆∞∆°ng Commune producing the most widely recognized brand. Since 2007 it has shipped an average of about 22,000 tonnes of tea domestically and 7,500 tonnes overseas, to Algeria, France, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Pakistan, and Taiwan. In an effort to boost exports, the city hosted its First International Tea Festival in November 2011. The effort seems to have paid off. During the first five months of 2012, it exported 49,000 tonnes, an increase of over 15% from the prior year, with Pakistan its biggest customer. In 1959, the city also became the center of a nascent metallurgical industry, with the creation of Th√°i Nguy√™n Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), thanks to its ample local resources of iron ore and coal. The new mill produced its first cast iron in November 1963. In 2009, it was converted from a wholly government-owned enterprise to a partially privatized joint-stock company. By 2011, its output reached 230,000 tonnes of pig iron and 400,000 tonnes of steel ingots. Although its primary production mills are located just south of Thai Nguyen City, it now has 17 branches and 6,000 employees, with another 8 partially owned subsidiaries in 9 northern provinces. It has won many national awards and now exports steel to Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Laos, and other countries overseas.

Schofield is one of the few leg- spinners to play Test cricket for England in twentyfirst century.  Early career born 6 October 1978, in Wardle, Rochdale, Greater Manchester, Schofield first came to prominence playing for the England Under-19 team, making his debut for them (as a batsman) at the age of 16 in April 1995. However, his career proper began in 1997, when he appeared on a number of further occasions for the Under-19s, and the following winter played for England in the Under-19s World Cup in South Africa which the team won. He finally made his first-class debut for Lancashire against Glamorgan in July 1998, although figures of 0‚Äì139 in the first innings were not the most impressive way to begin. (He claimed 2‚Äì44 in the second innings.) 1999 saw Schofield become an important member of the Lancashire side, and he played ten first-class games that season, finishing with 29 wickets at 32.79 including his first five-wicket haul: 5‚Äì66 against Durham. In 1999‚Äì2000 he had a useful tour to New Zealand and Bangladesh with England A, and his good form ‚Äì combined with the England hierarchy's Warne-inspired thirst for a leg-spinner of their own ‚Äì led to Schofield's being awarded one of the ECB's first batch of central contracts in 2000. International career In May 2000, Schofield made his Test debut against Zimbabwe at Lord's. Despite a crushing England win by an innings and 209 runs, the game was a frustrating match for the leg- spinner as Zimbabwe's ineptitude against the seamers meant that he was not called upon to bowl a ball, and he was out third ball for nought in his only innings. The second Test at Nottingham was better in terms of runs ‚Äì he made a handy 57 from number eight ‚Äì but in 18 less than controlled overs he took 0‚Äì73. In July 2007 he was picked in a preliminary 30-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in September, professing himself to have \\"worked very hard to get back into international colours\\". On 6 August 2007 Schofield was named in the full England Squad for the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship. Late career That was the end as far as Schofield's brief relationship with an England cap was concerned. He returned to his county, and though he was picked for another A tour to the West Indies in 2000‚Äì01 things started to fall apart shortly afterwards. In 2001 he took only 14 wickets at an average of over 54, though 26 wickets at 18.53 in List A cricket were a compensation, and although his average of 18.38 in 2002 looked better it was deceptive: Schofield was bowled only 122 first-class overs in total that summer. The 2003 season continued Schofield's downward slide: 15 wickets at 42.40 in first-class cricket; five at 47.60 in List A games. This, though, was as nothing when set against his miserable 2004: a career-best knock of 99 against Warwickshire could not hide the fact that he was selected for only three County Championship matches, in which he took precisely one wicket in total; and though he played ten one-day games these were almost entirely as a batsman: he bowled only 36 List A balls in 2004. At the end of the 2004 season, Lancashire released him, coach Mike Watkinson's understated remark that Schofield had \\"perhaps not reached his full potential\\" ringing in his ears. However, the player felt that he had been informed of the decision to dispense with his services too late in the year, and that this had affected his chance of finding a new employer for the following season. He brought a case for unfair dismissal against Lancashire to an employment tribunal, and in April 2005 the panel found in his favour. Meanwhile, Schofield returned to play in club cricket, for Cheshire and Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship, as well as having several games for the Durham, Sussex and Derbyshire second teams. In 2006 he played for Ormskirk Cricket Club in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition's Premier League. From late August 2006 he appeared for Surrey, though not (yet) under contract. In October 2006 he was offered a one-year contract for 2007 with Surrey and accepted the offer. He remained with Surrey until the end of the 2011 season, when he was released by the county after the club had gained promotion and won the Pro 40.

This occurs when at least one of the vehicles is unable to keep to its schedule and therefore ends up in the same location as one or more other vehicles which are supposed to be behind it. The result is unreliable service and longer and more inconsistent effective wait times than scheduled. Another unfortunate result can be overcrowded vehicles followed closely by near-empty ones. Theory A bus that is running slightly late will, in addition to its normal load, pick up passengers who would have taken the next bus if the first bus had not been late. These extra passengers delay the first bus even further. In contrast, the bus behind the late bus has a lighter passenger load than it otherwise would have, and may therefore run ahead of schedule. The classical theory causal model for irregular intervals is based on the observation that a late bus tends to get later and later as it completes its run, while the bus following it tends to get earlier and earlier. Eventually these buses form a pair, one right after another, and the service deteriorates as the headway degrades from its nominal value. The buses that are stuck together are called a bus bunch or banana bus; this may also involve more than two buses. This effect is often theorised to be the primary cause of reliability problems on bus and metro systems. Simulation studies have successfully demonstrated the extent of possible factors influencing bus bunching, and they may also be used to understand the impact of actions taken to overcome negative effects of bunching. Hypothesized causes Clumping can be caused by random heavy usage of any particular vehicle, resulting in it falling behind schedule. The leading vehicle eventually lapses towards the time slot of a later scheduled vehicle. Sometimes, the later scheduled vehicle gets ahead of its own timetable, and the two vehicles meet between their scheduled times. Sometimes one scheduled vehicle may pass another. These effects tend to accumulate, unless the later vehicle deliberately idles on stops or slows down, or the lead vehicle skips some stops where it has no drop-offs, leaving the pick-ups for the following bus. When buses clump, one can pass another on the street or road. When trains clump, this is often not possible due to the limitations of a single track in a given direction. Another cause is that some drivers are faster than others. This results in catching up on long or high-frequency routes. Corrective measures When a transit vehicle becomes overcrowded as well as delayed, the transit operator may choose to designate the vehicle as a temporary \\"express\\" trip. This means that the expedited vehicle will bypass many of its usual stops, operating on a limited stop basis, or heading non-stop directly to the route terminus. This usually entails some additional delay, needed to notify passengers already on board, and to let some of them to disembark to avoid being taken past their intended destinations. These non-express passengers, as well as others waiting to board, may be told that another less-crowded vehicle is \\"right behind them\\". This may or may not be true; in extreme cases, the following vehicle(s) may also be overcrowded or even more severely delayed. Other corrective measures include adding more vehicle trips or higher-capacity equipment. Aside from possible extra costs, the chief difficulty is in responding quickly enough to delays and overcrowding before they spontaneously dissipate. It is preferable to closely monitor transit headways and take immediate corrective measures, rather than allowing delays to \\"snowball\\", causing a near-complete breakdown of service. Clumping can be prevented or reduced as follows: *Scheduling minimum and maximum amounts of time at each stop *Scheduling some crowded runs to skip certain stops *If, on a popular route with frequent service, a crowded vehicle arrives, passengers can be urged to wait for the next vehicle, which may be less crowded. A different approach is to abandon the idea of a schedule and keep buses equally spaced by strategically delaying them at designated stops. This is used to control the buses on the campus of Northern Arizona University, where it outperforms the previously scheduled system. More efficient on-board fare collection, or prepaid fare collection, can reduce dwell time at stops and greatly speed up service. Multiple-door, level-boarding setups can also greatly reduce stop durations, as demonstrated by the best bus rapid transit (BRT) services. Heavy ridership caused by special events (such as sporting events, large concerts, inaugurations, or holiday celebrations) is even more likely to cause problems with bunching and delays. Extra service may be added, and special rules (such as waiving of fare collection) may be used to improve service. Merely adding more vehicles to the schedule without making other changes has been proven not to be a reliable solution to the problem of bunching.

It was almost due north of the city centre, and is commemorated with a small display of level crossing gates and a plaque. Known as the Stafford Road Works, it was opened by the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway in 1849 to maintain bought-in locomotives. Overview Wolverhampton works, located at Gorsebrook, north of Wolverhampton centre, became the workshop of the Northern Division of the Great Western Railway in 1854 under Joseph Armstrong who had been in charge of maintenance for the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway at Saltney. The first line arrived at Wolverhampton and the running shed was rebuilt. Locomotive repairs were concentrated in Wolverhampton, while carriage and wagon work was transferred to Saltney. Locomotives Joseph Armstrong was promoted to Swindon in 1864 and his brother George succeeded him. Wolverhampton became responsible for building standard gauge locomotives independently of Swindon and was expanded in 1858. In comparison with Swindon, Wolverhampton was frustrated by having to maintain a great variety of different locomotives from the various lines that had been taken over. Much of its work, therefore, was in rebuilding and standardisation. However, once new construction started in 1859 (with two 2-2-2s designed by Joseph Armstrong) its independence showed. This was even true of the livery; that of Swindon engines was leaf green with oak brown frames, while Wolverhampton's were dark blue-green with red-brown frames. Construction during George Armstrong's tenure consisted mainly of 0-4-2 tanks of the familiar 517 Class, and several classes of 0-6-0 saddle tanks, nearly all of which later became pannier tanks, and many of which would survive in that form into British Railways days. As the broad gauge declined and was finally abolished in 1892, Swindon naturally took over as the GWR's main \\"narrow\\" (=standard) gauge locomotive builder. When George Armstrong retired, aged 75, in 1897, Swindon influence grew stronger at Wolverhampton. After producing some 800 locomotives, all new building ceased in 1908. The Works continued to repair and overhaul all classes of locomotive, from the humble tank engine to the King Class and BR Standard locomotives, until it closed in 1964. Wolverhampton (Stafford Road) TMD GWR \\"Castle Class\\" 4-6-0 5050 \\"Earl of St Germans\\" at Wolverhampton (Stafford Road) motive power depot in December 1958. The site of the former Wolverhampton (Stafford Road) TMD today, redeveloped in the late 1960s as a light industrial estate On reaching Wolverhampton in 1854, the GWR built their own shed on the opposite side of the Stafford Road to the existing S&B; works, between the road and the LMS line to Crewe. Located opposite and accessible from Dunstall Park railway station, the shed backed onto the Stafford Road, with it throat facing Wolverhampton Low Level railway station. In 1860, the GWR added a Old Oak Common pattern turntable shed, with 28 access tracks all with their own inspection pits. Sheds nos. 2 and 3 were added in the same pattern by 1875, with all turntables across all three sheds increased to . But due to site access restrictions, sheds nos. 2 and 3 were not directly accessible from Wolverhampton Low Level. As the major depot of the region, it was constructed as a heavy maintenance repair shop, to replace the functionality of the old S&B; works. Hence under the Loans and Guarantees Act (1929): the old broad gauge sheds were demolished and replaced with new steel-framed sheds nos. 4 and 5; a new lifting and erection shop on the site of the old S&B; depot; the salted roofs and timber trusses roofs of sheds nos. 1, 2 and 3 replaced by steel supports and corrugated iron; and a new two-ramp coaling stage plus additional erected on the opposite side of the LMS line, closer to Wolverhampton Low Level. By this time the depot function of the old S&B; shed had been replaced by the new standard-pattern two-turntable Wolverhampton Oxley depot, which was on the opposite side of the line, next to the freight yards and closer to Wolverhampton Low Level. After reallocation of the depot to London Midland Region in January 1963, the decision was taken to close the now run down and highly dilapidated site, concentrating all remaining locomotives and work to Oxley. By this time sheds nos. 2 and 3 were effectively abandoned. The shed closed to all activity in September 1963, and was redeveloped as an industrial estate. References * H.

Coleman was the fourth United States Secretary of Transportation, from March 7, 1975, to January 20, 1977, and the second African American to serve in the United States Cabinet. As an attorney, Coleman played a major role in significant civil rights cases. At the time of his death, Coleman was the oldest living former Cabinet member. Early life and education  Coleman was born to Laura Beatrice (n√©e Mason) Coleman and William Thaddeus Coleman Sr. in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Coleman's mother came from six generations of Episcopal ministers, including an operator of the Underground Railroad. W.E.B. DuBois and Langston Hughes would visit the family's home for dinner. One of seven black students at Germantown High School, Coleman was suspended for cursing at a teacher after she praised his honors presentation by saying, \\"Someday, William, you will make a wonderful chauffeur.\\" When Coleman attempted to join the school's swim team he was again suspended, and the team disbanded after he returned so as to avoid admitting him, only to reform after he graduated. Coleman's swim team coach wrote him a strong letter of recommendation and he was accepted into the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a double major in political science and economics. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in history in 1941. There, he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society in 1941. Coleman was also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Coleman was accepted to the Harvard Law School but left in 1943 to enlist in the Army Air Corps, failing in his attempt to join the Tuskeegee Airmen. Instead, Coleman spent the war defending the accused in courts-martial. After the war, Coleman returned to Harvard Law, where he became the third black staff member accepted to the Harvard Law Review,William T. Coleman Jr. with Donald Bliss, Counsel for the Situation (Brookings Institution Press 2010), pages 53 & 71. and graduated first in his class and magna cum laude in 1946. Career He began his legal career in 1947, serving as law clerk to Judge Herbert F. Goodrich of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter in 1948. He was the first African American to serve as a Supreme Court law clerk. Fellow clerks, including Elliot Richardson, would have difficulty finding a restaurant where they could eat together. Coleman was hired by the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in 1949. Thurgood Marshall, then the chief counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, recruited Coleman to be one of the lead strategists and coauthor of the legal brief in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), in which the U.S. Supreme Court held racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional. He served as a member of the NAACP's national legal committee, director and member of its executive committee, and president of board of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Coleman was also a member of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Committee on Government Employment Policy (1959‚Äì1961) and a consultant to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1963‚Äì1975). Coleman served as an assistant counsel to the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy (1964), also known as the Warren Commission, on which then-Congressman Gerald Ford was a commissioner. During the Warren Commission's investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Commission received word via a backchannel that Fidel Castro, then Prime Minister of Cuba, wanted to talk to them. The Commission sent Coleman as an investigator and he met with Castro on a fishing boat off the coast of Cuba. Castro denied any involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy during Coleman's three-hour questioning. Coleman reported the results of his investigation and interview with Castro directly to Commission Chairman Earl Warren, the Chief Justice of the United States. Coleman was co-counsel to the petitioners in McLaughlin v. Florida (1964), in which the Supreme Court unanimously struck down a law prohibiting an interracial couple from living together. In 1969, he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the twenty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Coleman was also a member of the National Commission on Productivity (1971‚Äì1972). Coleman served in the boardrooms of PepsiCo, IBM, Chase Manhattan Bank, and Pan American World Airways. He was senior partner in the law firm of Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish, Levy & Coleman at the time of his appointment to the Ford Administration. =Cabinet post= Flag of the United States Secretary of Transportation President Gerald Ford appointed Coleman to serve in his Cabinet as the fourth Secretary of Transportation on March 7, 1975. During Coleman's time at the Department of Transportation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's automobile test facility at East Liberty, Ohio commenced operations, and the Department established the Materials Transportation Bureau to address pipeline safety and the safe shipment of hazardous materials. In February 1976, Coleman authorized a testing period for the supersonic Concorde jet, and flights began on After the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey banned the jet, the U.S. Supreme Court restored Coleman's authorization. In December 1976, Coleman rejected consumer activists' pressure for a federal mandate on automobile airbags and instead announced a two-year demonstration period favored by the auto industry. Coleman's tenure ended in January 1977, after Jimmy Carter won the 1976 election. =Post-Cabinet service and honors= Coleman, third from the left, being sworn into the United States Court of Military Commission Review. On leaving the department, Coleman returned to Philadelphia and subsequently became a partner in the Washington office of the Los Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny & Myers. Colman argued a total of 19 cases before the Supreme Court. He appeared for the respondent in the argument and reargument of Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985). In 1983, with the election quickly approaching, the Reagan administration stopped supporting the IRS's position against Bob Jones University that overtly discriminatory groups were ineligible for certain tax exemptions. Coleman was appointed to argue the now unsupported lower court position before the Supreme Court, and won in Bob Jones University v. United States. On September 29, 1995, Coleman was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. After the July 17, 1996, crash of TWA Flight 800, he served on the President's Commission on Airline and Airport Security. Coleman received an honorary LL.D. from Bates College in 1975. Coleman was also awarded honorary degrees from, among others, Williams College in May 1975, Gettysburg College on May 22, 2011, and Boston University in May 2012. In September 2004, President George W. Bush appointed Coleman to the United States Court of Military Commission Review. In December 2006, Coleman served as an honorary pallbearer during the state funeral of Gerald Ford in Washington, D.C.. Personal life In 1945, he married Lovida Mae Hardin. They have three children: Lovida H. Coleman; William Thaddeus Coleman III, a General Counsel of the Army under President Clinton and stepfather of Flavia Colgan; and Hardin Coleman, dean, Boston University School of Education.

His ideas on Iranian decline have affected the intellectual debates on modernity and democracy currently underway in Iran. Tabatabai's career-long research has revolved around this question: ‚ÄúWhat conditions made modernity possible in Europe and led to its abnegation in Iran?‚Äù He answers this question by adopting a ‚ÄúHegelian approach‚Äù that privileges a philosophical reading of history on the assumption that philosophical thought is the foundation and essence of any political community and the basis for any critical analysis of it as well. In 2001, in an interview with Lib√©ration, he says that political and ideological Islam is already dead, because they have no plans for modernity.

The Alpha Cast (Alpha Psi Omega's term for \\"chapter\\") was founded at Fairmont State College (now Fairmont State University) on August 12, 1925, by Prof. Paul F. Opp.Alpha Psi Omega History HARDWAY ADMINISTRATION BUILDING Historic SiteBaird's Manual of American College Fraternities 20th edition (1991) p. VII-11 Alpha Psi Omega was founded after Opp was denied charter petitions by both Theta Alpha Phi (ŒòŒëŒ¶), the National Theatre Honors Fraternity and the National Collegiate Players/Pi Epsilon Delta (Œ†ŒïŒî), which were unwilling to charter a chapter at Fairmont State College, then primarily known as a \\"teacher's college.\\" The first student members of the society were Elinor B. Watson and Robert Sloan. Membership is open to students (primarily undergraduate) who are active in collegiate/university theatre at four-year institutions (full colleges and universities). Most casts/chapters use a \\"point system\\" for determining eligibility of membership, with a certain number of points being dealt to a certain task in theatre. With some chapters there is an induction/training process, while other chapters choose members solely on merit, where the theatre experience is considered the induction process. Honorary membership may be conferred on certain individuals (usually department faculty) after obtaining permission from the National Officers.Alpha Psi Omega FAQ Delta Psi Omega National Theatre Honor Society (ŒîŒ®Œ©), Alpha Psi Omega's \\"Sister Society,\\" was founded in 1929 as the official junior-college division of Alpha Psi Omega. Both societies are governed by the same National Officers, yet have a separate coat-of-arms and induction ceremony. Delta Psi Omega is founded at two-year institutions (junior colleges/community colleges). Opp and Alpha Psi Omega were also instrumental in helping to organize the Thespian Society, now known as the International Thespian Society, the theatre honor society for high school students (also founded in 1929). With an original grant of $500, the society was able to help organize I.T.S. and help publish the first issues of the I.T.S. magazine. The International Thespian Society has since been assimilated into the Educational Theatre Association, but the influences can be seen in the similarities of both organizations' colors and induction ceremonies. Members are most commonly referred to as \\"APOs\\". However, due to some confusion with members of the national service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega, some campuses refer to their members as \\"Alpha Psis\\" or \\"AYOs\\". Members of Delta Psi Omega are commonly known as \\"DPOs\\". As was common practice in naming honor societies during that time, at the founding, Alpha Psi Omega was called \\"Alpha Psi Omega National Honorary Dramatic Fraternity\\" and used theatre-related terminology to refer to the honor society's officers and workings. Examples include: * President/National President ‚Äì Director / Grand Director * Vice-President/National Vice-President ‚Äì Stage Manager / Grand Stage Manager * Secretary-Treasurer/ National Secretary-Treasurer ‚Äì Business Manager / Grand Business Manager * Chapter ‚Äì Cast * Inductees ‚Äì Understudies * National Officers ‚Äì Grand Cast * National Convention ‚Äì Grand Rehearsal In 1997, upon pressure of anti-fraternity sentiments nationwide, the National Officers decided to update the public titles of the organization. This changed the official name of the society from \\"Alpha Psi Omega National Honorary Dramatic Fraternity\\" to \\"Alpha Psi Omega National Theatre Honor Society.\\" The open motto of Alpha Psi Omega, written in ancient Greek upon their coat-of- arms, is \\"seek a life useful\\" (\\"Œ±ŒπœÑŒµŒπœÑŒµ œàœçœáŒ∑ŒΩ œâœÜŒµŒªŒπŒºŒøŒΩ\\"). The official colors of Alpha Psi Omega and Delta Psi Omega are moonlight blue and bastard amber, from the names of the shades of lighting gels commonly used in theatre lighting. The official magazine of Alpha Psi Omega/Delta Psi Omega is The Playbill.Alpha Psi Omega Playbill Alpha Psi Omega/Delta Psi Omega has a total of 1048 chapters on record, making it one of the largest Greek Letter Organizations in the world.

At the outbreak of the English Civil War he supported the Royalist cause and was killed at the Battle of Edgehill. Life Edmund Verney was the son of Sir Edmund Verney of Pendley Manor near Tring, Buckinghamshire and his third wife Mary Blakeney. He was the grandson of Hon. Elizabeth Verney, second daughter of the first Baron Braye. He had two elder half-brothers Sir Francis Verney who died in 1615, and Ambrose Turvile who died in 1628, and two elder half-sisters on his mother's side, Ann Turvill (who married Sir John Leeke of Edmonton), and Ursula St. Barbe, who married her stepbrother Sir Francis Verney.W.H. Rylands (ed.), The Visitation of the County of Buckingham made in 1634 by John Philipot and William Riley, Harleian Society Volume LVIII (for 1909) (London 1909), Verney, p.122-23. Knighted by King James I in 1611, Edmund was sent to Madrid, and returned to join the household of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, to which his uncle Francis Verney was one of the falconers.Frances Parthenope Verney, Memoirs of the Verney Family During the Civil War (Longmans, Green & Co., London 1892), Vol. 1, p. 69 ff., at p. 70.

Cadell & W. Davies, London 1809), Vol. 1 pp. 364-400, at p. 393. Upon Henry's death in 1612, Edmund became a gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles, Duke of York, later Charles I. From 1620 he made his family home at Claydon House, Middle Claydon, Buckinghamshire (which the Giffard family had held by lease from the Verneys'Parishes : Middle Claydon', in William Page (ed.), A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 4 (London, 1927), pp. 32-35..

Verney, Memoirs of the Verney Family Vol. 1, Chapters 1 and 2, and at p.33-34. His financial sense was poor, and he was severely indebted by the early 1620s. In 1623, he accompanied Charles and the Duke of Buckingham to Spain to court the Infanta Maria. While there, he protected a dying Englishman from a Catholic priest by punching the priest in the face, which did not endear him to the Spaniards. Upon his return, he was elected Member of Parliament for Buckingham in 1624, and for New Romney in 1625. After the coronation of Charles that year, he was appointed Knight Marshal of England for life, the duties of which office required him to be extensively at court. He was returned for Aylesbury in 1629. Despite his income from the Knight Marshalsy, several business ventures ended in failure, and his debts were largely unrelieved. With the approach of the English Civil War, he found himself in a painful conflict. While personally loyal to the King, he resisted the Laudian religious policies. Verney was returned to the Short Parliament and then the Long Parliament as member for Wycombe, and often found himself in opposition to the King. Upon the outbreak of war, Verney remained true to his master and friend, King Charles, while his eldest son Ralph joined the Parliamentary forces. Made standard-bearer of the royal army, Verney was killed at the Battle of Edgehill. According to the tradition of his family, his body was never identified, except for his severed hand, found still grasping the banner.

It opened in December 1999 and is one of three casino hotels in the city. There are four in the Detroit‚ÄìWindsor area, including the Ontario-owned Caesars Windsor. Detroit is one of the largest American cities and metropolitan regions to offer casino resort hotels. The $825 million MotorCity complex incorporates a historic building that once housed the Wagner Baking Company, makers of the brand Wonder Bread. The complex houses a 100,000 square-foot casino with approximately 2,800 slot machines, 59 table games, and two poker rooms; a 13,000-square-foot spa; 67,000 square feet of meeting and convention space; Sound Board, a live music theater with a capacity of 2,400 people; and a luxury hotel with 400 guest rooms and suites. Opened by Mandalay Resort Group, MotorCity Casino Hotel was later purchased by Marian Ilitch of IH Gaming (Detroit Entertainment, LLC). Architecture The building, located on Grand River Avenue at the Lodge Freeway (M-10), was designed c.1915 by architect Walter W. Ahlschlager, who later designed the Peabody Hotel in Memphis in 1926 and New York City's Roxy Theatre in 1927, among other notable structures. As part of the property's renovation as a casino, the decorative terra cotta elements of the former bread bakery were restored to their original condition, preserving the signature features of the historic building. Chip Foose, a custom car designer and television personality, was a member of the design team. He is credited as instrumental in the property's unique look. Foose's influence is reflected strongly in the sweeping roof design, a 304-foot-long stainless steel undulating ribbon produced by Quality Metalcraft Inc., under direction of Michael Chetcuti. It is considered a reference to Detroit's automotive history. Foose says it was inspired by the door molding on a classic 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air. The roof ranges in height from 3.5 feet to 10 feet and weighs over 181 tons. Casino The casino features more than 100,000 square feet of gaming space: it includes approximately 2,800 slot machines (160 of them located in smoke-free gaming areas); approximately 59 table games; and two poker rooms. The interior of the casino is notable for Foose's design of the ceiling, which features large, extruded aluminum-like beams and thousands of multi-color LEDs that can display video with more than 256,000 colors. The style is referred to as \\"Future Retro,\\" and the ceiling resembles a giant custom car radiator. Other elements of design referring to Detroit's robust automotive heritage include hot rod flame carpeting. The entrances to the smoke-free slot room resemble the front-end grilles of a 1938 Buick Century and a 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr. In a nod to Detroit's Motown and other musical roots, the pillars of the Amnesia event space are designed to resemble bass clefs. The five-bar musical staff is used as a design element on items ranging from slot machine bases to signage throughout the property. Zebrawood, a rich wood often used in guitar construction, is incorporated into the hotel lobby and guestrooms. Bonus TV MotorCity Casino Hotel features a bonus system operated through custom flat-screen installations mounted above slot machines that allow interaction with customers. Through the system, the casino can award instant bonuses to players on their birthday, notify winners of special promotions, and more. Sound Board With a capacity of 2,400, Sound Board is a performance venue, and Detroit's only casino theater. Since opening with a concert by Detroit native Anita Baker on October 23, 2008, Sound Board has hosted entertainment and musical performers such as Robin Williams, BB King, Jay Leno, Mot√∂rhead, Patti LaBelle, Tony Bennett, Aretha Franklin, Eminem, Donna Summer, Etta James, Monica, Gladys Knight, Tamar Braxton, P. Diddy, and Diana Ross. The theater also hosts events such as live boxing and major product launches. Advanced sound, lighting, and video equipment includes a d&b; Line Array Sound System with Yamaha PM7 Rivage audio consoles, an HES Road Hog Full Boar lighting console, more than 50 moving lights and DL-3 lighting fixtures. Hotel Opened in November 2007, the MotorCity Casino Hotel has 400 rooms and suites. Dining MotorCity offers a variety of dining options:http://www.motorcitycasino.com/Dining.aspx?Page=Overview *Located on the 16th floor, Iridescence is a restaurant serving Modern American cuisine. *The casino buffet, the Assembly Line, offers nightly dinner themes such as Mediterranean Night, Barbecue Night, Caribbean Night, Steak House Night, Italian Night, Soul Food Night, and the Monday Night Seafood Buffet. *The Lodge Diner offers comfort food such as chicken and waffles and pot roast. *Grand River Deli & Burgers features sandwiches, burgers, salads, and soups. *The Detroit-based pizza chain Little Caesars has an outlet in the building.

On 5 September 1954, immediately after takeoff from Shannon Airport, the Super Constellation Triton ditched on a mudbank in the River Shannon. 28 people were killed in the accident. It was caused by an unexpected re-extension of the landing gear, possibly compounded by pilot error.  Triton disaster  The Lockheed Super Constellation Triton (registration ) was piloted by Adriaan Viruly, one of the airline's most senior pilots. After a refuelling stop at Shannon, the plane took off for the transatlantic leg of the flight at about 02:40. There were 46 passengers and ten crew on board. Shortly after takeoff, the pilot reduced power from maximum to METO (Maximum Except Take Off). The pilot was unaware that the landing gear was not retracted, and as result the aircraft descended to touch down in the Shannon estuary. It turned around on impact and broke into two sections. The aircraft was partially submerged, and at least one of the fuel tanks had ruptured during the crash. The fuel fumes rendered many passengers and crew unconscious, who then drowned in the rising tide. In the end, three crew-members (all the cabin crew) and 25 passengers perished. Even though the crash occurred less than one minute after the plane took off from Shannon Airport, airport authorities remained unaware of the disaster until the mud-caked third pilot (navigator) of the craft, Johan Tieman, stumbled into the airport and reported, \\"We've crashed!\\" That was 2¬Ω hours after the plane fell. Mr. Tieman had swum ashore and floundered painfully across the marshes to the airport, whose lights were clearly visible from the scene of the crash. It was not until 7 o'clock in the morning - 4¬Ω hours after the crash - that the first launch reached the survivors, who were huddled on a muddy flat in the river.  Cause of the accident  The official investigation concluded that the accident was caused by an unexpected re- extension of the landing gear and the captain's incorrect behaviour in this situation. Viruly, who had been only one year from retirement, rejected the responsibility for the crash and was bitter about his subsequent treatment by KLM. In an interview he later stated that there simply had not been enough time to react.

It is the eighth film in Hammer's Dracula series, and the seventh and final one to feature Christopher Lee as Dracula. The film was also the third to unite Peter Cushing as Van Helsing with Lee, following Dracula (1958) and Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972).  Plot  = Introduction = In 1974, a Secret Service agent (Maurice O'Connell) barely escapes from an English country house, in which satanic rituals are celebrated. Before he dies of his wounds, he reveals to his superiors that four prominent members of society ‚Äì a government minister, a peer, a general and a famous scientist ‚Äì are involved in the cult, led by Chin Yang (Barbara Yu Ling). Photos of the four dignitaries taken by the agent are developed, and a fifth photo, apparently showing an empty doorway, is assumed to be a mistake. In order to avoid any reprisals by the minister, secret service official Colonel Mathews (Richard Vernon) calls in Scotland Yard's Inspector Murray (Michael Coles) to work on the case independently. Murray (who had appeared in the preceding Dracula film) suggests consulting noted occult expert Professor Lorrimer Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). = At the house = The cult kidnaps the Secret Service secretary Jane (Valerie Van Ost), who is later bitten by Dracula (Christopher Lee). Murray, Secret Service agent Torrence (William Franklyn) and Van Helsing's granddaughter Jessica (Joanna Lumley) arrive at the country house. They separate; Murray and Torrence investigate inside the house, where they meet Chin Yang. Jessica enters the house through the cellar, where she finds Jane chained to a wall; she is revealed to be a vampire. The ensuing commotion awakens other female vampires who are likewise imprisoned, but they attempt to feed on Jessica. The agents hear Jessica's screams and come to her rescue. Murray kills Jane with a stake, and he escapes the grounds with Jessica and Torrence. Van Helsing visits his scientist friend, Julian Keeley (Freddie Jones), whom he recognized among the four conspirators. The mentally unstable Keeley is involved in bacteriological research designed to create a virulent strain of the bubonic plague. Van Helsing is shot by a guard and passes out. When he revives, Keeley's dead body hangs from the ceiling, and the plague bacillus is gone. Keeley referred to the 23rd of the month, which Van Helsing discovers is the \\"Sabbath of the Undead\\". Keeley's research notes lead Van Helsing to the reclusive property developer D. D. Denham, who funded Keeley's research. Van Helsing speculates that the fifth photo of an empty doorway may actually have been of Dracula, whose image cannot be captured; he suggests that Dracula wants to exact revenge on humanity. Van Helsing visits Denham in his headquarters (built on the church yard where Dracula died in the previous film) and discovers that he is actually Count Dracula. He tries to shoot Dracula with a silver bullet, but is beaten by the Count's conspirators. Dracula decides that killing Van Helsing would be too simple and has him moved to the country house. Jessica, Murray, Mathews and Torrence, while observing the country house, are attacked by snipers. Torrence and Mathews are killed, and Murray and Jessica are captured. Murray awakes in the cellar and escapes the clutches of Chin Yang, revealed to be a vampire herself. After staking her through the heart with a mallet, he destroys the other female vampires with clear running water from the fire sprinkler system. = Denouement = Dracula arrives at the house with Van Helsing. He announces to his henchmen that Jessica will be his consort, uncorrupted by the plague that his \\"four horsemen\\" ‚Äì including Van Helsing ‚Äì will carry out into the world. The conspirators, who had considered the plague a threat not to be used, begin to question their master. Dracula's hypnotic command brings them back into his control. He commands John Porter (Richard Mathews) to break the vial, releasing the bacteria and immediately infecting the minister. Murray overpowers a guard in the computer room. The guard's metal baton smashes a computer panel causing an explosion that starts a fire and unlocks the ritual room. Two uninfected conspirators escape, Murray rescues Jessica, and the infected minister and the plague bacteria burn in the fire. Dracula attacks Van Helsing, but his prey escapes through a window into the woods. Van Helsing lures Dracula into a hawthorn bush where he is entangled. Van Helsing grabs a fence post and drives it through his heart. Dracula disintegrates into ashes. Van Helsing retrieves Dracula's ring from the ashes.  Cast  * Christopher Lee as Count Dracula / D.D.

D. 1972, the main change being Joanna Lumley playing a more mature version of Jessica Van Helsing, as compared to Stephanie Beacham. Work began on what was tentatively titled Dracula is Dead...and Well and Living in London in November 1972. The title was a parody of the stage and film musical revue Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, but Lee was not amused. Speaking at a press conference in 1973 to announce the film, Lee said: > I'm doing it under protest... I think it is fatuous. I can think of twenty > adjectives ‚Äì fatuous, pointless, absurd. It's not a comedy, but it's got a > comic title. I don't see the point. The film was eventually retitled The Satanic Rites of Dracula. The French title, Dracula vit toujours √† Londres, remains closer to what was initially planned, as it can be translated by Dracula is Still Living in London. In the United States, the film was distributed in 1979 by Dynamite Entertainment in a heavily edited version titled Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride. The film itself is a mixture of horror, science fiction and a spy thriller, with a screenplay by Don Houghton, a veteran of BBC's Doctor Who. The original score was composed by television composer John Cacavas. As film historian Jonathan Rigby has observed, the film \\"wrapped on 3 January 1973, 15 years to the day since the original [Hammer] Dracula wrapped.\\"Rigby, Jonathan (2015). English Gothic: Classic Horror Cinema 1897-2015, Signum Books. p. 247. This was the final Hammer film that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing would make together. The two stars would eventually reunite one more time in House of the Long Shadows, ten years later.  Critical reception  AllMovie called it the \\"least interesting\\" film in the Hammer Dracula series. Time Out wrote, \\"a lot of weak action scenes and weaker lines, but still a vast improvement on Dracula A.D. 1972.\\"  See also  * Vampire film  References   External links  * * Category:English-language films Category:1973 horror films Category:British science fiction horror films Category:Hammer Film Productions horror films Category:Dracula films Category:Films directed by Alan Gibson Category:Films set in 1974 Category:Films about Satanism Category:British supernatural thriller films Category:British films Category:Gothic horror films Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios Category:Films shot in Hertfordshire Category:Films shot in London Category:Dracula (Hammer film series) ","title":"The Satanic Rites of Dracula"},{"id":"2543743","text":"Clearance Diving Team refers to a team of Clearance divers, originally specialist naval divers who used explosives underwater to remove obstructions to make harbours and shipping channels safe to navigate, but later the term \\"clearance diver\\" was used to include other naval underwater work.

He spent most of the First Civil War as a colonel in Lord Fairfax's northern parliamentarian army, and is known to have fought at Adwalton Moor in 1643 and possibly at Marston Moor in 1644. He was a member of Philip Nye's Hull congregation.Peacey J., The Regicides and the Execution of Charles 1, page 145 In February 1645 he took up a new command in the New Model Army. In 1649, appointed to the High Court of Justice at the trial of King Charles, he was one of the signatories of the King's death warrant. At the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, because of his act of regicide he was, although by then dead, a named exception in the general pardon (Act of Oblivion, section XXXVIII), which meant that any property that was held by the beneficiaries of his estate could be confiscated.

As a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin, it is used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, in particular, species of staphylococci that are resistant to other penicillins. Nafcillin is considered therapeutically equivalent to oxacillin, although one retrospective study found greater rates of hypokalemia and acute kidney injury in patients taking nafcillin compared to patients taking oxacillin. Indications Nafcillin is indicated in the treatment of staphylococcal infections, except those caused by MRSA. Retrieved on July 10, 2009. Freely available with registration. U.S. clinical practice guidelines recommend either nafcillin or oxacillin as the first-line treatment of choice for staphylococcal endocarditis in patients without artificial heart valves. Side-effects As with all penicillins, serious life-threatening allergic reactions can occur. Milder side-effects include: * HypokalemiaJA Mohr. (1979). Nafcillin-associated hypokalemia.

Several drugs with a narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and nifedipine, are metabolized by CYP2C9. Nafcillin contains salts added as stability media.

The modern border between Wales and England is shown in purple. Pengwern was a Brythonic settlement of sub-Roman Britain situated in what is now the English county of Shropshire, adjoining the modern Welsh border. It is generally regarded as being the early seat of the kings of Powys before its establishment at Mathrafal, further west, but the theory that it may have been an early kingdom (or a sub-kingdom of Powys itself) has also been postulated. Its precise location is uncertain. History and legend Nothing is known about the foundation of Pengwern, although according to Welsh tradition it was part of the Welsh kingdom of Powys in the early Middle Ages. Early Powys, much larger in extent than the later medieval kingdom, seems to have roughly coincided with the territory of the Celtic Cornovii tribe whose civitas capital or administrative centre was Viroconium Cornoviorum (now Wroxeter). The exploits of Cynddylan, as imagined around the ninth century, are told in the Old Welsh Canu Heledd (a cycle of poems named after Cynddylan's sister), possibly dating from the ninth century but not recorded until later, and this material situates Cynddylan's seat at Pengwern. These relate to a further cycle of heroic and elegiac poetry concerning early Powys and the Hen Ogledd known as Canu Llywarch Hen. =Possible locations= A number of places still identifiable in the Shropshire landscape today are mentioned alongside Pengwern in this poetry. The exact location of Llys Pengwern - the Court of Pengwern - is not known, and the problem is compounded by the fact that several other Pengwerns exist in Wales (e.g. near Denbigh in north Wales). A tradition, recorded by Giraldus Cambrensis in the late 12th century, associates it with the site of modern Shrewsbury (although that town has been known as Amwythig in Welsh since the Middle Ages). A number of alternative locations have been proposed. A more recent suggestion is the Berth, a dramatic hillfort at Baschurch, but the archaeological evidence shows only the Iron Age fort with possible Roman reuse.Newman, John; Nikolaus Pevsner, Shropshire (Buildings of England). New Haven: Yale University Press 2006, , p. 136 Wroxeter, the former Roman town of Viroconium Cornoviorum lies in proximity to these places. Archaeological evidence suggests that Wroxeter continued in use after the Roman withdrawal and was only finally abandoned in about 520 when it had become indefensible as the last vestiges of Romano- British central government broke down. Another theory is that the earthworks under Whittington Castle may be Pengwern. =Conflict with Northumbria= Cynddylan apparently joined forces with king Penda of Mercia to protect his realm, and together they fought against the increasingly powerful Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. It was here that their mutual enemy, king Oswald was slain. This seems to have bought a period of peace until Penda's death when a Northumbrian raiding party led by Oswald's brother Oswiu of Northumbria overran Cynddylan's palace at Llys Pengwern in a surprise attack. Caught completely off guard and without defence the royal family, including the king, were slaughtered, according to the poetry commemorating the tragedy. Princess Heledd was the only survivor and fled to western Powys. After this the region associated with Pengwern seems to have been shared between Mercia and Powys; part of it remained in Welsh hands until the reign of Offa of Mercia and the construction of his dyke. Part of it consisted of the Anglian sub-kingdom of the Magons√¶te. Later usage In Shrewsbury there is the Pengwern Boat Club on the banks of the River Severn, opposite The Quarry park, as well as other shops and businesses that use the name.

Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 36 (1966) He began to claim that he could enter trances in which he would be possessed by the Holy Spirit, allowing God the Father to speak through him.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 36 (1966) It does not appear that Yang truly believed that this was occurring, but that he instead acted as such in service of his own ambitions, as while speaking as God Feng necessarily possessed greater authority than even Hong Xiuquan.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 36-37 (1966) Upon Hong and Feng's return in the summer of 1849, they investigated Yang's claims and recognized them as genuine.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 37 (1966) From May to November 1850, Yang once again claimed to be deaf and mute.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 38 (1966) Once he recovered, Yang alleged that God was angered that Hong Xiuquan was not being allowed to establish the kingdom of God on Earth and sought to punish mankind with disease.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 39 (1966) According to this tale, only by suffering his illness was Yang able to redeem others.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 39 (1966) In 1850, perhaps in service of his political ambitions, he began to claim that he could miraculously heal true believers. Taiping Rebellion He was an early participant in the rebellion and rose quickly to prominence; in 1851, when Hong Xiuquan took the title of Heavenly King for himself, he made Yang, in spite of having no military knowledge or experience, commander-in-chief of the army. Yang was further named \\"East King\\", in keeping with three other leaders of the rebellion who were given titles as \\"kings\\" of the four-quarters of the Heavenly Kingdom. In 1851, Yang announced a vision in which it was revealed that there were traitors in the highest levels of the movement, and two years later that words of the Eastern King, that is, Yang himself, were divine. He devised an extensive network of spies to root out the intrigues of loyalists in the kingdom. Shrewd, ruthless, and ambitious, Yang ultimately proved himself to be a brilliant strategist and organizer, as well as the administrative mastermind of the Taiping Movement.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 35, 190 (1966) By the 1850s, Yang had become the most powerful leader of the Taiping Rebellion.Teng in Eminent Chinese, p. 886-87. With this presumed divine guidance, Taiping troops captured the city of Nanjing (Nanking), which became the capital of the Heavenly Kingdom in 1853. Yang took control of the city. He disciplined the troops after an initial period of violence and slaughter by declaring that he would execute any officer who entered a private home. City residents were ordered to return to work. Men and women were required to live separately, and were prohibited from walking together or even speaking to each other (there continued to be male and female military units). As Hong, the Heavenly King, became less interested in politics and more interested in his harem, he named Yang as prime minister of the Heavenly Kingdom. Many of the basic laws and regulations were issued during this period of Yang's control.Teng in Eminent Chinese, p. 887. In August 1856, Yang defeated the government troops besieging Nanking. He first led them to divide their forces by forcing them to send relief forces to other cities, then sent all his own troops against them in a massed attack. Arrogance over victory, however, led to his downfall.Teng in Eminent Chinese, p. 887. Yang clashed with Hong over the rebellion's policies and views toward Confucianism and iconoclasm; Yang believed that Confucian morality was essentially positive and that its basic tenets were compatible with the rebellion's interpretation of Christianity and that images of dragons were not sacrilegious. Hong, however, rejected this notion and believed that Confucianism ought to be eradicated, as it was the work of the devil. Fall Yang plotted to take the throne. Shortly before seeking a title commiserate with Hong Xiuquan's, Yang dispatched Wei Changhui, Shi Dakai, and Qin Rigang to separate provinces.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 237 (1996) Hong, viewing Yang's request as treasonous, alerted the three generals to return at once. Meanwhile, Yang demanded to be called Wansui (Ten Thousand Years), a title reserved for the emperor (Hong had assumed it in 1852). Wei returned to Nanjing with three thousand troops on September 1, 1856 and found that Qin Rigang had already arrived. In consultation with Hong Xiuquan and his allies, the two generals decided not to wait for Shi Dakai's arrival.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 242 (1996) Instead, they and their troops immediately stormed Yang's palace and slew him before he could escape. They then slaughtered his family and followers within the palace, despite having agreed with Hong that only Yang was to die. At this point, six thousand of Yang's followers remained in Nanjing.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 242-43 (1996) Yang's remaining followers in the capital were all systemically slaughtered over the next three months.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 243-44 (1996) Within a few years, the fortunes of the Taiping Rebellion declined as the rebellion's leaders became involved in the ensuing conspiracies and intrigues.Teng in Eminent Chinese, p. 887.

Released on October 2, 1916, it stars Chaplin in the role of assistant to the pawnshop owner, played by Henry Bergman. Edna Purviance plays the owner's daughter, while Albert Austin appears as an alarm clock owner who watches Chaplin in dismay as he dismantles the clock; the massive Eric Campbell's character attempts to rob the shop. This was one of Chaplin's more popular movies for Mutual, mainly for the slapstick comedy he was famous for at the time. Synopsis Chaplin plays an assistant in a pawnshop run by Henry Bergman. He goes about his job in the usual comic Chaplin manner: insulting various eccentric customers and dusting an electric fan while it is running. Quarreling over a ladder, Chaplin engages in a slapstick battles with his fellow pawnshop assistant and is fired. The pawnbroker gives Charlie a second chance because of his \\"eleven children\\"‚Äîa fiction which Charlie has hastily invented for the occasion. In the kitchen Charlie flirts with the pawnbroker's attractive daughter, helping her dry dishes by passing them through a clothes wringer. When a customer brings in an alarm clock to be pawned, Chaplin engages in one of his most famous solo sustained comedy bits: He thoroughly examines the clock as if he were a physician and a jeweler. He disassembles the clock piece by piece, damaging it beyond repair, and carefully puts the pieces into the man's hat. He then sorrowfully informs him that the clock can not be accepted. A crook enters the store and pretends he wants to buy diamonds. Charlie, who has hidden in a trunk after another raucous dispute with his co-worker, spots the man trying to open the pawnshop's vault. Charlie emerges from the trunk, knocks the armed thief out. Charlie is congratulated by the pawnbroker and embraced by his daughter for his bravery and good deed. The role of the pawnshop proprietor was Henry Bergman's first major appearance in a Chaplin film. (He had played a minor, uncredited role as an old man in The Floorwalker earlier in 1916.) Bergman would work closely with Chaplin until his death in 1946.

King Tau, a warrior who reigned around 1660. He fought many battles and consolidated the Barolong tribe to become a very strong kingdom. He had many wives and begot many sons and daughters. The prominent four sons are Ratlou, Tshidi, Seleka and Rapulana. The Barolong tribe later used the names of the warrior King Tau's sons as their clan names. The Barolong tribe spread across the regions covering Botswana (erstwhile Bechuanaland), through to Gauteng Province (erstwhile Transvaal), Northwest Province, Northern Cape Province (erstwhile Cape Province) and Free State in the current dispensation. Its important to note that King Tau‚Äôs first-born Son was Seleka, but some disputed this as Ratlou was the youngest bit of Royal lineage, hence he was considered first-born due to this dispute, Ratlou and his followers, resolved to reside in Ganyesa and reigned over vast area in Vryburg and surrounding areas through kgosikgolo (paramount chiefs) Seitshiro, Moshewa, Matlakoe, Gontse, Moshwete....in that order.

It is important to note that Moroka was not the Son of Koikoi/Mpolokang but his younger brother and therefore actual Regent for a much younger, Modimogale-a-Mpolokang. This is noted by Dr Silas Molema ‚ÄòChief Moroka, The Life and Times‚Äô. It is important to note that Samuel Moroka was banished to British Bechuanaland after the death/murder of co-claimant to throne Tshipinare (1884). Samuel Moroka and his followers eventually settled in Matsiloje, British Bechuanaland, where currently his descendants are settled with their leader Moipolai. The followers and descendants of Tshipinare remain in Thaba Nchu and reside with their leader a descendant of Tshipinare, Kgosi Moroka.

The Barolong chiefs, Moroka (James Moroka) and Dr Silas Molema (Molema's are the uncles of the Barolong boo rra Tshidi), played a key role in formation of the liberation movement (African National Congress).

While similar sounds coming from multiple sources can occur naturally, as in the case of a choir or string orchestra, it can also be simulated using an electronic effects unit or signal processing device. When the effect is produced successfully, none of the constituent sounds are perceived as being out of tune. It is characteristic of sounds with a rich, shimmering quality that would be absent if the sound came from a single source. The shimmer occurs because of beating. The effect is more apparent when listening to sounds that sustain for longer periods of time. The chorus effect is especially easy to hear when listening to a choir or string ensemble. A choir has multiple people singing each part (alto, tenor, etc.). A string ensemble has multiple violinists and possibly multiples of other stringed instruments. Terminology It is sometimes called a chorusing, choruser or chorused effect. On accordion, it is called a \\"musette\\" or \\"wet\\" sound.  Acoustically created  Although most acoustic instruments cannot produce a chorus effect by themselves, some instruments (particularly, chordophones with multiple courses of strings) can produce it as part of their own design. The effect can make these acoustic instruments sound fuller and louder than by using a single tone generator (b.e.: a single vibrating string or a reed). Some examples: *Piano ‚Äì Each hammer strikes a course of multiple strings tuned to nearly the same pitch (for all notes except the bass notes). Professional piano tuners carefully control the mistuning of each string to add movement without losing clarity. However, in some poorly-cared instruments (like the honky-tonk pianos), the effect is more prominent. *Santur (and similar coursed-hammered dulcimers) ‚Äì As well as on the piano, the player can strike (by using a pair of manual hammers instead) a course of multiple strings tuned to nearly the same pitch. As the instrument is frequently tuned by the musicians themselves (rather than by professional tuners), the chorus effect is more easily heard than on the piano. *12-string guitar, bajo sexto and Greek bouzouki ‚Äì Courses with pairs of strings, tuned in octaves and unisons, create a distinctive complex shimmer. In the 12-string guitar, this effect is often accentuated by the use of open and modal tunings, such as open-G and DADGAD. *Colombian tiple, guitarr√≥n chileno and tricordia ‚Äì Courses of 3 (or more) strings, tuned in octaves and unisons, create a more complex shimmer and a fuller effect. *Mandolin, lute and oud ‚Äì Courses with pairs of identically-tuned strings, as opposed to octaves and unisons on the 12-string guitar. *Accordion ‚Äì two or three reed blocks tuned to nearly the same pitch, but with one a bit sharp, produce a unique and distinctive \\"musette\\" sound exclusive to the accordion, colloquially called a \\"wet\\" sound. *Pipe organ ‚Äì The voix c√©leste [Fr.] (heavenly voice) is an organ stop consisting of either one or two ranks of pipes slightly out of tune. The term celeste refers to a rank of pipes detuned slightly so as to produce a beating effect when combined with a normally tuned rank. It is also used to refer to a compound stop of two or more ranks in which at the ranks are detuned relative to each other.Encyclopedia of Organ Stops, Celeste . However, while the open strings of a standard-tuned guitar (or any single-stringed instrument like ukuleles, banjos, etc.) can't produce any chorus effect, it can also be obtained by the use of alternative tunings (such as the unisons-and-octaves-only \\"ostrich tuning\\" by Lou Reed); by playing chords or fingerings with \\"redundant\\" notes (like playing the open high E string and the same \\"E\\" note on the 5th fret of the B string); and/or by using extended techniques like bending while playing a note (like playing the 5th fret on the 2nd string and, simultaneously, playing a full-tone bending in the 7th fret on the 3rd string). Ensembles of instruments and voices can produce a natural chorus effect, such as with a string orchestra or choir. Electronic effect Example of an Electro-Harmonix Small Clone chorus pedal The chorus effect can be simulated by a range of electronic and digital effects units and signal processing equipment, including software effects. The signal processor may be software running on a computer, software running in a digital effect processor, or an analog effect processor. If the processor is hardware-based, it may be packaged as a pedal, a rack-mount module, a table- top device, built into an instrument amplifier (often an acoustic guitar amplifier or an electric guitar amplifier), or even built into some electronic instruments, such as synthesizers, electronic pianos and Hammond organs. Regardless of the technology or form factor, the processor achieves the effect by taking an audio signal and mixing it with one or more delayed, pitch- modulated copies of itself. The pitch of the added voices is typically modulated by an LFO, which makes the overall effect similar to that of a flanger, except with longer delays and without feedback. In the case of the synthesizer, the effect can be achieved by using multiple, slightly detuned oscillators for each note, or by passing all the notes played through a separate electronic chorus circuit. Stereo chorus effect processors produce the same effect, but it is varied between the left and right channels by offsetting the delay or phase of the LFO. The effect is thereby enhanced because sounds are produced from multiple locations in the stereo field. Used on instruments like \\"clean\\" (undistorted) electric guitar and keyboards, it can yield very dreamy or ambient sounds. Commercial chorus effect devices often include controls that enable them to be used to also produce delay, reverberation, or other related effects that use similar hardware, rather than exclusively as chorus effects. In spite of the name, most electronic chorus effects do not accurately emulate the acoustic ensemble effect. Instead, they create a constantly moving electronic shimmer. Some pitch shift pedals create a slightly detuned unison effect which is more similar to the acoustic chorus sound. = Notable electronic chorus devices = Although the electronic chorus effect can be obtained by the multiple ways mentioned above, some devices have acquired a high status among musicians, especially in the \\"effect pedal\\" form. A BOSS CE-3 chorus pedal from 1984. * Boss CE-1 ‚Äì Released in 1976, it was one of the first chorus effect pedals commercially available, based on the same circuit from the Roland Jazz Chorus amplifier. It was originally conceived for keyboard and synthesizer players, but guitarists have occupied it as well, like John Frusciante (Red Hot Chili Peppers). * Boss CE-2 ‚Äì A smaller pedal (in the standard Boss enclosure) than the CE-1, and a popular choice for guitarists during the 1980s. * Electro-Harmonix Small Clone ‚Äì Used by Kurt Cobain (Nirvana). * TC Electronic Stereo Chorus Examples Some examples of the use of \\"obviously chorused guitar tracks\\" include Fripp & Eno's \\"Evensong\\" (0:37), Nirvana's \\"Come As You Are\\" (0:00, clearest at 0:48), Mike Stern's \\"Swunk\\" (0:00), and Satellite Party's \\"Mr. Sunshine\\" (0:19, right channel).Hodgson, Jay (2010).

The film stars Chaplin, in his traditional Tramp persona, as a customer who creates chaos in a department store and becomes inadvertently entangled in the nefarious scheme of the store manager, played by Eric Campbell, and the store's floorwalker, played by Lloyd Bacon, to embezzle money from the establishment.Simon Louvish (2009) Chaplin: The Tramp's Odyssey. London, Faber and Faber: 105 The film is noted for the first \\"running staircase\\" used in films which is used for a series of slapstick that climaxes with a frantic chase down an upward escalator and finding they are remaining in the same position on the steps no matter how fast they move. Edna Purviance plays a minor role as a secretary to store manager. Mirror scene Synopsis Charlie enters a department store and annoys the staff with his antics. Meanwhile, the store's manager and the floorwalker are conspiring to rob the store's safe. When they finish putting the safe's contents into a bag, the floorwalker knocks out the manager and flees with the money. Just as the floorwalker is about to exit, he encounters Charlie who looks very much like him. He persuades Charlie to act as his substitute. Nevertheless, the floorwalker is arrested, but Charlie ends up holding the bag. The manager sees Charlie with the bag and begins to chase him around the store. At one point the two men are running down an upward escalator without getting anywhere. Police become involved in the chase and the manager ends up with his head stuck in an elevator‚Äîwhile Charlie helps to keep it there. Production The Floorwalker was the first film Chaplin made for the Mutual Company. It also marked the first Chaplin comedy in which Eric Campbell played the huge, menacing villain. This film also marked Henry Bergman's first of numerous appearances in Chaplin films. Bergman would typically play an authority figure or an upper-crust society gentleman‚Äîthe perfect comic foil for Charlie's Tramp character. Bergman would work closely with Chaplin until his death from a heart attack in 1946. Mirror sequence Roughly seven minutes from the start of the film, Chaplin and the store's floorwalker, Lloyd Bacon, stumble into opposite doors of an office and are intrigued by their likeness to each other. They mirror each other's movements to deft comic effect in a way that is believed to have inspired the \\"mirror scene\\" in Max Linder's Seven Years Bad Luck (1921). In that comedy film, Max's servants accidentally break a mirror and try to hide their mistake by having one of them dress just like their employer. Then, when Max looks into the non- existent glass, the disguised servant mimics his every action. Max Linder's movie in turn inspired many similar scenes, most famously in the Marx Brothers film Duck Soup. Later renditions can be found in the Bugs Bunny cartoon Hare Tonic, the Mickey Mouse cartoon Lonesome Ghosts, the Tom and Jerry cartoon Cat and Dupli-cat and in the TV series Family Guy and The X-Files. A scene in The Pink Panther, with David Niven and Robert Wagner wearing identical gorilla costumes, mimics the mirror scene. Harpo Marx did a reprise of this scene, dressed in his usual costume, with Lucille Ball also donning the fright wig and trench coat, in an episode of I Love Lucy. Additionally, an early episode of The Patty Duke Show contains a mirror scene in which the characters Patty and Cathy Lane (both played by Patty Duke) act out a version similar to the one found in the film Duck Soup. Review Maxson F. Judell glowingly wrote of The Floorwalker in the Madison (WI) State Journal, \\"Performing in inimitable style on an escalator, or in common parlance, a moving stairway, injecting new 'business' such as he has not given the public in previous comedies, producing the film carefully with adequate settings and excellent photography, supported by a well-chosen cast, Charles Chaplin proves conclusively that he is without question of doubt the world's greatest comedian. Chaplin possesses that indefinable something which makes you laugh heartily and without restraint at what in others would be called commonplace actions.\\" Sound version In 1932, Amedee Van Beuren of Van Beuren Studios, purchased Chaplin's Mutual comedies for $10,000 each, added music by Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples and sound effects, and re-released them through RKO Radio Pictures.

He was named a People's Artist of the USSR in 1976 and a Hero of Socialist Labour in 1989. Life and career Batalov was born on 20 November 1928 in Vladimir, into a family associated with the theatre. His uncle Nikolay Batalov starred in Vsevolod Pudovkin's classic Mother (1926). Modernist poet Anna Akhmatova was a family friend, and he painted a well-known portrait of her in 1952. Batalov joined the Moscow Art Theatre in 1953 but left three years later to concentrate on his career in film. During the Khrushchev Thaw he was one of the most recognizable actors in the Soviet Union. The Cranes Are Flying (1957) is his best-regarded film of the period, and the one which won Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. He also starred in Mikhail Romm's Nine Days of One Year (1962). In 1967 he was a member of the jury of the 5th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1973 he was a member of the jury at the 8th Moscow International Film Festival. During the 1960s and 1970s, Batalov became known for his fastidious approach towards choosing roles for himself. He appeared mostly in film adaptations of Russian classics, including Anton Chekhov's The Lady with the Dog (1960) and Bulgakov's The Flight (1970). He also directed screen versions of Gogol's The Overcoat (1960) and Yuri Olesha's Three Fat Men (1966). In the 1970s he concentrated on professorship at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. In 1979 Batalov was invited to play Gosha, a mill machinist, in the melodrama Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears. After many hesitations, Batalov brilliantly played his part in the movie, which won him the USSR State Prize. The role was central to the film's Soviet message. As one character says in the picnic scene: \\"Seventy percent of my doctorate was due to Gosha's mechanical genius\\". After that, he effectively retired from acting and devoted his time to coaching new generations of film actors. Boris Yeltsin presented the Lifetime Achievement Nika Award to him in 2002. Batalov was awarded the State Prize of the Russian Federation (2005). In 2007 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 29th Moscow International Film Festival. In March 2014 he signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.Russian artists supported Putin's aggression against Ukraine (LIST), Glavkom (11 March 2014) Batalov died on 15 June 2017 in Moscow from complications of a fall, which resulted in a hip fracture, at the age of 88.

Life He was probably born on 6 March 1613/1614, the younger son of Thomas Ascham, an alderman of Boston, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Eton and in 1634 went as a King's Scholar to King's College, Cambridge, becoming a BA in 1638 and an MA in 1642, and then a Fellow of his college until his death. According to Anthony √† WoodAthenae Oxonienses, ed. Bliss, London, 1817, 3: 750 he :\\"closed with the Presbyterian in the beginning of the rebellion, took the covenant, sided with the Independents, became a great creature of the long parliament by whose authority he was made tutor to James, Duke of York), and an active person against his sovereign\\". His appointment as tutor dated from 1646. James, Duke of York was the future King James. He also tutored James's brother Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester. Ascham's reward for his support of the republican Commonwealth was to be appointed as a trade representative to the Hanseatic League in Hamburg in 1649. In 1650, he was appointed to represent the Commonwealth of England in Spain, but he never presented his credentials to the Court as he was murdered by a group of six Royalists √©migr√©s in an Inn in Madrid on 27 May. Accounts of the subsequent trial by Agustin de Hierro were published in EnglishA. de Hierro, The process and Pleadings in the Court of Spain upon the death of Anthonie Ascham [London, 1650] and Spanish,A. de Hierro, El Doctor Don Agustin de Hierro, Caballero del orden de Calatraba, Fiscal del Consejo, Contra Don Iuan Guillen, Guillermo Arnet, y Oduardo Usual, Ingleses, que dizen ser, y presos en la Carcel Real desta Corte.

Por las muertes alevosas De Don Antonio Asikan, Embaxador, y Iuan Babtista Ribas su Interpate [n.p., n.d. 1650?] Works In 1647 Ascham prepared a manuscript treatise On Marriage that remained unpublished.Cambridge University Library MSS, MS Gg.1.4, fo.xxii ff. paginated 1‚Äì56. His first published work was A Discourse, wherein is examined what is particularly lawfull during the Confusions and Revolutions of . This appeared in 1648, probably in July at the height of the political uncertainty engendered by the second Civil War. The previous month the Army had shown that it wielded both political and military power and Ascham's Discourse was widely seen as a defence of the Army as the conquering power, and as a plea for \\"the rank of the people\\" to adopt a position of political quiescence. Parliament's ultimate victory and the establishment of the Commonwealth posed a problem for those who felt unable to accept the legality of the new government but were now being required to give it their allegiance, and also for those who regarded their oath of allegiance to King Charles I Charles I of England as a solemn oath to God that could not be broken. One argument, provided by a group of political theorists variously called the Engagers or de facto theorists, was to argue that an individual could give their obedience to the de facto government in being simply because it was in power. For many such a theory was deeply shocking since it emphasised power at the expense of authority, and subordinated allegiance to self-interest. The debate was initiated by Francis Rous who published a brief pamphlet in April 1649The Lawfulness of Obeying the Present Government in which he argued that allegiance could be given to the Commonwealth even though it were acknowledged to be an illegal power. It was a radical shift in the basis of the argument that was to be followed through by theorists engaged in the debate on de facto government. In the debate that followed Ascham played a major part in developing a theory of political obligation to the de facto power. In 1649 it is possible that he was author of a short anonymous pamphlet, A Combate between Two Seconds. One for Obeying the Present Government. The Other the second part of a Demurrer undeservedly called Religious, which was published in July. This work firstly took issue with those whose arguments continued to be based on Romans 13: 1‚Äì2 and in particular addressed the arguments in an anonymous work that may have been published in two parts, but that is extant only in its second part entitled The Second Part of the Religious Demurrer; and secondly bypassed the critical emphasis on Romans 13: 1‚Äì2 to develop arguments based on the need to protect oneself from chaos, as originally deployed by Ascham in his 1648 Discourse. Having thus entered the pamphlet \\"war\\", Ascham then began to expand his arguments. He was certainly the author of a longer pamphlet, The Bounds and Bonds of Publique Obedience, which appeared in August 1649; and by November he had added nine chapters to his 1648 Discourse, which now appeared under the title Of the Confusions and Revolutions of (sic).Anthony Ascham, Of the Confusions and Revolutions of Governments, London, W. Wilson, 1649, facsimile edition published with an introduction by G[reville] W S V Rumble by Scholars' Facsimiles and Reprints, Delmar, New York, 1975 This work attracted the attention of Robert Sanderson who criticised it in a short and pungent pamphlet.Resolutions of Conscience (by a learned Divine) in answer to a letter sent with Mr Ascham's Book, Treating, How farre it may be lawful to submit to an Usurped Power. Ascham's Reply to a paper of Dr Sandersons, containing a censure of Mr A. A. his book of the Confusions and revolution of Government (sic), which was published on 9 January 1650, was directed as much as against Edward Gee's Exercitation concerning usurped powers as against Sanderson's work. In these works Ascham's essential argument was that in a situation in which people had to look after their own safety, they were justified in giving their allegiance to any power that was capable of protecting them, whatever the legality of its title to power. By the autumn of 1649 the debate began to centre on the specific question of the Oath of Allegiance and the Engagement to the Commonwealth: Two Acts of Parliament were passed requiring people to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Commonwealth, on 11/12 October 1649, and on 2 January 1650. Conventionally Oaths were regarded as \\"the strictest Ties and Obligations that a man can be under\\". For many the Engagement to the Commonwealth was impossible to take because it overrode their prior obligation to the monarchy (King Charles I and his heirs). The Presbyterian Richard Baxter held that he \\"could not judge it seemly for him that believed there is a God to play fast and loose with a dreadful oath\\".Richard Baxter, Reliquiae Baxterianae, London, 1696, p. 54. In contrast, Ascham argued that all oaths involved tacit conditions, of which the ability of the government to protect the people was the main one. A government that could not protect its people lost the right to their allegiance. Ascham's 1648 Discourse was to be republished, anonymously, following the ousting of King James II.Under the title A Seasonable Discourse, Wherein is Examined what is Lawful during the Confusions and Revolutions of Government. Then the question of the legality of the oath of allegiance to King William and Queen Mary had come to the fore. It did not, however, generate any discussion. By then the leading theorist in the field was Thomas Hobbes, whose De Corpore Politico, De Cive (first edition), and Leviathan, had systematised a coherent and secular defence of the contract as between ruler and ruled. A portrait engraving of Anthony Ascham by Robert Cooper can be found in the Archive Collection of NPG (NPG D29012).

Conception and composition \\"You Belong to Me\\" is credited to Chilton Price, Pee Wee King, and Redd Stewart. Price, a songwriting librarian at WAVE Radio Louisville, had written the song in its virtual entirety as \\"Hurry Home to Me\\", envisioning the song as an American woman's plea to a sweetheart serving overseas in World War II. Afforded songwriting credit on the song mostly in exchange for their work in promoting it, King and Stewart did slightly adjust Price's composition musically and lyrically, shifting the focus from a wartime background \\"into a kind of universal song about separated lovers\\" and changing the title to \\"You Belong to Me\\". Price had previously had success with another hit which she had written, \\"Slow Poke\\", under a similar arrangement with the two men. History The first recording of the song, in February 1952, was by Joni James. She had seen the sheet music in the Woods Building in Chicago and the lyrics attracted her. She recorded the song in Chicago, and it was released in March on the local Sharp Records label. After she signed to MGM it was reissued as her second single on that label on August 5, 1952, after Jo Stafford, Patti Page and Dean Martin had covered it. James' version also was issued on M-G-M Records for national distribution. The best- known early 1952 version of the song was recorded after James' recording by Sue Thompson on Mercury's country label as catalog number 6407. It was soon covered by Patti Page, whose version was issued by Mercury as catalog number 5899, with \\"I Went to Your Wedding\\" (a bigger Patti Page hit, reaching No. 1) on the flip side. It entered the Billboard chart on August 22, 1952, and lasted 12 weeks on the chart, peaking at No. 4. Joni James re-recorded the song at Abbey Road Studios in London in 1960, with a symphony orchestra and a soft rock beat. A cover version by Jo Stafford became the most popular version. Issued by Columbia Records as catalog number 39811, it was Stafford's biggest hit, topping the charts in both the United States and the United Kingdom (the first song by a female singer to top the UK Singles Chart). It first entered the US chart on August 1, 1952 and remained there for 24 weeks. In the UK, it appeared in the first ever UK chart of 14 November 1952 (then a top 12) and reached number 1 on 16 January 1953, being only the second record to top such chart,Rice, Jo & Tim, Gambaccini, Paul and Read, Mike(1982). The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits (1st ed.). Enfield, Middlesex: Guinness Superlatives Ltd. p. 7. remaining in the chart for a total of 19 weeks.Roberts, David (2006). British Hit Singles & Albums (19th ed.). London: Guinness World Records Limited. . Another cover version, by Dean Martin, released by Capitol Records as catalog number 2165, was also in play at that time. This version first entered the chart on August 29, 1952, and remained on the chart for 10 weeks, reaching No. 12. All the versions were combined in the rankings on the Cash Box charts, and the song reached No. 1 on those charts as well, lasting on the chart for more than half a year. The song figures prominently in the 1953 movie Forbidden starring Tony Curtis, Joanne Dru and Lyle Bettger. The melody is used for the opening credits. In a scene reminiscent of \\"Casablanca\\", Eddie (Tony Curtis) asks Allan (Victor Sen Yung), the Lisbon Club pianist, why he plays a somber tune every time Eddie appears at the club. He answers that Christine never comes when he is there. But in that moment, seeing that Christine (Joanne Dru) has just entered he plays the melody. It is followed by the club singer (Mamie Van Doren) singing the first verse (dubbed by Virginia Rees). In 1958, the song crossed over into rock for the first time on the Capitol album Gene Vincent Rocks and the Blue Caps Roll. A later version of the song, by the Duprees, also made the Billboard Top 10, reaching No. 7 in 1962. It was recorded by many other pop vocalists, including Patsy Cline and Bing Crosby. A solo acoustic version was recorded by Bob Dylan for the 1992 album Good as I Been to You but was eventually left off as an out-take; the recording surfaced two years later in the soundtrack for the 1994 film Natural Born Killers. A loop of Jo Stafford's introduction was used by Caviar in \\"The Good Times Are Over\\" repeatedly throughout the song. As Maria Wyeth Lang, Tuesday Weld sings a portion of the song in the 1972 film \\"Play It As It Lays.\\" The song has also appeared on many soundtracks. Vonda Shepard's cover was used frequently on the TV series Ally McBeal alongside romantic scenes of Ally McBeal and Billy Thomas. A version by Jason Wade was part of the soundtrack to the 2001 animated film Shrek. Singer Tori Amos also recorded the classic for the Julia Roberts film Mona Lisa Smile in 2003. Actress Rose McGowan sang it on the soundtrack for the Planet Terror segment of the 2007 film Grindhouse. In 1980 Matchbox recorded the song in part as a section of the medley single Over the Rainbow/You Belong to Me on the Magnet label. Mary Higgins Clark referenced the song throughout her novel of the same name, which was published by Pocket Books on April 1, 1999. In the British film The Deep Blue Sea (released 2011), directed by Terence Davies, the drinkers in a London pub perform the song which later modulates into Jo Stafford's version. The song was also featured in the 2013 video game BioShock Infinite as part of its Burial at Sea story add-on. In the game, the song is performed by the lead character Elizabeth and sung by her voice actress, Courtnee Draper (with fellow actor Troy Baker, who had previously portrayed Booker DeWitt, in said game providing accompanying Acoustic guitar); footage of Draper performing the song in the recording studio is shown during the game's end credits. The Duprees version of the song is featured in the video game Mafia III, usually on the in-car radio stations but can also be heard as the musical accompaniment to several key cut-scenes. A hard rock cover version by Misfits also plays towards the end of the game (despite that version not being recorded until 35 years after the games' 1968 setting). The song is featured in the 2018 gothic horror film The Nun, a spin-off of The Conjuring 2, when Fr. Burke and Sister Irene sit down to dinner, and again moments later when a demon uses the radio to wake up Fr. Burke.
