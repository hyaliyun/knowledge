The rebellion was fuelled by opposition to Hugh Despenser the Younger, the royal favourite.Some historians use the label the \\"Despenser War\\" to refer to just the second phase of the conflict; others apply it to the entire conflict. Others prefer the term the \\"Despenser Wars\\". The Welsh part of the campaign is occasionally termed the \\"Glamorgan war\\". After the rebels' summer campaign of 1321, Edward was able to take advantage of a temporary peace to rally more support and a successful winter campaign in southern Wales, culminating in royal victory at the Battle of Boroughbridge in the north of England in March 1322. Edward's response to victory was his increasingly harsh rule until his fall from power in 1326. Causes of the war King Edward II, whose domination by his favourites, the Despensers, led to the Despenser War The initial success of the rebels reflected the power of the Marcher Lords. Since Edward I's conquest of Wales, \\"[t]he marcher privileges remained undiminished, and the marcher energies which could no longer find employment in the struggle against the Welsh, sought new direction in the fertile field of English politics.\\"Davies, p.21. The death of the last Earl of Gloucester also meant the redistribution of his vast estates and lordships in Ireland and Wales. The important Lordship of Glamorgan passed to the late earl's brother-in-law, the younger Despenser, married to his eldest sister Eleanor. The Lords Ordainers, the powerful baronial hegemony led by the Earl of Lancaster, despised the younger Despenser and his father, the elder Despenser, on account of the influence they both wielded over the king. The council of Ordainers was formed in 1311 to reform the King's household, restrict his royal prerogatives, supervise the economy, and they insisted on the banishment of his then favourite, Piers Gaveston, husband of the earl of Gloucester's sister Margaret. Roger Mortimer, his uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk, and Humphrey de Bohun, a staunch Ordainer, were avowed enemies of the Despensers. The younger Despenser, through his marriage with Eleanor, received many expensive gifts, and much property and land grants in the Marches. The passage of Glamorgan to Despenser in its entirety angered his brothers-in-law, Roger d'Amory and Hugh de Audley, who were cheated out of their share of lands which rightfully belonged to them. Hostility deepened among the Marcher Lords when Despenser titled himself \\"Lord of Glamorgan\\" and \\"Earl of Gloucester\\".Costain, pp.189-91 First phase: February‚ÄìAugust 1321 Caerphilly Castle, one of the Despenser properties Roger Mortimer seized in May 1321 In February 1321 Mortimer, Hereford and Lancaster agreed on an attack on the Despenser lands in Wales.Weir, p.129. Edward responded in March by mobilising his forces in Wales, demonstrating that he intended to make any attack on the Despensers an attack on the crown, and therefore treasonable. The king travelled to Gloucester and called upon the Marcher Lords to join him there; Mortimer and Hereford declined. Mobilising more forces, Edward marched on to Bristol, and repeated his call for the Marcher Lords to convene with him there in May.Weir, p.130. They again declined. Mortimer and Hereford promptly began their attack on the Despenser lands. Newport, Cardiff and Caerphilly were seized by Mortimer in an intense eight-day campaign. Mortimer and Hereford then set about pillaging Glamorgan and Gloucestershire, before marching north to join Lancaster at Pontefract. The barons then swore an alliance at Sherburn-in- Elmet in June, naming their faction the \\"contrariants\\" and promising to remove the Despensers for good. Edward had returned to London, where he held his own parliament to discuss courses of action.Weir, p.131. Mortimer led his army east towards London as well, reaching St Albans in late July. The city of London refused to let Mortimer's forces in, and his forces placed the capital under effective siege. Lancaster arrived in August to support him and a tense stand-off ensued, with the younger Despenser threatening the rebels from a ship on the River Thames, and the barons threatening to begin to destroy royal properties and lands outside London unless he desisted. The Earl of Pembroke, a moderate baron with strong French links, intervened in an attempt to defuse the crisis.Weir, p.132. Edward continued to refuse to negotiate or exile the Despensers, so Pembroke arranged for Queen Isabella to publicly go down on her knees to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers. This provided him with a face-saving excuse to exile the Despensers and defuse the crisis, but it was clear Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity.Doherty, p.67; Weir 2006, p.132. Second phase: October 1321‚ÄìMarch 1322 The River Severn where King Edward II defeated the Marcher Lords Despite the momentary respite, by the autumn of 1321 tension between Edward and the baronial opposition led by Thomas of Lancaster, were extremely high, with both sides raising forces across the country.Doherty, p.70. At this point, Isabella undertook a pilgrimage to Canterbury, leaving the traditional route to stop at Leeds Castle; its governor, Bartholomew de Badlesmere, was steward of the King's household but by 1321 had joined the opposition. Historians suggest this was a deliberate act by Isabella on Edward's behalf to create a casus belli.Doherty, p.70-1; Weir 2006, p.133. Badlesmere was away at the time, leaving his wife Margaret in charge; when she refused the Queen admittance, fighting broke out between Isabella's guards and the garrison. Edward now mobilised his supporters and besieged the castle, giving Isabella the Great Seal and control of the royal Chancery.Doherty, p.71. The attack on the Queen meant he was joined by many moderates and volunteers from London; chroniclers claim he soon had 30,000 men, although this is almost certainly an overestimate. When the castle surrendered at the end of October, Badlesmere and his men were executed.Weir, p.135 Edward's position was much stronger than in August, and he now revoked the banishment of the Despensers. It was clear his opponents could expect little mercy; when Mortimer and Hereford travelled north meet with Lancaster, the three reaffirmed their opposition to Edward. However, Mortimer and Hereford were forced to return to the Welsh Marches to deal with a peasant revolt, while in December Edward marched to Cirencester, preparing to invade.Weir, p.136 In the north, Lancaster tried to enlist the support of the Scots in a bid to bring more forces to bear before Edward could retake Wales.Weir, p.137. In January 1322, Edward finally overcame resistance along the River Severn and advanced into the Marches; despite attacking and burning Bridgnorth, Roger Mortimer and his uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk recognised their position was hopeless and surrendered at Shrewsbury on 22 January 1322.Costain, pp.196-97 Edward turned north, assisted by the Despensers who had secretly returned from exile in mid-January.Weir, p.138. After mustering his men at Coventry in February, he advanced on Burton on Trent, where Lancaster and Hereford had fortified bridge over the River Trent. Realising they were outnumbered, the rebels withdrew, but on 13 March an army led by the Earl of Carlisle defeated them at the Battle of Boroughbridge. Hereford was killed in the fighting, Lancaster and another forty captured knights were beheaded shortly after. Aftermath 15th-century illustration showing Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer; execution of Hugh Despenser the Younger in the background Victory left Edward and the Despensers firmly in control of England and the Welsh Marches.Doherty, pp72-3. The Despenser War \\"totally changed the political scene in England\\".Mortimer, p.32. It proved a catalyst for the disintegration of the baronial oligarchy, allowing Edward to regain the powers lost by the Ordinances of 1311.Costain, pp.193-97 Roger Mortimer was imprisoned in the Tower of London after his surrender at Shrewsbury and some of his supporters, including William Trussell, continued to raid Despenser lands. In August 1323 Mortimer escaped and attempted to break other Contrariants out of Windsor and Wallingford Castles. He eventually fled to France where he was later joined by Queen Isabella, who was ostensibly on a peace mission, but was actually seeking assistance from her brother, King Charles IV of France to oust the Despensers. Mortimer and Isabella obtained the necessary help in Flanders and in 1326 the successful Invasion of England was launched. This invasion led to the executions of the two Despensers, the deposition and killing of Edward II, and the seizure of authority by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, who became the de facto rulers of England from 1327 to 1330. Mortimer was hanged in November 1330 by the order of Isabella's son King Edward III after he ousted his mother and Mortimer from power and assumed personal rule.

A close associate of Hideki Tojo, he helped plan Japan's wartime economy. Biography=Military career The eldest son of a landowner in Chiba Prefecture, Suzuki had aspired to participate in the forestry development of Manchuria based on stories told by his uncle, who was a colonel in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War. He applied for Tokyo Imperial University's Faculty of Agriculture, but passed the examinations for the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and upon the recommendations of his uncle, began a military career instead. He graduated from the 22nd class in 1910, and from the 29th class of the Army War College in 1917. After commissioning, he studied economics for a year and was briefly assigned to the Ministry of Finance. Following the Nikolayevsk incident, he was dispatched from April to October 1920 to Siberia. he served as a military attache to Shanghai from November 1920 to February 1922. As he was fluent in both English and Chinese, he was assigned to the China Bureau within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff and was sent to Beijing from August 1925 to December 1925, and to various locations in China from December 1926 to May 1927. he accompanied General Yamanashi Hanzo on a meeting with Chinese warlord Zhang Zuolin in Beijing in June 1927. From 1927, Suzuki became increasingly involved in internal political factions within the Army, and joined the Isseki-kai in 1929. This clique included Tetsuzan Nagata, Hideki Tojo, Kanji Ishiwara and Seishir≈ç Itagaki. He was sent as a military attache to the United Kingdom from February to October 1929. After his return, he was a participant in the 1931 March Incident, an abortive coup d'√©tat intended to make General Kazushige Ugaki prime minister. Following the Mukden Incident later that year, he began advocation of a more aggressive policy in Manchuria, and was one of the most vocal advocates of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. He was promoted to colonel in December 1933. From 1934 to 1935, Suzuki served as an instructor at the Army Staff College and was assigned to the Cabinet Research Bureau from 1935 to 1936. During this time, he co-authored a pamphlet outlining his theory for a \\"national defense state\\" to prepare for total war, based on utopian and Marxist theories on state control of industries and agrarian reform. During the February 26 incident in 1936, Suzuki was initially regarded as a member of the K≈çd≈çha faction which supported the attempted coup; however, he switched sides to the T≈çseiha as it became apparent that the coup would not succeed. Although this earned him a spot close to Hideki Tojo, it also gained him the reputation as an \\"opportunist\\" which many in the Army, including former classmate Tomoyuki Yamashita resented. Suzuki was assigned command of the IJA 14th Infantry regiment in December 1936. Although he had been a bureaucrat and administrator his entire career, with little experience as a field commander and no combat experience, command of a field unit was necessary for his further promotion. He became a major general in November 1937 and was assigned nominally to the staff of the IJA 16th Division from November 1937 to April 1938, although he remained in Tokyo with the Cabinet Research Bureau. From April 1936, he was nominal Chielf-of-Staff of the IJA 3rd Army, At the time, the IJA 3rd Army was a garrison force in Manchukuo, far from the combat zones in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Suzuki returned to Tokyo in December as Head of the Political Affairs Bureau of the East Asia Development Board. He was promoted to lieutenant general in August 1940. He retired from military service in April 1941 and entered the reserves. Wartime political career Although retired from the military, Suzuki continued to serve as a Minister of State as Chair of the Cabinet Planning Board under the second and third Fumimaro Konoe administrations. In the October 1941 Gozen Kaigi immediately prior to the start of then Pacific War, Suzuki asserted that the outcome of a war would depend a quantitative analysis of Japan's economic and military power, and that at the present time, due to the American economic embargo, Japan had less that three year's supply of oil and other critical resources. Unless new resources could be secured, Japanese industry would collapse and the military would lose its capability of taking action, resulting in the loss of the Empire. Continuing to serve in the Hideki Tojo administration, he pushed strongly for the creation of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, of which he expected to become the cabinet minister. However, Tojo selected career bureaucrat Kazuo Aoki instead, and Suzuki resigned as Minister of State, and became a member of the Upper House of the Diet of Japan in October 1943. Postwar After the surrender of Japan, Suzuki was arrested by the American occupation authorities and was charged with Class A war crimes in December 1945 for his advocation of war at the October 1941 Gozen Kaigi. Found guilty at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for \\"planning to wage a war of aggression\\", he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1948. He was released from Sugamo Prison in September 1955 after the end of the American occupation and was pardoned by the Japanese government in 1958. He was requested to serve as an advisor by several industrialists, and was asked by Kishi Nobusuke to run for the post-war Diet of Japan, but Suzuki refused all offers to return to public life. However, he continued to be consulted on a private basis by conservative politicians, including Eisaku Sato. Suzuki died at his home in Shibayama, Chiba of heart failure on July 15, 1989 at 100 years old. He was the last surviving defendant of the main Tokyo/Nuremberg trials, outliving Rudolf Hess, who had committed suicide two years earlier.

His stage name was derived from words for land (glen) and sea (mor) in Breton. His distinctive style led to popularity. His songs aggressively asserted the unique cultural identity of Brittany. He portrayed himself as a political radical with anti-clerical and anarchist views. He wore a beard and his hair long, in a revival of the traditional Breton peasant style. Activism Actively engaged in Breton nationalism, Glenmor wrote the song le Kan bale lu poblek Breizh, later renamed Kan bale an ARB, which was the marching song of the ARB (Arm√©e R√©volutionnaire Bretonne; Breton Revolutionary Army). In June 1979, he participated in a hunger strike to protest against the detention of a Breton activist arrested following an attack against the Chateau of Versailles. With his friends Alain Guel and Xavier Grall, he helped found the publishing house \\"Kelenn\\", where in 1968 he published Le Livre des Chansons. A few years later Grall published Barde imagin√© and La f√™te de la nuit (1972), works in which Glenmor is the main character, in the fictionalised form of the bard \\"Arzel\\". In the early 1970s he, Grall and Guel founded the newspaper la Nation bretonne, which was influential on the Breton intellectual elite. In 1977, he appeared in Pierre Perrault's film C'etait un Qu√©b√©cois en Bretagne, madame! along with fellow Breton nationalist Meavenn. Both are portrayed as \\"poets of dispossession, the voices of a despairing national identity.\\" Glenmor describes himself in the film as an \\"oral journalist with opinions\\".David Clandfield, Pierre Perrault and the poetic documentary, Toronto International Film Festival Group, Indiana University Press, 2004, p.12. In 1978, he was designated \\"Breton of the Year\\" by Armor Magazine. In 1990 he retired from performance to devote himself to writing. He was decorated with the Order of the Ermine in 1990. He died six years later on June 18, 1996. Several thousand people attended his funeral in Mael-Carhaix . The tomb is inscribed with the words, \\"√âmile LE SCANV (1931-1996) Et voici bien ma terre, la vall√©e de mes amours. Glenmor\\". Discography * GLENMOR single * Quatre Chansons en Breton single Ed.

A central personage during the Danish Golden Age, he contributed to Danish cultural life in a number of capacities. He collected and published Danish folk tales with inspiration from the Brothers Grimm and founded the Royal Print Collection, today part of the Danish National Gallery. After the death of Bertel Thorvaldsen, he saved his archives and other papers and based on them he wrote his first biography. He was the father of Thorvald Nicolai Thiele. Early life and literary production Just Mathias Thiele painted by J. L. Lund, 1831, Bakkehusmuseet Just Mathias Thiele was born on 13 December 1795 in Copenhagen. After receiving his schooling at the Metropolitan School and studying privately with A.G. Rudelbach, he had his debut in 1816 in Danfana, a magazine, before publishing his first book, a novel named Bjergmandsdalen, the following year. From 1817 to 1835 he was employed at the Royal Danish Library. During this phase, with inspiration from the Brothers Grimm, he collected Danish folk tales, relying on both written sources and oral ones which he collected on travels around the country. He published them in four volumes as Danske Folkesagn I-IV between 1818 and 1823 (extended edition 1843). He also wrote poetry and drama but to no great acclaim and his works within that field are forgotten today. Relationship to Bertel Thorvaldsen J√∏rgen Sonne's frieze on the facade of Thorvaldsens Museum: The reception of Thorvaldsen in Copenhagen, Thiele is the third man from the left, standing behind Jonas Collin Thiele's publication of Danish folk tales was rewarded with a scholarship. He traveled to Rome where he became a close friend of Bertel Thorvaldsen who would also become a major focus for his academic writings with Den danske Billedhugger Bertel Thorvaldsen og hans V√¶rker, I-IV (\\"The Danish Sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen and his oeuvre, I-IV\\") published from 1831 to 1850 and Thorvaldsens Biographie, 1-4 from 1851-56. Thiele was also a member of the committee for the foundation of Thorvaldsens Museum. After Thorvaldsen's death, he was effective in saving his archives and other papers from destruction. Art administration Thiele was secretary at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1825 to 1871. While working at the Royal Library, he was the main force behind saving its neglected collection of 70,000 prints which became the basis for establishing the Royal Print Collection, today part of the holdings of the Danish National Gallery. He served as inspector at the collection from 1835 and its director from 1861. Family and friends Ida Thiele, at the age of 2, painted by Christen K√∏bke (1832) H. W.

Just Mathias Thiele was throughout his life an active part of the cultural environment in Copenhagen. Still a student, he became part of the circle of artists and intellectuals around Knud Lyne and Kamma Rahbek at Bakkehuset, a time he commemorated in Erindringer fra Bakkehuset (\\"Memoirs from Bakkehuset\\") published in 1869.

History C&P; Telephone of WV logo, 1964-1969 The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia, originally part of the Bell System, was founded on January 1, 1917. C&P; of WV took over telephone operations in West Virginia being served by Central District and Printing Telegraph Company, Southern Bell, and The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland. Dial service was first introduced by C&P; of West Virginia in 1925 to the Huntington central office. Bell Atlantic ownership In 1984, The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia became a holding of Bell Atlantic, upon the divestiture of the Bell System by AT&T.; Charleston became the first city in the United States to have a choice of long-distance companies. By dialing \\"1\\" plus the area code and number, they could choose their long-distance carrier. Charleston was the nation's first test market for the service, allowing 34,000 customers to choose from one of eight long- distance companies serving the area. C&P; Telephone logo, 1984-1994 C&P; Telephone Co. of WV was the last Bell Atlantic company to provide party line telephone service. The last party line was converted to \\"private line\\" service on October 30, 1989. In 1993, C&P; Telephone of West Virginia took its last analog switch out of service, becoming the first Bell Operating Company to have 100% digital switching Name changes In 1994, Bell Atlantic standardized all of its Bell Operating Company names, resulting in C&P; Telephone of West Virginia being renamed Bell Atlantic - West Virginia, Inc. In 2000, upon its purchase of GTE, Bell Atlantic became Verizon Communications, resulting in the new name Verizon West Virginia, Inc. Sale to Frontier On July 1, 2010, Verizon spun off New Communications Holdings, Inc. and its holding company New Communications ILEC Holdings to Verizon shareholders, which then merged with Frontier Communications. Included in the sale was Verizon West Virginia, among other select Verizon landline properties, which became Frontier West Virginia, Inc.Frontier Requested Legal Names and Codes, June 15, 2010 The company operates separately from Citizens Telecommunications Company of West Virginia, the existing Frontier provider in the state. Even though Frontier Communications is not a Baby Bell, the FCC determined that Frontier West Virginia is still bound by laws dating to its time as C&P; Telephone of West Virginia; therefore, it is still responsible to uphold obligations expected of Bell Operating Companies outlined in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Unique Frontier West Virginia was the first Bell Operating Company to have been completely divested by a Baby Bell and sold to a non-Baby Bell. Some historically Bell local access lines have been sold to non-Baby Bells over the years by BellSouth, US West, and Verizon; however, the Bell Operating Companies from which those exchanges were split have been retained by the Baby Bells. AT&T; announced on December 17, 2013 that it plans to sell Southern New England Telephone to Frontier Communications. Although SNET is not legally defined as a Bell Operating Company since it was not majority-owned by the original AT&T;, it is an original member of the Bell System and now shares a common affiliation with Frontier West Virginia (via ownership by Frontier) for the first time since 1983.

Production The series' war segments were later reused in The Legend of the Condor Heroes (2008) for the flashback scene depicting Yang Zaixing's death. The filmmakers obscured the actors' features to differentiate the two television series, but the images' compositions are the same.The comparisons of The Young Warriors (2006) and The Legend of the Condor Heroes (2008) The series' costume design is one of its main focal points. During its premiere, the production team hosted runaway events for cast members to showcase their costumes. The Yang generals and Yel√º Xie's costumes were designed based on battle armour from the Tang, Song and Liao dynasties. However, the Yangs' armours attracted the most attention, as audiences felt that they resembled samurai armour more than Chinese armour, because of their bright red and black colouring, and long narrow plates. The Song military uniform designs were featured again in The Legend of the Condor Heroes (2008) and A Weaver on the Horizon (2010).

The screenplay was written by James Booth, who co-starred in the film. It was originally intended as a sequel to the 1985 film Invasion U.S.A., which starred Chuck Norris in the role of Matt Hunter. The film had a negative critical reception but it have cult success on home video and since then, it was considered a cult film. Plot In the swamps of the Louisiana bayou, two men are hunted and killed by four costumed, well-armed adversaries. Retired Secret Service agent, Captain Matt Hunter (Dudikoff), has retired to his family's cattle ranch in Louisiana and Texas, with his sister Sarah (Gereighty) and grandfather. They drive to New Orleans, meeting Matt's old military comrade and local politician Larry Richards (James), who is now running for U.S. Senate. At dinner, Larry hesitantly mentions threats made against his life during the election cycle, which he dismisses as harmless. Later that day, Larry, Matt and their families ride in Larry's float in the Mardi Gras parade. Disguised as revelers, assassins open fire on Larry's float, accidentally killing his eldest son. Matt and Larry take down the attackers, but Matt loses the last assassin in charge in the crowd. Matt calls in a favor to his old boss, Admiral Brown (Booth), and learns the perpetrators are members of an organization known only to U.S. intelligence as the Pentangle. Taking the name of the five-pointed star, the Pentangle is a far right-wing group promoting extreme views on gun rights, immigration, and security and whose leadership is suspected of operating a hunting club targeting people. The Secret Service suspects the cult is composed of businessmen and authority figures with connections to Washington, run by five members, each represented by a point on the star; however they lack further knowledge and ask Matt to infiltrate the organization to gain further intel. Matt declines, citing his family, and instead sends his and Larry's family to hide out at his ranch. Meanwhile, Matt and Larry intentionally foil a second trap set by the Pentangle, eliminating several more assassins in a dockyard confrontation. Prof. Elliott Glastenbury (John P. Ryan) is the head of Glastenbury Industries and the leader of his cult, the Pentangle. Having rallied his cult's support by eschewing his far right-wing views, he takes personal interest in Matt after reviewing surveillance of the botched Richards hit, Pentangle's first failure; the members Wade Delaney (Bill Wallace), Jeb Wallace (Karl Johnson), and Charles Lavall (Alaimo) contemplate asking Matt to join. Learning that the families are hiding out at Matt's ranch, Glastenbury orders Delaney, Wallace, and Lavall to attack the ranch, killing the Secret Service agents and Matt's grandfather while setting the ranch ablaze. Matt, Sarah, and Larry's wife all escape, while Larry goes back to rescue his youngest son, but is shot in the process. As Matt saves them both, Larry asks Matt to protect his son and dies. Meanwhile, Pentangle finds Sarah and Larry's wife hiding outside, taking Sarah hostage and executing Larry's wife. Matt attempts to escape via the roof with Larry's son but is shot in the leg, falling to the ground. Pentangle gives Matt two weeks to agree to be hunted, or they will kill Sarah. Before leaving, they execute Larry's youngest son in front of an injured Matt. Two weeks later, Matt shows up to a Cajun bayou party, where the Pentangle members are guests. Matt finds Sarah about to be auctioned off by the brothel as a sex slave. He rescues her but attracts the Pentangle's attention while doing so, escaping into the swamps on foot. The Pentangle hunts him throughout the night; one by one, Matt eliminates Lavall, Wallace, and Delaney until only Glastenbury remains. Ambushed by Glastenbury, Matt stabs him, allowing both men time to escape, with Matt taking Sarah to Admiral Brown for treatment and protection. Matt then confronts Glastenbury at his mansion. Declining his offer to join the Pentangle, the two duel amidst Glastenbury's collection of antique weaponry. Glastenbury appears to have the upper hand, but Matt impales him on one of his own statues, killing him. Matt goes to the hospital to see Sarah, where Admiral Brown congratulates him on a job well done. Matt confronts him that only the Secret Service knew that the families were hiding out on Matt's ranch; therefore, someone in the Service is connected to the Pentangle (strongly implying that the Admiral is the unnamed, fifth member of the Pentangle's membership.) Matt vows to continue fighting the Pentangle and leaves.  Cast  * Michael Dudikoff as Capt.

Allen (born June 30, 1943) is a Republican politician and educator from Bountiful, Utah. She represented the 19th District of the Utah House of Representatives from 1994 to 2011. Before entering politics, Allen was a teacher and the president of the Davis County Board of Education. In May 2010, Salt Lake County mayor Peter Corroon, the Democratic candidate for Governor of Utah, selected Allen as his running mate for the office of lieutenant governor, making them the first major bipartisan ticket in Utah state history. However, they were defeated by the all-Republican ticket of Gary Herbert and Greg Bell in the 2010 gubernatorial election. Background Sheryl Allen was born in 1943 in Salt Lake City, Utah. Allen attended the University of Utah, where she received a Bachelor's degree in Elementary Education in 1965. She is married to John Allen, the chief statistician of the Utah Jazz. The Allens have four children and seven grandchildren. Educational career In 1976, Allen, Lucile Cardon Reading, and Theo Italisano were the first three women to be elected to the previously male-dominated Davis County Board of Education and took office on January 1, 1977. Reading, who became board president, and Allen worked to stop alleged mismanagement and ended the practice of officials receiving kickbacks from building contractors. Allen became board president with the death of Reading in March 1982. In 1988, Allen stated that she was stepping down from the board the following year to pursue graduate studies. In 1990, she received a Master's degree in Education Administration from the University of Utah. Allen was also the public relations director of the Davis Technical College (formerly known as the Davis Applied Technology Center) from 1985 to 1995. She became the foundation director of the Davis School District in 1995. Political career Allen ran against Quinn Gardner in June 1994 to succeed Utah state representative Kim Burningham, who was stepping down after 15 years of service. Allen won with 54% of the vote and took office on July 20, 1994. On January 26, 1996, eight hours after the execution by firing squad of John Albert Taylor, Allen introduced a bill to eliminate the firing squad, which did not pass. She later succeeded in passing HB180, which removed the right of the condemned to choose their method of execution after February 2004. In 2005, Allen was awarded Legislator of the Year by the Utah School Board Association. She was re-elected to her eighth term in the state legislature in 2008 with over 80% of the vote. Allen is a member of the House Judiciary Committee and the Revenue and Taxation Committee. She is also the co-chairperson of the Economic Development and Revenue Appropriations Subcommittee. In 2008, Allen was involved in bringing forth an investigation by the Utah House Ethics Committee that led to the reprimand of fellow Republican house member Greg Hughes. Facing political ostracization from within her own party, Allen announced that she would not seek another term as a state representative in 2010. 2010 campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Utah On May 1, 2010, Salt Lake County mayor Peter Corroon asked Allen to be his running mate as lieutenant governor in his gubernatorial bid against incumbent Republican Governor Gary Herbert. As Corroon ran as a Democrat and Allen as a Republican, this was the first bipartisan team on a single ticket between major political parties in a Utah state election. In 1976, governor Scott M. Matheson and lieutenant governor David Smith Monson were elected from different parties, but on separate tickets. Political clashes between Matheson and Monson led to changes in state election law, requiring joint tickets in subsequent elections. Corroon and Allen ran on a moderate ticket to appeal to independent voters. A major platform of their campaign was the improvement of education in the state of Utah. Corroon's campaign accused Herbert's governorship of being \\"corrupt.\\" After the second most expensive gubernatorial campaign in Utah history, Herbert won the election on November 2, 2010.

Members East End members are: *Gaku (MC) (, born October 10, 1970) *ROCK-Tee (DJ) (, born December 8, 1970) *Yoggy (DJ) (, born May 5, 1970). History Members Gaku and Yoggy were friends in high school, initially bonding over a mutual interest in breakdancing. In their second year of high school, the duo participated in rap contests as \\"Funky New Style.\\" They became acquainted with future member ROCK-Tee at one of these events. Later, when entering college, Gaku ran into ROCK-Tee, and informally organized East End. East End‚Äôs first live performance was at an event called ‚ÄúPeace Ball,‚Äù in 1990. Many acts that are still famous in Japan today were in attendance, including DJ Honda, DJ Krush, Boy-Ken, DJ Yas, and others. East End continued as an independent act, and released their debut studio album Beginning of the End in 1992, but garnered little mainstream attention. In 1994, the group released the EP denim-ed soul, accompanied by the single ‚ÄúDa.Yo.Ne.‚Äù The album and single featured Yuri Ichii, together under the new collaborative name EAST END x YURI. Initially sales were modest, but in the following year, \\"Da.Yo.Ne\\" attracted a large audience through radio play across Japan. It is speculated that it reached major radio stations because of its promotion through Tower Records in Hokkaido. Essentially a one hit wonder, East End continued to release singles but were unable to maintain an audience. In 2003, after a brief hiatus, East End released Kokoroe, a new album featuring some of the forefathers of Japanese hip hop (namely Rip Slyme, Rhymester, and Crazy-A) and attracted press attention, but failed to reenter the cultural mainstream. East End were at first skeptical about collaborating with Yuri, an idol from the group Tokyo Performance Doll. Yuri, being a woman, posed a possible threat to their careers since women did not frequent the hip hop scene in Japan. Female singers were more commonly associated with pop songs and ‚Äúcute‚Äù acts. The fact that Yuri was a woman, however, was very beneficial for the group in the end. She gave them a second chance in the recording industry after their first album did not sell as much as the producers wanted. Having a pop star on their side then allowed East End to continue recording, a chance that the group might not have had without her.Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006. \\"Da.Yo.Ne.\\" The ‚ÄúDa.Yo.Ne.‚Äù mini-CD single, plus ‚ÄúDa.Cha.Ne.‚Äù and ‚ÄúSo.Ya.Na.‚Äù The group's first major single, \\"Da.Yo.Ne,\\" sold 912,010 copies in 1995, reaching #7 on the weekly Oricon charts and remaining on the chart for thirty-nine weeks. The phrase \\"da yo ne\\" is informal Japanese, mainly used in Tokyo (and eastern Japan, more broadly). Because of this, several other versions of this song were recorded under the names West End √ó Yuki, North End √ó Mai, North East End √ó Mai (and others) which included local versions of the phrase, ‚ÄúSo.Ya.Na.,‚Äù ‚ÄúDa.Be.Sa.,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDa.Cha.Ne.‚Äù respectively. A compilation album of these variations, titled Da. Yo. Ne. Local Version Ominbus, was released in 1995. Although lasting only as a memory for many Japanese people, the song ‚ÄúDa.Yo.Ne.‚Äù helped spark the hip hop movement in Japan. The song contains a sample of ‚ÄúTurn Your Love Around‚Äù by George Benson.

His eldest son was Selim II Giray.  First Rule (1699‚Äì1702)  Selim I Giray, after his retirement in 1699, recommended Devlet II Giray Khan to the post who was confirmed in the rank of Khan by the Ottoman Empire. In the early years of his reign, he faced a conflict that broke out between his brothers and Kalga Nureddin for important positions within the Khanate. One participant in the dispute, Goran Gaza, fled to Bujak and there gathered around himself rebellious Nogays that had intended to leave the subordination of the Crimea. This rebellion was suppressed by Devlet II Giray. Soon Khan had difficulties with foreign states. The Ottoman Empire, which signed peace treaty with Moscow, ignored all the warnings of the Khan, who reported on the plans of Peter I of Russia to continue to wage war in the south. Devlet II Giray tried to organize an army against the will of the Ottoman sultan Mustafa II, but was immediately stripped of his power.

Devlet II Giray always expressed his fears that Muscovy had no intention to abide by a long peace and would soon begin its new invasion of Crimea at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Ahmed III's initial reaction was very weak due to the fear of another war with Imperial Russia. He later proceeded with the Pruth River Campaign, when Charles XII of Sweden convinced the Ottomans and the Crimean Khanate to declare war on Russia. The Ottomans won the war, while Russia lost Moldavia.  Second dethronement and death  Sultan Ahmed III deposed Devlet II Giray from the throne of the Crimean Khanate following allegations of improper treatment of the Swedish King Charles XII (who sought asylum in Turkey) during the campaigns against Russia (Devlet II Giray considered Charles XII a prisoner) and sent him into exile to the Ottoman island of Rodos in the Aegean Sea.

Wyer Jr. is a visiting professor at the University of Cincinnati and Professor (Emeritus) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He received his doctoral degree from the University of Colorado. His research interests cut across numerous areas of social information processing, including knowledge accessibility, comprehension, memory, social inference, the impact of affect on judgment and decisions, attitude formation and change, and consumer judgment and decision making. Personal life It was a somewhat circuitous path that led Bob Wyer to the field of social psychology. Raised in upstate New York, he received degrees in electrical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1957) and New York University (1959). After working for two years at Bell Telephone Laboratories, he became concerned that he might have missed out on a classic liberal arts education, and enrolled in graduate school in social psychology at the University of Colorado, receiving his Ph. D. in 1962. Working with O. J. Harvey and William Scott, he began to investigate questions of cognitive organization and social information processing, establishing the themes that have guided his scholarship throughout his career. On completion of his doctoral studies, Wyer held academic appointments at the University of Iowa and the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle. In his earliest work, he investigated a range of fundamental questions about the nature of social beliefs, attitudes, and judgment. He developed a comprehensive view of the cognitive bases of judgment and inference in his first major book, Cognitive Organization and Change: An Information Processing Approach (1974).Wyer, Robert S. (1974), Cognitive Organization and Change: An Information Processing Approach. Hillsdale; New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum. In 1973, he moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he spent the next several decades of his research career. During that time, he began to develop a full-fledged social-cognitive perspective on topics such as attitudes, attribution, and impression formation, and became recognized as one of the most prolific scholars in the history of social psychology.Bodenhausen, Galen V. and Alan J. Lambert (2003). Foundations of Social Cognition: A Festschrift in Honor of Robert S. Wyer, Jr. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.

The deployment was conceived following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, as a way to improve the interoperability of the region's military forces, governments, and humanitarian organisations during disaster relief operations, while providing humanitarian, medical, dental, and engineering assistance to nations of the Pacific, and strengthening relationships and security ties between the nations. The deployment is typically based around an amphibious warfare vessel or hospital ship of the USN's Pacific Fleet. Other nations regularly contribute to the deployment; the Australian Defence Force has provided assets since the first deployment in 2006, and seven nations, along with other branches of the United States Armed Forces, US government agencies, and non-government organizations, were involved in Pacific Partnership 2011. History Following Operation Unified Endeavour, the United States response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the United States Navy saw the opportunity to build on the goodwill created by this operation, and conceived an annual deployment to the region. The aim of this deployment, Pacific Partnership, was to improve the interoperability of the region's military forces, governments, and humanitarian organisations during disaster relief operations, while providing humanitarian, medical, dental, and engineering assistance to nations of the Pacific, and strengthening relationships and security ties between the nations. The first such deployment was conducted in 2006, based aboard the hospital ship USNS Mercy, and included partner nations such as Australia (which has contributed consistently since), and non-government organizations. The deployment visited the Philippines, Bangladesh, Indonesia, West Timor, and East Timor. Puma helicopter during Pacific Partnership 2011 In 2007, the Pacific Fleet prepared another deployment, this time based aboard the amphibious warfare ship . Nations visited included the Philippines, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 2008 saw USNS Mercy visit the Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Timor- Leste, and Vietnam. During Pacific Partnership 2008, over 90,000 patients were treated, including 14,000 dental patients and 1,300 surgery patients. The flagship for the 2009 deployment was the dry cargo ship USNS Richard E. Bird, which visited the Oceanic nations of Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Tonga. In 2008, the pacific Partnership sailed again on board the U.S.N.S. Mercy. Sailing from San Diego on May 1, 2008, they passed through Hawaii to the South Pacific. Pacific Partnership provided humanitarian and engineering assistance by visiting the Republic of the Philippines, Vietnam, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea. The Mercy returned via Guam and Hawaii, arriving in San Diego on September 25, 2008. The USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) and her crew of U.S. military, partner-nation representatives and non-governmental organizations (NGO) arrived in Chuuk, Federated States of Micronesia, for the final mission site for Pacific Partnership 2008. This mission reflected the longstanding tie between the U.S. and Micronesia with its humanitarian outreach. During the 10 days in Micronesia the mission was carried out with the NGO's and in close coordination and partnership with local medical care professionals. Volunteers from Project Hope and the University of California at San Diego Pre-dental Society worked closely with the U.S. and partner-nation medical personnel. Several countries were represented, including Canada, India, Australia and New Zealand. The UCSD Pre- dental Society provided dentists, dental students, pre-dental students (both from several universities) medical and pre-medical students and pharmacists and pharmacy students. Military personnel as well as the NGO volunteers worked together to provide humanitarian and civic assistance to six different locations within Micronesia. The Chuuk State Hospital at Weno Island was the beneficiary of the Naval Seabees as they reconstructed the facility. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) President Emanuel Mori signed into congressional law a resolution thanking the USNS Mercy (T-AH19) Pacific Partnership mission during the fifth regular session of the 15th Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia on October 29, 2008. According to a press release from the FSM Public Information Office, Congressional Resolution No. 15-145 was instituted to convey \\"profound gratitude and appreciation to the team of health services professionals and crew of USNS Mercy for humanitarian assistance and medical assistance to the people of Yap, Chuuk and Pohnpei during the visit to the FSM.\\" The August 22 to September 1 visit was the fifth and final stop on Mercys Pacific Partnership 2008 deployment which ran from May through September. During the FSM visit, Mercy and other Pacific Partnership personnel treated 3,000 dental patients, 15,000 medical patients and performed more than 200 surgeries. Pacific Partnership returned to USNS Mercy in 2010, visiting Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste. Mercy was supported at different times by ships from Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, and Australia. In addition to Mercys operations, two separate deployments were made under Pacific Partnership 2010: the command ship to Palau, and the heavy lift ship to Papua New Guinea. Ships from Pacific Partnership 2011 sailing through the Segond Channel The 2011 deployment, which started on 21 March and ended on 4 August, was centered on the amphibious warfare ship . In addition to USN personnel, resources deployed include personnel and equipment from other branches of the United States Armed Forces, government agencies, non- government organizations, and the militaries of Canada, Singapore, and Spain; ships from the United States Coast Guard, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan; and a helicopter team from France. In addition to carrying out medical and engineering infrastructure projects in Tonga, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and the Federated States of Micronesia, the operation aimed to implement sustainability projects in these nations. In the first three ports, 21,000 patients were treated, thousands of contact hours of formal Subject Matter Expert Exchanges (SMEEs) were completed, and classrooms and a water catchment system were built. The total cost of the 2011 mission is reportedly $20 million or almost $4 million for each port of call. Between 2006 and 2010, Pacific Partnership has visited 13 countries, treated more than 300,000 patients, and built over 130 engineering projects. The 2012 deployment began with the USNS Mercy departing San Diego on 3 May and concluding its last humanitarian/medical mission in Cambodia on 11 August before heading for home port. Its goal was to establish opportunities for multinational crisis response capabilities supporting humanitarian and civic actions. The Mercy made two port calls on its way back; Guam and Hawaii. In addition to USN personnel, various other branches of the United States Armed Forces, government agencies, non-government agencies, as well as the militaries of Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Peru, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. One of the highlighted accomplishments was the development of a self-sustaining ecosystem at Bunaken National Park. Bunaken National Marine Park is a marine reserve park located in the Coral Triangle that provides a habitat to 390 species of coral as well as many fish, mollusk, reptile and marine mammal species. In Indonesia 200 surgeries were performed, over 2300 livestock and pets received veterinary care, and over 9000 local citizen received medical evals and treatments. Philippines witnessed 271 surgeries, and the PP12 teeam treated over 16,000 patients. In Vietnam PP12 performed over 12,000 medical treatments; performed 207 surgeries; conducted nearly 4,000 treatments on 1,600 livestock and domestic animals; and completed renovations and a new building for two health clinics. In Cambodia 12,679 patients were triaged; three surgical civic assistance programs resulting in 218 surgeries on board hospital ship USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) and at Preah Kossamek military hospital in Phnom Penh; four medical subject matter expert exchanges (SMEEs) on surgeries and medical techniques; three bio-medical repair SMEEs which resulted in 64 equipment repairs; two veterinary civic assistance projects where 1,375 animals received exams and treatments; three engineering civic assistance projects resulting in three new maternity wards. HMNZS Canterbury on Pacific Partnership 2013 The 2013 mission included significant participation by three key nations dividing up the mission beginning on 15 May and concluding their final missions on 13 Aug 2020. The U.S. with the USS Pearl Harbor concentrated its efforts on Samoa, Tonga and the Marshall Islands. Australia with the HMAS Tobruk went to Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand sent the HMNZS Manawanui to Kirabati and the HMNZS Canterbury to the Solomon Islands. Other participating nations included Canada, France, Japan, and Malaysia. Also included were non-governmental organizations to include NOAA, Project Handclasp, Project HOPE, USAID, Vets Without Borders and World Vets. In Samoa mission personnel held more than 60 medical and dental engagements, provided veterinary services at 12 sites triaging and treated 2,633 patients, vets evaluated 430 animals and performed five engineering missions and four underwater harbor surveys surveying more than 500 underwater acres while in Samoa. In Tonga the mission staff treated 5,455 patients, evaluated 3,000 animals and conducted 25 donation events.

The title comes from lines in Thomas Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust, or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death? The screenplay was by Michael Pertwee, adapted from his own play The Paragon. The film was shot in film noir style with dramatic use of light and shadow. Plot Simon Rawley is reported killed in the last days of World War II, and his blind father Robert (Murray) decides to build a cricket pavilion in his memory in the local village. His neighbour Lord Clandon (Seymour Hicks) urges him to extend the dedication to all the local men who gave their lives in the war, but Robert refuses. Planning and construction take some time and three years pass, during which Simon's widow Angela (Gray) falls in love with local doctor's son Maxwell Oliver (Derek Farr) whilst they have both been posted to Occupied Germany after the war. Robert cannot help feeling that this is disloyal to his dead son, but his second wife Joan (Campbell) does her best to convince him that Angela is entitled to search for happiness again. The pavilion is finally completed and plans are in place for the grand dedication and opening. The local police are meanwhile looking for a villain who coshed a motorist and stole his car in London, and has dumped the car in the vicinity. Robert surprises an intruder in the house that evening. He is closely followed by Angela, who to her great shock recognises her \\"dead\\" husband Simon (Patrick). He signals to her not to let Robert know his identity. Later he comes up with elaborate excuses to Angela to explain his resurrection and lack of contact since the war, but she soon sees through the lies. It is subsequently revealed that, far from dying a hero's death on the battlefield, Simon was a deserter who faked his own death. Since the war he has been making a living on the wrong side of the law as a black-marketeering spiv. Now down on his luck, he has returned (in the stolen car) to try to extort money. Angela has to let Joan in on Simon's return from the dead, and the two try desperately to shield Robert from the knowledge of his son's return in such circumstances, aware that the shattering of his illusions would destroy him. The unscrupulous Simon, learning of Angela's new attachment to Maxwell, demands ¬£5,000 to leave for good. Robert gradually comes to realise that something very strange is going on, and little by little manages to piece together that Simon is in hiding somewhere in the house. He finally manages to track him down and a struggles ensues, climaxing with Simon falling to his death from a balcony. With his son's perfidy finally revealed to all, Robert agrees to change the dedication of the pavilion, as Lord Clandon had requested all along.

Feyer drew cartoons as part of the proceedings. Critical reception Ottawa Citizen television critic Bob Blackburn described the series as CBC's \\"biggest turkey\\" of 1954. Another Ottawa Citizen critic, Claude Hammerston, described the series as a \\"monstrosity\\", noting about the much-promoted Clarke that the CBC \\"treated her rather shamefully\\".

Starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher, the film is about two friends who decide to make a pact to have a \\"no strings attached\\" relationship, without falling in love with each other. The film was released in the United States on January 21, 2011. Plot After first meeting at a summer camp as teenagers, Emma Kurtzman (Natalie Portman) and Adam Franklin (Ashton Kutcher) run into each other a few times as young adults but never keep in touch. Emma is a doctor in Los Angeles, and Adam is a production assistant for a musical television show. Soon, Adam finds out that his father Alvin (Kevin Kline), the well-known star of a former hit television comedy series, has begun a romance with his ex- girlfriend, Vanessa (Ophelia Lovibond). Devastated, he gets drunk and calls all his female contacts to hook up. The next morning, he wakes up on Emma's couch, encountering Emma's friends and colleagues who tease him and tell him that he was crying and passed out naked on the couch. She leads him to her room to find his pants, and they have sex. The two have sex again at Adam's house. Before she leaves, they agree to engage in a \\"no strings attached\\" relationship, where they just have sex. Soon, Adam finds himself getting jealous of Emma's co-worker Sam (Ben Lawson), and being an emotional person, he doubles his romantic attempts towards Emma. She feels awkward and thus ends their arrangement, only to end up missing him. She drunkenly crashes at his place, and they sleep together again. On Adam's birthday, his father tells him he wishes to have children with Vanessa. Disgusted, Adam walks out, and Emma defends him. He asks her for one single date on Valentine's Day, and it seems perfect till she awkwardly tells him she will not engage in an emotional relationship. They agree to not see each other. Six weeks later, before her sister's wedding, Emma realizes she wants to be with Adam, and drives over to his place at night, only to see Adam and his colleague Lucy (Lake Bell), mistaking her for his girlfriend. She drives away. Later that same night, Adam and Lucy are starting to get intimate when Vanessa informs him his father is in the hospital. Adam rushes to the hospital, only to see Emma there as well, as her colleague Shira (Mindy Kaling) had informed her. As Emma confesses her feelings to Adam, he asks her to pursue their relationship again, and she agrees. They are then shown to have breakfast, a sign of a \\"strings attached\\" relationship, as the movie ends it shows all relationships end happily ever after. CastProduction No Strings Attached is directed by Ivan Reitman based on a screenplay by Elizabeth Meriwether titled Friends with Benefits. The title was changed to avoid confusion with a different film with a similar premise that opened on July 22, 2011. The Paramount Pictures film was first announced in March 2010 as an untitled project. Actors Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman were cast in the lead roles, and Paramount anticipated a release date of , 2011. Reitman said of casual sex, \\"I noticed from my own kids that with this generation in particular, young people find it easier to have a sexual relationship than an emotional one. That is how the sexes deal with each other today.\\" Principal photography began in May 2010. By November 2010, the film was titled No Strings Attached with a new release date of , 2011. Though the timing was coincidental, Portman welcomed the chance to portray a dissimilar character to her role in Black Swan.

Release No Strings Attached had its world premiere on , 2011, at the Fox Village Theater in Los Angeles, California. The film was released in in the United States and Canada on , 2011. Its target demographic was women between 17 and 24 years old, and its primary competition was The Dilemma. Interest tracking reflected the target demographic's gaining interest in the film leading up to its release, and tracking also revealed \\"good early awareness\\" from Hispanic audiences. The studio predicted for the film to gross in the \\"mid-to-high teens\\" millions in its opening weekend, similar to past romantic comedies rated \\"R\\" (restricted to 17 years old and up) by the Motion Picture Association of America.

Critical reception No Strings Attached received mixed reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 49%, based on 171 reviews, with an average rating of 5.28/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"It benefits from the presence of Natalie Portman and director Ivan Reitman's steady hand, but No Strings Attached doesn't have the courage or conviction to follow through on its ribald premise.\\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 50 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Critic David Edelstein described No Strings Attached as a film with \\"a supposedly feminist veneer...(that) never makes the case for Emma's point of view. It's almost a feminist backlash movie, and it didn't have to be. There are plenty of reasons for brilliant young women, especially with the stress of a medical career, to approach time- and emotion-consuming relationships warily.\\" He expressed disappointment on overuse of stock characters, as well as Reitman's \\"heavy-handed\\" direction and a story that is ultimately \\"corny and contrived and conservative.\\" A. O. Scott called the film \\"not entirely terrible...high praise indeed, given that this is a film aspiring to match the achievement of 27 Dresses, When in Rome, and Leap Year\\"; according to Scott, the film is \\"Love & Other Drugs without the disease\\", a film whose pleasures \\"are to be found in the brisk, easy humor of some of Ms. Meriwether's dialogue and in the talented people scattered around Ms. Portman and Mr. Kutcher like fresh herbs strewn on a serving of overcooked fish.\\" Scott considered \\"the film's great squandered opportunity--and also the source of some of its best comic moments--is that Ms. Gerwig and Mindy Kaling in effect share the role of Emma‚Äôs zany sidekick. How can this be? Why are these two entirely original and of-the-moment performers marginal players in this agreeable, lackluster picture and not stars of the year‚Äôs greatest girl- bromance?... To imagine Ms. Kaling and Ms. Gerwig in a remake of Thelma and Louise or the Wedding Crashers is to experience an equal measure of frustration and hope. Why can‚Äôt we have a few movies like that and not quite so many like this?\\" British newspaper The Telegraph named No Strings Attached one of the ten worst films of 2011, saying \\"No Strings Attached is nominally a raunchy romantic comedy, but Natalie Portman betrays so little indication of enjoying herself you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking we were watching deleted scenes from Black Swan.\\" Home media No Strings Attached was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 10, 2011.\\"No Strings Attached (2011)\\" .

Harvaqtuurmiut (alternate: Harvaqtormiut, or Ha'vaqtuurmiut; translation: \\"whirlpools aplenty people\\") were a Caribou Inuit society in Nunavut, Canada. Predominantly, their inland existence was along the lower Kazan River section, by Thirty Mile Lake, that they called Harvaqtuuq.Keith, pp. 2, 6 In 1995, the lower Kazan River area, an important crossing area for the Kaminuriak caribou herd as well as the traditional territory and ancestral home of Harvaqtuurmiut, was designated the Fall Caribou Crossing National Historic Site. History In the 19th and 20th centuries, Harvaqtuurmiut and others lived in the interior west of Hudson Bay. In addition to the lower Kazan River area, they also occupied areas below Yathkyed Lake, below the Kunwak River, and inland to Beverly Lake and the lower Dubawnt River. Historically, the land of the Harvaqtuurmiut was also a gathering place for people from other places because the Kazan River is a fall caribou crossing area. Population estimates in 1918 were 186, but down to 71 in 1922.Keith, p. 5 By the early 1980s, most had moved to Baker Lake. Culture Their cultural and linguistic traditions were shared with the Ahiarmiut, Hauniqtuurmiut, Paallirmiut, and Qairnirmiut. By the 19th century, the Harvaqtuurmiut and the Qairnirmiut were known to live inland and to the north. While according to Vallee (1962), they were known to rarely visit the coast and on those occasions, they came to trade but did not hunt sea mammals, Kuoljok (1969) stated that sea mammals held some importance during the summer for the Harvaqtuurmiut. While they engaged in the fur trade, their primary focus was the Barren-ground Caribou as they relied on it for subsistence and it determined where they built their homes. They specialized in hunting at autumn river-crossings. They used kayaks characterized as being sleek and of well made design. The Harvaqtuurmiut society had its own traditions. Niqaptaq was a goose hunting ritual involving strings with bones ties at the ends that were spun overhead and when they wrapped around a goose's neck, the goose fell to the ground. They used moss smoke in their tents as a mosquito repellent. Dried moss, collected in the summer, was used as a fuel lighting mechanism. Drum dances might be incorporated into asking questions of Shamans. Drum dancing movement is up to the individual and might include bending at the knee, moving in a circle, standing still, moving in a procession, moving back and forth, running, or jumping. According to Rasmussen (1927), the Harvaqtuurmiut believed in Pinga, an Inuit female spirit, who was watchful of people's conduct, rewarding and punishing them based on how they behaved.Vallee, p. 167 Harvaqtuurmiut followed five seasons: Upinraqhaaq (a time of snow melt), Upinraaq (July and early August), Aujahajuq or Aujaq (mid- August to September), Ukiaqhaq or Ukiaq (October to early November), and Ukiuq (mid-November to April).Keith, pp. 6-10 ReferencesExternal links * Photos Category:Indigenous peoples in Northern Canada Category:Caribou Inuit Category:Kivalliq Region ","title":"Harvaqtuurmiut"},{"id":"29171707","text":"The Golygina ()–°–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –≥–∏–¥—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω ‚Äî —á–ª–µ–Ω–æ–≤ –°–ù–ì, Federal Service for Geodesy and Cartography of Russia, 1999, p. 104 is a river on the southwest coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula.

PWC office building to the right and KLP office building to the left at Operakvarteret Oslo is an important centre of maritime knowledge in Europe and is home to approximately 980 companies and 8,500 employees within the maritime sector, some of which are the world's largest shipping companies, shipbrokers, and insurance brokers.Oslo Teknopol Mal Det Norske Veritas, headquartered at H√∏vik outside Oslo, is one of the three major maritime classification societies in the world, with 16.5% of the world fleet to class in its register.Dnv.com The city's port is the largest general cargo port in the country and its leading passenger gateway. Close to 6,000 ships dock at the Port of Oslo annually with a total of 6 million tonnes of cargo and over five million passengers. The gross domestic product of Oslo totaled NOK268 billion (‚Ç¨34 billion) in 2003, which amounted to 17% of the national GDP. This compares with NOK166 billion (‚Ç¨21 billion) in 1995. The metropolitan area, bar Moss and Drammen, contributed 25% of the national GDP in 2003 and was also responsible for more than one quarter of tax revenues. In comparison, total tax revenues from the oil and gas industry on the Norwegian Continental Shelf amounted to about 16%. Cost of living Oslo is one of the most expensive cities in the world. As of 2006, it is ranked tenth according to the Worldwide Cost of Living Survey provided by Mercer Human Resource Consulting and first according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The reason for this discrepancy is that the EIU omits certain factors from its final index calculation, most notably housing. Although Oslo does have the most expensive housing market in Norway, it is comparably cheaper than other cities on the list in that regard. Meanwhile, prices on goods and services remain some of the highest of any city. Oslo is hosting 2654 of the largest companies in Norway. Within the ranking of Europe's largest cities ordered by their number of companies Oslo is on position 5. A whole group of oil and gas companies is situated in Oslo. According to a report compiled by Swiss bank UBS in the month of August 2006,Yahoo! News Oslo and London were the world's most expensive cities. Energy The Oslo region possesses a unique competency gained through its central role in 100 years of hydropower production and close to 40 years of offshore petroleum development. Oslo is the main location for Norwegian research and development, and many of the institutions are clustered in the area around the University of Oslo, the largest in Northern Europe. At the University of Oslo several research groups are engaged in energy research, including work on new renewable energy sources and petroleum-related issues. Other important institutions in this field are the Norwegian Geotechnical Research Institute, Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research, the Norwegian Building Research Institute (energy efficiency, ventilation technology and indoor air quality) and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. The Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research, with its 1800 employees, is the largest independent research organisation in Scandinavia. SINTEF's headquarters are in Trondheim, but it conducts extensive research activities, primarily within oil and gas exploration and production, in the Gaustadbekk Valley. Located in the heart of the Gaustadbekk Valley, the Oslo Innovation Center is the leading business incubator in the region. The park is strongly committed to the commercialisation of ideas and results from research environments through creating favourable conditions for business start-ups. The center has recently constructed an environmental technology wing to accommodate the ever-growing need for research into Renewable energy and climate-friendly technologies. ICT Fornebu, west of Bygd√∏y is the ever-changing IT district in Oslo where Telenor's headquarters are located. Telenor Arena can be seen on the right. The Oslo region is in the midst of a \\"mobile adventure\\". Norwegians' desire for more efficient, entertaining and mobile ways of communication has placed them in the forefront of adapting and developing new products and services. Norway is among the world's leading information societies and widely regarded as having a highly developed mobile market. The Oslo region is a key driver and centre for research, development and business. A combination of unique expertise, strong R&D; environments and advanced users with high purchasing power has made the Oslo region an excellent test market for new and innovative ICT products. Recent years have witnessed a large number of business start-ups in the region, and several internationally renowned companies have chosen to locate here such as Google Inc and Microsoft Norway. The Norwegian topography naturally lends itself to mobile communication with its vast and practically impenetrable mountainous areas and plateaus‚Äîfactors which have made Norway a pioneer in new communication techniques and advanced technologies. Norwegian research contribution was crucial when the world's first automatic mobile net NMT 450 was launched in 1981, and today's global GSM-standard was invented in Norway by Telenor. Many promising companies are contributing to the growing mobile and wireless cluster in Oslo. Wireless Future (Tr√•dl√∏s Fremtid) is established as a cluster building initiative, involving most of the key players from business and R&D; in Norway. Tandberg is known for its video conference systems and the Kongsberg Group has developed a wide spectrum of technological products for the defence and maritime industry. The list of companies with international success are rising, with prime examples like Opera Software, the game producer Funcom and Chipcon, which in 2006 was sold to Texas Instruments. FAST, which has become a global market leader in search engineers, has been appointed a Norwegian Centre for Research-based Innovation (SFI) thanks to its Information Access. Telenor, Norway's largest ICT-company, with head office located at Fornebu, just outside Oslo is emerging as one of the fastest growing providers of mobile communications services worldwide. In 2007, Telenor surpassed 136 million mobile subscriptions worldwide, placing it as the 7th largest mobile operator in the world. The Telenor Group was ranked the best Mobile Telecom company in the world by the Sustainability Yearbook 2008. With the Department of Informatics, the University of Oslo is the largest educational institution for ICT within the region. Together with the Norwegian Computing Center and SINTEF, the Department of Informatics provides Norway with an important research environment for ICT. Other renowned R&D; environments are found at Fornebu, Kjeller, Halden and Horten. Maritime Norway's maritime industry is built on the expertise gained from centuries as a shipping nation, with Oslo at the main centre. Maritime companies locate in Oslo to be part of a complete and innovative cluster of shipping companies and a range of specialized maritime services. For investors and partners, the strength and the international position of the maritime cluster in Oslo offers many attractive opportunities. In a special report on Oslo from November 12, 2008, Lloyd's List highlights the diversity and strength of the Oslo maritime cluster. According to Lloyd's, \\"Oslo remains Norway's largest hub for international shipping and related industries with a range of businesses from shipping to financial services and maritime research, with few rivals worldwide\\". Though Norway is still feeling the repercussions of a long tax debate, Lloyd's characterizes the concentration of shipowners based in the Norwegian capital as \\"impressive\\". With the advent of a favourable shipping tax, Oslo shipowners together with leading service companies have turned their attention to developing high-tech and environmentally friendly solutions for the industry. Leading classification society Det Norske Veritas (DNV) is a major contributor to these developments, with a range of research initiatives connected to green shipping, safety and the environment. The financial sector in Oslo continues to support industry activity, with Oslo B√∏rs and Imarex trading shipping shares and freight derivatives, maritime banking giants DnB NOR and Nordea, and leading brokerage houses like Fearnlys, Pareto and RS Platou. Oslo Maritime Network (OMN) is a non-profit collaborative network organisation gathering members from all segments of the maritime cluster in Norway's capital region. Research In 2004, the Oslo region was ranked six on innovation in a comparison with the regions of the European Union. The Oslo region gets top scores on lifelong learning, working population with tertiary education and public R&D; expenses per capita. But it is also among Europe‚Äôs most developed regions in relation to high-tech employment and innovation co- operation in medium-sized enterprises. At the national level, the 2005 European Innovation Scoreboard shows that Norway is one of the most innovative countries in Europe in relation to the most innovative sectors, i.e. business services and computer and related activities. The knowledge environment in the Oslo region is the force behind an international level of R&D; in a number of specialist areas. With short distances and a transparent community, it is easy to develop interdisciplinary collaboration. The University of Oslo holds four Nobel Prizes and is the largest knowledge institution in the region, with 30 000 students and 4 600 employees. It is located at Gaustad/Blindern, the prime location for R&D; in the city of Oslo. Other R&D; hubs in the region are found at √Ös, Kjeller, Kongsberg, Fornebu, Horten and Halden. Cost-saving technology is a top priority for Norwegian businesses and Norwegians are quick to pick up new and innovative technological products and ideas, and use them in their daily lives. The European Innovation Scoreboard 2003 puts Norway second after Denmark on its innovation take-up barometer. Norwegians use on average only four years to start using new technologies and Norway in general and the Oslo region in particular are excellent test-beds for new innovative technological products and ideas. The Oslo region has seen a strong growth of actors in the regional innovation support system in recent years. The regional innovation support system is made up of 23 different actors, including technology transfer offices, science parks, business incubators, venture capitalists and a range of other companies and programmes providing support and assistance in the process of commercialising research based ideas and helping entrepreneurs developing their businesses into the international market place.

Follies lost to singer Linda Ronstadt, who won for her performance on Great Performances on PBS that year. Snowden also assisted with the puppetry for the character Chucky in the horror films Child's Play 2 (1990) and Child's Play 3 (1991). His other film credits included work on Beetlejuice (1988), Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991), Dracula (1992), Alien Resurrection (1997), Starship Troopers (1997) and The X-Files (1988). During the 1980s, Snowden became the lead puppeteer on the television series Pee-wee's Playhouse. He also performed the puppetry for the Crypt Keeper on Tales from the Crypt, an anthology series which aired from 1989 until 1996. His last television credit was as H.R. Pufnstuf on an episode of My Name is Earl in 2007. Snowden also worked for the puppeteer division of Hasbro and its Tiger Electronics division. He was part of the puppetry and programming team which developed the body, mouth and eye movements for such interactive toys as Furby, E.T., Gizmo and Yoda. Snowden headed Hasbro's puppeteer division for the last three years of his life and career.

He played college football at the University of Michigan. Early years White began his football career at Memorial Junior High School, and spent two years at Orlando's William R. Boone High School. He then moved to Titusville High School for his junior and senior years. As a senior in 1982, White was selected as a Parade High School All-American. As a two-way player, he led Titusville to the Florida High School Athletic Association Class AAA football championship. After White dominated the Region 5 playoff game, the Lakeland Ledger wrote: > The 6-foot-2, 205-pound White rumbled for 178 yards and two touchdowns as > the Terriers blanked Lake Wales 33-0. White did it all. He even punted twice > for a 46.5-yard average ... He finished the first half with 138 yards. Two weeks later, White led Titusville to a 29-0 win over Homestead in the Class AAA state semi-final game, rushing for 118 yards and two touchdowns and kicking a 27-yard field goal. In the state championship game, Titusville defeated Kissimmee Osceola 33-0 as White rushed 12 times for 139 yards and a touchdown. White later recalled playing football for coach Al Werneke at Titusville: \\"The closeness and camaraderie are what I remember most about our high school teams. We loved coach Werneke and enjoyed each other, and it was culminated by winning the state championship.\\" White rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of his final three seasons and was a two-time All-America. As a high school football player, he was known as \\"Stardust\\", a nickname that reportedly \\"evolved from his fascination for the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas, where he lived before moving to Florida\\". College career In 1983, White accepted a football scholarship from the University of Michigan. He played for the Michigan Wolverines football team under head coach Bo Schembechler from 1983 to 1986. As a freshman in 1983, White appeared in three games for the Wolverines, gaining 64 yards in 20 carries. As a sophomore in 1984, White appeared in seven games and started two games at the tailback position. He gained 345 yards on 91 carries, including 89 yards in Michigan's 22-14 victory over the Miami Hurricanes in the season opener. After the Miami game, Schembechler praised White's effort: \\"We did not block well. I thought (tailback Gerald) White, under the circumstances with no blocking, ran good. He made some tough yards.\\" As a junior in 1985, coach Bo Schembechler converted White from a tailback to a fullback. Though White had previously resisted efforts to have him play fullback, White later recalled, \\"But it was the best thing that ever happened to me, because I learned more about the game.\\" White started all 12 games for the Wolverines at the fullback position. The 1985 Michigan football team, with White, Jamie Morris and Jim Harbaugh in the backfield, compiled a record of 10-1-1, outscored opponents 342 to 98 and finished the season ranked No. 2 in both the AP and UPI polls. During the 1985 season, White gained 564 rushing yards on 133 carries and 123 receiving yards on 18 catches. He also led the team with 11 total touchdowns (seven rushing and four receiving) on the season. He had his career-best game in Michigan's 27-17 victory over Ohio State, as he rushed for 110 yards on 29 carries and added 23 receiving yards on three catches. He also scored the go-ahead touchdown in Michigan's 27-23 victory over Nebraska in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl. As a senior in 1986, White started 11 of 13 games for the Wolverines at fullback. With the same starting backfield of White, Morris and Harbaugh, the 1986 team finished 11-1 in the regular season and was ranked No. 8 in the AP poll and No. 7 in the UPI poll. The team advanced to the 1987 Rose Bowl, losing to Arizona State by a score of 22-15. White totaled 323 rushing yards (fourth on the team) on 88 carries and 408 receiving yards (third on the team) on 38 catches (led the team). He scored eight touchdowns (tied for the team lead), five rushing and three receiving, during the 1986 season. In the 1987 Rose Bowl, White caught a pass from Mike Gillette in the end zone for a two- point conversion on a fake kick. At the end of the 1986 season, White also played in the 1987 Hula Bowl. In four years at Michigan, White totaled 1,864 yard of offense for the Wolverines. He rushed for 1,297 yards, caught 64 passes for 567 yards and scored 19 touchdowns. Interviewed in 1997, White said, \\"The highlight of playing at Michigan, more than rushing for 110 yards against Ohio State and going to the Rose Bowl, was playing for Bo Schembechler. You either loved or hated Bo, but I loved him. I loved him because he taught me so much about life.\\" Professional career=Dallas Cowboys White was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1987 NFL Draft. He was released on September 1. After the NFLPA strike was declared on the third week of the 1987 season, those contests were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. He was re-signed to be a part of the Dallas replacement team that was given the mock name \\"Rhinestone Cowboys\\" by the media. On being named to the Cowboys' lineup, White called it a \\"dream\\". He started all 3 games at fullback, making five receptions for 46 yards. He was waived at the end of the strike on October 26. In 1988, White was signed by the Cowboys as a free agent. He was cut at the end of training camp on August 29. Miami Dolphins In May 1989, White signed as a free agent with the Miami Dolphins. He was cut on September 4. During his career in football, White played for Bo Schembechler at Michigan, Tom Landry at Dallas and Don Shula at Miami. Personal life After White retired from football, he moved to Atlanta, where he worked for two years for the Hooters restaurant organization. He later formed G-Sport Management and Marketing, a sports marketing company in Orlando. In 1997, White was the manager of promotions for Champion sportswear in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. At the time, White recalled, \\"I played for some of the best coaches ever. I don't want to coach because of the attitudes of some of today's players, but I apply what I learned to the business world. Sacrifice, trust and perfecting what you do are important, no matter what you do.\\" In 2005, White formed Gerald White International, LLC, a marketing and events company. He is also the managing partner of LudaJuice, Inc. In April 2010, Gerald White International moved its headquarters from Miami Beach, Florida, to Ann Arbor, Michigan. The firm's clients include the National Athletic Association and The Ludacris Foundation.

Dubin met and worked with Paul Tudor Jones. In 1984, Glenn Dubin and his childhood friend Henry Swieca co-founded Dubin & Swieca Capital Management. The company was an early fund of funds business that constructed multi-manager hedge fund portfolios guided by the principles of modern portfolio theory. In 2005, the firm was renamed Corbin Capital Partners, as Dubin and Swieca were no longer involved in the day-to-day management of the company. The new name reportedly originated from an intersection in Washington Heights where the founders first met when they were 5 years old. In 1992, Dubin and Swieca founded Highbridge Capital Management with $35 million in capital, naming the institutional alternative-asset management firm after the 19th Century aqueduct that connects Washington Heights with the Bronx. In late 2004, J.P. Morgan Asset Management‚Äîa division of JPMorgan Chase‚Äîpurchased a majority interest in Highbridge. The Financial Times reported in 2006 that JPMorgan paid Glenn Dubin an \\"an estimated $1bn in 2004\\" for his majority stake in Highbridge Capital Management. In July 2009, J.P. Morgan Asset Management completed its purchase of substantially all remaining shares of the firm. After the purchase, Dubin remained Highbridge‚Äôs chief executive. By 2011, Dubin was sharing responsibilities for managing Highbridge with Todd Builione and Scott Kapnick. By 2013, Glenn Dubin had \\"handed control\\" of Highbridge to Scott Kapnick a former Goldman Sachs banker, but continued to work in the firm‚Äôs New York offices. In 2013, Dubin founded the quantitative- trading firm Engineers Gate Manager LP. The company along with Dubin's family office are headquartered at Hudson Yards. In January 2020, Dubin announced he was retiring from the hedge fund industry after four decades to focus on private investments. Investments In 2006, Highbridge invested as a joint venture in Louis Dreyfus Group to increase their access to and control of energy delivery within trading markets. In October 2012, it was announced that Dubin, Paul Tudor Jones and Timothy Barakett were among a group of investors buying the merchant energy operation, then called Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy (\\"LDH Energy\\"), and renamed the firm Castleton Commodities International, LLC. Philanthropy In 1987, Dubin was asked by fellow hedge fund manager and close friend Paul Tudor Jones to join him and Peter Borish in a venture philanthropy project Jones had conceived and started. The resulting Robin Hood Foundation has raised and granted more than $2 billion to fight poverty in New York City. Dubin has served on the board since its founding, is a former Board Chair, and sits on the Jobs and Economic Security subcommittee. In 2010, Dubin established the Dubin Fellowship for Emerging Leaders at the Center for Public Leadership, an academic research center at Harvard Kennedy School, with a $5 million gift. He had formed a relationship with the school two years prior while speaking before the school's students. The fellowship provides tuition for up to ten students each year. Dubin also serves on the Kennedy School‚Äôs Dean's Executive Committee. In 2010, the Dubin family donated $4.3 million to Stony Brook University towards the creation of the Dubin Family Athletic Performance Center in the Stony Brook Indoor Sports Complex. In 2015, the Dubin family donated $5 million towards the creation of Stony Brook University's Indoor Training Facility, which opened in 2020. Dubin is a trustee of the Mt. Sinai Medical Center. He and his wife funded the Dubin Breast Center of the Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai in 2010 to provide comprehensive integrated breast care in a patient-centered environment. The multidisciplinary Center is headed by Dr. Elisa Port. On April 19, 2012, Dubin and his wife Eva signed The Giving Pledge, created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The commitment of the pledge is to give away at least 50% of their wealth to charity within their lifetime. Personal life In 1994, Dubin married Dr. Eva Andersson and the couple has three children (two daughters and a son). He first saw Eva on the New York Post's Page Six in a modeling photo. The Dubins live in Manhattan and own property in Colorado's Gunnison County as well as in Sweden. Legal In August 2019, unsealed documents revealed connections between Dubin and Jeffrey Epstein, including allegations of involvement in his sexual abuse ring. Former house manager for the Dubins, Rinaldo Rizzo, described a 2005 encounter at the Dubin's home with a 15-year- old girl employed as a nanny. Rizzo said the girl, who was shaking and crying, told him that she was pressured by Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with Epstein, with Maxwell taking her passport when she refused. A month into her employ, according to The Daily Beast, the Dubins took the girl with them to Sweden, where she was dropped off at an airport. The unsealed court documents were from a lawsuit filed in 2015 against Maxwell by Virginia Roberts Giuffre who named several individuals as participants in Epstein's sex trafficking scheme that included Glenn Dubin as one of the men with which Epstein and Maxwell forced her to have sex. In September 2020 the Attorney General of the British Virgin Islands subpoenaed the Dubins as part of their probe into the dealings of Jeffrey Epstein.

Nationality by birth  Colombia and Dominican Republic are the only countries in the continental Americas that does not grant automatic birthright citizenship. To obtain Colombian citizenship at birth, a person must have at least one parent who is a citizen or legal resident of Colombia. A child born outside Colombia who has at least one Colombian parent can be registered as a Colombian national by birth, either upon returning to Colombia (for residents) or at a consulate abroad (for non-residents).  Nationality by naturalization  A person who has lived in Colombia as a legal permanent resident for five years may apply for naturalization with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. There are exceptions to the usual residence requirements in some cases, including: * one year of residence for citizens by birth of a Latin American or a Caribbean country; * two years' residence for citizens by birth of Spain; * two years' residence for a person married to a Colombian citizen or parent of child holding, or eligible for, Colombian citizenship; * five years' residence for foreigners who are not Latin American, Caribbean or Spanish citizens. Colombian nationality confers the right to acquire a Colombian passport.  Tests  Applicants for naturalization must also pass a test on Colombia's history, geography and constitution. A Spanish-language aptitude test is also required for people who are not native Spanish-speakers. Those who have a bachelor's degree from a Colombian university or are over 65 years old are exempt from the tests.  Dual nationality  Colombian nationality law acknowledges that a Colombian by birth or by naturalization can also have other nationalities. Colombians who acquired Colombian nationality by birth cannot be deprived of it under any circumstances, so acquiring another nationality does not in itself result in the loss of Colombian nationality. A person who renounced their Colombian nationality may recover it later. Nevertheless, certain government positions are barred for those with dual citizenship. For example, career diplomats may not hold dual citizenship as per Colombian law; an individual with dual citizenship may be appointed to a diplomatic position, but cannot acquire career rights.  Colombian citizenship  Colombian law differentiates between nationality and citizenship. Nationality is the attribute of the person in international law that describes their relationship to the State, whereas citizenship is given to those nationals (i.e. those that hold Colombian nationality) that have certain rights and responsibilities to the State. Article 98 of the Colombian constitution establishes that Colombian citizens are those nationals that are 18 years of age or older. Colombian citizens are entitled to vote in elections and exercise the public action of unconstitutionality.  Renunciation of citizenship  Colombian citizens can renounce their citizenship. The process of renunciation requires the citizen to appear at a Colombian embassy or consulate if the petitioner lives outside of Colombia, or at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs if the petitioner resides in Colombia. To start the process of renouncing Colombian citizenship, the petitioner must hold a citizenship from a different country.

Pew Research Center History Relations between Iran and Lebanon during the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi occurred in two phases: The first phase lasted from the mid-1950s to the 1967 June war and was closely affected by the policies of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, which led the Shah to support the government of Lebanon as well as other anti-Nasser governments in the Middle East; the second phase, from 1967 to 1979, witnessed tense relations because anti-Shah groups were trained by Palestinian militant organisations in Lebanon during this time span.

Additionally, 58 percent considered Iranian projects and plans in Lebanon did not conflict with Lebanese interests; and 80 percent approved of Iran's proposed aid to the Lebanese army, with 86 percent considered US and French stances against the visit as interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. Following the visit, Hamas also invited Ahmadenijad to Gaza. Rising anti-Iranian sentiment Following the involvement of Hezbollah, and increasing economic demise of Lebanon, Iran, for the first time, became antagonized for its meddling on the Lebanese sectarian system, as well as growing violent attacks by Hezbollah supporters toward the Lebanese protesters.

Before 1861, southerners loyal to the Union were generally respected as principled idealists. As southern states began to actually secede, however, those who had seceded viewed southerners who remained Unionists as cowardly and lacking the strength to stand up for their own rights. Following the winter of 1861, popular sentiment in the Deep South held that the north was unwilling to compromise with the south. The Deep South would rather secede from the Union than relinquish sovereignty. Consequently, \\"submissionist\\" was a derogatory name for a southerner who would seemingly relinquish sovereignty in order to remain in the Union.Ayers, Edward L. In the Presence of Mine Enemies: The Civil War in the Heart of America, 1859-1863. New York: Norton, 2003. Print. The term was used also to describe a particular kind of cooperationist, that is, those who were generally opposed to secession; Louisiana politician Pierre Soul√©, for instance, a cooperationist, protested that he was \\"no submissionist\\" and would choose revolution (i.e., secession) rather than ignominy. Thomas T. Gantt, however, Provost Marshal General of the District of Missouri, proudly called himself a submissionist at the Missouri State Convention on March 15, 1861. Edmund Ruffin, who is credited with firing the first shot at the Battle of Fort Sumter, noted in his diary, September 3, 1861, \\"As a general rule, the Submissionist party embraces, & is largely composed of, the old, the timid, the cowardly, the imbecile & the mean-spirited.\\" References Category:Politics of the Confederate States Category:Separatism in the United States ","title":"Submissionist"},{"id":"29172471","text":"Dreams to Reality is a 1997 third-person action-adventure game developed and published by Cryo Interactive.

Michel Bulteau is a French poet, essayist, occasional musician and experimental filmmaker, born on 8 October 1949 in Arcueil. Biography When he was twenty-two, he contributed with seventeen other young poets, including Matthieu Messagier, Jean-Jacques Faussot, Jacques Ferry, Patrick Geoffrois and Thierry Lamarre to a poetry bundle entitled 'Manifeste √âlectrique aux paupi√®res de jupes' (Electrical Manifesto with Eyelids of Skirts), which was published in 1971 by Le Soleil Noir. The poetry bundle entitled 'Manifeste √âlectrique aux paupi√®res de jupes' was a literary manifest that caused a stir in the literary world. Encouraged by the Belgian- French poet and writer, Henri Michaux, he continued his quest as a rebellious poet. In 1976, he moved to New York where he became friends with beat writers, painters and pop punk musicians. Bulteau is, in the words of William S. Burroughs, an \\"explorer of untouched psychic areas.\\" Work Michel Bulteau was only twenty-one years when '7, Retomba des nuits' (1970), his first book of poetry, was published. The poems in this collection are dark, tragic and desperate and are a reflection of the violence and freedom of the Beat Generation as well as the generation of black surrealism. He would publish many more poetry collections which are all characterised by a hypersensibility. This places him firmly in the tradition of great French writers such as Baudelaire, Nerval and Rimbaud. Bulteau has written that \\"Being modern is the most dangerous artistic route. Being modern means refusing to be untrue, unreal.\\"(A√©rer le pr√©sent, 1999). Michel Bulteau has written more than sixty books including poetry books, biographies of famous persons associated with the beat generation and avant-garde art scene (Allen Ginsberg, James Dean, Andy Warhol) as well as journals and essays. He has been an editor of the Nouvelle Revue de Paris in which he published Houellebecq's early poems. Michel Bulteau is also active as a musician. He was the lead singer of Mahogany Brain, a band with which he aimed to realise his ideal of a marriage between poetry and rock'n roll. The band played pre-punk music that was influenced by drugs (the original cover of their debut showed an arm with a syringe). Their music was a crossing of Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat and Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica. The band was quite short-lived: they played their only concert in the summer of 1970 at the Lucemarie during which Bulteau threw bricks at the few members of the audience. After that they became a studio band recording two records. In December 1970 Mahogany Brain recorded the album With (Junk-Saucepan) When (Spoon-Trigger) released by the Futura label early the next year and they also provided the soundtrack to a short film of Bulteau's, Main Line. Another record, Smooth Sick Lights, was recorded on a single day in June 1972, but only released several years in 1976 later by the Pole label. Mahogony Brain issued a new record under the title With/Without in 2004 on Mello Records. Michel Bulteau has recorded a maxi 45 with Elliott Murphy (1989) and a further three solo albums during the nineties and in 2004. Michel Bulteau has directed and contributed to a number of avant-garde movies which place him in the tradition of experimental directors such as Kenneth Anger, Stan Brackage and Jean Cocteau. In Fiction Michel Bulteau appears as a character in the novel The Savage Detectives by Chilean author Roberto Bola√±o. In the novel Michel Bulteau meets Ulises Lima, one of the main characters of the novel, in Paris circa 1976. Later, a Peruvian poet, Roberto Rosas, becomes obsessed with his poem \\"Sang de Satin\\" as he is trying to translate it into Spanish.

The mine became known internationally for its collapse in 2010, which trapped 33 miners underground. Its workings are reached by a long sloping roadway with many spiral turns (a diagram shows ten turns), not by a vertical mineshaft. History Diagram of mine layout The San Jos√© Mine is located 45 kilometers northwest of Copiap√≥. The mine began operations in 1889. In 1957, Jorge Kemeny Letay, a Hungarian immigrant founded the San Esteban Mining Company (). According to Terra, the mine's annual sales surpassed 20 million dollars. Between 2003 and 2010, several mining accidents occurred in the mine, causing at least three deaths. In 2007, a geologist was killed in the mine, and led to its closure. It was reopened in May 2008 by SERNAGEOMIN ‚Äì Servicio Nacional de Geolog√≠a y Miner√≠a (National Geology and Mining Service). In July 2010, miner Gino Cort√©s lost a leg in an accident. 2010 cave-in Compa√±√≠a Minera San Esteban () advised national authorities on 5 August 2010 that a collapse had occurred at 14:00 local time, and rescue efforts began the next day. National Emergencies Office of Chile reported that day a list of 33 trapped and possibly deceased miners, that included Franklin Lobos, a retired footballer, and Carlos Mamani, a Bolivian miner. The miners were found alive 17 days later, on August 22. Nonetheless, it was not until 69 days after the collapse on October 13, 2010, that the first miner, Florencio √Åvalos, was rescued. San Esteban Mining Company is considering bankruptcy after the miners are rescued. San Jos√© is the only mine owned by San Esteban.

Louis Bakanowsky, the founder of Cambridge Seven, stated, \\"(...) the challenge of modern sculpture is not the making of closed, volumetric objects. Instead, today's sculpture must deal with issues of space, movement and address a much wider set of references... [this work will] create a resonance between the viewer's own inner rhythms and those of the larger world of nature.\\" Gift of the Wind was originally planned to extend down into the subway station proper. When the work rotated due to the wind, a link, through a \\"large light shaft\\" would make a selection of hammers strike chimes in the station. This concept was later abandoned. Boorstin, Robert O.

Early life  His name at birth was David Cohen, but when he was a young man he changed his name because there was already a photographer with that name. He was born in Boston but grew up in Winthrop, Massachusetts.  Education  He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1961. He began making photographs in 1969. He went on to study with Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind at the Rhode Island School of Design, and he received a Master's in Fine Arts from there in 1973.  Career  He worked in several formats both in documentary style and in manipulated imagery when he re-photographed his own photographs and then used copy machines to create distortions that heightened the emotional content of the photograph. In 1985, Akiba received a MassProductions grant to photograph the Frederick Law Olmsted‚Äôs Emerald Necklace park system for two years, which led to a series of related exhibitions once the work was completed. In 2005, Akiba completed the work Through the Lens: A Separate Journey. This work is a photographic diary of his son Jonah becoming a Hassidic Jew after being raised in a non-religious household and it shows the impact this transformation has had on David and his son Daniel. A few years prior, Daniel had created a critically acclaimed short documentary called My Brother's Wedding, which featured some of his father David Akiba's photographs. They held several joint exhibitions of David's family photos alongside screenings of the video. His work has been exhibited widely at galleries in Boston and around the world, and is currently part of several permanent collections including in the collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Art, Fogg Art Museum, Center for Creative Photography, DeCordova Museum, Brooklyn Museum and others. Akiba's photographs of the MBTA were included in the photo book, Images of Rail: Boston‚Äôs Orange Line. These photographs were from 1985, when he was selected to be one of five photographers who photographed the Elevated Orange Line between Forest Hills and downtown Boston before its 1988 planned demolition. Akiba's work is included in Sinclair Hitchings's Art in Boston project which is part art collection and part research reference library for Boston-based art. He taught part-time at Babson College, Emerson College, and the New England School of Photography.  Personal life  David had six children from two marriages. He lived in Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston with his wife Jane (n√©e Levin). Jane is a portrait photographer and also teaches at Emerson College. David's son Isaac Akiba is currently a member of the Boston Ballet, having become the first person from Boston's public school dance program to make it into the elite ballet troupe. David created a photo series inspired by the dancers.

Scholars Alex Mayer and S. Majid Hassanizadeh define LNAPL transmissivity as the \\"product of the porous medium permeability and the LNAPL relative permeability, which in turn is a function of saturation, and the thickness of the LNAPL\\". They wrote that once LNAPL is taken away, a lower recovery rate occurs because the \\"saturation and thickness of the mobile LNAPL fraction decreases\\". LNAPL transmissivity is a summary parameter that takes into account soil type and physical properties (e.g., porosity and permeability), LNAPL physical fluid properties(e.g., density and viscosity) and LNAPL saturation (i.e., amount of LNAPL present within the pore network). Consequently, LNAPL transmissivity is comparable across soil types, LNAPL types and recoverable LNAPL volumes. More importantly, for LNAPL recovery from a given well, the soil and LNAPL physical properties do not change significantly through time. What changes, is the LNAPL saturation (amount of LNAPL present). As a result, LNAPL transmissivity decreases in direct proportion to the decrease in LNAPL saturation achievable through liquid recovery technology. LNAPL Transmissivity is not the only piece of data required when evaluating a site overall, because it requires a good LNAPL conceptual model in order to calculate. However, it is a superior summary metric to gauged LNAPL thickness to represent LNAPL recoverability and migration risk (e.g., on site maps) and direct remediation efforts.

Biography=Early years; name changes Hemdah Ben‚ÄëYehuda was born Beila Jonas in Drissa (Verkhnyadzvinsk), Belarus to Shelomo Naphtali Herz Jonas (1840‚Äì1896) and his wife Rivka Leah. She was the fifth of the seven children. During her early years she underwent several name changes. When she was nine years old, her father renamed her Belle. Upon the family's move to Moscow she became Paula. It was not until her marriage that her husband bestowed upon her the name Hemdah. Her married name is written with or without final \\"h\\": Hemda/Hemdah, Ben-Yehudah/Ben-Yehuda. In Moscow In 1882, the family settled in Moscow. Here Beilla/Paula Jonas attended Russian primary and high school before continuing to a women's college of science to study chemistry. In 1891, her eldest sister Deborah (b. 1855), who was married to Eliezer Ben- Yehuda, died of tuberculosis in Jerusalem. Only a few weeks later Ben-Yehuda, who knew Hemdah from his visits to her family, hastened to ask her to marry him, claiming that this had been Deborah's wish before her death. Paula agreed at once, but her father objected to the match, both because of the fifteen- year difference in age between the two and also because he feared that, like her sister, she would be infected by the tuberculosis from which Ben-Yehuda suffered. Move to Jerusalem In the winter of 1892, a diphtheria epidemic that broke out in Jerusalem caused the death of three of the children of Deborah and Eliezer, leaving only two, Ben-Zion (Itamar), and Yemima. During the entire period Ben-Yehuda's mother had been helping him run the household, but now, when all seemed lost, Shelomo Jonas relented. In any case, his permit to reside in Moscow had expired, so that he was compelled to leave the city. Accordingly, it was decided that the entire family would emigrate to Palestine and Paula would marry Ben-Yehuda. Jonas, his wife, Paula and the two younger children departed for Istanbul where Paula and Eliezer were married on March 29, 1892. On this occasion Ben-Yehuda changed Paula's name to Hemdah; the first Hebrew word he taught her was mafteah (key), a word which she perceived as symbolic, signifying her entrance not only into marriage but also into a new country, a new people and a new culture. Indeed, Hemdah, who was deeply involved in Russian culture, profoundly attracted to the theories of Leo Tolstoy and remote from Judaism and Zionism, abandoned everything: her studies at the college, her friends and the attractions of life in a great city. At the age of nineteen she came to develop herself in a desolate, distant land with a poverty-stricken, persecuted, consumptive widower fifteen years older than herself, and his two orphaned children. \\"First Hebrew-speaking family\\" The Jonases and Ben-Yehudas arrived in Palestine on April 15 and at once proceeded to Jerusalem. Here Hemdah learned that her role was not only that of wife and mother but also one of national-cultural dimensions: hers would be the \\"first Hebrew (-speaking) family\\", namely, the first and only Zionist family in Erez Israel who communicated with each other only in Hebrew, at a time when Hebrew was not yet fit for everyday speech and communication and certainly not for use in intimate family discourse, child-rearing and education, for which it lacked a great many words essential to daily life. Hemdah committed herself to this impossible role as part of her marriage, and the marriage ceremony was indeed presented as her acceptance of a sacred mission that could never be abandoned. She wrote: > \\"I was utterly shocked at the unbearably heavy burden which the reviver of > language placed upon my shoulders. He did not ask for my consent but for a > vow, which I gave. Ben-Yehuda‚Äôs personality was so compelling that I did not > dare to doubt my own ability. And there was no way other than to submit and > accept it all with surrender, and to go wherever he went.\\" Cultural, social and family life Hemdah made every effort to live up to her promises, though on her own terms. On all she did she imposed the dominant personality of a young, modern, secular woman whose principles of aesthetics, culture and enlightenment informed her choices and actions. Within six months she was fluent in basic Hebrew and from then on spoke only Hebrew in their home. She also made her home a model for modern life in Jerusalem; after a long day of hard work (the newspaper by which they made their living, together with its printing, was operated from their apartment) and caring for the children, she invited people of letters and culture from Erez Israel and abroad to their home, referring to this custom as creating a \\"meeting place for scholars\\" (Pirkei Avot 1:4). Above all, she became involved in all Ben- Yehuda's professional and political activities, especially the disputes with his opponents which led to bans, arrests and lawsuits that affected their livelihood and his status in the community. Hemdah's role in these matters was to calm things down, mediate and mend ruptured relations, and this she did. At the end of 1893 she succeeded in securing Ben-Yehuda's release when he and her father were imprisoned and Ha-Zevi, the newspaper on which their livelihood depended, ceased publication for fourteen months. The circumstances of the incident were as follows: During the week of Hanukkah Hemdah gave birth to her first child, Deborah. Since Ben-Yehuda was occupied with caring for her, her father edited the festive issue and published an article praising the heroism of the Maccabees. This was mistakenly interpreted by the authorities as a call to rebellion against the Ottoman rule. In 1900 the paper was reestablished under a different name, Hashkafa, with Hemdah as its official owner, the \\"holder of the firman\\". She used her connections to raise funds in Palestine and abroad to publish Ben-Yehuda's major work, the first modern Hebrew dictionary, and created comfortable working conditions in which Ben-Yehuda could carry on his research even when the house was full of children. (She bore six, two of whom‚Äîthe oldest daughter, Deborah, and a son, Ehud‚Äîdied in childhood. The four who survived were Ada, Ehud-Shelomo, Deborah-Dolah and Zilpah). She accompanied her husband on his travels to libraries and archives, met with American and European leaders, and appeared before Jewish audiences, Zionist and non-Zionist alike. Her slogan was: \\"If we have a language, we shall become a nation.\\" The Hebrew dictionary Ben-Yehuda's colossal enterprise of reviving the Hebrew language by gathering into one volume all Hebrew words, especially the neologisms of recent years, was also Hemdah's enterprise. During the thirty years of their life together, from 1892 to 1922, she furthered the dictionary volume by volume, seven in all (the first volume was published in 1908). Upon her husband's death and during the decades that followed (1922 to 1951) she did everything in her power to complete the dictionary rapidly, to its last letter. In 1923 and 1933 she established committees of scholars from Palestine and abroad to take charge of completing the work, and mobilized the Jewish world and the yishuv in Palestine to contribute financial assistance. The last volume was published in 1958, seven years after her death. Writing and other activities Hemdah Ben-Yehuda was active in three additional areas on which she left her original mark: journalism, literature and the advancement of women's status in Palestine. She began by working for Ben-Yehuda's newspaper (known at various times as Ha- Zevi, Ha-Or and Hashkafah) about a year after her arrival. In 1897 Hemdah Ben- Yehuda began writing a column called \\"Letters from Jerusalem\\" under the pen name \\"Hiddah\\" (riddle). According to Galia Yardeni, these letters \\"were an innovation in Hebrew journalism\\" because of their \\"intimate pleasantness, lightness and warmth.\\" Unlike the average contemporary Hebrew newspaper, which used ornate, clumsy diction to discuss world affairs, Hemdah's compositions, including her critical pieces, dealt with everyday human subjects. As she herself wrote, \\"I shall not write about great, weighty matters. ‚Ä¶ I shall simply write about scenes from life in Jerusalem, things we see in the marketplaces and the streets every day.\\" Hemdah Ben-Yehuda also wrote fiction, some of which was published in slim volumes (e.g. Farm of the Rechabites) by the Jerusalem publishing company of Shlomo Israel Shirizli. She collected most of her work in a book entitled Lives of the Pioneers in Erez Israel (1945). She wrote a great deal for children, including the series \\"Children‚Äôs Lives in Erez Israel\\", which was published in the Hebrew children's press in Europe (Olam Katan in Vienna and Cracow, Life and Nature in Vilna, and by the Tushiyyah Publishing House in Warsaw). Yet her major literary work was a family trilogy of which only two volumes were published: * Ben-Yehuda: His Life and Work (1940) (in a 1932 version, The Happy Warrior) and * Standard- Bearer (1944), the life of Ithamar Ben-Avi (1882‚Äì1943), the son of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. The third volume, * Devorah, Mother of the Hebrews, remained in manuscript form. These works were not only novels documenting the family's dramatic and colorful life, but also provided a Zionist narrative in which the Ben-Yehudas, who were mythical figures for her, represented the nation's founders, appearing in the threefold character of the father (Eliezer, who performed \\"sacred service\\"), the mother (Deborah, the \\"family‚Äôs idol\\" and the first woman to revive Hebrew in the speech of her children), and the son (Ithamar Ben-Avi, the \\"standard-bearer\\", the \\"guinea pig\\" in the fateful experiment of raising a child speaking only Hebrew). Like most of Hemdah Ben- Yehuda's prose, these works proved controversial since their critics, particularly those who subscribed to the school of Realism of the time, maintained that her exaggerated treatment of real-life material swept her work to the borders of fantasy and cheapened it. Final years From the end of the 1940s Hemdah's health steadily declined as a result of a fall that left her badly injured. She died on August 26, 1951.

Beavers Jr. (October 30, 1891 ‚Äì October 12, 1989) was the board chairman of Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, which at one time was the largest black-owned business west of the Mississippi. Early years George Allen Beavers Jr. was born to a poor family in Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of 12, Beavers moved with his family to California, where his father got a job with the Pacific Electric Railroad. During his summer vacations from Los Angeles High School, the younger Beavers would work for the railroad as a water boy. He graduated from high school, got married in 1911 and took a job at the German-American Bank (later Security Pacific National Bank) as an elevator operator. He was later promoted to stock clerk and then messenger at the firm. During World War I, Beavers worked at the Los Angeles Foundry as a molder's helper. He was exempt from military service due to the loss of an eye as a teenager. Business career A major activity for Beavers at this time was helping to establish the People's Independent Church of Christ. Led by entrepreneur and real estate broker J. H. Shackleford, the church was founded in 1915 and located at 1025 East 18th Street in Los Angeles. Shackleford became chairman of the board of trustees and Beavers served as acting secretary. Through his affiliations with Shackleford and the church, Beavers began selling real estate at G. W. Wheatley Real Estate. In the early 1920s, William Nickerson Jr., an insurance salesman who had recently opened the Los Angeles branch of the Texas-based American Mutual Benefit Association, approached the congregation of the People's Church and after much discussion, convinced many of its members to purchase insurance. Presumably, it was at this time that Beavers first encountered Nickerson. In 1922, after Beavers had purchased an insurance policy with American Mutual, he joined their sales team on a part-time basis. The following year, when their superintendent of agents Norman O. Houston left the firm to join Liberty Building and Loan Association, Beavers assumed his position with the company. Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company In November 1924, when Nickerson's contract with American Mutual was not renewed, he asked Beavers to join him along with Houston, to run the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company. At the time, there was little or no insurance available for the roughly 16,000 African Americans living in Los Angeles. To help meet state requirements to form a corporation, Nickerson assigned Beavers with the task of securing 500 clients who were willing to pay their premiums in advance. Beavers became the vice president of the new corporation with Nickerson as president and Houston as secretary/treasurer. They started in a small, one-room office on 1435 South Central Avenue. While the company flourished, Beavers, as did Nickerson and Houston, also became a community leader. He was recognized for community service by presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and by Los Angeles mayors spanning Fletcher Bowron to Tom Bradley. He's also the recipient of the 1959 Gold Award presented by the George Washington Carver Institute. When founder William Nickerson Jr. died in 1945, Beavers became chairman of the board. In 1962, he was elected President of the National Insurance Association, a trade organization representing 48 black-owned insurance companies. Beavers served as board chairman of Golden State until 1966, when he resigned from the position citing health reasons. Later years Beavers was a Brother of the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. Beavers died in Los Angeles on October 12, 1989. At the time of his death, Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company was the third largest black insurance company with offices in 22 states and the District of Columbia.

The AS 42 Sahariana was developed by SPA-Viberti using the same chassis as the AB 41 armoured car, including its four-wheel steering, but with a 2x4 transmission specifically for desert operations, primarily in a reconnaissance role. Its origins trace back to requests stemming from units operating on the North African Front for a long range, highly manoeuvrable vehicle, similar to those widely used by the highly successful British reconnaissance forces, the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG). Design The Camionetta Desertica AS.42 Sahariana was a 4x2 unarmoured vehicle with a boat hull based on the chassis of the AB 41 armoured car, but with a 2x4 transmission. The 100 Horse Power SPA ABM 3 6 cylinder petrol engine was located in the rear which gave enough space in the middle of the hull to accommodate up to five fully equipped men and weapons, though the mission crew seldom exceeded three or four. The open compartment's only overhead protection was a waterproof canvas sheet. Besides the driver‚Äôs seat, the crew that served the on board weapons were seated on four folding seats on the sides. The AS 42 had internal fuel tanks of 145 liters with an additional 20 jerrycans externally mounted on both sides between the wheels plus 4 on the front fenders, holding a total of 80 liters of water and 400 liters of fuel. A full fuel tank and the additional fuel canisters allowed a maximum range of . A second model, called Camionetta II or Metropolitana, entered service in Italy in 1943. It differed from the first model by the absence of the two upper side rows of gasoline jerrycans, replaced by two large caissons for ammunition, and the presence of a canvas top. In addition, this version was fitted with new Pirelli Artiglio tires adapted to mud and snow of the mainland, unlike the previous Pirelli Tipo Libia or Superflex sand tires. Various armament combinations were used, which included: * one or two 8 mm Breda model 37 machine-gun * 20 mm Breda model 35 gun * 20 mm Solothurn S18/1000 anti-tank rifle * 47 mm Breda 47/32 gun Service The AS 42 Sahariana's performance was very good. From September to November 1942, the first batch of 14 vehicles was delivered to the Regio Esercito. The unit that gave the AS 42 its baptism of fire in November of 1942 was the ‚ÄúRaggruppamento Sahariano AS‚Äù (Africa Settentrionale, North Africa). The good results achieved by the ‚ÄúRaggruppamento Sahariano AS‚Äù quickly led to the formation of at least four more ‚ÄúCompagnia Arditi Camionettisti‚Äù: the 103rd, 112th, 113th, and 123rd. The ‚ÄúSahariana‚Äù was completely dedicated to desert raiding parties operating against the LRDG. Its low-profile allowed it to hide behind the dunes and wait for the arrival of the enemy unseen, and its great autonomy allowed it to chase enemy forces for long periods. Entering service in December 1942, the AS.42 participated in the final stages of the African campaign of Libya and the whole campaign of Tunisia, mainly assigned to aviation companies of the Auto-Saharan Company and the 103rd Battalion. Surviving vehicles were later used by the 2nd Battalion of the 10th Regiment in the defence of Sicily and southern Italy. The same unit and the Motorized Assault Battalion employed the ‚ÄúSahariana‚Äù and ‚ÄúMetropolitana‚Äù models in the defence of Rome on 8 September 1943. After that, a few Sahariana stayed in Northern Italy with Mussolini‚Äôs Italian Social Republic. Seven vehicles fought on the Eastern Front in the ranks of the 2. Fallschirmj√§ger Division. They soldiered throughout 1944 and 1945 as reconnaissance vehicles on the Eastern Front, in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Some of the vehicles were recovered and used by the Free Italian Battalion ‚ÄúBarbarigo‚Äù X¬™ MAS Flotilla. The end of the war didn't mean the end of the AS 42‚Äôs service, as a dozen of these vehicles were supplied to the Italian Police, and, painted cherry red, were integrated into the ranks of the Department Celeri and Departments of Public Security, seeing service until 1954. The AS 42 was fast and dependable, but nevertheless complicated to build. See also *S.P.A.

Prior to 2010 the Corruption Survey included only a few of the 34 provinces and was not able to give a national overview of the corruption situation in Afghanistan. In the 2010 National Corruption Survey, 32 out of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan were covered but the survey still faces some limitations as it was unable to survey areas that are in conflict and under pure Taliban control. IWA's research measures the evolution of corruption trends and habits in Afghanistan and produces training tools to raise awareness about corruption. The organisation also works to strengthen local capacities to prevent corruption within the Afghan public institutions, private sector, civil society organisations and the public at large.

A \\"bag\\" consists of a \\"payload\\" (the arbitrary content) and \\"tags\\", which are metadata files intended to document the storage and transfer of the bag. A required tag file contains a manifest listing every file in the payload together with its corresponding checksum. The name, BagIt, is inspired by the \\"enclose and deposit\\" method, sometimes referred to as \\"bag it and tag it\\". Bags are ideal for digital content normally kept as a collection of files. They are also well-suited to the export, for archival purposes, of content normally kept in database structures that receiving parties are unlikely to support. Relying on cross-platform (Windows and Unix) filesystem naming conventions, a bag's payload may include any number of directories and sub-directories (folders and sub-folders). A bag can specify payload content indirectly via a \\"fetch.txt\\" file that lists URLs for content that can be fetched over the network to complete the bag; simple parallelization (e.g. running 10 instances of Wget) can exploit this feature to transfer large bags very quickly. Benefits of bags include: * Wide adoption in digital libraries (e.g. the Library of Congress). * Easy to implement using ubiquitous and ordinary filesystem tools. * Content that originates as files need only be copied to the payload directory. * Compared to XML wrapping, content need not be encoded (e.g. Base64) which saves time and storage space. * Received content is ready-to-go in a familiar filesystem tree. * Easy to implement fast network transfer by running ordinary transfer tools in parallel.  Specification  BagIt is currently defined in RFC 8493. It defines a simple file naming convention used by the digital curation community for packaging up arbitrary digital content, so that it can be reliably transported via both physical media (hard disk drive, CD-ROM, DVD) and network transfers (FTP, HTTP, rsync, etc.). BagIt is also used for managing the digital preservation of content over time. Discussion about the specification and its future directions takes place on the Digital Curation discussion list. The BagIt specification is organized around the notion of a ‚Äúbag‚Äù. A bag is a named file system directory that minimally contains: * a ‚Äúdata‚Äù directory that includes the payload, or data files that comprise the digital content being preserved. Files can also be placed in subdirectories, but empty directories are not supported * at least one manifest file that itemizes the filenames present in the ‚Äúdata‚Äù directory, as well as their checksums. The particular checksum algorithm is included as part of the manifest filename. For instance a manifest file with MD5 checksums is named ‚Äúmanifest-md5.txt‚Äù * a ‚Äúbagit.txt‚Äù file that identifies the directory as a bag, the version of the BagIt specification that it adheres to, and the character encoding used for tag files On receipt of a bag a piece of software can examine the manifest file to make sure that the payload files are present, and that their checksums are correct. This allows for accidentally removed, or corrupted files to be identified. Below is an example of a minimal bag ‚Äúmyfirstbag‚Äù that encloses two files of payload. The contents of the tag files are included below their filenames. myfirstbag/ -- data  \\\\-- 27613-h  \\\\-- images  \\\\-- q172.png  \\\\-- q172.txt -- manifest-md5.txt  49afbd86a1ca9f34b677a3f09655eae9 data/27613-h/images/q172.png  408ad21d50cef31da4df6d9ed81b01a7 data/27613-h/images/q172.txt \\\\-- bagit.txt BagIt-Version: 0.97 Tag-File-Character-Encoding: UTF-8 In this example the payload happens to consist of a Portable Network Graphics image file and an Optical Character Recognition text file. In general the identification and definition of file formats is out of the scope of the BagIt specification; File attributes are likewise out of scope. The specification allows for several optional tag files (in addition to the manifest). Their character encoding must be identified in ‚Äúbagit.txt‚Äù, which itself must always be encoded in UTF-8. The specification defines the following optional tag files: * a ‚Äúbag-info.txt‚Äù file which details metadata for the bag, using colon-separated key/value pairs (similar to HTTP headers) * a tag manifest file which lists tag files and their associated checksums (e.g. ‚Äútagmanifest- md5.txt‚Äù) * a ‚Äúfetch.txt‚Äù that lists URLs where payload files can be retrieved from in addition or to replace payload files in the ‚Äúdata‚Äù directory Until version 15, the draft also described how to serialize a bag in an archive file, such as ZIP or TAR. From version 15 on, the serialization is no longer part of the specifications, but not because of technical reasons but only because of the scope and focus of the specification.  History  The BagIt specification emerged from a collaboration between The Library of Congress and the California Digital Library while transferring digital content created as part of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. The origins of the idea date back to work done at the University of Tsukuba on the \\"enclose and deposit\\" model, for mutually depositing archived resources to enable long-term digital preservation. The practice of using manifests and checksums is fairly common practice as evidenced by their use in ZIP (file format), the Deb (file format), as well as on public FTP sites. In 2007 the California Digital Library needed to transfer several terabytes of content (largely Web archiving data) to the Library of Congress. The BagIt specification allowed the content to be packaged up in \\"bags\\" with package metadata, and a manifest that detailed file checksums, which were later verified on receipt of the bags. The specification was written up as an IETF draft by John Kunze in December 2008, where it has seen several revisions before being issued as an RFC. In 2009 the Library of Congress produced a video that describes the specification and the use cases around it. In 2018, version 1.0 was published as an RFC by the Internet Engineering Task Force.

The AS.37 Autocarro Sahariano was developed from 1937 on the frame of the TL.37 artillery tractor and was especially conceived to be employed in the North African desert. The most significant improvement of this new vehicle was its increased range: 900 km with added water tanks. The A.S.37 could transport 8 men and their equipment in its rear cargo box. Overview The military authorities did not judge the problem of desert vehicles urgent, FIAT, supported by Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor of Libya launched its own initiative which resulted in the A.S.37. The first 200 A.S.37 specimens were sent Libya in 1938 and were assigned to Commando LED the Sahara Libico and to Autogruppo della Tripolitania. Marshal Balbo wanted to use A.S.37's for the motorization of the Company Sahariane, which was to have 22 vehicles. In March 1942, 584 A.S.37 were in service, and by April 30, 1943 a total of 802 were in service in North Africa. The crews of A.S.37 put forth very favourable judgements on these vehicles; their four-wheel drive and large diameter wheels prevented them from becoming easily bogged down. The A.S.37 principal defect lay in a silhouette too high and thus too visible.

Disgruntled by the neglect of army finances and the Emperor's unwillingness to consider their grievances, Komnenos and other leading commanders, including Nikephoros Bryennios and Nikephoros Botaneiates, began plotting against Michael VI, and on 8 June 1057, Komnenos was proclaimed emperor at his estates in Cappadocia. After his supporters rallied regiments from Anatolia to his cause, his army marched west towards Constantinople, and encountered the loyalist army, composed largely of regiments from Europe, near the city of Nicaea. After confronting each other for several days, the two armies finally engaged at the plain of Hades. Although the right wing of the rebel army was beaten, Komnenos himself held firm in the centre. Victory was won by his left wing, led by Katakalon Kekaumenos, which routed the imperial right, reached and entered their camp, and destroyed their tents, causing the imperial army to break and run, leaving the way open to Constantinople. With the rebel army approaching the capital, Michael VI offered Komnenos the position of Caesar and heir-apparent, but he was quickly convinced to abdicate the throne. On the next day, 1 September 1057, Isaac Komnenos was crowned emperor in Constantinople. His reign was marked by his unsuccessful attempts to reform the administration and strengthen the empire, but the opposition he aroused led to his own abdication in November 1059.  Background  The Byzantine Empire at the time of the Battle of Petroe. When Empress Theodora, the last member of the Macedonian dynasty, died in 1056, the court circle around the Empress, dominated by her household eunuchs under Leo Paraspondylos, selected Michael VI Bringas as her successor. A career bureaucrat, Michael was a weak and pliant ruler dominated by the eunuchs. Given his advanced years and lack of children, his reign was perceived as weak and unlikely to last from the start, and was plagued by rebellions. Michael VI engaged in massive promotions of individuals, but restricted this to the civilian bureaucracy, and neglected the military. This was not a trivial matter: the debasement of the Byzantine currency under Constantine IX Monomachos () had affected military pay‚Äînot coincidentally presided over by none other than Michael Bringas, who was then military logothete‚Äîand while civil officials were compensated by being raised to higher dignities, the army officers were not. This exacerbated the already simmering dislike of the military aristocracy for what, in the words of the Byzantinist Anthony Kaldellis, they considered as the \\"regime of eunuchs and civilian politicians\\" that had dominated the empire during the last decades of the Macedonian dynasty. During Easter 1057, a delegation of leading generals under Isaac Komnenos, Katakalon Kekaumenos, Michael Bourtzes, Constantine Doukas and John Doukas, appeared before the Emperor to request similar promotions. According to the eyewitness Michael Psellos, the Emperor began abusing them at once; he then made Isaac, as the leader of the deputation, and his second, Kekaumenos, stand forth, and proceeded to denounce Isaac, claiming that he was responsible for \\"all but losing Antioch\\" and \\"corrupting his army\\", being a coward and incompetent, and of having misappropriated army funds for his own use. The effect of the Emperor's attitude on the army leadership was profound, and turned them against Michael. A second delegation, this time to Strabospondylos, was received in similar manner, and a plot was formed against the Emperor, with Isaac Komnenos as its leader. The conspirators contacted the veteran general Nikephoros Bryennios, who had unsuccessfully tried to usurp the throne from Theodora, but had recently been recalled by Michael VI as commander of the Macedonian army, and he apparently agreed to support them. Soon after, Bryennios left with his troops for Asia Minor, to campaign against the Turks. Once in the Anatolic Theme, he quarrelled with the army treasurer, the patrikios John Opsaras. Bryennios not only imprisoned Opsaras, but also appropriated the army chest that Opsaras carried with him, and began to pay the soldiers as he saw fit. This act did not go unnoticed by another local commander, the patrikios Lykanthes, who regarded it as an attempt at rebellion. Lykanthes marched against Bryennios, arrested him and handed him over to Opsaras, who had Bryennios blinded.  Initial moves  A gold histamenon showing Michael VI in imperial regalia, being crowned by the Theotokos Fearing that their plot was about to be discovered, the eastern generals felt forced to act. The conspirators resident in the Anatolic Theme, Romanos Skleros, Michael Bourtzes, Nikephoros Botaneiates and the sons of Basil Argyros, hastened to find Isaac Komnenos at his estates near Kastamon in Paphlagonia, and on 8 June 1057, at a place called Gounaria, proclaimed him emperor. It is unclear whether any of the rebels held command of troops; rather, according to Kaldellis, \\"they had to canvass for support among the officers and soldiers and forge orders of imperial appointment for themselves\\". Thus the near-contemporary historian John Skylitzes reports that Kekaumenos had to forge imperial letters to mobilize the regiments (tagmata) of the Armeniac Theme, ostensibly to march against the Seljuk chieftain Samouch. Of these regiments, three were composed of mercenaries‚Äîtwo Frankish and one Russian‚Äîand two were native Byzantine‚Äîthose of Koloneia and Chaldia. Gathering these forces on the plain of Nikopolis, Kekaumenos marched west to join Komnenos. At the same time, the western regiments, and the eastern ones of the Anatolic Theme and of Charsianon, remained loyal to Michael VI. The Emperor placed this force under the command of Theodora's eunuch favourite, the proedros Theodore, who was the domestikos ton scholon (commander-in-chief) of the east, and the magistros Aaron, Isaac's brother-in-law; unlike previously, he now \\"showered the commanders and the soldiers with honours, gifts and extravagant grants of money\\" to secure their allegiance. The loyalist army crossed over into Anatolia at Chrysopolis and assembled at Nicomedia, controlling the direct route to the capital. Advance detachments were sent to demolish the Sangarius Bridge, while the army established a fortified camp at Mount Sophon (modern Sapanca Daƒüƒ±). Leaving his family with his brother at the fortress of Pemolissa on the banks of the Halys River, Komnenos in turn slowly advanced west towards Constantinople. Finding the imperial army blocking the direct route to the capital, Komnenos turned south and seized Nicaea as his base of operations. He then established his own fortified camp some 12 stadia () north of the city.  Battle  Gold histamenon struck by Isaac I Komnenos. His martial posture, bearing a naked sword, is unique among Byzantine imperial coinage. Both sides sent soldiers out to forage and collect wood, and over several days, the soldiers from both camps, often friends or relatives, met one another and tried to persuade the other side to defect. Initially, the commanders of the two armies tried to take advantage of this, sending \\"men skilled in argument\\" to induce the other side to defect, but without much effect. Eventually Isaac Komnenos ordered his men to stay closer to their camp, and to be more careful in contact with the loyalists. This was interpreted by the loyalist soldiers as a sign of weakness, and they urged the proedros Theodore to fight. Reluctantly, the latter agreed to leave Sophon and encamp at Petroes, some 15 stadia () from the rebel camp. Finally, on 20 August, Komnenos marched out his forces and arrayed them for battle on a plain called, according to Michael Attaleiates, Polemon or Hades (Haides according to Skylitzes). Kekaumenos commanded the left wing; Romanos Skleros the right; and Komnenos positioned himself in the centre. On the imperial side, the magistros Aaron was stationed on the left wing with Lykanthes, Pnyemios the Iberian (commander of the forces of Charsianon) and the patrikios Randolf the Frank as his lieutenants; Basil Tarchaneiotes (the stratelates of the western armies) was positioned on the right; and the centre was commanded by the proedros Theodore. In the ensuing battle, the imperial left wing under Aaron completely routed the rebel right wing. Pursuing them to the rebel camp, he captured Romanos Skleros there and was on the cusp of seizing the rebel camp and victory along with it: Skylitzes reports that Komnenos was on the verge of fleeing to Nicaea. However, Aaron hesitated, and allowed the rebel army time to reverse the situation. In the centre, Komnenos held out against heavy loyalist pressure. Psellos reports that four \\"Tauroscythian\\" (an anachronistic term for the Russians) mercenaries tried to kill him, but failed; indeed, by attacking him simultaneously from two sides, their lances got stuck in his armour and kept him aloft, balanced in the middle. On the rebel left, Kekaumenos routed the loyalist right, breaching their camp and destroying their tents. As the camp was situated on a height and was widely visible, this encouraged the rebels and dejected the loyalists, who collapsed and fled. Although Skylitzes writes that \\"many more were taken prisoner than were killed\\" in the subsequent pursuit, the loyalists suffered many killed, including the generals Maurokatakalos, Pnyemios and Katzamountes. Nikephoros Botaneiates won particular renown at this point: Randolf the Frank was caught up in the rout when he saw Botaneiates leading an attacking division. Shouting a war cry, Randolf turned and attacked Botaneiates; the two engaged in single combat until Randolf's sword broke and he was captured.  Aftermath  While the remnants of the imperial army withdrew to the capital, Komnenos moved to occupy Nicomedia. There he was met on 24 August by envoys of the Emperor: Michael Psellos, and the proedroi Constantine Leichoudes and Theodore Alopos, who offered him the title of Caesar‚Äîat that time the highest title of the Byzantine court, signifying the designated heir-apparent‚Äîif he would cease his rebellion. Although these proposals were publicly rejected, privately Komnenos showed himself more open to negotiation, and he was promised the status of co-emperor. During the course of these secret negotiations, a riot in favour of Komnenos broke out in Constantinople. By the time the envoys returned to the capital on 29 August, they had espoused the rebels' cause, and, aided by patriarch Michael Keroularios, they began to conspire in his favour. On 31 August, Keroularios convinced Michael VI to abdicate in favour of Komnenos, who entered Constantinople on 1 September and was crowned emperor the same day. With the Macedonian dynasty extinct, Isaac thus became the first military strongman to usurp power outright since the 9th century; other powerful generals, such as Romanos I Lekapenos () or Nikephoros II Phokas () had also usurped the throne under the Macedonian emperors, but they had reigned alongside the legitimate rulers. This was reflected in the coinage struck in his name, which uniquely showed him holding a drawn sword; while it may have simply indicated his intention to restore \\"capable military rule\\" (Kaldellis), it came to be understood as a claim to rule by right of conquest, and even as expressing an impious belief \\"that his accomplishments came not from God but from his own prowess\\". Isaac attempted to reform the bureaucracy and the empire's fiscal system, as well as to restore its military strength, but his reforms aroused much opposition; increasingly isolated politically, and probably disheartened, during an illness in November 1059 he abdicated in favour of Constantine Doukas.

Career Cliver was discovered at the age of 16, he then started doing a few commercials and later at around the age of 22 he got into the world of Italian cinema. He decided to use the name Al Cliver as his stage name, as it was trendy for Italian actors at that time to use American stage names. He decided on after Al Capone, or Al Pacino and his surname was taken from a death row prisoner who wrote a best selling book. Cliver made his acting debut in 1974 in Il Saprofita. He has starred in erotic, adventure and crime movies, but he is mostly memorable for starring in exploitation and horror films such as Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2, The Black Cat, The Beyond and Demonia, and Jes√∫s Franco's Mondo Cannibale and Devil Hunter. Personal life Cliver was born Pierluigi Conti in Alexandria, Egypt. From 1975 to 1978, he was in a relationship with French actress Annie Belle and has acted alongside her in the films Forever Emmanuelle, Blue Belle, Velluto Nero and Un Giorno alla fine di Ottobre. After their split they acted together in Molto di Pi√π and L'Alcova. Cliver was diagnosed with throat cancer in August 2008. He had to undergo surgery which has left him speaking strained in a mere whisper. He lives in Bali and is the owner and manager of holiday villas. In 2018 Cliver's memoirs, Without Script were published.

In 2013, it was announced that a deal was struck with Universal Music Group to combine those recordings with his work at Capitol Records from the 1950s under UMG imprint called Signature Sinatra. A series of events to celebrate Sinatra's centenary in 2015 was organised and entitled \\"Sinatra 100\\". History Frank Sinatra Enterprises was founded in 2007 as the company which administers the rights for the usage of Frank Sinatra's recordings from his time spent on the Reprise Records label, as well as a number of other recordings, films and images. It also issues licences for the usage of Sinatra's name and likeness. It was formed by Warner Music Group alongside the Sinatra family; specifically his children, Frank Sinatra, Jr., Nancy Sinatra and Tina Sinatra. Prior to the founding of the new label, Tina and attorney Robert A. Finkelstein were managing the Sinatra rights, but found that the work required a larger team to work on it. Under Frank Sinatra Enterprises, the duo hold the Sinatra family's two votes on the five person board, the others being represented at launch by the chief executive officer of Warner Music Group, Edgar Bronfman, Jr., president of Rhino Entertainment, Scott Pascucci, and a tie-breaking vote in the hands of former Capitol Records president Hale Milgrim. Under this agreement, Sinatra's Reprise Records recordings were released on Rhino Records within the United States, and internationally distributed from 2009 onwards by Universal Music Group. In 2013, Frank Sinatra Enterprises and UMG agreed to jointly licence Sinatra's recordings on Reprise alongside those from his Capitol Records period; the former represents his recordings from the 1960s, while the latter are generally from the 1950s. The new releases were made under a new imprint entitled Signature Sinatra, which UMG managed and marketed. This replaced the Rhino releases within the United States of Sinatra's work. The first release under this new agreement was a re-release of the 1993 album Duets, expanded with further five further tracks. Sinatra 100 To commemorate the Sinatra centenary on December 12, 2015, the Sinatra family alongside Frank Sinatra Enterprises planned a series of events throughout the year entitled \\"Sinatra 100\\". This included an exhibition running from March to September at the Lincoln Center called \\"Sinatra: An American Icon\\", alongside The Grammy Museum. After September 4, a national tour began. An exhibition of previously unseen photographs of Sinatra, called \\"The Sinatra Experience\\" was held at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in New York City during March.

Weld, Robert Doorenbos, Wrapper Induction for Information Extraction Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1997 Many web pages present structured data - telephone directories, product catalogs, etc. formatted for human browsing using HTML language. Structured data are typically descriptions of objects retrieved from underlying databases and displayed in Web pages following some fixed templates. Software systems using such resources must translate HTML content into a relational form. Wrappers are commonly used as such translators. Formally, a wrapper is a function from a page to the set of tuples it contains. Wrapper generation There are two main approaches to wrapper generation: wrapper induction and automated data extraction. Wrapper induction uses supervised learning to learn data extraction rules from manually labeled training examples. The disadvantages of wrapper induction are * the time-consuming manual labeling process and * the difficulty of wrapper maintenance. Due to the manual labeling effort, it is hard to extract data from a large number of sites as each site has its own templates and requires separate manual labeling for wrapper learning. Wrapper maintenance is also a major issue because whenever a site changes the wrappers built for the site become obsolete. Due to these shortcomings, researchers have studied automated wrapper generation using unsupervised pattern mining. Automated extraction is possible because most Web data objects follow fixed templates. Discovering such templates or patterns enables the system to perform extraction automatically.Liu, B. Web Data Mining: Exploring Hyperlinks, Contents and Usage Data, Springer, 2007. Wrapper generation on the Web is an important problem with a wide range of applications. Extraction of such data enables one to integrate data/information from multiple Web sites to provide value-added services, e.g., comparative shopping, object search, and information integration.

The film was the fourth and last screen adaptation of the famous Stanley Houghton play of the 1910s, dealing with an independent-minded young woman insisting on her right to enjoy a sexual flirtation regardless of the disapproval of family or society. This was the first film version of the play since 1931 and it was felt to be a rather odd choice, as the subject matter which had been considered controversial and provocative a generation earlier now appeared somewhat anachronistic in light of the major changes which had taken place in British society in the interim, particularly the more liberal attitudes growing from the national experience during World War II when previous taboos had been relaxed to a significant degree. The film was felt to be dated, even by 1952 standards, and the incongruity of supposed Lancashire mill-workers speaking in cut-glass Mayfair tones was also singled out as an absurdity. The storyline is set in the 1950s and is a valid and accurate reflection of that period. However, it has little resemblance to either the original story or the earlier film versions, having a very different atmosphere. It would have been more widely credited had it not adopted the title \\"Hindle Wakes\\" as this does little to validate the film. Plot Lancashire mill-girls Jenny Hawthorne (Daniely) and Mary Hollins (Sandra Dome) go on holiday to Blackpool during the annual wakes week in their hometown of Hindle. They run into Alan Jeffcote (Worth), the son of the owner of the mill in which they work, who has also travelled to Blackpool with a group of friends while his fianc√©e is detained on business in London. Jenny and Alan hit it off immediately, and he persuades her to leave Blackpool to spend the week with him at Llandudno. To cover her tracks, Jenny leaves a postcard with Mary, asking her to send it to her parents (Leslie Dwyer and Joan Hickson) later in the week. She and Alan leave their friends and set off for Wales. They book into a hotel on the Promenade as Mr and Mrs Jeffries. Shortly afterwards, Mary is involved in a serious boating accident and is killed. Her possessions are returned to Hindle and the unsent postcard is found in her luggage. Jenny's parents are already suspicious and concerned by the fact that Jenny has not returned to Hindle as they would have expected in view of such a tragic turn to her holiday, and the discovery of the postcard increases their fears. Jenny returns at the end of the week. Her parents ask about her holiday, and allow her to dig a hole for herself as her fictitious account shows she is unaware of Mary's death and has clearly not spent the week in Blackpool. When confronted with the truth, Jenny admits to where she has been, and with whom, but defiantly refuses to be made to feel guilty or immoral. The Hawthornes decide that they will have to confront the Jeffcotes (Ronald Adam and Mary Clare) with their son's unacceptable behaviour. Mrs. Hawthorne's anger is tempered by the fact that she believes the situation may be turned to financial advantage. Hawthorne feels some trepidation, as he and Jeffcote have been friends since childhood and have remained on good terms despite Jeffcote's rise to social prominence. To the surprise of the Hawthornes, Jeffcote agrees that in the circumstances Alan must be made to marry Jenny to prevent a scandal. Mrs. Jeffcote is less convinced, anticipating the ruin of Alan's reputation and business prospects. A meeting is convened between all the interested parties. Jenny and Alan remain silent while their parents try to thrash out suitable arrangements, and Mrs. Hawthorne and Mrs. Jeffcote become involved in an undignified shouting match. Jenny and Alan leave to talk alone. She tells him that she has no designs on his money and has no interest in marrying him. She then announces her decision to the incredulous parents, adding that Alan was no more to blame than she was, for both of them it was just a \\"little fling\\" about which neither need feel guilty, and that a woman has just as much right as a man to enjoy a brief sexual flirtation with no strings attached. Alan returns to his fianc√©e, while Jenny confidently leaves home and her mother's fury for an independent life without interference.

Guerriero Project Homerun used 16 RB-47Es from the 10th SRS and five RB-47Hs from the 343rd SRS. 156 sorties were performed. On a typical RB-47H reconnaissance mission covering 5,984 mi (9,360 km), the aircraft would fly from Thule, Greenland to the Kara Sea to Murmansk and then return only to find Thule weathered-in, forcing the flight from the air-refueling/decision point near the northeast shore of Greenland to one of three equidistant alternates: Goose Bay, Labrador, London, or Fairbanks, Alaska. Five KC-97s at Thule were required to support this scenario. Two ground spares and one air spare ensured two 20,000 lb (9,090 kg) fuel transfers at a distance of over 600 mi (965 km) from Thule. Tankers returned to Thule to refuel and again repeat the flight to intercept the returning RB-47H six hours later for another air refueling.

The village of Ambodiharina lies across the river from Salehy. Industry People there are living principally on fishing, agriculture, handicraft, ‚Äúbetsa‚Äù manufacturing (an alcoholic traditional beverage) and a small part of tourism. People in Salehy, same as people from many villages in Madagascar, nowadays, are living in extreme poverty. Geography The village is surrounded by water, by the Canal des Pangalanes to the west, Mangoro River to the south, and Indian Ocean to the east, preceded by a small natural swimming pool called ‚ÄúDobo masina‚Äù, meaning ‚ÄúSalted pool‚Äù. The water is salty because of the ocean, as it can reach that body of water during the night even a kilometer inland. To the east is the confluence of the Mangoro River, the Canal, and the Indian Ocean. This confluence changes its place but Salehy remains. To the north, there is also a small lake named ‚ÄúSalehy be‚Äù (Big Salehy). Before going there, ask riparian people what you shouldn‚Äôt do there. The lake is still abounded of taboo. It has abundant fish but no one take it from there. Salehy has a very calm beach but be careful about the waves. Surfers can take profit there. History Historically, though an oral tradition, the name Salehy came from French people who passed by there. They drank water from ‚ÄúDobo masina‚Äù, and finding it salted, exclaimed ‚ÄúOhh! C‚Äôest sal√©‚Äù (it‚Äôs salted). The name of the place was after that Salehy. Salehy is always a victim of every passing cyclone. People there don‚Äôt build strong house because they say that it will be destroyed again by the cyclone next year. The truth is that they don‚Äôt have enough resources to build strong house.

He diagnosed her Cancer prior to her death in the Fifties. He was last married to Dolores, who survived his own death in Cordoba. She mourned amongst other world leaders he had befriended, such as Salvador Allende from the neighboring Chile.

Due to lack of funds, the building eventually was lost to the crediting Banks that had been generating loans. Professional life Bermann had a highly influential role in the university reform of 1918 in Argentina, which spread throughout the country and influenced the way Higher Education was taught in many other Latin countries. It even influencing the Student movements on the U.S. and France during the sixties, note the student riots in France in 1968. He continued to play an active role in university reform up into the 1930s. He founded the \\"Bermann Clinic\\" for Mental Health in \\"Las Rosas\\" Cordoba, after getting his degree in Psychiatry. He also studied German in order to interview Sigmund Freud in his own tongue, which he did, an entry in Freud's schedule cites the meeting with Dr. Bermann. Gregorio also brought Freudian Psychoanalysis to Argentina, and the rest of Latin America, and was the founder of the Latin American Psychiatric Association over which he presided for a number of years. His other passion was politics, and during the Spanish Civil War he leased a plane and took 16 colleagues with him to fight Hitler's new brand of Fascism in the form of General Franco. He was a Medic during the War, and it was during such times that he befriended Humanists and writers such as Miguel de Unamuno, Federico Garcia Lorca, etc. He published twenty books total, 10 on psychiatry, psychology and psychoanalysis, and also published 10 books and journal articles relating to philosophy and politics. In politics, he was a socialist; he joined the Socialist Party of Cordoba in the 1920s and he was part of the intellectual network of the Communist Party from the 1930s onwards, participating in the anti-fascist movement and in the opposition to various right-wing governments through the years, including that of Juan Per√≥n. However, in the 1960s he moved away from the Soviet-aligned party and towards the Cuban and to some extent Chinese versions of communism.

Reception=Critical review Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote: \\"What is done in the name of biography in the Warner Brothers' 'Shine on Harvest Moon' is something which shouldn't be done to a burglar‚Äîlet alone to the memory of the late Nora Bayes. For this musical film in which that lady and her second husband, Jack Norworth, are supposedly represented in their joint and devoted careers is no more veracious to the real thing than if it were a story of Alice Faye. It is simply another of those musicals which dig back into the past for a score of nostalgic ditties and some old-time vaudeville atmosphere; a film in which a songsmith falls in love with a honky-tonk girl and sticks with her through trials and tribulations until they finally emerge together on top. And if anyone goes expecting to see Ann Sheridan play Nora Bayes, or Dennis Morgan play Jack Norworth, this is to make it understood that you will not.\\" Box office According to Warner Bros records the film earned $2,557,000 domestically and $1,149,000 foreign.

The film was selected for the 47th Antalya \\"Golden Orange\\" International Film Festival.  Production  The film's writer-director took his inspiration from the Bosphorus Bridge toll booth attendants, who had always intrigued him, performing the same work, day after day. Kara√ßelik said that one day he decided \\"to be cute,\\" and told the attendant, \\"kolay gelsin!\\" (May it come easy). \\"He looked so bad at me,\\" continued director, \\"I could not forget it.\\" \\"The European Union does not even sell tomatoes which grow near the highway, but these [toll booth attendants] live their lives there.\\" He wrote a letter to the union of toll booth workers, Yapƒ±yol Sen. \\"Actually I wrote a poem, and all my friends made fun of me,\\" he said, but the union quickly answered, providing the name and number of a contact.

He joined the Communist Party in 1937 and became the personal secretary to Mao Zedong on industrial affairs. After retiring from political life, Li became a writer and a vocal advocate of democratic reform in China.  Early life  Li Rui was born in Beijing in 1917. In 1934, he enrolled for Wuhan University, studying engineering.  Political career  Li was an early and enthusiastic member of the Communist Party, having trekked to the Communist base at Yan'an in the late 1930s. Within a few years, he first suffered revolutionary persecution there. In 1945 he was made the secretary to Gao Gang, a post which he held until 1945. In the mid-1950s, Li was briefly one of Mao Zedong's secretaries, giving him access to the inner circle of China‚Äôs ruling elite, but his criticisms of the Great Leap Forward and support for Peng Dehuai led to his denunciation and exile. He later declared that Mao was dismissive of the suffering and death caused by his policies: \\"Mao's way of thinking and governing was terrifying. He put no value on human life. The deaths of others meant nothing to him\\".Jonathan Watts. China must confront dark past, says Mao confidant The Guardian, June 2, 2005 Li was then denounced as an anti-party element and spent twenty years in prison, emerging in 1979 and three years later being elected to the Central Committee, then in 1983 going on to be vice director of the Organisation Department of the Communist Party. Li was a vice minister of the Ministry of Water Conservation and later at the time of its planning was opposed to the Yangtze Three Gorges Project.Li Rui, Former Secretary of Chairman Mao, and Maj. Gen. Chang Zhonglian Reflect on Zhao Ziyang, Epoch Times, January 28, 2005, trans from Chinese He continued to oppose construction of the dam after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.  Dissent  At the 16th Communist Party Congress in 2002, Li wrote an open letter to Party Secretary Hu Jintao on political reform of the Communist Party. In the letter, Li argued that constitutionalism would lead the Communist Party away from political mishaps such as the Anti-Rightist Movement, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. In November 2004, the party's Propaganda Department banned Li from being published in the media. On hearing of the death of Zhao Ziyang in 2005, Li returned to Beijing from overseas and immediately went to the former general secretary‚Äôs home to pay his last respects. In 2006, he was a lead signatory to an open letter condemning the state's closure of the investigative newspaper Freezing Point. Ahead of the 17th Communist Party Congress in 2007, Li and retired academic Xie Tao published articles calling for the Communist Party to become a European-style socialist party, remarks that were condemned by the party propaganda apparatus.Hu Jintao Battles the CCP's Crisis of Confidence , Willy Lam (Jamestown Foundation's China Brief) In October 2010, Li was the lead signatory to an open letter to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, calling for greater press freedom.Chinese Cadres Say ‚ÄòBlack Hands‚Äô Choke Wen‚Äôs Political Reforms, Business Week, October 13, 2010 Personal life Li had a daughter, Li Nanyang.

Aircraft used included the Boeing B-47 Stratojet bomber and‚Äîfrom 1956‚Äîthe Lockheed U-2 spy plane specifically designed for high-altitude reconnaissance flight. The overflight program was ended following the 1960 U-2 incident. Background Reconnaissance flights began in 1946 along the borders of the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc states. The necessity of peacetime overflights was reinforced after the escalation of the Cold War in the late 1940s, and in particular after the Korean War began in 1950. U.S. President Harry S. Truman authorized selected overflights of the Soviet Union in order to determine the status of its air forces. It was feared that the Soviets might launch a surprise aerial attack on the United States with long-range bombers. RB-47E reconnaissance bomber, mid-1950s Cross-border droppings On several occasions in 1951-1952, CIA planes flew over the Soviet territory, penetrating the airspace near the borders of its westernmost republics (Moldovan SSR, Ukrainian SSR, and Belarussian SSR,) dropping parachutist agents recruited in the West from the Soviet defectors (the AEDEPOT project.) Most of the landed agents were captured by the Soviet troops and government agencies. The agents were disguised as ordinary Soviet citizens, and equipped with fake Soviet passports, guns, grenades, explosives, disguised firing devices, and other spy equipment. They were detailed to contact local anti- Soviet rebels, and engage in a guerrilla warfare against the local Soviet authorities.Dozornye zapadnyh rubezhey: dokumental'nye ocherki po istorii voysk Krasnoznamyonnogo Zapadnogo pogranichnogo okruga (in Russian). By I. A. Kurolenko, V. A. Kozlov, Zh. D. Bragin, N. D. Borovkov. 2nd edition. Kiev, 1984. pp. 232-233. First deep-penetration flights In 1952 a modified B-47B bomber made the first deep-penetration United States overflight of Soviet territory to photograph Siberian air bases. Limited periphery flights had already been conducted by American aircraft, including the signals intelligence RB-29, RB-50, and RB-47. Overflights of the Soviet Union with the newly designated RB-47Es started in 1954, often at great risk as they were routinely intercepted by Soviet MiGs. It became apparent that a new aircraft was needed which could operate at altitudes well above any Soviet air defenses. U-2 missions In November 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a secret program under the direction of the Central Intelligence Agency to build and fly a special-purpose high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft with the code name AQUATONE. Lockheed was chosen to build the reconnaissance plane and in August 1955 the first Lockheed U-2 was test-flown. Other strategic reconnaissance missions continued as the U-2 tests were ongoing. In early 1956 Project Genetrix involved hundreds of high-altitude photographic reconnaissance balloons that were intended to collect intelligence as they drifted across the Soviet Union; only 51 balloons were recovered, however and just 31 of those provided any usable photos. During Project HOMERUN (between March and May 1956) RB-47E reconnaissance aircraft flew almost daily flights over the North Pole to photograph and gather electronic intelligence over the entire northern section of the Soviet Union. On 6 May 1956 six reconnaissance bombers, flying abreast, crossed the North Pole and penetrated Soviet airspace in broad daylight as if on a nuclear bombing run. Any Soviet radar operator seeing the bombers would have no way of knowing that the mission was an act of espionage and not of war.https://web.archive.org/web/20120101112547/http://www.allbusiness.com/buying_exiting_businesses/3580596-1.html On 4 July 1956 the first U-2 flight over the Soviet Union took place. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev angrily protested this overflight and feared that \\"when they understand that we are defenseless against an aerial attack, it will push the Americans to begin the war earlier.\\" This prompted the Soviet Union to develop new air defense systems. Strategic overflight reconnaissance in peacetime became routine U.S. policy. The CIA's Project OXCART, an aircraft which flew even higher and four times faster than the U-2, advanced aerial overflight reconnaissance capabilities with eventual development of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Discontinuance Following the 1960 U-2 incident, Eisenhower ordered an end to American reconnaissance flights into the Soviet Union. This policy was upheld by President Kennedy. On 25 January 1961 he told a press conference, \\"I have ordered that the flights not be resumed, which is a continuation of the order given by President Eisenhower in May of last year.\\"Pedlow, Gregory W. and Welzenbach, Donald E., 'The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance; The U-2 And Oxcart Programs, 1954-1974', Central Intelligence Agency History Staff, 1992. SECRET, declassified 25 June 2013. Retrieved: 2 February 2014. Ryan Model 147B high-altitude reconnaissance RPV under wing of a DC-130A launch aircraft, mid-1960s Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, elected to continue the policy of no overflights. Improvements in technology during the 1960s allowed satellite reconnaissance which was immune to intercept and provided much of the same information that could be obtained by reconnaissance aircraft, thus rendering aerial overflights unnecessary. In 1964 CIA director John A. McCone emphasized to the Johnson administration the orders were not a pledge barring further flights, but simply a directive that the flights not be resumed, one which can be countermanded. In spite of the formal end to reconnaissance aircraft overflights, the U.S. remained involved in overflight attempts of its Cold War adversaries. Project Dark Gene, a CIA‚ÄìIranian program of intrusions into Soviet airspace to explore Soviet air defense systems, continued operations up to 1979. Aerial reconnaissance of mainland China continued with the Ryan Model 147 \\"Lightning Bug\\" RPVs (Remotely Piloted Vehicles); several of these drones were shot down or recovered by the Chinese during the Vietnam War era. China overflight efforts prevailed into the 1970s with proxy U-2 missions flown by Taiwanese pilots. Legacy More than 40 U.S. aircraft were downed by Soviet forces and 200 Americans were killed during these operations. Their families were given false information by the army on the circumstances of their deaths.. See also *National Vigilance Park *Donald E.

This response eventually led to the coalition of different leftist factions that sparked the creation of the Popular Front.Tabea Alexa Linhard, Fearless Women in the Mexican Revolution and the Spanish Civil War, (2005), p.205 Spanish Civil War On 18 July 1936 Mar√≠a and Rafael were in Ibiza when the Spanish Civil War broke out. They returned to Madrid where she became secretary of the Alliance of Antifascist Writers and founded the magazine, El mono azul (The Blue Overall) which came out on 27 August 1936. Contributors included Manuel Altolaguirre, Antonio Aparicio, Vicente Aleixandre, Jos√© Bergamin, Luis Cernuda, Antonio Machado, Ram√≥n J. Sender, Lorenzo Varela, Mar√≠a Zambrano and many non-Spanish writers such as John Dos Passos, Vicente Huidobro, Andr√© Malraux and Pablo Neruda. The publication lasted for forty-seven issues, almost the entire period of the civil war. She served on the Junta de Defensa y Protecci√≥n del Tesoro Art√≠stico Nacional (Board of Defense and Protection of National Artistic Patrimony) which saved the art of the Museo del Prado, Palacio Real, Palacio Liria and the El Escorial from the aerial bombardment during the war. At first the art was stored in the Prado, but after the Prado was directly hit by nine bombs in late November, Mar√≠a, along with her husband Rafael led the 3 December evacuation of the Prado with a convoy of camouflaged trucks to a safe location in Valencia.Rojo y Azul: La Guerra Civil Espa√±ola Rafael later wrote Noche de guerra en el Museo del Prado (Night of War in the Prado Museum), a play in which characters in paintings by Goya come to life to defend the besieged city of Madrid. The play premiered at the Piccolo Theatre in Rome in 1973 and at the Teatro Mar√≠a Guerrero, Madrid in 1977.Sociedad Estatal de Conmemoraciones Culturales, (28 November 2003) She wrote \\"They sacrificed us. We were the Spain with torn clothes and heads held high\\".https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/04/spain-civil-war-franco-nationalist- fascism Exile (1939‚Äì1977) After the Republican defeat they fled to Paris via Oran. They lived in Paris until the end of 1940 working as translators for French radio and as announcers for the broadcasts of Paris-Mondial in Latin- America. After the German occupation of France they sailed from Marseilles to Buenos Aires on the SS Mendoza where they were reunited with thousands of other Spaniards who had been forced to flee their country.La Nacion ADN Cultura (10 December 2010) http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1332204 Here she used exile to her advantage to criticize her country and avoid the Francoist censorship. In 1941 Mar√≠a gave birth to their daughter, the poet Aitana. During the 1940s and 1950s she gave readings of her work at benefits that aided Nazi victims or striking workers in Argentina; many of which were in organized in collaboration with soprano Isa Kremer who sang at these benefits. With the arrival of Juan Per√≥n the political and artistic censorship imposed made life increasingly difficult in Argentina and in 1963, after a 23-year stay in Buenos Aires, they moved to Rome. On 27 April 1977 they returned to Spain after almost thirty-eight years of exile. Mar√≠a, however, was suffering from Alzheimer's and could not recognize even her closest old friends. She spent her last years in a sanatorium in the mountains outside Madrid. She died on 13 December 1988 and is buried in the cemetery at Majadahonda just outside Madrid. On her grave are the words written by her husband: \\"Esta ma√±ana, amor, tenemos veinte a√±os\\" (This morning, love, we are twenty years old). Mar√≠a Teresa Le√≥n always carried her love for Gonzalo and Enrique, her first children. In her life she suffered from the separations produced by two exiles: the first from her children, and then from her country.Maureen Tobin Stanley & Gesa Zinn, Female Exiles in Twentieth and Twenty-first Century Europe, (2007), p.141-153 Writings Collections of Short Stories: * Cuentos para so√±ar (Tales for Dreaming), (1928, dedicated to her eldest son, Gonzalo) * Le bella del mal amor (The Beauty of Bad Love), (1930) * Rosa-Fr√≠a, patinadora de la luna (Rosa-Fr√≠a, Moon Skater), (1934) * Tales from Contemporary Spain, (1935) * Morir√°s lejos (You Will Die Far Away), (1942) * F√°bulas del tiempo amargo (Fables of Bitter Times), (1962) Novels: * Contra viento y marea (Against All Odds), (1941) * El gran amor de Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer (Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer's Great Love), (1946) * Don Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar, el Cid Campeador, (1954) * Juego limpio (Clean Game), (1954) * Menesteos, marinero de abril (Menesteos, Seaman of April), (1965) * Do√±a Jimena D√≠az de Vivar, (1968) * Cervantes, El soldado que nos ense√±√≥ a hablar (Cervantes, the Soldier Who Taught Us to Speak), (1978) Non-Fiction: * La historia tiene la palabra (History Has the Word), (1944) * Sonr√≠e China (China Smiles), (1958) * Memoria de la Melancol√≠a (Memory of Melancholy), (1977) ‚Äì Autobiography Plays: * Huelga en el Puerto (Strike at the Harbor), (1933) * La liberdad en el tejado (Freedom on the Roof), (written in exile and published in 1989) Screenplays: * Los ojos m√°s bellos del mundo (The Most Beautiful Eyes in the World), (1943) * La dama duende (The Phantom Lady), (1945) * Nuestro hogar de cada d√≠a (Our Daily Home), (1958, for radio) References Category:1903 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Spanish women writers Category:Spanish children's writers Category:Spanish exiles Category:Spanish feminists Category:Spanish feminist writers Category:Exiles of the Spanish Civil War in France Category:Women in war 1900‚Äì1945 Category:Women in war in Spain Category:Spanish dramatists and playwrights Category:Spanish women novelists Category:People from Logro√±o Category:Women children's writers Category:20th-century Spanish novelists Category:20th-century women writers Category:Exiles of the Spanish Civil War in Argentina ","title":"Mar√≠a Teresa Le√≥n"},{"id":"29174172","text":"ExecuJet is an international business aviation company headquartered at Zurich Airport, Switzerland. ExecuJet has facilities operating in six regions worldwide - Africa, Asia Pacific, Caribbean, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The Group services include aircraft management, charter, fixed- base operations (FBO) and completions consulting. The company employs 750 staff worldwide and operates a managed fleet of over 130 aircraft. History Global Express in front of an ExecuJet building ExecuJet‚Äôs first operation was based at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1991 as a maintenance provider. The facility was appointed in 1993 as a Major Service Centre by Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal) and a Learjet Authorised Service Facility by Bombardier. In 1994 the firm extended its offer to include services, deployed in concert with a Bombardier Business Aircraft sales franchise. In 1995 the firm became a Canadair authorised service facility. In 1997 it opened in Denmark as ExecuJet Scandinavia. During 1999, ExecuJet Middle East was established in Dubai and the Bombardier sales franchise expanded to 10 Middle Eastern countries. ExecuJet Australia was founded in 2000. It included an aircraft management and maintenance centre at Sydney Airport and awarded dealership rights for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific. The facility was also appointed as Bombardier Authorised Service Facility and Gulfstream authorised warranty repair facility. ExecuJet expanded its European operations in 2001 with an aircraft management business, a Fixed Base Operation (FBO) and its offices in Zurich became the headquarters for ExecuJet. Bombardier adds Switzerland to ExecuJet‚Äôs business aircraft dealership. In 2002 ExecuJet expanded its services into Latin America with operations at two Mexican Airports in Monterrey and an extended facility at Lanseria. The firm opened in Dubai in 2005 and ExecuJet was appointed as a Middle East Bombardier authorised service centre. In Berlin, ExecuJet acquired an equity stake in Lufthansa Bombardier Aviation Services (LBAS), in joint venture partnership with Lufthansa Technik and Bombardier. During 2006 a FBO at Berlin Sch√∂nefeld opened, and ExecuJet Australasia opened a line maintenance base in Melbourne, Australia. In 2008 ExecuJet acquired a hangar at Singapore‚Äôs Seletar Airport, where it still oversees maintenance activities. The firm was also granted an Air Operator‚Äôs Certificate (AOC) for the United Kingdom. Representative offices were opened in Mumbai, Beijing and Moscow. In 2009, ExecuJet South Africa occupied a new FBO facility in Cape Town in anticipation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The wider fim was restructured around an OEM-independent business model. Later that year ExecuJet Malaysia opened a maintenance base in Kuala Lumpur. In the year 2010 Berlin Airports selected ExecuJet Europe as operator of the General Aviation Terminal, and ExecuJet Mexico opened an office at Toluca Airport. In France, ExecuJet partnered with Advanced Air Support, for the FBO at Paris Le Bourget Airport, and a joint venture partnership was established with China Sichuan Haite and ExecuJet Haite Aviation Services China was born, based at Tianjin Binhai International Airport. ExecuJet‚Äôs continued its worldwide expansion with the opening of brand new FBO facilities such as Frankfurt, Melbourne, Wellington, Gerona, Ibiza, Barcelona, Valencia and ExecuJet Europe winning the Cambridge FBO tender. A new FBO was opened at Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport, Turkey run by Bilen Air Service in strategic partnership with ExecuJet. During 2012 the FBO in Cambridge was opened, and ExecuJet and RUAG announced a partnership FBO in Geneva. Meanwhile, in Indonesia an agreement was signed with Angkasa Pura 1 for the management of General Aviation Terminals in Indonesia. In Nigeria an FBO was opened at Lagos International Airport, and our Dubai office expands the FBO at Dubai International Airport. ExecuJet Australasia expanded with the establishment of Maintenance facilities in Perth in 2013, and ExecuJet Europe further. At the same time in the Middle East, ExecuJet expands its presence with a joint venture with NAS Holdings for an FBO in Riyadh. In 2014 a new FBO facility was built in Bali. ExecuJet already started operating from temporary facilities at Bali International Airport. The Bali facility was the first terminal to be opened following the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation in June 2012 for ExecuJet to exclusively design, construct and manage General Aviation Terminals at up to 13 airports managed by state-owned Indonesian aviation company Angkasa Pura 1. The same year our Cambridge operations was granted a helicopter AOC, and Europe launches helicopter services in the United Kingdom. In 2015 ExecuJet was acquired by the Luxaviation Group. With Luxaviation is headquartered in Luxembourg, and with ExecuJet has a combined staff of 1,500 and a fleet of over 250 business jets. ExecuJet began operations in Bali in the same year. The acquisition of ExecuJet by the Luxaviation Group started the process of centralizing certain operational services in a shared services structure based in Cambridge. CAMO and Dispatch services were the first to be centralised, with Travel, Training and Procurement following shortly after. During this process ExecuJet UK recruited dozens of employees eventually outgrowing their location at Cambridge City Airport and moved to Fulbourn. In 2016, ExecuJet opened FBOs in Munich, Germany, New Delhi, India, and a second FBO in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. April saw the opening of a FBO in Monterrey, Mexico ‚Äì the first in Latin America, as well as the opening of St. Maarten, Caribbean in June.

Nessa was defrocked from the Church of Norway in 1989, confirmed after an appeal in 1991, which led him to co-found the independent Deanery of Strandebarm (also known as the \\"Church of Norway in Exile\\") together with fellow priests B√∏rre Knudsen and Per K√∏rner. Church services administered by Nessa has been broadcast on Visjon Norge since 2014. Pro-life activism Appointed priest of Borge og Torsnes in √òstfold in 1979, Nessa founded the \\"New Life Action\\" Aksjon Nytt Liv along with B√∏rre Knudsen in 1987 in order to stage protests against abortion. They staged their first non-violent protest against abortion at a hospital in Oslo, and later protested with symbolic burials of small coffins, and sending dolls drenched in ketchup to public figures and politicians. Nessa was defrocked from the Church of Norway in 1989, confirmed after an appeal to the Eidsivating Court of Appeal in 1991. Together with Knudsen and Per K√∏rner he thereafter co-founded the Deanery of Strandebarm, also known as the \\"Church of Norway in Exile\\". In 1999 Nessa went into \\"church asylum\\" at a Gospel Hall as he was due to serve time in prison for refusing to pay fines received for his anti-abortion protests. He was arrested later the same year and sent to serve his penalty of 53 days imprisonment. For the 2005 and 2009 parliamentary elections Nessa headed the Abortion Opponents' List along with Ivar Kristianslund, Per K√∏rner and B√∏rre Knudsen. In 2013 Nessa was notified from tax authorities that he risked being registered as \\"emigrated from Norway\\", as since he was evicted from his parish residence in 1991 has been registered as \\"homeless\\". He alternates between residing in a Gospel Hall in Fredrikstad and his cabin in Sarpsborg. Other activism Nessa has criticised the increasing influence of Muslims and Islam in Norway, and stated that only \\"true Christians\\" will be able to \\"resist Islam\\". He has proposed and stated his willingness to burn the Quran after comedian Otto Jespersen in 2006 burned a Bible, and he has voiced his support for American pastor Terry Jones. He has suggested that the 2011 Norway attacks may have been caused as a result of Norwegian abortion policies. As part of an annual marking against abortion on the date of its legalisation in Norway, 13 June, Nessa and his followers have routinely \\"banished\\" the Government quarter that was bombed on 22 July. In 2012 he sent emails to Norwegian members of parliament, denouncing a bill that would separate the church from the state as a \\"coup\\" and a \\"revolution\\", and threatening to \\"banish\\" Norwegian politicians responsible for it.

Ziegel, the co-founder of the first officially approved Soviet UFO research group, became an overnight sensation when, on November 10, 1967, speaking on the Soviet central television, he made an extensive report on the UFO sightings registered in the USSR and encouraged viewers to send him and his colleagues first-hand accounts of their observations, which resulted in barrage of letters and reports. He died in November 1988, leaving 17 volumes of the unpublished research documents for his daughter to keep.  Biography =Early years Felix Ziegel was born in Moscow on March 20, 1920, to the lawyer Yury Konstantinovich Ziegel, a Russian-born ethnic German, and his wife, Nadezhda Platonovna. \\"I had been sentenced to death before I was even born,\\" Felix Ziegel used to say later, referring to the extreme circumstances of his birth. Nadezhda and Felix Ziegel. 1925 In March 1920, the 22-year-old student Nadezhda found herself on the Cheka's death row, waiting to be executed by firing squad for alleged \\"counter-revolutionary activities\\". According to her granddaughter Tatyana Konstantinova-Ziegel's memoirs, the sight of a \\"doomed young beauty in her last days of pregnancy\\" had such a disturbing effect upon a senior investigator officer that he promptly opened the door and let her go. One week after her miraculous release, Nadezhda gave birth to her son. The parents called him Felix, not after the Iron One, as some of the family's friends jovially suggested, but in honour of Prince Felix Yusupov, the man behind the Rasputin murder, whom the husband and wife hero- worshipped. Felix Ziegel spent his early years at the family's countryside dacha in Tarusa where at the age of six he constructed a primitive telescope and started his first journal of astronomical observations. The post-1917 hardships notwithstanding, Yuri Ziegel gave his son a fine education, both technical and humanitarian. Young Felix, apart from being an astronomy enthusiast, showed deep interest in history, philosophy, Russian Orthodox Church architecture and theology. Influenced by his spiritual tutor Alexander Vvedensky, whose sermons he attended regularly in his teens, Felix considered for a while the career of a clergyman. The love for astronomy prevailed, and in 1938 he enrolled in the Moscow University's Mechanics and Mathematics faculty. Two years earlier the sixteen-year-old took part in his first scientific expedition; along with a team of senior scientists he traveled to Kazakhstan to observe the total eclipse of the Sun. It was there that Ziegel met a member of a US expedition camped nearside. The name of the American was Donald Howard Menzel, whose book several years later would change his life. In 1939 Felix Ziegel, a second year student, was expelled from the University after the arrest of his father, who had been accused of plotting the destruction a factory in Tambov. It soon transpired that the anonymous report had been compiled by a neighbour, whose idea was to move into the jailed man's flat. After two years spent in prison Yuri Ziegel was released, a physically and morally broken man. His leg had to be amputated as a consequence of the so-called zhuravl (\\"the Crane\\") torture, in which a prisoner was forced to stand on one leg during the interrogation. =Career= In 1941, as the Great Patriotic War broke out, Yuri Ziegel, an ethnic German, was deported to Alma-Ata with his family. Felix managed to return to the University which he graduated in 1945. The same year his first book \\"Eclipses of the Moon\\" was published. In 1948, after three years' work in the USSR Academy of Science he got his Candidate of Sciences degree in astronomy and started lecturing, mostly in Moscow's Geodesics and Cartography institute and The Planetarium. His most popular spoken-word shows were Life on Mars and Tunguska. The latter, based on Alexander Kazantsev's sci-fi short story \\"The Blast\\", had a soldier protagonist played by a professional actor, who was making a point to involve the audiences into the discussion as to the nature of the 1908 Tunguska event. Felix Ziegel was the first in the USSR to come with the hypothesis for Tunguska blast having been the result of an alien spacecraft crash which, according to the author, had made a 600-kilometers-curve maneuver before exploding in the air. The concept jarred with the official \\"meteorite theory\\" but a decade later the evidence would be found, corroborating his idea that the object indeed went off in the air, without contacting the Earth. This latter discovery came as a result of numerous expeditions to the region made in the 1960s by enthusiasts who, in their own turn, have cited Ziegel's lectures as an original inspiration. In 1963 Ziegel, now the co-author (with Valery Burdakov) of the first Soviet university textbook on the cosmonautics and space exploration became the astronomy docent in the Moscow Aviation Institute. The same year he read Donald Menzel's book Flying Saucers published in Russian which reignited his interest in possible contacts with the extraterrestrial life. = UFO studies = In May 1967 the first official Soviet UFO Study Group held its meeting at the Moscow Aviation and Cosmonautics Center with Major General Pyotr A. Stolyarov at the helm and Ziegel as his deputy. In October the DOSAAF Cosmonautics Committee invited the Group to function under its auspices. Preceding this was the publication of Ziegel's article in Smena magazine, in which he wrote: The article caused furore in the USSR and was regarded in the West as the first ever evidence that the Soviets were aware of the UFO phenomena too. By this time Ziegel has completed his chapter in the book called Naselyonny Kosmos (Inhabited Cosmos), which presented the data collected by the team of well-known Soviet scientists, as well numerous reports by the Russian pilots drawn from the Ministry of Civil Aviation archives. This ambitious research on the question of extraterrestrial intelligence was due to be released by the USSR Academy of Science‚Äôs Nauka Publishing House in 1968. The project's Editor-in-chief was Boris Konstantinov, the Academy's vice-President, academicians Vitaly Ginzburg, Anatoly Blagonravov and Vasily Parin were among the team of scientific reviewers. On November 10, 1967 Stolyarov and Ziegel, speaking on the Central TV, encouraged viewers to send their first-hand accounts in. The response was astonishing: it showed, Ziegel later wrote, that the UFO phenomena was indeed widespread. But before the Committee (by this time comprising more than 200 scientists and high-level professionals) could even begin to work on the information received, its work was abruptly cancelled. In the end of 1967 the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Physics department led by Lev Artsymovich, passed a resolution denouncing studying of UFOs as such. In February 1968 Ziegel made a report at a high-level discussion held in Moscow, academicians Leontovich, Mustel and Petrov attending. Several days later he received a letter from Edward Condon, the director of the University of Colorado UFO Project, suggesting that the Soviet and the American groups should cooperate, starting with the information exchange. Ziegel and twelve other members of his group signed a letter requesting the Soviet government to create the state-sponsored organization that should coordinate all the UFO research in the country. Next month he received the official response: it was negative. The Inhabited Cosmos was already in print, when Boris Konstantinov suddenly died in July 1969. The academician Lev Artsimovich demanded the book to be confiscated and brought before the academician Vasily Fesenkov for further scrutiny. The resume signed by Artzymovich and Fesenkov, read: \\"Along with the articles based on strong scientific evidence we found there some pseudo-scientific scoops (UFOs, Tunguska meteorite, etc.) more akin to fables, which can in no way be published under the Academy's auspice\\". Ziegel and Pekelis made an official protest. It was upheld by Parin, the almanac's new Editor-in-Chief, but rejected by Mikhail Millionshchikov, the Academy's vice- president. The heavily censored 1972 edition, according to Argumenty i Fakty, \\"profoundly shook the readership\\" but there was not a single mention in it of either UFOs or the Tunguska event. \\"Our efforts to tell the truth about the UFO phenomena to a wide scientific community failed completely,\\" Ziegel later admitted. Felix Ziegel in Sharapova Ohota, Moscow region, 1977. The drawing, made according to the witnesses' reports depicts a UFO, allegedly seen at this very place In the early 1973 Ivan F. Obraztsov, the Moscow Aviation Institute rector (and later the RSFSR Minister of Education) asked Ziegel for an update on \\"the current situation around the UFO issue.\\" Much impressed with it, he upheld the idea of restarting the project, but later confessed he could give it only moral support. Ziegel called for the special meeting of the Academy's Radioastronomy Council, inviting some well-known scientists like Vsevolod Troitsky and Nikolai Kardashev. His lecture made an impact: in a carefully worded resolution the Council proposed that the \\"data exchange process should be maintained\\" between the Council and the UFO investigators. Ziegel then formed the UFO Study Group at the MAI, compiled a report called \\"The Preliminary Study of Anomalies in the Earth's Atmosphere\\" and initiated the ambitious UFO-77 symposium. In July 1976 one of Ziegel's (KGB-sanctioned, as he made a point to stress later) lectures, made in the secret Moscow Kulon factory, was published by the samizdat. Amateurishly shorthanded and full of mistakes, it contained some personal data, including the author's telephone numbers. What followed then were what Ziegel later referred to as his \\"days of nightmare.\\" On November 28, 1976, sci-fi writer Yeremey Parnov published in Komsomolskaya Pravda an article entitled \\"The Technology of Myth-mongering\\", calling for \\"this whole UFO business to be sorted out,\\" and labeling ufology \\"pseudoscience\\". Ziegel responded by \\"The Technology of Lies\\" article (which none of the central press wanted to publish) and made an unsuccessful attempt to sue Parnov for libel. Ziegel's UFO Study group was disbanded and what he saw as \\"the libelous campaign aimed at the UFO studies as a whole,\\" commenced. The MAI authorities formed two commissions aimed at \\"re-evaluating\\" Ziegel's work. While one of them found Ziegel's professional activities in the institute flawless, another took a deeper approach, involving studies of his family history, notably his parents' pre-1917 \\"behavior\\". According to this second commission's verdict, Ziegel's work was non-scientific and entirely \\"self-promotional\\", its motivation being \\"getting the West interested in his own persona.\\" According to the two commissions' joint communiqu√©, Ziegel's mistakes came as the result of his \\"poor knowledge of the principal postulates of Marxism-Leninism,\\" which prompted him \\"taking upon the subject far beyond his scientific qualification and scope of knowledge\\". Researcher's demand for this verdict to be openly discussed at the Institute's Communist party committee was ignored. Still, Ziegel had influential allies (whom he often mentioned, but never specified). In The Brief History of the UFO Studying in the USSR he wrote: \\"‚Ä¶So I had to forward letters to our country's highest quarters. I informed them of how important it was that the UFOs should be studied in the USSR, of how serious and significant this problem was and of this press campaign's sheer absurdity. And this time my voice was heard. These higher quarters interfered and made sure no repressive actions would be taken against me.\\" Ziegel was expelled from the Znaniye (Knowledge) society where he lectured for more than thirty years, but retained his position at the MAI. People like physicists V.A. Lashkovtsev and B.N. Panovkin (his former student) continued to attack Ziegel, and, \\"Y. I. Parnov was not to be left behind. As A. P. Kazantsev informed me, speaking at the Writers' Union special Science fiction authors' congress on February 23, 1977, Yeremei Iudovich insisted that \\"Ziegel's lectures were the act of foreign ideological subversion. Their direct result has been our industry's labour efficiency‚Äôs 40 per cent drop!\\", Ziegel wrote. In 1979 he formed another, this time unofficial group of the UFO investigation enthusiasts. It compiled thirteen type-written volumes of the classified UFO sightings evidence, complete with fresh theoretical works, summed up in the extensive thesis called \\"The Introduction to the Future UFO Theory\\".  Death  In 1985 Ziegel suffered a stroke. Recovered, he returned to the Aviation Institute full of new ideas and lecturing plans. A second stroke proved to be fatal; Felix Ziegel died on November 20, 1988. Tatyana Konstantinova-Ziegel told Argymenty I Fakty in March 2010: \\"For my father Stalinism has never ended. As the War broke out he, an ethnic German, was deported to Alma-Ata. After the War he had difficulties because his second name sounded too Jewish to many. And while in the years of the Thaw, the whole country started to shake itself off this horrible catatonia, in science the domination of \\"the one and only correct point of view\\" remained a norm. Obscurantism and common ignorance, unveiled malice from one group of people and secret jealousy of another ‚Äì those were the reasons that prevented him from bringing his ideas to the general public's awareness.\\" According to ufology.net at least 50,000 UFO reports collected by Ziegel have been left stored in the MAI computers. Tatyana Konstantinova-Ziegel claimed she was (as of 2011) still in a possession of 17 huge type-written volumes of her father's unpublished work.

The chain, founded by brothers Adam Kaye and Samuel Kaye in 1993, and floated on AIM in 1995, was the subject of a public-to-private deal in 2004, after which it was merged with Pizza Express to form Gondola Holdings, which was later part of the Gondola Group, and was acquired along with Zizzi for ¬£250 million by Bridgepoint Capital in February 2015. The name can be construed either as the founders' initials or as an acronym for \\"Authentic Sicilian Kitchen\\". ASK was the chain's original name, it was rebranded as ASK Italian from 2010.

It is similar to some mancalas played in West Africa, especially Benin, and could be regarded as a variation of the Wari game, which is the most common mancala game found in the Americas. The game plays an important role in the social life of saramaccans, and it is especially connected to funeral rituals. After someone's death, the game is played for the ten days before burial; at night, the board is left outside in the open so that the yorkas (spirits of the dead) can play with it. The intent is to lure the spirits into the village so that they will eventually accept the dead's spirit in their community. Board can only be manufactured by widows. References * M.J.

He was a national finalist of the Metropolitan Opera auditions and an Adler Fellow with the San Francisco Opera.  Early life  His mother was a soprano and his father was an Opera singer, conductor, director, composer and teacher. He had done some juvenile roles but he decided to pursue a musical career only after graduating from Grand Canyon College in Phoenix, Arizona with a degree in graphic arts. At age 21, he enrolled in the music program at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa where his parents were teaching.  Professional career  His first professional experience was at the North Carolina Opera in 1983. In 1986, he was at the San Francisco Opera in a small role in Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlos. He spent the next three years performing in numerous comprimario roles with the company. After leaving San Francisco, he got work but he received lukewarm reviews that he felt he didn't deserve. He walked out of a job at the Sarasota Opera. The musical director was relieved to see him go: \\"I've never met a guy who has angered my entire company like this.\\" Delavan openly admits to having \\"addictive issues\\" during this time. In the mid 1990s, his father died, he lost his marriage and wound up taking a janitorial job and sleeping in the back room of the Opera Music Theater International in Newark, New Jersey where Jerome Hines had invited him to enroll in a young artists' program. His first big break after that was singing for Frank Corsaro, who said \\"That's about the best Credo I've ever heard.\\" Delavan was then invited to sing at the New York City Opera where he stayed for the next nine years playing most of the major baritone roles from Verdi, Puccini, Wagner and Richard Strauss. His profile has been rising ever since. In 2004, the NYCO asked him what he wanted to do and he suggested an Operatic production of Sweeney Todd opposite Elaine Paige for which he received mostly positive reviews for his \\"hulking presence\\" and \\"striking physicality.\\" For Variety, Charles Isherwood wrote: \\"Delavan‚Äôs Sweeney suggested Frankenstein‚Äôs monster more than anything else.\\" In TheaterMania, Michael Portantiere declared: \\"If Delavan does not quite possess the top-notch musical theater acting skills of such Sweeneys as Len Cariou and George Hearn, he's still a force to be reckoned with.\\" He returned to San Francisco to sing Scarpia in Giacomo Puccini's Tosca (2004, with Carol Vaness in the title role) and Wotan in Richard Wagner's The Ring Cycle (2008, 2010, and 2011).Delavan&psearchtype;= San Francisco Opera Archives In 2001 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Amonasro in Verdi's Aida with Deborah Voigt in the title role, Luciano Pavarotti as Radam√®s, Olga Borodina as Amneris, and James Levine conducting. He has since been heard at the Met as Alfio in Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, Carlo G√©rard in Andrea Ch√©nier, Count Tomsky in The Queen of Spades, Don Carlo in Verdi's La Forza del Destino, the Messenger in Richard Strauss' Die Frau ohne Schatten, Scarpia, and the title roles in Verdi's Nabucco, Verdi's Rigoletto, and Verdi's Simon Boccanegra.Metropolitan Opera Archives Delavan has also sung roles with other leading American companies like the Houston Grand Opera, the Los Angeles Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the New York City Opera, the Opera Company of Philadelphia, the Pittsburgh Opera, the Santa Fe Opera, and the Washington National Opera.

A Spanish army commanded by the Governor of Galicia, Rodrigo Pimentel, Marquis of Viana, entered Portuguese territory and confronted a Portuguese army led by Jo√£o Rodrigues de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 2nd Count of Castelo Melhor. The Spanish were victorious and proceeded over the following months to capture Mon√ß√£o, Salvaterra de Mi√±o and other Portuguese strongholds. Background After the death of King John IV in 1656, various Spanish offensives were launched against Portuguese territory, mainly from Extremadura, but also from Galicia, where a second front was opened to force the Portuguese to divide their forces.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, p. 158 The Spanish governor of Galicia, Vicente de Gonzaga y Doria, crossed in the Mi√±o river in command of 6,000 infantry and 900 cavalry soldiers with the aim of preventing the Portuguese army from sending reinforcements to its garrisons in Alentejo.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, p. 159 He laid siege to the town of Salvatierra de Mi√±o, occupied by Portugal since 1642, but the lack of forces that his army suffered forced him to lift the siege.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, p. 160 However, he ordered a fort to be built atop of the hill of San Pedro de la Torre, near the Portuguese riverside of the Minho river. The fort, named S√£o Luis de Gonzaga, was located a league from Valen√ßa do Minho and Vila Nova de Cerveira. In 1657 a Portuguese army under Count of Castelo Melhor besieged the fort, achieving its surrender in the following year. Planned operations against Tui were frustrated, nevertheless, because of the Spanish conquest in Alentejo of Olivenza and Mour√£o.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, p. 163 A new governor for Galicia, don Rodrigo Pimentel, Marquis of Viana, was appointed by King Philip IV in May 1658 with instructions of recover Salvatierra de Mi√±o and other important towns of the area. Pimentel was seconded in the leadership of his army by don Baltasar de Rojas y Pantoja, Maestre de Campo General; and Maestre de Campo don Francisco de Castro, who had previous experience against Portuguese armies. Marquis of Viana established his headquarters in Tui, where a force consisting of 4,000 infantry, 3,000 militia, 2,000 sappers and 700 cavalry was gathered. The commander of the cavalry was the Portuguese loyalist don Bernardino de Meneses, Marquis of Pe√±alba, Count of Tarouca and Grandee of Portugal. Battle Lu√≠s de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor, whose father commanded the Portuguese army at the Battle of Vilanova. The Spanish army departed Pontevedra on 6 September and entered Portuguese territory on 12 September having crossed the Mi√±o river through a pontoon bridge. Three Portuguese forts located throughout their lines were assaulted and captured by the Tercio of Rojas y Pantoja in a skirmish which cost the Spanish 20 men, among them don Diego Su√°rez de Deza, Se√±or de Castrelos, and two infantry captains, as opposed to 100 Portuguese dead. On 17 September the Portuguese army under Jo√£o Rodrigues de Vasconcelos e Sousa, Count of Castelo Melhor, numbering 5,500 infantry and 500 cavalry men, approached a league from the Spanish. Count of Pe√±alba was then sent to inspect the field in command of 8 cavalry squadrons, which were led by don Francisco de la Cueva, don Francisco Taboada, don √Ålvaro de Anaya, don Francisco Marcos de Velasco, don Antonio de Mocoso, don Andr√©s de Robles and don Pedro Ni√±o. They were accompanied by 8 battalions of the tercios. Teniente Maestro the Campo General don Francisco Buzo, meanwhile, was ordered to skirmish with the Portuguese in command of 400 musketeers. The maneouver of Count of Pe√±alba was covered by Teniente Maestro de Campo General don Francisco Rojo with his Tercio, while don Francisco de la Cueva moved on the opposite flank with the same aim. Marquis of Viana led the major attack from Vila Nova de Cerveira; the Maestro de Campo General commanded a second attack from Valen√ßa do Minho with Comisario General don Crist√≥bal Zorrilla, various other officers and 1,000 soldiers belonging to the Tercios of don Gabriel Sarmiento de Quir√≥s and dos Lu√≠s P√©rez de Vivero. Don Francisco Buzo, whose musketeers were harassing the Portuguese army, reported to Marquis of Viana that Count of Castelo Melhor seemed to have intentions of withdraw with his army.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, p. 172 Count of Pe√±alba with his cavalry and Teniente Maestre de Campo General don Pedro de Aldao with the infantry, in an attempt to avoid it, found the Portuguese entrenched in a slope and attacked their formations until break them. The Portuguese cavalry was defeated; then the infantry fled. 18 Spanish were killed and about 60 or 63 wounded. Count of Castelo Melhor lost 900 men: 250 killed, 380 wounded and 260 prisoners, among who were 28 officers including Count of Vimieiro. Aftermath The day after the battle, the Spanish army captured the Tower of Nogueira and four other watchtowers, as well as some small villages. The Count of Castelo Melhor retreated to Covas de Ponte de Lima, being pursued by the Spanish cavalry, who plundered the place before rejoining the main force. On 30 September, having reorganised his army, the Marquis of Viana laid siege to the fortress of Lapela, which had been his first objective. The village was taken on 6 October with its garrison of 150 soldiers, who were imprisoned in Galicia.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, p. 173 Mon√ß√£o was also besieged, falling in Spanish hands on 7 January 1659 after a costly and expensive siege for both countries. The Count of Castelo Melhor died of illness during the winter and could not prevent the fall of the town. The main objective of the campaign, the recapture of Salvatierra de Mi√±o, was achieved on 17 February.

While many Korean writers were enveloped in nihilism or existentialism, Han Moo-sook made her mark by warmly rendering human joys rather than engaging in cynical pessimism.

All her works, however reveal her multitude of literary skills including vivid description of customs, precise language, and skillful representations of inner consciousness.

The terminal was officially opened on 21 September 2007 by the Duke of Kent when the Queen Elizabeth 2 berthed at the terminal. The current terminal is composed mainly of a floating landing stage, with a small passenger terminal building, but a larger terminal is under construction. The Terminal is run and operated by Cruise Liverpool, the department within Culture Liverpool at Liverpool City Council. History Cunard Line poster 1875 advertising 4 times a week Liverpool-New York passenger service The floating landing stage, Prince's Landing Stage, circa 1930 Long distance scheduled commercial passenger travel by ship began in Liverpool in 1819, regular transatlantic crossing service began in 1840 with the Britannia-class steamship. Princes' Landing Stage at Prince's Dock, Liverpool, next to Pier Head opened in 1875, was demolished in 1973 (a year after transatlantic service ceased), leaving Huskisson Dock for passenger ships to berth. Facilities The ¬£19 million facility is capable of accommodating vessels of in length and draft. The terminal was mostly funded by grants of ¬£9 million from the UK government and ¬£8.6 million from the European Regional Development Fund. The cruise terminal was developed in conjunction with improvements to the Isle of Man ferry terminal, operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. The Royal Navy also berths ships at the terminal several times a year, often allowing the public to visit the ships. The terminal has seen strong growth and in 2017 welcomed a record 63 cruise ships bringing over 111,000 visitors to the city. The facility is expected to be used by 57 ships and 100,000 passengers and crew in 2018, bringing in an estimated ¬£7 million to the local economy. Opening thumb The ¬£9.2 million grant from the UK government came with the strange condition that the terminal could only be used for cruise port-of-calls, which meant cruises would not be allowed to begin or end at the terminal. \\"Turnaround\\" visits generate more revenue for the port and city than port-of-calls. The reason for the strange restriction was that it was to minimize unfair competition with other ports that had been built with private funding, particularly Southampton. Liverpool City Council tried unsuccessfully to have this restriction removed in 2009. In July 2011, the council offered to pay back part of the UK government funding in exchange for being allowed turnaround visits, which led Associated British Ports, the owner of Southampton Docks, to take legal advice. The Southampton Chamber of Commerce collected 12,000 signatures on a petition against the change. Liverpool city council did cite that ¬£70 million of public money was spent in upgrading the rail link from Southampton Docks to the Midlands container terminals competing directly with the Port of Liverpool. This fell on deaf ears. However, in March 2012, the government agreed a repayment offer from Liverpool Council and construction of a temporary terminal buildings began on the shore and floating terminal landing stage. Embarkation point On Tuesday, 29 May 2012 a cruise began from the Pier Head for the first time in 40 years, when Ocean Countess departed on a cruise to the Norwegian fjords. Current services *Fred.

The terminal received UK Government approval in March 2013, after Liverpool City Council approved the scheme in March 2012.http://www.liverpoolwaters.co.uk/content/news.php?id=2130 A second cruise terminal is under construction as a part of the Liverpool Waters scheme. Liverpool City Council unveiled preliminary plans for a ¬£50 million development for the proposed new cruise stage in September 2017. The new facility is being built slightly further down the Mersey at Princes Dock where the old wooden landing stage currently lies. The new terminal will be able to handle ships with up to 3,600 passengers and would include dedicated passport control as well as a cafe. Plans were submitted for planning permission by the council in November 2017 and work on the new facility began in 2018. Belfast building and civil engineering firm McLaughlin & Harvey were awarded a contract in March 2018 to support the council during the first of the two phases of development. The first phase of the project involves finalising the design and construction of the new facility and the removal of the existing derelict Princess Jetty. Planning permission for the new facility and the removal of the old jetty was granted in April 2018. ¬£20 million of funding was granted from Liverpool City Region Combined Authority in August 2018 towards financing the next phase of the project, which is due to start in October of that year. The new passenger terminal will be split across two floors and will be capable of handling vessels carrying up to 3,700 passengers.

The naval battle was part of a campaign ordered by Governor Richard Philipps to retrieve over 82 New England prisoners taken by the Mi'kmaq in fishing vessels off the coast of Nova Scotia. The New England force was led by Ensign John Bradstreet and fishing Captain John Elliot.  Historical context  Dummer's War occurred as a result of an expansion of British settlements along the Kennebec River (in present-day Maine) and of the movement of more New England fishermen into Nova Scotia waters (particularly at Canso, Nova Scotia). The Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which ended Queen Anne's War, had facilitated this expansion. The treaty, however, had been signed in Europe and had not involved any tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy. None had been consulted and they protested through raids on British fishermen and settlements. In response to Wabanaki hostilities toward the expansion, the Governor of Nova Scotia Richard Philipps built a fort in traditional Mi'kmaq territory at Canso in 1720 and Massachusetts Governor Shute built forts on traditional Abenaki territory at the mouth of the Kennebec River. The construction of these fortifications raised tensions which in 1722 spilled into open warfare. In July, the Abenaki and Mi'kmaq blockaded the capital of Nova Scotia Annapolis Royal in an attempt to starve it out. They captured 18 fishing vessels along with prisoners between present-day Cape Sable and Canso. They also captured vessels and took prisoners on the Bay of Fundy. One of the captured vessels had been dispatched from Canso to Annapolis Royal by Governor Philipps and contained a year supply of provisions for the capital. The Maliseet seized another vessel and used it to transport 45 warriors up the bay to join with 120 Mi'kmaq from Shubenacadie and Cape Sable in preparation to march against Annapolis Royal. In response, to protect the capital from native attack and secure the release of the New England prisoners, Lieutenant Governor John Doucett took 22 Mi'kmaq hostage at Annapolis Royal. Soon after the blockade began, Massachusetts Governor Shute declared war on the Wabanaki Confederacy. (Lieutenant Governor William Dummer, after whom the war is named, took the position of Acting Governor in 1723.)  Battle  Immediately after the declaration of war, on July 22, Governor Philipps commissioned Capt. John Elliot and Capt. John Robinson in two sloops with regiments to protect the fishery at Canso and retrieve the New England prisoners. There was a Mi'kmaq camping place near Canso at present-day West Jeddore.Bruce Furguson. Place-Names and Places of Nova Scotia, p. 314 There were thirty-nine natives at Winnepang (present-day Jeddore Harbour) who were holding prisoners in seven vessels. Captains Elliot and Bradstreet arrived in the harbour and attacked the natives in a two-hour naval battle. Bradstreet led a boarding party that overwhelmed the natives with hand grenades and disciplined fire. The New Englanders had five men killed and several injured, including a badly wounded Capt. Elliot.; reports there was only one New Englander killed and several wounded. As the Mi'kmaq tried to swim ashore to escape, the New Englanders opened fire on them. Thirty-five Natives were killed. The New Englanders managed to rescue fifteen prisoners from the vessels, while discovering that nine had been killed. Only about five natives survived the battle, and when the bodies of the roughly thirty native casualties were recovered from the battle the New Englanders decapitated the corpses, setting the severed heads on spikes surrounding Canso's new fort.  Aftermath  Elsewhere in the campaign to retrieve the New England prisoners, James Blinn negotiated a prisoner exchange at Canso and won the release of 24 fishermen. Blinn later kidnapped another three or four natives at Cape Sable Island. In Captain Robinson's expedition, he captured ten of the vessels and killed three Abenaki. Robinson warned the Mi'kmaq not to harm the New England prisoners because they still had Mi'kmaq hostages at Annapolis Royal. He then arrived at Malagash harbour where the natives held five of the fishing vessels along with twenty prisoners. Robinson paid a ransom and they were released. Captain Cyprian Southack killed one Mi'kmaq and took another five as prisoners off the Gut of Canso. The Natives had sent sixteen prisoners to present-day Richibucto, New Brunswick.

She enjoyed a particularly fruitful partnership with the New York City Opera, appearing with the company almost every year since 1990. She has sung more than 100 different opera roles on stage during her career, often appearing in contemporary works or more rarely staged operas. Opera News stated that, \\"Flanigan has enjoyed one of the most distinctive careers of any artist of her generation, one marked by a high volume of contemporary works. Modern composers love her because of her innate musicality, dramatic power and lightning-fast skills and instincts.\\" Education and early career Flanigan was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of Irish and Pennsylvania Dutch parents. In 1971, at the age of 12, she appeared as Flora in Benjamin Britten's The Turn of the Screw with the San Francisco Western Opera Theatre. Her portrayal of Flora resulted in being offered a full scholarship to study music, violin and voice in the pre-college program at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. While there she studied voice with Alice Taylor. She went on to earn a Bachelor of Music degree from Boston University where she was a voice student of Mac Morgan. She pursued graduate studies in vocal performance with Judith Raskin at the Manhattan School of Music, earning a Master of Music degree in 1984. In 1986 she was accepted as a post graduate student in voice at the Juilliard School. Flanigan credits much of her early experience to the singular interest of Dr. Robert Larsen of the Des Moines Metro Opera where in 1985 she was cast as Clorinda in Gioachino Rossini's La Cenerentola and as Curley's Wife in Carlisle Floyd's Of Mice and Men. This was followed by performances in 1987 as Musetta in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me and Miss Jessel in The Turn of the Screw; 1989 as Rosalinda in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus; and 1990 in Britten's Peter Grimes.

She was elected to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly representing the division of Araluen for the Country Liberal Party in a 2010 by-election following the resignation of Jodeen Carney. She resigned from the CLP and contested Araluen as an independent in 2016, then joined the Territory Alliance in March 2020. Early life Lambley was born in Grafton, New South Wales, and moved to Alice Springs in 1993 where she was in charge of the hospital's Social Work Department and Aboriginal Liaison and Interpreting Service. In 2000, she and her husband opened the Mad Harry's retail store. In addition to running the business and raising two children, Lambley served as a councillor on the Alice Springs Town Council, and was deputy mayor of Alice Springs from 2006 to 2007.2010 Araluen By-election, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2010. Politics Following the Country Liberal Party's victory in the 2012 territory election, the CLP voted Lambley deputy leader of the party (and Deputy Chief Minister to Terry Mills), replacing Kezia Purick who had been deputy leader prior to the election.Sleath, Emma (29 August 2012): Lambley new deputy leader, ABC Darwin, 29 August 2012. She and Mills were initially sworn in as a two-person government, pending the full ministry's swearing-in on 3 September. At that time, among other portfolios, Lambley became Treasurer. Lambley resigned as the Deputy Chief Minister on 5 March 2013, but stayed on as Treasurer. In a March cabinet reshuffle, Lambley became Minister for Health, a post she retained when Mills was ousted in favour of Adam Giles. Lambley was sacked from cabinet in February 2015 for helping Willem Westra van Holthe and John Elferink line up support for their attempted party-room coup against Giles. She resigned from the CLP on 17 June 2015 after the release of a proposed redistribution of electoral boundaries that would see her seat of Araluen dismantled. A revised map later saw Araluen retained. Lambley contested Araluen as an independent in the 2016 Territory election. On the primary vote, she finished just a few hundred votes ahead of her replacement as CLP candidate, Stephen Brown. However, she easily defeated Brown on Labor preferences, taking 58 percent of the two-party vote.Green, Antony. Northern Territory Votes: Araluen. ABC News, 8 August 2016.Araluen. ABC News, 31 August 2016. Lambley often communicates with voters in her district with 'drive thru chats', where she sits by the side of the road and waits for people to pull over and discuss local issues within her community. On 18 March 2020, Lambley joined the Territory Alliance party founded by former chief minister Terry Mills. She also became deputy leader of Territory Alliance, once again becoming Mills' deputy as she had been Deputy Chief Minister to Mills in the previous CLP government. Mills and Lambley becoming allies after their departure from the CLP marked a contrast in working relations between the two as Lambley was among those to support Mills' ousting as Chief Minister.https://alicespringsnews.com.au/2013/03/13/adem-giles-coup- is-good-for-us-down-here/ In 2020, the Territory Alliance had a dismal election, with Mills losing his seat. Lambley finished second on the primary vote to CLP candidate Damien Ryan, but scraped back in on Labor preferences.

It may also refer to the attainment of insight in ultimate or hidden truths, and to human transformation supported by various practices and experiences. The term \\"mysticism\\" has Ancient Greek origins with various historically determined meanings. Derived from the Greek word Œºœçœâ m√∫≈ç, meaning \\"to close\\" or \\"to conceal\\", mysticism referred to the biblical, liturgical, spiritual, and contemplative dimensions of early and medieval Christianity. During the early modern period, the definition of mysticism grew to include a broad range of beliefs and ideologies related to \\"extraordinary experiences and states of mind.\\" In modern times, \\"mysticism\\" has acquired a limited definition, with broad applications, as meaning the aim at the \\"union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God\\". This limited definition has been applied to a wide range of religious traditions and practices, valuing \\"mystical experience\\" as a key element of mysticism. Broadly defined, mysticism can be found in all religious traditions, from indigenous religions and folk religions like shamanism, to organized religions like the Abrahamic faiths and Indian religions, and modern spirituality, New Age and New Religious Movements. Since the 1960s scholars have debated the merits of perennial and constructionist approaches in the scientific research of \\"mystical experiences\\". The perennial position is now \\"largely dismissed by scholars\\", most scholars using a contextualist approach, which takes the cultural and historical context into consideration. Etymology \\"Mysticism\\" is derived from the Greek , meaning \\"I conceal\\", and its derivative , mystikos, meaning 'an initiate'. The verb has received a quite different meaning in the Greek language, where it is still in use. The primary meanings it has are \\"induct\\" and \\"initiate\\". Secondary meanings include \\"introduce\\", \\"make someone aware of something\\", \\"train\\", \\"familiarize\\", \\"give first experience of something\\". The related form of the verb (mue√≥ or my√©≈ç) appears in the New Testament. As explained in Strong's Concordance, it properly means shutting the eyes and mouth to experience mystery. Its figurative meaning is to be initiated into the \\"mystery revelation\\". The meaning derives from the initiatory rites of the pagan mysteries. Also appearing in the New Testament is the related noun (must√©rion or myst·∏órion), the root word of the English term \\"mystery\\". The term means \\"anything hidden\\", a mystery or secret, of which initiation is necessary. In the New Testament it reportedly takes the meaning of the counsels of God, once hidden but now revealed in the Gospel or some fact thereof, the Christian revelation generally, and/or particular truths or details of the Christian revelation. According to Thayer's Greek Lexicon, the term in classical Greek meant \\"a hidden thing\\", \\"secret\\". A particular meaning it took in Classical antiquity was a religious secret or religious secrets, confided only to the initiated and not to be communicated by them to ordinary mortals. In the Septuagint and the New Testament the meaning it took was that of a hidden purpose or counsel, a secret will. It is sometimes used for the hidden wills of humans, but is more often used for the hidden will of God. Elsewhere in the Bible it takes the meaning of the mystic or hidden sense of things. It is used for the secrets behind sayings, names, or behind images seen in visions and dreams. The Vulgate often translates the Greek term to the Latin (sacrament). The related noun (mustis or mystis, singular) means the initiate, the person initiated to the mysteries. According to Ana Jim√©nez San Cristobal in her study of Greco-Roman mysteries and Orphism, the singular form and the plural form are used in ancient Greek texts to mean the person or persons initiated to religious mysteries. These followers of mystery religions belonged to a select group, where access was only gained through an initiation. She finds that the terms were associated with the term (Bacchus), which was used for a special class of initiates of the Orphic mysteries. The terms are first found connected in the writings of Heraclitus. Such initiates are identified in texts with the persons who have been purified and have performed certain rites. A passage of the Cretans by Euripides seems to explain that the (initiate) who devotes himself to an ascetic life, renounces sexual activities, and avoids contact with the dead becomes known as . Such initiates were believers in the god Dionysus Bacchus who took on the name of their god and sought an identification with their deity.San Cristobal (2009), p. 51-52 Until the sixth century the practice of what is now called mysticism was referred to by the term contemplatio, c.q. theoria. According to Johnson, \\"[b]oth contemplation and mysticism speak of the eye of love which is looking at, gazing at, aware of divine realities.\\" Definitions According to Peter Moore, the term \\"mysticism\\" is \\"problematic but indispensable.\\" It is a generic term which joins together into one concept separate practices and ideas which developed separately, According to Dupr√©, \\"mysticism\\" has been defined in many ways, and Merkur notes that the definition, or meaning, of the term \\"mysticism\\" has changed through the ages. Moore further notes that the term \\"mysticism\\" has become a popular label for \\"anything nebulous, esoteric, occult, or supernatural.\\" Parsons warns that \\"what might at times seem to be a straightforward phenomenon exhibiting an unambiguous commonality has become, at least within the academic study of religion, opaque and controversial on multiple levels\\". Because of its Christian overtones, and the lack of similar terms in other cultures, some scholars regard the term \\"mysticism\\" to be inadequate as a useful descriptive term. Other scholars regard the term to be an inauthentic fabrication, the \\"product of post-Enlightenment universalism.\\" Union with the Divine or Absolute and mystical experience Deriving from Neo-Platonism and Henosis, mysticism is popularly known as union with God or the Absolute. In the 13th century the term unio mystica came to be used to refer to the \\"spiritual marriage,\\" the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used \\"to contemplate both God‚Äôs omnipresence in the world and God in his essence.\\" In the 19th century, under the influence of Romanticism, this \\"union\\" was interpreted as a \\"religious experience,\\" which provides certainty about God or a transcendental reality. An influential proponent of this understanding was William James (1842‚Äì1910), who stated that \\"in mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness.\\" William James popularized this use of the term \\"religious experience\\" in his The Varieties of Religious Experience, contributing to the interpretation of mysticism as a distinctive experience, comparable to sensory experiences. Religious experiences belonged to the \\"personal religion,\\" which he considered to be \\"more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism\\". He gave a Perennialist interpretation to religious experience, stating that this kind of experience is ultimately uniform in various traditions. McGinn notes that the term unio mystica, although it has Christian origins, is primarily a modern expression. McGinn argues that \\"presence\\" is more accurate than \\"union\\", since not all mystics spoke of union with God, and since many visions and miracles were not necessarily related to union. He also argues that we should speak of \\"consciousness\\" of God's presence, rather than of \\"experience\\", since mystical activity is not simply about the sensation of God as an external object, but more broadly about \\"new ways of knowing and loving based on states of awareness in which God becomes present in our inner acts.\\" However, the idea of \\"union\\" does not work in all contexts. For example, in Advaita Vedanta, there is only one reality (Brahman) and therefore nothing other than reality to unite with it‚ÄîBrahman in each person (atman) has always in fact been identical to Brahman all along. Dan Merkur also notes that union with God or the Absolute is a too limited definition, since there are also traditions which aim not at a sense of unity, but of nothingness, such as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Meister Eckhart. According to Merkur, Kabbala and Buddhism also emphasize nothingness. Blakemore and Jennett note that \\"definitions of mysticism [...] are often imprecise.\\" They further note that this kind of interpretation and definition is a recent development which has become the standard definition and understanding. According to Gelman, \\"A unitive experience involves a phenomenological de-emphasis, blurring, or eradication of multiplicity, where the cognitive significance of the experience is deemed to lie precisely in that phenomenological feature\\". Religious ecstasies and interpretative context Mysticism involves an explanatory context, which provides meaning for mystical and visionary experiences, and related experiences like trances. According to Dan Merkur, mysticism may relate to any kind of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness, and the ideas and explanations related to them. Parsons stresses the importance of distinguishing between temporary experiences and mysticism as a process, which is embodied within a \\"religious matrix\\" of texts and practices. Richard Jones does the same. Peter Moore notes that mystical experience may also happen in a spontaneous and natural way, to people who are not committed to any religious tradition. These experiences are not necessarily interpreted in a religious framework. Ann Taves asks by which processes experiences are set apart and deemed religious or mystical. Intuitive insight and enlightenment Some authors emphasize that mystical experience involves intuitive understanding of the meaning of existence and of hidden truths, and the resolution of life problems. According to Larson, \\"mystical experience is an intuitive understanding and realization of the meaning of existence.\\" According to McClenon, mysticism is \\"the doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths.\\" According to James R. Horne, mystical illumination is \\"a central visionary experience [...] that results in the resolution of a personal or religious problem. According to Evelyn Underhill, illumination is a generic English term for the phenomenon of mysticism. The term illumination is derived from the Latin illuminatio, applied to Christian prayer in the 15th century. Comparable Asian terms are bodhi, kensho and satori in Buddhism, commonly translated as \\"enlightenment\\", and vipassana, which all point to cognitive processes of intuition and comprehension. According to Wright, the use of the western word enlightenment is based on the supposed resemblance of bodhi with Aufkl√§rung, the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world, and there are more resemblances with Romanticism than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances. Spiritual life and re-formation Other authors point out that mysticism involves more than \\"mystical experience.\\" According to Gellmann, the ultimate goal of mysticism is human transformation, not just experiencing mystical or visionary states. According to McGinn, personal transformation is the essential criterion to determine the authenticity of Christian mysticism. History of the term=Hellenistic world In the Hellenistic world, 'mystical' referred to \\"secret\\" religious rituals like the Eleusinian Mysteries. The use of the word lacked any direct references to the transcendental. A \\"mystikos\\" was an initiate of a mystery religion. Early Christianity In early Christianity the term \\"mystikos\\" referred to three dimensions, which soon became intertwined, namely the biblical, the liturgical and the spiritual or contemplative. The biblical dimension refers to \\"hidden\\" or allegorical interpretations of Scriptures. The liturgical dimension refers to the liturgical mystery of the Eucharist, the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The third dimension is the contemplative or experiential knowledge of God. Until the sixth century, the Greek term theoria, meaning \\"contemplation\\" in Latin, was used for the mystical interpretation of the Bible. The link between mysticism and the vision of the Divine was introduced by the early Church Fathers, who used the term as an adjective, as in mystical theology and mystical contemplation. Under the influence of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite the mystical theology came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible, and \\"the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names.\\" Pseudo-Dionysius' Apophatic theology, or \\"negative theology\\", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity. It was influenced by Neo- Platonism, and very influential in Eastern Orthodox Christian theology. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing Cataphatic theology or \\"positive theology\\". Theoria enabled the Fathers to perceive depths of meaning in the biblical writings that escape a purely scientific or empirical approach to interpretation.John Breck, Scripture in Tradition: The Bible and Its Interpretation in the Orthodox Church, St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2001, p. 11. The Antiochene Fathers, in particular, saw in every passage of Scripture a double meaning, both literal and spiritual.Breck, Scripture in Tradition, p. 37. Later, theoria or contemplation came to be distinguished from intellectual life, leading to the identification of Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒØŒ± or contemplatio with a form of prayerOxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ), article contemplation, contemplative life distinguished from discursive meditation in both EastMatt√° al-Miskƒ´n, Orthodox Prayer Life: The Interior Way (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2003 ), pp. 55‚Äì56 and West. Medieval meaning This threefold meaning of \\"mystical\\" continued in the Middle Ages. According to Dan Merkur, the term unio mystica came into use in the 13th century as a synonym for the \\"spiritual marriage,\\" the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used \\"to contemplate both God‚Äôs omnipresence in the world and God in his essence.\\" Under the influence of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite the mystical theology came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible, and \\"the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names.\\" Pseudo-Dionysius' Apophatic theology, or \\"negative theology\\", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity, although it was mostly a male religiosity, since women were not allowed to study. It was influenced by Neo-Platonism, and very influential in Eastern Orthodox Christian theology. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing Cataphatic theology or \\"positive theology\\". It is best known nowadays in the western world from Meister Eckhart and John of the Cross. Early modern meaning The Appearance of the Holy Spirit before Saint Teresa of √Åvila, Peter Paul Rubens In the sixteenth and seventeenth century mysticism came to be used as a substantive. This shift was linked to a new discourse, in which science and religion were separated. Luther dismissed the allegorical interpretation of the bible, and condemned Mystical theology, which he saw as more Platonic than Christian. \\"The mystical\\", as the search for the hidden meaning of texts, became secularised, and also associated with literature, as opposed to science and prose. Science was also distinguished from religion. By the middle of the 17th century, \\"the mystical\\" is increasingly applied exclusively to the religious realm, separating religion and \\"natural philosophy\\" as two distinct approaches to the discovery of the hidden meaning of the universe. The traditional hagiographies and writings of the saints became designated as \\"mystical\\", shifting from the virtues and miracles to extraordinary experiences and states of mind, thereby creating a newly coined \\"mystical tradition\\". A new understanding developed of the Divine as residing within human, an essence beyond the varieties of religious expressions. Contemporary meaning The 19th century saw a growing emphasis on individual experience, as a defense against the growing rationalism of western society. The meaning of mysticism was considerably narrowed: Under the influence of Perennialism, which was popularised in both the west and the east by Unitarianism, Transcendentalists and Theosophy, mysticism has been applied to a broad spectrum of religious traditions, in which all sorts of esotericism and religious traditions and practices are joined together. The term mysticism was extended to comparable phenomena in non-Christian religions, where it influenced Hindu and Buddhist responses to colonialism, resulting in Neo-Vedanta and Buddhist modernism. In the contemporary usage \\"mysticism\\" has become an umbrella term for all sorts of non-rational world views, parapsychology and pseudoscience. William Harmless even states that mysticism has become \\"a catch-all for religious weirdness\\". Within the academic study of religion the apparent \\"unambiguous commonality\\" has become \\"opaque and controversial\\". The term \\"mysticism\\" is being used in different ways in different traditions. Some call to attention the conflation of mysticism and linked terms, such as spirituality and esotericism, and point at the differences between various traditions. Variations of mysticism Based on various definitions of mysticism, namely mysticism as an experience of union or nothingness, mysticism as any kind of an altered state of consciousness which is attributed in a religious way, mysticism as \\"enlightenment\\" or insight, and mysticism as a way of transformation, \\"mysticism\\" can be found in many cultures and religious traditions, both in folk religion and organized religion. These traditions include practices to induce religious or mystical experiences, but also ethical standards and practices to enhance self-control and integrate the mystical experience into daily life. Dan Merkur notes, though, that mystical practices are often separated from daily religious practices, and restricted to \\"religious specialists like monastics, priests, and other renunciates. Shamanism Shaman According to Dan Merkur, shamanism may be regarded as a form of mysticism, in which the world of spirits is accessed through religious ecstasy. According to Mircea Eliade shamanism is a \\"technique of religious ecstasy.\\"Mircea Eliade, Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy, Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3‚Äì7. Shamanism is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.Hopp√°l 1987. p. 76. A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.Oxford Dictionary Online. The term \\"shamanism\\" was first applied by western anthropologists to the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighboring Tungusic and Samoyedic-speaking peoples. The term is also used to describe similar magico-religious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas. For instance, Louisiana Voodoo, Haitian Vodou, West African Vodun, Dominican Vud√∫ and Hoodoo are related folk-religions with ecstatic elements. Neoshamanism refers to \\"new\\"' forms of shamanism, or methods of seeking visions or healing, typically practiced in Western countries. Neoshamanism comprises an eclectic range of beliefs and practices that involve attempts to attain altered states and communicate with a spirit world, and is associated with New Age practices.Harner, Michael The Way of the Shaman. 1980, new edition, HarperSanFrancisco, 1990, Western mysticismMystery religions= The Eleusinian Mysteries, (Greek: ·ºòŒªŒµœÖœÉŒØŒΩŒπŒ± ŒúœÖœÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒ±) were annual initiation ceremonies in the cults of the goddesses Demeter and Persephone, held in secret at Eleusis (near Athens) in ancient Greece.Ker√©nyi, Karoly, \\"Kore,\\" in C.G. Jung and C. Ker√©nyi, Essays on a Science of Mythology: The Myth of the Divine Child and the Mysteries of Eleusis. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963: pages 101‚Äì55. The mysteries began in about 1600 B.C. in the Mycenean period and continued for two thousand years, becoming a major festival during the Hellenic era, and later spreading to Rome.Eliade, Mircea, A History of Religious Ideas: From the Stone Age to the Eleusinian Mysteries. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978. Numerous scholars have proposed that the power of the Eleusinian Mysteries came from the kykeon's functioning as an entheogen. =Christian mysticismEarly Christianity The apophatic theology, or \\"negative theology\\", of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (6th c.) exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity, both in the East and (by Latin translation) in the West. Pseudo-Dionysius applied Neoplatonic thought, particularly that of Proclus, to Christian theology. Orthodox Christianity The Orthodox Church has a long tradition of theoria (intimate experience) and hesychia (inner stillness), in which contemplative prayer silences the mind to progress along the path of theosis (deification). Theosis, practical unity with and conformity to God, is obtained by engaging in contemplative prayer, the first stage of theoria, which results from the cultivation of watchfulness (nepsis). In theoria, one comes to behold the \\"divisibly indivisible\\" divine operations (energeia) of God as the \\"uncreated light\\" of transfiguration, a grace which is eternal and proceeds naturally from the blinding darkness of the incomprehensible divine essence. It is the main aim of hesychasm, which was developed in the thought St. Symeon the New Theologian, embraced by the monastic communities on Mount Athos, and most notably defended by St. Gregory Palamas against the Greek humanist philosopher Barlaam of Calabria. According to Roman Catholic critics, hesychastic practice has its roots to the introduction of a systematic practical approach to quietism by Symeon the New Theologian. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, without the need for formal ordination. While Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience,deCatanzaro 1980, pp. 9‚Äì10. and met with strong resistance for his charismatic approach, and his support of individual direct experience of God's grace. Western Europe Life of Francis of Assisi by Jos√© Benlliure y Gil The High Middle Ages saw a flourishing of mystical practice and theorization in western Roman Catholicism, corresponding to the flourishing of new monastic orders, with such figures as Guigo II, Hildegard of Bingen, Bernard of Clairvaux, the Victorines, all coming from different orders, as well as the first real flowering of popular piety among the laypeople. The Late Middle Ages saw the clash between the Dominican and Franciscan schools of thought, which was also a conflict between two different mystical theologies: on the one hand that of Dominic de Guzm√°n and on the other that of Francis of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, Bonaventure, and Angela of Foligno. This period also saw such individuals as John of Ruysbroeck, Catherine of Siena and Catherine of Genoa, the Devotio Moderna, and such books as the Theologia Germanica, The Cloud of Unknowing and The Imitation of Christ. Moreover, there was the growth of groups of mystics centered around geographic regions: the Beguines, such as Mechthild of Magdeburg and Hadewijch (among others); the Rhineland mystics Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler and Henry Suso; and the English mystics Richard Rolle, Walter Hilton and Julian of Norwich. The Spanish mystics included Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross and Ignatius Loyola. The later post-reformation period also saw the writings of lay visionaries such as Emanuel Swedenborg and William Blake, and the foundation of mystical movements such as the Quakers. Catholic mysticism continued into the modern period with such figures as Padre Pio and Thomas Merton. The philokalia, an ancient method of Eastern Orthodox mysticism, was promoted by the twentieth century Traditionalist School. The allegedly inspired or \\"channeled\\" work A Course in Miracles represents a blending of non-denominational Christian and New Age ideas. =Western esotericism and modern spirituality= Many western esoteric traditions and elements of modern spirituality have been regarded as \\"mysticism,\\" such as Gnosticism, Transcendentalism, Theosophy, the Fourth Way, and Neo-Paganism. Modern western spiritually and transpersonal psychology combine western psycho-therapeutic practices with religious practices like meditation to attain a lasting transformation. Nature mysticism is an intense experience of unification with nature or the cosmic totality, which was popular with Romantic writers. Jewish mysticism Portrait of Abraham Abulafia, Medieval Jewish mystic and founder of Prophetic Kabbalah. In the common era, Judaism has had two main kinds of mysticism: Merkabah mysticism and Kabbalah. The former predated the latter, and was focused on visions, particularly those mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel. It gets its name from the Hebrew word meaning \\"chariot\\", a reference to Ezekiel's vision of a fiery chariot composed of heavenly beings. Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious Ein Sof (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). Inside Judaism, it forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation. Kabbalah originally developed entirely within the realm of Jewish thought. Kabbalists often use classical Jewish sources to explain and demonstrate its esoteric teachings. These teachings are thus held by followers in Judaism to define the inner meaning of both the Hebrew Bible and traditional Rabbinic literature, their formerly concealed transmitted dimension, as well as to explain the significance of Jewish religious observances.\\"Imbued with Holiness\\" ‚Äì The relationship of the esoteric to the exoteric in the fourfold Pardes interpretation of Torah and existence. From www.kabbalaonline.org Kabbalah emerged, after earlier forms of Jewish mysticism, in 12th to 13th century Southern France and Spain, becoming reinterpreted in the Jewish mystical renaissance of 16th-century Ottoman Palestine. It was popularised in the form of Hasidic Judaism from the 18th century forward. 20th-century interest in Kabbalah has inspired cross- denominational Jewish renewal and contributed to wider non-Jewish contemporary spirituality, as well as engaging its flourishing emergence and historical re- emphasis through newly established academic investigation. Islamic mysticism Sufism is said to be Islam's inner and mystical dimension.Alan Godlas, University of Georgia, Sufism's Many Paths, 2000, University of Georgia Nuh Ha Mim Keller, \\"How would you respond to the claim that Sufism is Bid'a?\\", 1995. Fatwa accessible at: Masud.co.ukZubair Fattani, \\"The meaning of Tasawwuf\\", Islamic Academy. Islamicacademy.org Classical Sufi scholars have defined Sufism as A practitioner of this tradition is nowadays known as a ' (), or, in earlier usage, a dervish. The origin of the word \\"Sufi\\" is ambiguous. One understanding is that Sufi means wool-wearer; wool wearers during early Islam were pious ascetics who withdrew from urban life. Another explanation of the word \\"Sufi\\" is that it means 'purity'. Sufis generally belong to a khalqa, a circle or group, led by a Sheikh or Murshid. Sufi circles usually belong to a Tariqa which is the Sufi order and each has a Silsila, which is the spiritual lineage, which traces its succession back to notable Sufis of the past, and often ultimately to the last prophet Muhammed or one of his close associates. The turuq (plural of tariqa) are not enclosed like Christian monastic orders; rather the members retain an outside life. Membership of a Sufi group often passes down family lines. Meetings may or may not be segregated according to the prevailing custom of the wider society. An existing Muslim faith is not always a requirement for entry, particularly in Western countries. MawlƒÅnƒÅ Rumi's tomb, Konya, Turkey Sufi practice includes * Dhikr, or remembrance (of God), which often takes the form of rhythmic chanting and breathing exercises. * Sama, which takes the form of music and dance ‚Äî the whirling dance of the Mevlevi dervishes is a form well known in the West. * Muraqaba or meditation. * Visiting holy places, particularly the tombs of Sufi saints, in order to remember death and the greatness of those who have passed. The aims of Sufism include: the experience of ecstatic states (hal), purification of the heart (qalb), overcoming the lower self (nafs), extinction of the individual personality (fana), communion with God (haqiqa), and higher knowledge (marifat). Some sufic beliefs and practices have been found unorthodox by other Muslims; for instance Mansur al-Hallaj was put to death for blasphemy after uttering the phrase Ana'l Haqq, \\"I am the Truth\\" (i.e. God) in a trance. Notable classical Sufis include Jalaluddin Rumi, Fariduddin Attar, Sultan Bahoo, Sayyed Sadique Ali Husaini, Saadi Shirazi and Hafez, all major poets in the Persian language. Omar Khayyam, Al-Ghazzali and Ibn Arabi were renowned scholars. Abdul Qadir Jilani, Moinuddin Chishti, and Bahauddin Naqshband founded major orders, as did Rumi. Rabia Basri was the most prominent female Sufi. Sufism first came into contact with the Judeo- Christian world during the Moorish occupation of Spain. An interest in Sufism revived in non-Muslim countries during the modern era, led by such figures as Inayat Khan and Idries Shah (both in the UK), Rene Guenon (France) and Ivan Agu√©li (Sweden). Sufism has also long been present in Asian countries that do not have a Muslim majority, such as India and China. Indian religionsHinduism= In Hinduism, various sadhanas aim at overcoming ignorance (avidhya) and transcending the limited identification with body, mind and ego to attain moksha. Hinduism has a number of interlinked ascetic traditions and philosophical schools which aim at moksha and the acquisition of higher powers. With the onset of the British colonisation of India, those traditions came to be interpreted in western terms such as \\"mysticism\\", drawing equivalents with western terms and practices. Yoga is the physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which aim to attain a state of permanent peace. Various traditions of yoga are found in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.Denise Lardner Carmody, John Carmody, Serene Compassion. Oxford University Press US, 1996, page 68.Stuart Ray Sarbacker, SamƒÅdhi: The Numinous and Cessative in Indo-Tibetan Yoga. SUNY Press, 2005, pp. 1‚Äì2.Tattvarthasutra [6.1], see Manu Doshi (2007) Translation of Tattvarthasutra, Ahmedabad: Shrut Ratnakar p. 102 The Yoga S≈´tras of Pata√±jali defines yoga as \\"the stilling of the changing states of the mind,\\" which is attained in samadhi. Classical Vedanta gives philosophical interpretations and commentaries of the Upanishads, a vast collection of ancient hymns. At least ten schools of Vedanta are known, of which Advaita Vedanta, Vishishtadvaita, and Dvaita are the best known. Advaita Vedanta, as expounded by Adi Shankara, states that there is no difference between Atman and Brahman. The best-known subschool is Kevala Vedanta or mayavada as expounded by Adi Shankara. Advaita Vedanta has acquired a broad acceptance in Indian culture and beyond as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality. In contrast Bhedabheda-Vedanta emphasizes that Atman and Brahman are both the same and not the same, while Dvaita Vedanta states that Atman and God are fundamentally different. In modern times, the Upanishads have been interpreted by Neo-Vedanta as being \\"mystical\\". Various Shaivist traditions are strongly nondualistic, such as Kashmir Shaivism and Shaiva Siddhanta. =Tantra= Tantra is the name given by scholars to a style of meditation and ritual which arose in India no later than the fifth century AD. Tantra has influenced the Hindu, B√∂n, Buddhist, and Jain traditions and spread with Buddhism to East and Southeast Asia. Tantric ritual seeks to access the supra-mundane through the mundane, identifying the microcosm with the macrocosm.Harper (2002), p. 2. The Tantric aim is to sublimate (rather than negate) reality.Nikhilanada (1982), pp. 145‚Äì160 The Tantric practitioner seeks to use prana (energy flowing through the universe, including one's body) to attain goals which may be spiritual, material or both.Harper (2002), p. 3. Tantric practice includes visualisation of deities, mantras and mandalas. It can also include sexual and other (antinomian) practices. =Sant-tradition and Sikhism= Guru Nanak and Bhai Mardana Mysticism in the Sikh dharm began with its founder, Guru Nanak, who as a child had profound mystical experiences. Guru Nanak stressed that God must be seen with 'the inward eye', or the 'heart', of a human being. Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, added religious mystics belonging to other religions into the holy scriptures that would eventually become the Guru Granth Sahib. The goal of Sikhism is to be one with God. Sikhs meditate as a means to progress towards enlightenment; it is devoted meditation simran that enables a sort of communication between the Infinite and finite human consciousness. There is no concentration on the breath but chiefly the remembrance of God through the recitation of the name of God and surrender themselves to God's presence often metaphorized as surrendering themselves to the Lord's feet. =Buddhism= According to Oliver, Buddhism is mystical in the sense that it aims at the identification of the true nature of our self, and live according to it.Oliver, P. Mysticism: A Guide for the Perplexed, pp. 47‚Äì48 Buddhism originated in India, sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, but is now mostly practiced in other countries, where it developed into a number of traditions, the main ones being Therevada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Buddhism aims at liberation from the cycle of rebirth by self-control through meditation and morally just behaviour. Some Buddhist paths aim at a gradual development and transformation of the personality toward Nirvana, like the Theravada stages of enlightenment. Others, like the Japanese Rinzai Zen tradition, emphasize sudden insight, but nevertheless also prescribe intensive training, including meditation and self-restraint. Although Theravada does not acknowledge the existence of a theistic Absolute, it does postulate Nirvana as a transcendent reality which may be attained. It further stresses transformation of the personality through meditative practice, self-restraint, and morally just behaviour. According to Richard H. Jones, Theravada is a form of mindful extrovertive and introvertive mysticism, in which the conceptual structuring of experiences is weakened, and the ordinary sense of self is weakened. It is best known in the west from the Vipassana movement, a number of branches of modern TheravƒÅda Buddhism from Burma, Laos, Thailand and Sri Lanka, and includes contemporary American Buddhist teachers such as Joseph Goldstein and Jack Kornfield. The Yogacara school of Mahayana investigates the workings of the mind, stating that only the mind (citta-mƒÅtra) or the representations we cognize (vij√±apti-mƒÅtra), really exist. In later Buddhist Mahayana thought, which took an idealistic turn, the unmodified mind came to be seen as a pure consciousness, from which everything arises. Vij√±apti-mƒÅtra, coupled with Buddha-nature or tathagatagarba, has been an influential concept in the subsequent development of Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notable in the Ch√°n (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions. Chinese and Japanese Zen is grounded on the Chinese understanding of the Buddha-nature as one true's essence, and the Two truths doctrine as a polarity between relative and Absolute reality. Zen aims at insight one's true nature, or Buddha-nature, thereby manifesting Absolute reality in the relative reality. In Soto, this Buddha-nature is regarded to be ever-present, and shikan-taza, sitting meditation, is the expression of the already existing Buddhahood. Rinzai-zen emphasises the need for a break-through insight in this Buddha-nature, but also stresses that further practice is needed to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life, as expressed in the Three mysterious Gates, the Four Ways of Knowing of Hakuin, and the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures. The Japanese Zen-scholar D.T. Suzuki noted similarities between Zen-Buddhism and Christian mysticism, especially meister Eckhart.D.T. Suzuki. Mysticism: Christian and Buddhist. Routledge, 2002. The Tibetan Vajrayana tradition is based on Madhyamaka philosophy and Tantra. In deity yoga, visualizations of deities are eventually dissolved, to realize the inherent emptiness of every-'thing' that exists. Dzogchen, which is being taught in both the Tibetan buddhist Nyingma school and the B√∂n tradition, focuses on direct insight into our real nature. It holds that \\"mind-nature\\" is manifested when one is enlightened, being nonconceptually aware (rigpa, \\"open presence\\") of one's nature, \\"a recognition of one's beginningless nature.\\" Mahamudra has similarities with Dzogchen, emphasizing the meditational approach to insight and liberation. Taoism Taoist philosophy is centered on the Tao, usually translated \\"Way\\", an ineffable cosmic principle. The contrasting yet interdependent concepts of yin and yang also symbolise harmony, with Taoist scriptures often emphasing the Yin virtues of femininity, passivity and yieldingness.Mysticism: A guide for the Perplexed. Oliver, P. Taoist practice includes exercises and rituals aimed at manipulating the life force Qi, and obtaining health and longevity. These have been elaborated into practices such as Tai chi, which are well known in the west. The Secularization of Mysticism Today there is also occurring in the West what Richard Jones calls \\"the secularization of mysticism\\".Richard H. Jones, Philosophy of Mysticism (SUNY Press, 2016), epilogue. That is the separation of meditation and other mystical practices from their traditional use in religious ways of life to only secular ends of purported psychological and physiological benefits. Scholarly approaches of mysticism and mystical experience=Types of mysticism R. C. Zaehner distinguishes three fundamental types of mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic (\\"all-in-one\\") or natural mysticism. The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the Bhagavad Gita. The monistic type, which according to Zaehner is based upon an experience of the unity of one's soul, includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as Samkhya and Advaita vedanta. Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not fit into one of these two categories. Walter Terence Stace, in his book Mysticism and Philosophy (1960), distinguished two types of mystical experience, namely extrovertive and introvertive mysticism. Extrovertive mysticism is an experience of the unity of the external world, whereas introvertive mysticism is \\"an experience of unity devoid of perceptual objects; it is literally an experience of 'no-thing-ness'.\\" The unity in extrovertive mysticism is with the totality of objects of perception. While perception stays continuous, ‚Äúunity shines through the same world‚Äù; the unity in introvertive mysticism is with a pure consciousness, devoid of objects of perception, ‚Äúpure unitary consciousness, wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated.‚Äù According to Stace such experiences are nonsensous and nonintellectual, under a total ‚Äúsuppression of the whole empirical content.‚Äù Stace argues that doctrinal differences between religious traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences. Stace argues that mysticism is part of the process of perception, not interpretation, that is to say that the unity of mystical experiences is perceived, and only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver's background. This may result in different accounts of the same phenomenon. While an atheist describes the unity as ‚Äúfreed from empirical filling‚Äù, a religious person might describe it as ‚ÄúGod‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Divine‚Äù. Mystical experiences Since the 19th century, \\"mystical experience\\" has evolved as a distinctive concept. It is closely related to \\"mysticism\\" but lays sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior, whereas mysticism encompasses a broad range of practices aiming at a transformation of the person, not just inducing mystical experiences. William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience is the classic study on religious or mystical experience, which influenced deeply both the academic and popular understanding of \\"religious experience\\". He popularized the use of the term \\"religious experience\\" in his \\"Varieties\\", and influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge of the transcendental: Yet, Gelman notes that so-called mystical experience is not a transitional event, as William James claimed, but an \\"abiding consciousness, accompanying a person throughout the day, or parts of it. For that reason, it might be better to speak of mystical consciousness, which can be either fleeting or abiding.\\" Most mystical traditions warn against an attachment to mystical experiences, and offer a \\"protective and hermeneutic framework\\" to accommodate these experiences. These same traditions offer the means to induce mystical experiences, which may have several origins: * Spontaneous; either apparently without any cause, or by persistent existential concerns, or by neurophysiological origins; * Religious practices, such as contemplation, meditation, and mantra-repetition; * Entheogens (psychedelic drugs) * Neurophysiological origins, such as temporal lobe epilepsy. The theoretical study of mystical experience has shifted from an experiential, privatized and perennialist approach to a contextual and empirical approach. The experientalist approach sees mystical experience as a private expression of perennial truths, separate from its historical and cultural context. The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, takes into account the historical and cultural context. Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes. Perennialism versus constructionism The term \\"mystical experience\\" evolved as a distinctive concept since the 19th century, laying sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior. Perennialists regard those various experience traditions as pointing to one universal transcendental reality, for which those experiences offer the proof. In this approach, mystical experiences are privatised, separated from the context in which they emerge. Well-known representatives are William James, R.C. Zaehner, William Stace and Robert Forman. The perennial position is \\"largely dismissed by scholars\\", but \\"has lost none of its popularity.\\" In contrast, for the past decades most scholars have favored a constructionist approach, which states that mystical experiences are fully constructed by the ideas, symbols and practices that mystics are familiar with. Critics of the term \\"religious experience\\" note that the notion of \\"religious experience\\" or \\"mystical experience\\" as marking insight into religious truth is a modern development, and contemporary researchers of mysticism note that mystical experiences are shaped by the concepts \\"which the mystic brings to, and which shape, his experience\\". What is being experienced is being determined by the expectations and the conceptual background of the mystic. Richard Jones draws a distinction between \\"anticonstructivism\\" and \\"perennialism\\": constructivism can be rejected with respect to a certain class of mystical experiences without ascribing to a perennialist philosophy on the relation of mystical doctrines. One can reject constructivism without claiming that mystical experiences reveal a cross-cultural \\"perennial truth\\". For example, a Christian can reject both constructivism and perennialism in arguing that there is a union with God free of cultural construction. Constructivism versus anticonstructivism is a matter of the nature of mystical experiences while perennialism is a matter of mystical traditions and the doctrines they espouse. Contextualism and attribution theory The perennial position is now \\"largely dismissed by scholars\\", and the contextual approach has become the common approach. Contextualism takes into account the historical and cultural context of mystical experiences. The attribution approach views \\"mystical experience\\" as non-ordinary states of consciousness which are explained in a religious framework. According to Proudfoot, mystics unconsciously merely attribute a doctrinal content to ordinary experiences. That is, mystics project cognitive content onto otherwise ordinary experiences having a strong emotional impact. This approach has been further elaborated by Ann Taves, in her Religious Experience Reconsidered. She incorporates both neurological and cultural approaches in the study of mystical experience. Neurological research Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes. This leads to a central philosophical issue: does the identification of neural triggers or neural correlates of mystical experiences prove that mystical experiences are no more than brain events or does it merely identify the brain activity occurring during a genuine cognitive event? The most common positions are that neurology reduces mystical experiences or that neurology is neutral to the issue of mystical cognitivity. Interest in mystical experiences and psychedelic drugs has also recently seen a resurgence.E.g., ; The temporal lobe seems to be involved in mystical experiences, and in the change in personality that may result from such experiences. It generates the feeling of \\"I,\\" and gives a feeling of familiarity or strangeness to the perceptions of the senses. There is a long- standing notion that epilepsy and religion are linked, and some religious figures may have had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The anterior insula may be involved in ineffability, a strong feeling of certainty which cannot be expressed in words, which is a common quality in mystical experiences. According to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the anterior insula, a part of the brain which is involved in interoception, self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by \\"anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk\\". Mysticism and morality A philosophical issue in the study of mysticism is the relation of mysticism to morality. Albert Schweitzer presented the classic account of mysticism and morality being incompatible.Schweitzer 1936 Arthur Danto also argued that morality is at least incompatible with Indian mystical beliefs.Danto 1987 Walter Stace, on the other hand, argued not only are mysticism and morality compatible, but that mysticism is the source and justification of morality.Stace 1960, pp. 323‚Äì343. Others studying multiple mystical traditions have concluded that the relation of mysticism and morality is not as simple as that.

It was the first motorcycle assembler in the country and the Andean Group. History Assembly plant in Cartagena Auteco SAS was founded in Medell√≠n on September 1st, 1941, as a distributor of spare parts and auto parts and a gas station. Auteco began importing American Indian brand motorcycles in 1945. Years later, the company also imported Ariel, Excelsior, and Monarch motorcycles from England. Auteco obtained the rights to assemble and sell Lambretta motorcycles manufactured by the Italian firm Innocenti in 1954. Auteco also imported and distributed vehicles such as Nash cars, federal trucks, and Gravely tractors. Before the establishment of Sofasa S.A., Auteco commercialized Renault vehicles in Colombia. In 1956, Auteco worked together with Colombian Automotive Company, Colmotores, now a Chevrolet assembler, distributing the vehicles that Colmotores was assembling back then, including British Austin cars and trucks. In 1961, the government of Colombia granted Auteco the first license to assemble and manufacture motorcycles in the country, thus initiating a new era assembling motorcycles as its main activity. In 1962 it acquired its facilities in Itag√º√≠, located in the Aburra Valley in Antioquia. Its production and main offices are still located there. In the 1970s, Auteco sought new market prospects after the downturn of the Italian producer Innocenti. in 1972, Auteco signed an assembly and technical assistance agreement with Kawasaki Heavy Industries. It was how Auteco began assembling Kawasaki motorcycles in Colombia. At the end of the 1980s, and mainly due to the economic recession, the entry of new competitors, and the restrictions of the national government, Auteco diversified its production and began the distribution of other products from the Japanese brand such as power plants and lawnmowers. At the beginning of the 1990s, Auteco started to contact the Indian company Bajaj Auto, with whom, Auteco wanted to reintroduce scooters in the country. Thus, in May 1993, Auteco launched the Plus, a highly successful motorcycle in Colombia, mainly because of its resistance and reliability. Other models were launched afterward, such as the Bajaj Boxer CT 100 (the best-selling motorcycle in the history of Colombia) and the Bajaj Pulsar 180. Kawasaki launched the KMX models in 1991 that revolutionized the 125cc enduro motorcycle market because it included technological breakthroughs never seen before in products produced locally, such as water cooling, two- wheel disc brakes. In 1995, Auteco started importing high displacement sports bikes and superbikes; it was a sensation for their aesthetics and power. The most significant Kawasaki trademark was Ninja; it became the signature name for the category. In 2003, Auteco began the assembly and distribution of motorcycles for the Taiwanese company Kymco, introducing models such as Top Boy 100 and Bet & Win 250 to the market, thus entering the market for automatic scooters in Colombia. In 2012 Auteco expanded the portfolio with the Austrian brand KTM; it was the first assembler of this brand outside Europe. In that same year, Auteco opened its accessories line. In 2014, a second assembly plant located in Cartagena was opened, the most modern and innovative in Latin America. 2016 was the year of the launch of the electric vehicle line under the brand St√§rker. In 2018, the Swedish brand Husqvarna was added to the portfolio, thereby fulfilling the promise of having \\"a motorcycle for every Colombian.\\" In 2019, Auteco Mobility SAS was born as a spin-off focused on the assembly and distribution of Kawasaki, Kymco, St√§rker, and Victory brands. Auteco SAS continued with the assembly and distribution of Bajaj, KTM, and Husqvarna. In September 2020, the company announced the termination of its partnership with Bajaj and the start of a new alliance with TVS, which would become effective at the end of that year, with a comprehensive product portfolio. Since 2017, Auteco SAS is part of the United Nations Global Compact and shows its progress in the sustainability report developed under GRI methodology. The most recent version of the sustainability report is here.

The Moncayo's highest summit, San Miguel (2,314 m), is the highest point in the 500 km long Sistema Ib√©rico. The Moncayo is located between the provinces of Zaragoza in Aragon and Soria in Castile and Le√≥n.Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa - Moncayo The ridge's highest summits are usually covered in snow between October and May every year. Description Besides the San Miguel, the Moncayo massif includes two other peaks that are almost identical and are located close together, Cerro San Juan (2,283 m) and Pe√±a Lobera (2226 m). This mountain was mentioned as Mons Caius by Marcus Valerius Martialis in Ancient Roman times. The nearest large town to Moncayo is Tarazona, with many old and historical buildings, located on the massif's northern side 10 km away from it. There are also smaller villages closer to the mountain. The Sierra de Nava Alta and Sierra del Boll√≥n are eastern prolongations of the Moncayo Massif.  Hiking  Moncayo is one of the most popular hiking places in Spain and there is public transport to reach the mountain. There are few buses during the winter season, but almost hourly connections in the summer time. From the village of San Mart√≠n de la Virgen de Moncayo starts a road for hikers, ending at the village of Agramonte. The lower ranges of the mountain are covered by forest, including oak trees and spiky shrubs. There is a wide path at the northern side of the mountain zigzagging upwards. In the north east corner of the mountain is a mountain hut made of stone which can be used as shelter in emergency situations. The shelter is located at the car park north of the Lobera peak before the slope. At the north west side of the mountain is a tiny river. One can ascend the highest peak going up from Agramonte or from the eastern side of the mountain range, also via Lobera peak. Going up takes about three hours. There are a few loose stone sections which can be avoided when following the paths. On the top of the highest peak one can see the Pyrenees in clear weather.

Early life John E. Bush was born in Honolulu on February 15, 1842. He was the son of George Henry Bush (1807‚Äì1853), a native of Suffolk, who came to Hawaii from England in 1825, and his Hawaiian wife. Thus he was of mixed native Hawaiian and Caucasian descent (known as hapa haole). Growing up in a multicultural environment, he could read, write, and speak at least the English and Hawaiian language fluently. He sometimes used  ªAiluene Buki as the Hawaiian version of his name. He worked for a while on a whaling ship, and then learned the printing trade at the offices of the Hawaiian Gazette. His younger brother James Wood Bush was a sailor in the Union Navy and veteran of the American Civil War. Politics In 1875, he became a marriage license agent, and 1876 a land appraiser on Oahu island. On January 4, 1877, King KalƒÅkaua appointed him Royal Governor of the island of Kauai. KalƒÅkaua also appointed him to his Privy Council on September 1, 1878, and the House of Nobles in the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom on April 24, 1880. Bush served until the office was made elective in 1887. On August 14, 1880, he became Minister of the Interior in KalƒÅkaua's cabinet, but he was replaced about six weeks later on September 27. He temporarily acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs replacing Celso Caesar Moreno for much of the same time as well, until William Lowthian Green took the office on a more permanent basis. He was back in the cabinet again on May 20, 1882, as Minister of Finance, but served only until August 8 of that year. At that time he took the interior ministry again, and served until July 26, 1883. After another temporary replacement, Charles T. Gulick became interior minister. Bush was accused of \\"irregularities\\" in awarding public works contracts. Polynesian Confederation On December 23, 1886, KalƒÅkaua named him a special envoy to Samoa in an attempt to form a Polynesian alliance with Samoan King Malietoa Laupepa. Bush arrived to Apia, Laupepa's capital, on January 7, 1887, on the steamer Zealandia. Laupepa was awarded the honorary decoration Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania. The order had just been created for the heads of state for the proposed Polynesian confederation, although the actual medal was delayed in the mail. Bush lavishly entertained the Samoans and promised more gifts, such as a carriage and pair of horses. By February 17, Laupepa agreed to the alliance, and a treaty forming a Polynesian Confederation was signed on March 21, 1887. The Kaimiloa at Honoluly Harbor. Bush then was told to negotiate similar deals with Tonga, the Gilbert Islands, and others in the Pacific. The empire was generally thought to be the idea of Walter M. Gibson, who among his other titles, had himself named secretary of the Navy. However, the \\"navy\\" did not have any ships. On January 22, 1887, Gibson convinced the government to purchase the Explorer, a former British merchant steamer which had been launched in 1872. After being refitted at great expense (over budget and behind schedule), the ship was renamed Kaimiloa (from ka imi loa which roughly means \\"the explorer\\" in the Hawaiian language), and ceremonially launched on April 20, 1887. Isobel Strong, the stepdaughter of Robert Louis Stevenson and wife of Joseph Dwight Strong, designed a naval flag, and Henri Berger composed a march in her honor. Kaimiloa finally set sail on May 18, 1887, to serve as Bush's flagship. Henry A. P. Carter, who was in Europe trying to negotiate treaties between Hawaiian and major powers at the time, informed the German Empire of the agreement. Germany had been asserting influence over the Samoan islands, which were in the midst of a Samoan Civil War. Germany, with its powerful modern navy, considered the ship an irritating insult. Kaimiloa was commanded by George E. Gresley Jackson, master of the Honolulu Reformatory School, and manned by members of the school's band. The mission was documented with J. D. Strong as ship's artist and photographer. She had been refitted with cannon and Gattling guns, although her arms were barely usable for anything but ceremonial salutes. The ship got lost but finally made it to Apia in mid-June 1887. The crew exchanged salutes with the German ship Adler, which shadowed Kaimiloa while Bush tried to gather support for Laupepa in other parts of Samoa. The boys band played concerts for the Samoans, who were entertained with food and liquor through the night. The German ship could have easily blown Kaimiloa out of the water, but might have suspected it was somehow backed by the United States. Aboard Kaimiloa, right to left: Poor, Bush, Malietoa Laupepa When he returned to Apia on July 19, Bush found a letter from Gibson replacing him as envoy with his secretary Henry F. Poor. Gibson cited a letter complaining about Bush's conduct, which later turned out of be fake. In the meanwhile, back in Hawaii, on June 30, 1887, a group of businessmen and lawyers supported by the Honolulu Rifles had forced KalƒÅkaua to dismiss Gibson and sign a new constitution that limited the monarch's powers. The expense of the Polynesian expedition was given as a motivation for the takeover. The English-language press in Hawaii satirically called the effort \\"the Empire of the Calabash\\" and suggesting creating additional decorations for \\"the Order of the Tattooed Drinking Gourd and the Order of the Royal Cuspidor\\", or awarding gold-plated loincloths. Kaimiloa was ordered back to Honolulu, but Bush refused to go aboard. The ship crew violated their orders, and landed in Pago Pago (on another Samoan island) where they sold the ship's silver service and some arms for food and drink. Kaimiloa finally left Samoa on August 23, and on the next day, Germany declared war on Laupepa. Laupepa, lucky to escape with his life, never received the promised aid except for the naval dress uniform and medal. Stevenson quotes him as saying: \\"If you have come here to teach my people to drink, I wish you had stayed away.\\" The eventual Samoan crisis resulted in partitioning of Samoa into German Samoa in the west and American Samoa in the east. The ship finally returned on September 23, 1887, and was decommissioned and sold for a fraction of the cost of its refitting, ending the brief existence of a pan-Polynesian navy. Political organizer Bush quietly returned to Hawaii and began organizing political opposition groups. On November 22, 1888, he became the first president of Hui KƒÅlaiƒÅina, a group of mostly native Hawaiians known as the Hawaiian Political Association in English. From 1889 to 1896 published the Hawaiian language newspapers Ka Leo o ka LƒÅhui (\\"the voice of the nation\\" in Hawaiian) and Ka Oiaio (\\"the truth\\"). Ka Leo o ka LƒÅhui, with a circulation of 5000, was the leading Hawaiian language newspaper of the 1890s. After the failed Wilcox Rebellion of 1889, Bush was the subject of a lawsuit for libel by Lorrin A. Thurston. In October 1889 he was fined for contempt for publishing articles that would \\"bring the Court into ridicule and bad odor.\\" In the 1890 and 1892 elections, Bush was elected to the house of representatives for Oahu. Over time Bush lost confidence in the monarchy and advocated a liberal democratic republic. Although he loyally served earlier rulers, he no longer supported Queen Liliuokalani or her administration. Bush was an organizer and first president of the Hawaiian National Liberal Party in early 1892, using his papers to promote the cause. He continued to publish editorials saying \\"the base of the throne is decayed, and no severe shock will be awaited to topple it over.\\" In a May 12 editorial, he called Marshall Charles Burnett Wilson and cabinet minister Samuel Parker \\"a half-Tahitian blacksmith and a half-caste cowboy... pitiful specimens of ignorance.\\" The 1892 elections resulting in a three-way split of power with no party having majority control. After the elections Joseph Nawahi then became president of the Liberal Party, objecting to Bush's aggressive anti-monarchy stance. When Liliuokalani proposed a new constitution to break the political crisis in January 1893, the Honolulu Rifles were again behind the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii by the conservative Reform Party. Out of political favor, Bush's only government position was a court interpreter, as he struggled to keep his newspaper business profitable. At one time he endorsed Doan's Pills to cure Kidney pain. In May 1900, he spoke and acted as interpreter at the organizational meeting of the Hawaii Democratic Party, was a member of its first territorial committee, and campaigned unsuccessfully in the next election. His former ally Robert William Wilcox had formed the Home Rule Party of Hawaii which split opposition voters. Family life and legacy He first married Mary Ann Peters, who was considered one of the most beautiful women in the Hawaiian Islands and presented a lei around the neck of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh on his visit to Hawaii in 1869. In 1883, she fell off her horse while riding in the Pali. The accident left her unconscious and she died shortly of a fractured skull. After her death, he married Mary Julia Glennie (1868‚Äì1932) in 1884. He had a son also named John Edward Bush, born on January 31, 1890, and several other children. He died on June 28, 1906, from a stroke, and was buried in Makiki Cemetery. A street was named Bush Lane for him in Honolulu near the Punchbowl Crater at .

The charity operated under its original charity names as \\"Age Concern NI and Help the Aged in Northern Ireland\\" until the new brand launch on 26 March 2010. It also works interdependently with charities for the nations called Age Cymru, Age Scotland and Age UK. Structure Age NI was formed from the merger of Age Concern NI and Help the Aged in Northern Ireland, creating an organisation with a combined income of around ¬£5 million, raised through corporate partnerships, fundraising, public funding and charity shops. Anne O'Reilly, previously Deputy Chief Commissioner of the Equality Commission, was appointed Chief Executive of the new charity in April 2009. Her previous experience includes ten years as Director of Help the Aged in Northern Ireland, Chair of NICVA for six years, Chair of Engage with Age (an interagency community development partnership) and Director of Women‚Äôs Resource and Development Agency. Age NI adopts shared governance as part of its organisational culture. This is to ensure those primarily affected by the decisions of the organisation are given the opportunity to be involved in the decision making process. History=Age Concern Age Concern's origins are British and can be traced back to a realisation in that country of the effects on aged people of the Second World War; the dislocation and breakdown of family life arising out of conscription led to a recognition that existing poor laws failed to provide effective support for old people separated from family support networks. In 1940, the Old People‚Äôs Welfare Committee (OPWC), chaired by Eleanor Rathbone, was formed as a forum for discussion between government and voluntary organisations. OPWC was a sub-committee of Liverpool Personal Service Society (PSS). In 1944, the committee changed its name to the National Old People‚Äôs Welfare Committee (NOPWC), and took on responsibility for coordinating the activities of numerous local OPWCs. From the 1950s onwards, NOPWC accessed government and local funds associated with the post-war development of the welfare state, to provide services to local committees, and training to wardens of old people's homes. In 1971, under the direction of David Hobman, the NOPWC changed its public name to Age Concern, and separated itself entirely from government and the National Council for Social Service, now NCVO. It did so while also launching a 'manifesto for old age' and establishing itself nationally as a lobbying body as well as an organisation that engaged in service provision and enhancement, training and research. The directors of Age Concern England have included David Hobman, Baroness Greengross, and Gordon Lishman - the current Director General. In 1986 Age Concern established an Institute of Gerontology at King's College London into which it folded its own Age Concern Research Unit. Help the Aged Help the Aged was founded in 1961 by Cecil Jackson-Cole, with the aim to free disadvantaged older people from poverty, isolation and neglect. Branding The two brand logos from the merged charities will gradually disappear now that the new Age NI brand has been launched (on 26 March 2010) and new brand- awareness develops during 2010. Anne O'Reilly, the charity's Chief Executive, stated \\"By 2029, the number of over 60s here will increase to 600,000. Ageing is a global phenomenon. Age needs a voice in Northern Ireland and now it has one - Age NI.\\"Age NI press release.

It was formed in November 1940 for service in the Greco-Italian War, and after the German invasion of Greece and the capitulation of that country in April 1941, assumed occupation duties in the Greek mainland. It remained on station in Greece until the Italian armistice in 1943, when it was forcibly disbanded by the Germans. History It was formed on 9 November 1940 out of the 11th Army Corps, then based in Italian-occupied Albania and engaged in operations against Greece alongside the 9th Army. Its engagement against the Greeks lasted until the fall of Greece in April 1941. Occupation of Greece Thereafter, the Eleventh Army assumed duties of occupation in Greece, headquartered in Athens. Its command also doubled as the Higher Armed Forces Command Greece (Comando Superiore Forze Armate Grecia, abbrev. C.S. FF. AA. Grecia), with responsibility over mainland Greece (apart from the German and Bulgarian zones in northern Greece and the German zone in eastern and southern Attica), as well as the island of Euboea, the Northern Sporades and Skyros, and Kythera. The remainder of the Ionian Islands came under the Higher Armed Forces Command Albania (Ninth Army), while the Italian Dodecanese, the Italian-occupied Lasithi Prefecture on Crete and the bulk of the Cyclades came under the Higher Armed Forces Command of the Italian Islands of the Aegean at Rhodes. Apart from the units of the Eleventh Army, the Higher Armed Forces Command Greece also included the Air Force Command Greece (Comando Aeronautica Grecia), and the Western Greece Naval Military Command (Comando Militare Marittimo della Grecia Occidentale) at Patras. In April 1943, an assessment of the combat readiness of the Eleventh Army's eight remaining divisions in terms of armament and means of transport found only one‚Äîthe 11th Infantry Division Brennero‚Äîas \\"complete\\", with three more \\"effective\\" (over 70% of pack animals and 70% to 90% of vehicles from the table of organization and equipment) and the rest \\"incomplete\\" (with figures of completeness around 60%).

In 1995 he published his PhD thesis Limits of the Mind: Towards a Characterization of Bao Mastership where he analyzed the intellectual abilities required to master the Bao game.

Auca of children‚Äôs games. Claudine Bouzonnet-Stella (7 July 1636 ‚Äì 1 October 1697) was a French engraver, most of whose prints were after works by Nicholas Poussin, or by her uncle Jacques Stella, from whom she received her artistic education. Life She was born at Lyon in 1636, the daughter of √âtienne Bouzonnet, a goldsmith, and his wife, Madeleine Stella. She studied art in Paris under her uncle, Jacques Stella. Having collaborated with various engravers for many years before achieving considerable success as a painter, Stella had decided to set up a workshop to produce prints after his designs. To staff it he brought in his sister's children, Claudine, Antoinette, Francoise and Antoine, all of whom moved from Lyon to live in his apartments in the Louvre. It is, however, likely that Claudine Bouzonnet-Stella also had some training in engraving from another practitioner, as her uncle's printmaking activities had been restricted to etching. Following Jacques Stella's death in 1657 she became head of the workshop, and was granted exclusive rights by the king to publish prints after Stella's designs. In the same year she issued Les Jeux et Plaisirs de l'Enfance, a set of 50 plates which she had engraved herself after a series of drawings by Jacques Stella. In 1667 she published Les Pastorales, a set of 16 prints of rural subjects. Although these too were published as works after Jacques Stella, no originals have been traced, nor are any drawings mentioned in a surviving inventory of the workshop, leading some art historians to suggest that the designs may have been by Bouzonnet-Stella herself. She also produced prints after works by Nicholas Poussin, who had been a close friend of her uncle, and after her own designs. For the latter, however, she did not act as her own publisher. Her technique combined both etching and engraving. In the late 18th century Joseph Strutt wrote of her prints: > If they be not executed with that precision and neatness, which are found in > the best French masters, they possess such beauties as overbalance all > defects of that nature. The naked parts of the figures are exceedingly well- > drawn; and the characters of the heads are finely expressed. She delineated > the other extremities with great taste and correctness. She died in Paris in 1697. Works Her plates are mostly after Jacques Stella and Nicolas Poussin. They include: After Jacques Stella *Les Jeux et Plaisirs de l'Enfance(1657), a set 50 plates. *Les Pastorales (1667), a set of 17 plates, including a title page. *The Marriage of St. Catharine. *Christ at the Column After Nicolas Poussin *Moses found in the Bulrushes, in two plates. *Moses striking the Rock. *The Crucifixion, called the Great Calvary. *St. Peter and St. John curing the Lame Man. *Holy Family with St John Offering an Apple to the Christ Child. *Holy Family with Children Bringing Flowers.

Born in New York, MacGovern was the son of George M. Cohan's publicist. His mother performed in light operas. Graduating from high school in 1921, MacGovern began at the New York Sun Herald as a copy boy in the art department. After a period working as a jazz musician, he returned to commercial art with a position at the New York Post where he was employed for years, eventually heading up the newspaper's art department.Lambiek: Stan MacGovern Comic strips and editorial cartoons MacGovern was 18 when he sold his first comic strip, Dumbell Dan (1922‚Äì23). In June 1938, he began a cartoon feature, Extra Extra with satirical commentary on minor news events. Distributed by American Feature Syndicate, it was soon retitled Swing with the News. After the character Silly Milly became the strip's central character, the title was finally changed to Silly Milly. MacGovern continued to focus on human interest news items, and he sometimes incorporated reviews of Broadway shows into the strip. MacGovern's Silly Milly is unrelated to characters with the same name in the British publication Twinkle, the children's book by Wendy Cheyette Lewison and the Silly Milly doll (originally named Milly Magpie) distributed by Portable Playhouse to children in hospitals.Silly Milly at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Silly Milly, which had limited syndication by the Post to other newspapers, came to an end in 1951. MacGovern, who lived in Malverne, New York, left the newspaper field to run a gift shop on Long Island. It was an unsuccessful business, and he later worked at a Long Island furniture store.

The power plant receives water from the lake through the Tana-Beles interbasin transfer and after utilizing it to produce electricity, the water is then discharged into the Beles River. The plant has an installed capacity of 460 MW and it is the second largest power plant in the country. It is also expected to help provide water for the irrigation of . It was inaugurated in May 2010 and the last generator was operational in February 2012. Its construction was negatively perceived by downstream Egypt. Background and construction In 1992, the first feasibility study was completed for the project, a 200 MW power station. A later study and final design was completed in 2005 by Studio Pietrangeli for the current 460 MW plant. The Government of Ethiopia signed a contract with Salini Costruttori to build the plant on July 8, 2005 and construction began soon after. Because of the project's remote location, transportation and manning of personnel and equipment was difficult, often taking 4‚Äì5 months for supplies to arrive. On June 2, 2007, a tunnel boring machine (TBM), operated by SELI, began boring the tailrace tunnel and completed it on May 31, 2008. Tunneling was carried out seven days a week in three eight-hour shifts a day. The TBM averaged per day while in January 2008, a maximum daily amount of was achieved. The TBM for the headrace tunnel broke through, completing it on August 11, 2009. Salini Costruttori awarded a sub contract to construct the actual power station to VA Tech Hydro. On May 11, 2010, the first 115 MW generator at the power plant began operation and on May 14, 2010, the plant was inaugurated. The project's cost was around $500 million USD. The power plant was fully operational in February 2012. Design The Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant receives water from Lake Tana where it is transferred to a power station and then discharged through another tunnel and into the Beles River. This is first accomplished by an inlet on Lake Tana, where the power station can utilize of the lake's volume for power production. The inlet channel is wide, high and its flow into the headrace tunnel is controlled by five floodgates. The headrace tunnel transfers the water to the southwest along its length within its diameter of . At the end of the headrace tunnel, it converts into a diameter and long penstock before reaching the power station. At the power station, water is delivered to four Francis turbines powering four 115 MW generators. The power station is a cavern type and is long, high and wide. It has a deep and diameter surge shaft as well. Once the water is used in hydroelectric production it is then discharged from the power station to the Beles River via a tailrace tunnel with the same diameter as the headrace. Normal water level at the inlet is above sea level and the power station resides at , allowing for of hydraulic head. The project is also expected to help irrigate in the future as well. Social and environmental impacts for the downstream communities The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant is considered a formality and is unfindable. The social impacts of the Tana-Beles water transfer have been studied and results published in the high-profile Journal of Hydrology: the dangerously high increases in discharge of Beles river have led to the drowning of 250 people between 2010 and 2018. The negative impacts on rural livelihoods are however overshadowed by national development goals (electricity production). The external costs (coping with damage) are borne by local people, who have low bargaining power. Beles River downstream of the hydropower outlet Egyptian opposition The Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant is part of a larger issue amongst the Nile River Basin countries as the Beles River is a tributary of the Blue Nile and Lake Tana supplies the basin as well. After the inauguration of the power plant, statements were released from a meeting of Egyptian officials, one of which was \\"Tana Beles dam aims to provoke Egypt‚Äôs anger and lead it to take swift diplomatic action which would turn the global opinion in favor of the upstream Nile countries.\\" The officials, many involved in the Nile River Sector, stated they had no information about the project. The power plant was inaugurated at the same time as a Cooperative Framework Agreement over the Nile Basin was signed by upstream countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Ethiopia, but downstream countries Sudan and Egypt refused to sign. Under colonial-era accords, only Sudan and Egypt were to benefit from the Nile's flow and could reject any upstream projects that would impede it.

With influences ranging from the Sex Pistols, Chelsea, U.K. Subs, Broken Bones, Negative Approach and the English Dogs, Evacuate's releases and live sets cover a wide range of the punk rock spectrum. History=Beginning: 2007-2008 Started by founding members vocalist Mike Virus (ex- The Virus/Cheap Sex) and lead guitarist Karlos Evacuate (ex- Lab Rats), also featuring ex Cheap Sex members Brock on bass and guitarist Phil, and Ryan on drums. The original lineup wrote the first two Evacuate songs, \\"Convenience Killed Mankind\\" and \\"In My Dreams\\". Months later Phil, Brock and Ryan left to form side projects, and Mike and Karlos carried on recruiting bass player Sean, guitarist John A. (All Out Attak) and Danny (2nd Hand Justice) on drums. This lineup wrote songs ‚ÄúWhat Happened to Hardcore‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive You Nothing‚Äù, which were recorded along with the first two songs to complete Evacuate's first demo \\"Evacuate 2007\\". This lineup also wrote part of the first LP and played the first handful of shows. John A. left and was replaced by Tony on second guitar and helped finish writing the first LP. After a few shows Danny left and was replaced by John C on drums. Foundation: 2008-2010 This lineup recorded the band's first official release - the self-titled \\"Evacuate\\" CD/LP, which was released in 2008 on Taang/Joe Pogo, and the Endless War EP on Czech label Voltage Records in 2010. They shared the stage with Fear, The Germs, U.K. Subs and Bad Religion. This incarnation of Evacuate lasted two years until 2010 when Sean was replaced by Kevin Sayaka on bass. Endless War Across Europe: 2010-2011 This lineup recorded Evacuate‚Äôs second full length offering 2012 also on Voltage released in late 2011, this lineup played regularly throughout 2010 and 2011 including a full tour of Europe with the Mad Pigs, also sharing the stage with SS- Kaliert, Vox Populi and Normahl! Evacuate also put together a benefit show for the victims of Japan's catastrophic tsunami. Trials and Tribulations: 2012-2013 2012 brought some adversity to the band with members Kevin Sayaka and Tony taking a hiatus from the band. Evacuate continued on as a four piece with Kevin Kane joining on bass. This lineup played a handful of shows including a debut show with the Vibrators, Kevin Sayaka returned on second guitar from his hiatus and Evacuate continued as a five piece, this came with the announcement that Evacuate would be playing the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, England, the band worked all of mid 2013 playing shows and raising funds to head across the pond. Then things took a bad turn with longtime drummer John C, having to leave the band to fight personal demons, leaving Evacuate with a commitment to play in England with no drummer, it seemed like all hope was lost until longtime friend Alan from the band Destruct offered to fill in for the trip. This coincided with Tony's return from hiatus and adding a third guitar adding an extra layer to Evacuate‚Äôs sound. Anarchy in the UK: 2013 Continued Evacuate complete with the updated six-man lineup finally ventured out to the UK. This saw the boys playing two critically acclaimed sets, the first a surprise set replacing Mad Sin supporting the Defects in the arena stage, which saw members of Chelsea join Evacuate on stage to play a cover version of Chelsea's hit single \\"Evacuate\\", which is where the band's name came from. The second set, which was their originally advertised stage time, back in the arena stage. As the boys returned, a new drummer Raul \\"Riff-Raff\\" Cuellar was recruited, and it was back to work until a near tragedy struck one of the guy's family members; this situation hit close to home with everyone in the band and threatened the existence of the band, but with the help of loyal fans, friends and family all over the world, the situation improved enough for the boys to continue moving forward. 2014 and beyond As 2013 drew to a close the news broke of Evacuate joining up with The Virus and The Bad Engrish for a West Coast tour in the spring of 2014. Evacuate will release a limited edition orange colored flexi with two new songs complete with a special fanzine sleeve/packaging. This was a preview of Evacuate's next album, Blood Money.

He served as the secretary of Barberini's legation to France and as a conclavist to the Cardinal during the 1623 conclave.

He kept an account of the king's daily expenses which is an important source document for the Scottish royal court.The original accounts are kept at the National Archives of Scotland, NAS E30/9, 'pursemaster account of John Tennand.' They were edited and published by Athol L. Murray in 1965. Life at court Tennent's court positions were pursemaster and yeoman of the wardrobe. He was given livery clothes as a servant in the king's chamber in 1529.Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1903), p. 382. As pursemaster he daily accompanied the king, paying his small debts and handing over the sums the king gave in alms or as tips to workmen and beggars. He and the other pursemasters were given money for the king's purse by the Treasurer of Scotland.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1531-1538, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1905), pp. 201-2. Tennent's other main r√¥le was yeoman and master of the wardrobe. The wardrobe was a large establishment which employed almost 40 individuals over the personal reign. There were embroiderers, tailors, a laundry, tapestry men, and carts to transport the clothes, tapestries, and cloths-of-estate between the palaces.Thomas, Andrea, Princelie Majestie (John Donald: Edinburgh, 2005) pp. 229‚Äì230. Tennent took delivery of linen for bed sheets, the king's shirts, and night caps. He bought canvas to hang around the king's gowns in the wardrobe.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1531-1538, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 256. Tennent was in charge of the Honours of Scotland and ordered a new case to be made for a sword in March 1539.Athol Murray, 'Pursemaster's Accounts' (1965), p. 16. This may have been the sword sent by Pope Paul III in 1537, which is now lost.Reid, John J., 'The Scottish Regalia', PSAS, 9 December (1889), p. 28 James V and Mary of Guise went hunting in Glenartney and Glen Finglas in September 1539.Henry Ellis, 'Household Book of James the Fifth', Archaeologia, 22 (London, 1829), p. 10.

It is said that at their meeting James instructed Tennent to pretend to be him and they exchanged clothes.Thomas, Andrea, Princelie Majestie, John Donald (2005), 23. This story appears in four sixteenth century chronicles. Adam AbellCameron, Jamie, James V (Tuckwell: East Linton, 1998), p. 131. and George Buchanan mention the disguise; only John Lesley names Tennent; Lindsay of Pitscottie's version is the most elaborate but does not identify the servant.Lindsay of Pitscottie, Robert, History of Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1814), 363‚Äì364.

They wanted to compose music that would bring them the greatest pleasure, as well as help to splash out emotions and express their ideas and feelings. The name Fromuz was borrowed from an early song title and is short for ‚Äúfrom Uzbekistan‚Äù. Fromuz has become one of the most successful progressive rock/fusion bands in Central Asia. The band‚Äôs sound is predominantly instrumental. History Fromuz‚Äôs first test of playing together live was at a concert dance was ‚ÄúSodom & Gomorra XXI‚Äù composed by Albert Khalmurzaev for the Youth Theater of Uzbekistan. This play, done in a progressive rock style, was performed at the International Theater Festival in St. Petersburg in 2008. In 2005, the band performed at The International Blues Music Festival, ‚ÄúAstana Blues 2005‚Äù, and took part in a series of ethnic music concerts, including ‚ÄúGreeting from Nostradamus‚Äù, by drummer V. Badirov. In 2006, Fromuz became the owner of ¬´Crystal Awards 2006¬ª by Snob Collection as the best music project of the year in Uzbekistan. In 2006, the band attracted the attention of 10T Records. Fromuz signed their first record contract with 10T in August 2006 and set out to record their debut album. ‚Äò‚ÄôAudio Diplomacy‚Äô‚Äô was released in February 2007 as a CD/DVD set. It is a live album consisting of 8 instrumental tracks. In 2008, Fromuz released their second album ‚Äò‚ÄôOverlook‚Äô‚Äô via 10T Records. ‚Äò‚ÄôOverlook‚Äô‚Äô was recorded at Losis studio in Tashkent and mixed at Charleston Sound. ‚Äò‚ÄôOverlook‚Äô‚Äô was the last album recorded by the original lineup. ‚Äò‚ÄôQuartus Artifactus‚Äô‚Äô, the 4th band album and an acoustic anthology of Fromuz music, was released in May 2011.http://www.fromuzband.com/news/%E2%80%9Cquartus- artifactus%E2%80%9D-double-cddvd-combo-official-announce/ In 2008 after Andrew Mara-Novik and Vladimir Badirov left the band to seek employment in another country, Ali Izmailov and Surat Kasimov filled the drummers and assist positions in Fromuz. Also, Igor Elizov was hired as the second keyboard player. In this new membership, Fromuz were signed by Iosis Studio to work on their fresh material, and ‚Äò‚ÄôSeventh Story‚Äô‚Äô album became the result of this collaboration. Besides the changes in the lineup, Fromuz modified the structure of their compositions. The sound became more energetic and vocals appeared in several compositions. It was at this time that the dot/period was added to the name to differentiate from ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôthe original lineup. To support the ‚Äò‚ÄôSeventh Story‚Äô‚Äô album, Fromuz gave a series of concerts in September 2008 and March 2009 on the stages of Youth theatre of Uzbekistan and Ilkhom Theatre. In September 2010, band released a second live DVD recorded and shot during Fromuz‚Äôs live performance at the Youth Theatre of Uzbekistan in September 2008. Influences Bands that the members of Fromuz have been inspired by include various musicians such as King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Yes, Jethro Tull, Miles Davis, Led Zeppelin and Jeff Beck. . Live performances Concert activity of Fromuz includes report-concerts. It can be two or three concerts in the year. Each concert takes 2‚Äì3 days on the same stage. The first Fromuz concert was playing the Imitation‚Äìlive at the Youth Theatre of Uzbekistan. The band was chosen to open the ceremony for Uzbekistan‚Äôs first rock music awards, the 2009 IOSIS Fest. Also there were 2 big conceptual shows in Fromuz history. They are ¬´Quartus Artifactus¬ª and ¬´Fromuz Anthology¬ª. ¬´Quartus Artifactus¬ª gig took place on June 23, 2009 at the Ilkhom Theatre in Tashkent. The conception of this show was to play compositions using just acoustic instruments. At the beginning of 2010, Fromuz performed ¬´Quartus Artifactus¬ª concert, named so because of the planned set list. It comprises best tracks from all albums. Throughout their career, Fromuz performed at several progressive rock and blues festivals. In 2007 band was invited to The Baja Prog Festival in Mexico where they played on one stage with other famous progressive rock figures such as Jordan Rudess (Dream Theater), Univers Zero, Focus. In August 2007, Fromuz participated in the ¬´Summer Nights¬ª festival in Chimkent (Kazakhstan) where the band performed compositions from their first album ‚Äò‚ÄôAudio Diplomacy‚Äô‚Äô. Cover songs Fromuz has covered some other artists‚Äô work during their career. In 2009 Fromuz took part in ‚Äò‚Äô10T: Undercover‚Äô‚Äô album where they performed their cover version of King Crimson‚Äôs ‚ÄúStarless and Bible Black‚Äù. Also in summer 2010, Fromuz started working on Jeff Beck‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrush with the Blues‚Äù. Band members There have been four different lineups of Fromuz. The original lineup of guitarist Vitaly Popeloff, keyboardist Albert Khalmurzaev, drummer Vladimir Badirov, and bassist Andrew Mara-Novik released two albums. Then in May 2008 Mara-Novik and Badirov were replaced by Surat Kasimov and Ali Izmailov, also Igor Elizov was hired as the second keyboard player. After leaving Surat Kasimov in July 2009, Albert Khalmurzaev started playing bass. And finally, in September 2010, Ali Izmailov left the group. Nowadays there is no constant drummer in Fromuz and every concert the band invites different session drummers.

It lies on the A977 road at its intersection with Vicar's Bridge Road near the extreme south- westerly point of the region, approximately southeast of Dollar. The Arndean agricultural estateArndean Estate lies about northeast, near the River Devon. Schools Blairingone Primary School is located in Blairingone.Blairingone Primary School History Blairingone is located in the Parish of Fossoway and is part of the former County of Kinross-shire. In fact it is the last village in the county of Perth and Kinross. \\"Blairingone\\" in Gaelic is ; Bl√†r- na-gobhainn, and the literal translation is \\" Smithfield\\" or Field of the Smith. The word \\"Gobhainn\\" is derived from Macgowan which is another name for \\"Blacksmith\\". Other local derivations of the Gaelic name are ; \\"Field of Arrows or Field of Spears\\". All of these are based on the fact that in the Middle Ages and onwards the smiddy in Blairingone was a base for the serious manufacture of weapons of war. The twin forges being maintained by the easily obtained surface coal even then. The field behind the smiddy which was incidentally the site for the recent Lambhill open-cast mine, was the probable source of the coal which fed the forges that sustained this weapons industry. This small settlement and area was historically a base for the winning of many valuable minerals. Materials like Limestone, Alum, Iron-ore, Whinstone & Sulphur as well as coal were mined here on a regular basis. History records that the Fossoway area and over into Fife contained the most ancient coal mining operations in Scotland. During the 1700s a waggonway complex included a track from Blairingone for carrying coal which also connected the North Fife coal fields and the limeburners at Limekilns on the Forth Estuary. The monks from Culross Abbey obtained their coal from this area many years before this, and visiting nuns were accommodated at the still occupied \\"Ladieshall\\" on the Vicars Bridge road out of the village. Livestock drovers from the North and South passed through Blairingone on their way to the upper Forth ferry and were often known to take refreshment at one of the three Inns in the village, only one of which is left and was called the 'Devonvale Inn', In recent years renamed The Mart Inn.

She has worked on the \\"Mystery Train\\" project for the Institute of Contemporary Arts to make contemporary art more accessible to people with learning disabilities. Her work has been exhibited more than two dozen times with her husband, fellow artist Patrick Brill, best known as Bob and Roberta Smith. Early life and education Jessica Voorsanger was born in New York City in 1965 and grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Two of her grandparents were artists: her father's mother and her mother's father. She first studied fine art at The Brooklyn Museum Art School in New York from 1982 to 1983 and obtained her Bachelor of Fine Arts at Rhode Island School of Design in 1987. She began graduate studies at Goldsmiths College, London in 1991 and received her Master of Arts in fine art in 1993. She met Patrick Brill (the artist Bob and Roberta Smith) after graduating from Rhode Island School of Design. When he returned to London, she went with him and they are now married. Artist Voorsanger creates inter-active installations, objects, performances and events that reference pop and celebrity culture. As a child growing up in the 1970s she was enamored with popular sitcom television shows like The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family, and, as one critic has reported, she believes her interest in the shows planted \\"the seeds of star adulation\\" that has influenced her work; and \\"that these cosy shows were a social glue, offering comfort to a nation traumatised by the Vietnam war and bankruptcy.\\" Her artwork explores stardom, television shows, and fame using a wide range of media, including filmed performances, paintings and sculptures. Journalist Jessica lacks said, \\"Her brand of celebrity-quick art has occasionally been dismissed as lightweight, with critics overlooking or ignoring the fact that Voorsanger's guileful ability to make work that is as addictive and kitsch as Heat magazine, operates on the same plain as the world she is critiquing.\\" She particularly is interested in portraying celebrities that she believes have real talent, increasingly relevant with the advent of reality television. In 2008's Star Struck, performers were made up as Cher, Billy Idol, Michael Jackson, Devo, Kurt Cobain, George Harrison, Diana Ross, Morrissey, Paul Weller, David Hockney, Amy Winehouse and Siouxsie Sioux. The mixed media installation projected multiple films of the costumed karaoki performers singing the songs of another artist: David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust was sung by Amy Winehouse. The installation included portraits of the chosen celebrities. Voorsanger was commissioned to work on an Institute of Contemporary Arts six-month project entitled \\"Mystery Train.\\" She partnered in 2008 with Art on the Underground and Pursuing Independent Paths (PIP) to make transportation easier to navigate and encourage people with learning disabilities to explore contemporary art venues. PIP students and Voorsanger visited London's museums and galleries, had a behind-the-scenes tour of the Charing Cross Underground station and developed multiple communications media, including \\"Heads, Bodies, Legs\\" posters and costumed karaoke games. Each poster has a composite image the head, body and legs of ICA staff, London Underground staff and PIP students. Art educator, Emily Candela commented: \\"I have enjoyed the sense of exploration that runs through Mystery Train. Travel itself ‚Äì and London's transport system in particular ‚Äì served both as inspiration for our projects with Jessica Voorsanger as well as the link between our base at the ICA, PIP's centre in Westminster and the world of galleries and museums that we discovered.\\" Lecturer Voorsanger has lectured since 1997 for Goldsmiths College Masters of Arts program, Sunderland, Camberwell College of Arts, Royal College of Art, and The Slade. From 1998 to 2003, she was a lecturer in pictoral arts at Kent Institute of Art & Design. Since 2003 she has been a part-time lecturer for both the University for the Creative Arts's Fine Art and Research and Wimbledon School of Art's Bachelor of Arts programs. Voorsanger has been an external examiner for the University of East London since 2007. Exhibitions She has exhibited widely in the United Kingdom, United States and Germany.

He is notable for having depicted some 35 years of the Cape's history in landscapes and seascapes. Life Bowler was born in Tring, Hertfordshire in 1812, the son of William Bowler and his wife Sarah Butterfield, He landed at the Cape on 5 January 1834 as a servant to Thomas Maclear, the new Astronomer Royal, whose service he left in July 1835, taking employment with Capt. Richard Wolfe, Commandant of Robben Island, and remaining until the end of 1838. Bowler then started offering his services in Cape Town as a \\"drawing master and landscape painter\\". He took up a position as drawing master at the Diocesan College, and from 1842 at the South African College. In the same year that he published his first lithograph, The Landing of Troops at Port Natal being covered by H.M.S. Southampton. This was followed by Four Views of Cape Town in 1844. He also planned an 1845 portfolio of prints Five Views of Natal, but failed to find sufficient subscribers. The originals were returned to South Africa in 1960 by Lord de Saumarez. In 1850 he published The Anti-convict Agitation, a print of the large gathering held in Cape Town on 4 July 1849, objecting to the landing of convicts from the penal transportation ship Neptune. In May 1854 he returned to England, where he received tuition from the artist James Duffield Harding, and was back in Cape Town in March 1855. He painted two historically important pictures of the start of the 1859 Cape Town to Wellington railway line, the first in South Africa; and another two of its opening in November 1863. Three of these paintings were published as engravings in the Illustrated London News. Burns' Hill Mission Station on the Keiskamma River During his time in South Africa, Bowler travelled widely in the Cape Colony, and visited Knysna and Port Elizabeth along the Garden Route. His journeys produced a large number of paintings and sketches such as The Kaffir Wars and the British Settlers in South Africa (1865), and the Pictorial album of Cape Town, with views of Simonstown, Port Elizabeth and Grahamstown (1866). Also in 1866 was Bowler's voyage to Mauritius. He planned to publish a portfolio of 20 lithographs of views on the island, but support was not forthcoming. Seven of the original watercolours are in South Africa, while at least three are in Mauritius. Bowler played a leading role in the founding and legalising of Art Unions at the Cape. Being of a quarrelsome nature, his frequent disagreements were regularly aired in the local press. In August 1868 he travelled to England via Mauritius and Egypt to arrange the production of his portfolio Twenty Views of Mauritius, but died soon after arrival. Bowler produced some 540 watercolours, oil paintings and sketches of which 64 were published as lithographs. Two of his works were published as engravings, not counting his illustrations for books and magazines. His works are held in the African Homes Trust Collection, the Cape Archives, and the Mendelssohn Collection in the Library of Parliament. He was married twice, to Jane Hawthorne and Maria Jolly, the marriages producing ten children.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa (Edna & Frank Bradlow) Bibliography *F.R.

It is within the Perth and Kinross council area. It lies to the east of Loch Leven, at the junction of the A977 and B920 roads, approximately west of Glenrothes and east of Kinross. Scotlandwell is one of the historic sites of Kinross-shire. Named Fons Scotiae by the Romans who founded it nearly 2,000 years ago, the curative waters that bubble up through the sandy ground were used by Red Friars who maintained a hospital in the village between 1250 and 1587. Thousands of pilgrims came to Scotlandwell to take the water, the most famous perhaps being King Robert the Bruce who is alleged to have found a cure for leprosy here. The two main historical features of Scotlandwell village are the Well and Wash House. The Well and Wash House The building of the ornamental well and wash house in Scotlandwell in more recent times was undertaken as part of a general scheme of village improvement carried out between 1857 and 1860 by Thomas Bruce of Arnot. A direct descendant of Sir William Bruce, the architect of Kinross House, Thomas Bruce was the feudal superior of the old Barony of Arnot which included the village of Scotlandwell as its principal settlement. In 1822 a small piece of common ground, situated by the main street and known locally as the Peat Hill, was divided up amongst the feuars of the village. The spot where the well now stands was then described as being \\"an almost unapproachable slough of mire and filth\\" beside which stood \\"a half ruinous building used sometimes as a washing house and sometimes as a slaughter house.\\" Thomas Bruce, who eventually acquired all of this land, commissioned the well. In 1857 the plan for an ornamental fountain or well was prepared by the Edinburgh architect David Bryce (1803‚Äì76). Bryce also designed the washhouse opposite. Using stone from quarries at Greenhead of Arnot and Nivingston near Cleish, the well was completed in 1858 at a cost of ¬£154. On either side of the water spout in front of the well are the embossed initials TBA for Thomas Bruce of Arnot and HD for his wife, Henrietta Dorin, who died during the time the well was being built. The village improvement scheme, which also included the upgrading of many cottages, was completed in 1860 with the building of the washhouse at a cost of ¬£117. In addition to land being cleared to create a bleach field, an ornamental garden with exotic trees was laid out for the benefit of villagers between the washhouse and the main street. For many years a tearoom stood on this site. The wash house bears not only the date 1860 but also the initials TBA for Thomas Bruce of Arnot who commented on the whole scheme once the well and wash house had been completed: \\"The improvement of the village and of its \\"Well\\" has cost me more money than some might perhaps say I aught to have expended upon them, but it has been a subject of great interest to me and I have been far more than repaid in one way at least by the gratification it has afforded to the villagers by a desire for whose moral improvement it was that I was mainly actuated in what I did and am still doing.\\" The Well Two years after the death of Sir Charles Bruce of Arnot in 1922, the well, wash house, garden and bleach field were handed over to the people of Scotlandwell as a gift. Thereafter, the local Parish Council whose powers were eventually devolved to Kinross County Council maintained the site and its historic buildings. The well and nearby washhouse are both in need of upkeep and repair. While the well itself needs to be cleaned and minor structural attention, the washhouse is deteriorating.

Although the film is a horror thriller, the subject matter is intended as a cautionary tale on the dangers of online social networking. Plot Four young people win the competition of a lifetime; Jo (Scarlett Alice Johnson), Max (Jack Gordon), Gwen (Elen Rhys) and Dave (Michael Jibson) head off on an all expenses paid trip to New York, courtesy of the social network All2gethr.com. As they board the private jet, they are asked to relinquish their mobile phones and take part in the in-flight entertainment ‚Äì a new online gaming experience. As Jo climbs into the car she hands her daughter a cell phone so they could text each other. As she leaves a man enters her mother's house and kills the mother. What happens to the daughter remains unknown. The four contestants soon meet; Dave, is soon to be married but has a little bit of a self-control problem around women. Jo, is a single mother who had just gotten out of rehab. Gwen seems to be a sweet girl and is a counselor on All2gether.com but doesn't take her own advice. Max is a liar and a strange guy. As they board the aeroplane the chauffeur takes their phones. After flying, Max and Jo realises a strange door that would lead to the cockpit. Round 1 begins with a three question quiz for each player. Dave scores a 0 out of 3, claiming to have only one tattoo (no piercings), made 9 field goals, and had never seen the girl on screen when actually he has tattoo on his back and a piercing on his scrotum, made 0 field goals and got banned from playing because he assaulted a rival player, and had an affair with the girl on the screen. Jo scores 2 out of 3, claiming to drink 20 virtual alcoholic drinks online per week, claims the picture on the screen was her during her alcoholic period, and she was offline for three months because she was in therapy for her drinking problem, when actually she drinks 30 virtual drinks online per week and even more in actual life. Max scores 0 out of 3, claiming to be grade 5 on classical violin, viewed his mother's All2gether.com page the most (which Dave feels is sad that his mother has a page), and has no idea of the first thing he bought online until the alligator pulls up a picture of genital wart solution which he claims to have never bought, when actually he is still on grade 1 for failing the test several times, he has viewed Jenny's page the most, looking at her albums 237 times, and bought a container of genital wart solution after a holiday when he was 17. Gwen is last, scoring 1 out of 3 claiming she has no idea which celebrity she is compared to the most, has no idea who the man is on the screen, and she is \\"Guardian Angel\\", when actually she is compared to Katie Brooks because of the eating disorder she had when she was 15, the boy was Neil Harris which she dedicated her All2gether page to torment him, and she was \\"Guardian Angel\\" on a helping hands counselor site. Summary, she is a hypocrite because she should take her own advice before helping others. As Round 1 ends, Dave wonders where the picture of the girl came from because it was nowhere on his page. Jo looks out the window and stares at the storm claiming to Max that the weather over the Atlantic ocean was supposed to be clear. Max tells her there is nothing to worry about. Round 2 begins, Kiss and Tell. The alligator shows them a video of some men tormenting a man and eventually killing him. Jo reacts to it claiming she never watched it. The alligator pulls up info saying she watched it one night, again the next morning, and sent it to five of her friends saying \\"OMG THIS NASTY, WATCH TIL THE END!\\" she then claims that she is done playing the game. Gwen is next, the alligator pulls up a quiz called \\"What kind of lover are you?\\" which she took multiple times. The quiz called her a \\"kinky lover\\" which the alligator states wasn't true because she lied on half of her quiz. He then pulls up question four \\"How many people have you slept with\\" she claims it was none of his business he says it is none of his business yet she posted it on an online website for everyone to see. He then asks the question again and she sticks with her answer that it was none of his business. He then pulls up a virtual avatar site with her avatar name \\"Cherry Bomb\\" and she admits to sleeping with no one. She wonders how he knows all of this. He claims that anyone can see anything that anyone does on All2gether.com. Dave is next, the alligator says he visited videos on a Japanese website and watched some videos \\"Two girls and a horse\\", \\"Too young to run\\", etc. He then asks if Dave considered the ages of the girls in the videos and asks Dave if he remembers the video that he watched a total four times, claiming that it will come back to haunt him. Dave feels the need to defend himself, saying he isn't a pervert and that everyone watches things that they shouldn't have. Dave then goes to the cockpit door and pounds on it, the alligator tells him to sit down countless times. Dave refuses. The alligator says that since Dave has refused to go along with the rules he has forfeited. The alligator brings onto the screen all the friends of Dave and stops at Rory. the screen changes to the inside of a house, a man with a torch is walking to the door with a gun. He walks into the bedroom and finds Rory playing video games. He knocks Rory out with the gun and shoots him in the head. Max begins to tap on the screen and finds that the email is blocked. Max broke the rules and issued the forfeit. He chooses his friend Allan. The screen goes to a guy in front of a door, a man with a bat begins to pound on him, then pushes him off the railing of the stairs. The alligator assures them that the game is very real. Round 2 is over. Jo then sees lights outside from land. She claims that they shouldn't be anywhere near land. Max pulls the screen off the wall and punches the wall and hooks the screen to power cords inside the wall. The screen pulls up and shows that their destination is not New York, but Oslo, Norway. Round 3 begins, Do or Die. They will be given an assignment and if they do not follow more deaths will commence. Jo goes into the bathroom and puts on the headphones. Her mission is not known, but if she fails to follow or tells someone her daughter would be killed. Sophie is then shown on the screen inside a bunker house. Jo comes out of the bathroom and takes her seat. Max asks her questions but she refuses to answer or look at them. Dave enters the bathroom and puts on the headsets. If he doesn't follow his fianc√©e, Sarah, will be killed. Dave exits the bathroom crying. Gwen is next. Gwen hesitates but does the same as the others. Instead she hears crying from her sister. On the screen it shows the man pouring petrol on her. Max is last. He refuses to go until Dave tells him to. On the screen it shows his brother, Mike, tied to a table with the man holding a machete. Max exits and they sit in silent. The alligator tells them that they have 45 minutes to complete their mission, if not their special person dies. At the 45 minute mark the plane would crash into the All2gether.com building and they would all die. Max grabs an Ax and begins to tear apart the plane. The alligator instructs Max to put down the axe or his brother will die. Max does so, but because he gave away some of his mission, the man chops off Mike's arm. Max tells the alligator that he isn't really Max. He explains that he hacked into Max's account and changed everything, that he thought they would've caught him at the airport seeing as how he was 25 and Max was 21, but they didn't. He refuses to tell them who he really is. Dave ends up furious and fights with Max. Jo instructs him to prove who he is. Max pulls out a carton of cigarettes and his passport. Dave believes he is telling the truth. He then walks into the bathroom and puts on the headphones. The alligator instructs that they have all revealed clues to their missions and the result must be consequences. Dave tells the alligator he knows who Max really is. The screen ends on a picture of his fianc√©e. Jo makes her way to the bar and grabs a bottle of wine. She pours three glasses and Max drinks all three. Back in the bathroom, Dave pleas with the alligator to let his fianc√©e go, but the alligator says that he has another task and instructs Dave to kill one of the passengers in 3 minutes. Dave grabs the axe and threatens them. Swinging it he attacks Max hitting him in the chest. Max kicks the axe away and they begin attacking each other. Dave grabs a bottle and Max grabs the axe. Dave hits him in the head and Max kills Dave. The alligator then kills Sarah. Gwen walks into the bathroom and the alligator instructs her to put the headsets on. Gwen tells him that she couldn't do what the alligator told her but he reassigns her to seduce Max. Gwen helps Max carry Dave off so no one will look at him. Gwen takes him into the bathroom to treat his arm. She helps him peel his shirt off and cleans it with her scarf. Gwen then tries to kiss him but he pulls away multiple times. Gwen pleas with him saying that if they didn't do it her sister is going to die. They begin to make out when Max runs into the side of the bathroom to find it hollow then remembers that's where the luggage is. The alligator tell Gwen that she has failed her task, he then tells her that she must stop Max or her sister will die. She refuses to move out of Max's way and attacks him with the Axe. Jo attacks Gwen and snaps her neck. The alligator tells them that Gwen has failed her task and sets her sister on fire. Max continues to attack the door. When he busts the door down a smell overcomes the entire plane. He finds trash bags. When he opens one it reveals Max's brother. They realize that they have been watching recordings. Max finds his laptop and Jo desperately looks for Sophie. Jo stumbles across her mother and the cockpit door slowly opens. The pilot holds a taser to them and crushes the laptop. They take the pilot down and he tells them that he is just doing what he is told because he has his family. He tells them he came home the day before yesterday and his house was torn apart. Max's vision begins to fade. Jo tells him that everyone is dead. Max begins choking. Jo helps him into a chair and tells him she's sorry that she poisoned him when he drank all three glasses of wine. The alligator shows the pilot's family on the screen. The pilot shocks Jo with the taser and goes back into the cockpit. Jo wakes up and the alligator shows her a video of a young girl taking as many pills as she could to commit suicide, Lucy Turner age 15. The alligator tells her that all four of them commented on the video, they all watched it at exactly the same time. Gwen, \\"Not even god can forgive you if you do this. Where will you spend eternity?\\", only made it worse, a hypocrite hiding behind her Christian views (her sister died by fire). Dave, \\"WTF!!! Another sad attention-seeking trip to causality and a stomach pump. Do it right or don't do it at all!!!!!! Hang yourself and be sure ;-)\\", merely mocked her agony (Sarah died by hanging), and when he shared the video, Rory committed \\"Dumb bitch! if i were as ugly as you i'd probably do the same. LOL!!!!!\\" Jo tells him that he killed the wrong person, because the man on the plane wasn't Max. He tells her that he will catch up with Max soon enough. Alan also commented on Max's shared video, \\"Cheer up Retard! ROFL!\\" But he tells Jo that she is most at fault because she sat there and watched it happen, as his little girl killed herself. That they all deserved what happened to them and their punishment was just and fit. She tells him that no one is going to care about it, that no one is going to know. The screen then changes to the camera on her. He tells her that the video is going to go viral after he removes everything about him. She demands to know what happened to her daughter. He tells her that he took out her eyes as Jo's punishment. She claims that Lucy killed herself because of him. Jo grabs the axe and busts the door down. She is blown out of the plane as it crashes into the sea. The alligator is then revealed as he turns off the screen. News reporters talk about how the wreckage confirms the video going worldwide. Sophie is shown in the bunker house playing with a doll, when the alligator walks in. He tells her that she is no longer Sophie, but Lucy. He introduces himself as Rupert Turner. He takes her hand and walks her out of the room into a living room where a woman (the chauffeur from earlier) and man (the baggage loader from before the flight) stand before her. The woman calls herself her mother, Annie, and the man her brother, Ed. (Sophie does have both of her eyes.) The film ends with them walking hand in hand out of the building.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1868 to 1880.  Early life  David Chadwick was the son of John Chadwick, who was originally from Macclesfield but later moved to Manchester. Chadwick was educated in Manchester, and began training as an accountant in 1843. By 1870 he was a senior partner in Chadwicks, Adamson, Collier, and Co., based in London and Manchester. He was a President of the Manchester Statistical Society, the first president of the Manchester Institute of Accountants, and an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. At the 1865 general election, Chadwick unsuccessfully contested the borough of Macclesfield, but he won the seat at the 1868 general election. Macclesfield then had two Members of Parliament (MPs), and Chadwick and his fellow Liberal MP William Coare Brocklehurst were re-elected in 1874 and in 1880. However, an election petition was lodged against the result of the 1880 general election in Macclesfield, and the result was declared void on 22 June 1880. The Election Court found that an organised system of bribery and treating by the Liberal election agent had prevailed at the election; Chadwick and Brocklehurst were both unseatedEdward Loughlin O'Malley and Henry Hardcastle, \\"Reports of the Decisions of the Judges for the Trials of Election Petitions in England and Ireland\\", vol. III (Stevens and Haynes, 1881), p. 100. and a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate. The inquiry opened on 1 October 1880, which found that there had been extensive bribery in the borough. The writ was suspended, and the borough lost its right to representation in Parliament. William Mair, Liberal agent at the election, told the court that he had promised Chadwick that no money would be spent illegally. He was convicted in July 1881 of bribery and of making a false return of election expenses. Chadwick did not stand again. Chadwick was also a prolific writer on a range of topics. His works included Suggestions for an Equitable Redistribution of Parliamentary Representation, The Financial Aspect of the Sanitary Question, Poor Rates and Principle of Rating, Social and Educational Statistics of Manchester, and The Rate of Wages in 200 Trades for 20 Years. He was described in 1870 as being \\"in favour of the ballot, national education, and reduction in national expenditure\\". He erected the Macclesfield Free Library, and presented it to the town's corporation. He was also a governor of the estate of the Royal Holloway College in Surrey.  Family  Chadwick married twice, firstly in 1844 to Louisa Bow, daughter of William Bow of Broughton. Louisa died in 1873, and in 1878 he married Ursula Sopwith, daughter of the civil engineer Thomas Sopwith. Chadwick died on 19 September 1895, aged 73, at his home The Poplars in Herne Hill, London and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

Life  Landscape with shepherds Jan van Gool was a pupil of Simon van der Does and Mattheus Terwesten.Jan van Gool in the RKD He became a member of the Confrerie Pictura in 1711. He was first regent, and then five years later became director, of the Hague Drawing School from 1720-1734. He spent most of his time in the Hague, but travelled to England twice and is recorded there in 1711. He specialized in Italianate landscapes. He is best known today for his book of artist biographies, otherwise known as the \\"Nieuw Schouburg\\". The full title is De Nieuwe Schouburg der Nederlantsche kunstschilders en schilderessen: Waer in de Levens- en Kunstbedryven der tans levende en reets overleedene Schilders, die van Houbraken, noch eenig ander schryver, zyn aengeteekend, verhaelt worden. (The Hague, 1750). He meant this book as an update to the original \\"Schouwburg\\" written by his friend Arnold Houbraken, whose 3-volume Schouburg was written in order of birth year, ending with Adriaen van der Werff, born in 1659. Just as Houbraken before him, he starts his book with a tribute to his predecessors, most notably Karel van Mander and to Houbraken himself, noting however, that Houbraken included many insulting comments in his sketches that he felt were unnecessary. He starts with the artists that Houbraken left out, choosing for his first subjects two painters from the Hague, Jan van Ravensteyn and Adriaen Hanneman. He then proceeded to write short sketches in birth year order up to 1680, ending Volume I with Gerard Jan Palthe. In Volume II he continued from 1680 with Jan van Huysum and ended in 1700 with the brothers Bernard and Matthijs Accama. His book contains many notes about Hague painters and the founding of the drawing academy in the Hague, where he lived and worked.Jan van Gool in the Dictionary of Art Historians List of painters in Part I *Jan Antonisz. van Ravesteyn p. 15 *Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen p. 22 *Adriaen Hanneman p. 24 *Martinus Lengele p. 30 *Arnold van Ravesteyn p. 31 *Isaac Koedijck p. 36 *Jan Potheuck p. 36 *Abraham Lambertsz van den Tempel p. 37 *Jan Goedart p. 41 *Willem Eversdijck p. 43 *Cornelis Eversdyk p. 43 *Theodor van der Schuer p. 44 *Willem Doudijns p. 51 *Nikolaes Wieling p. 58 *Herman Verelst p. 59 *Pieter Hermansz Verelst p. 59 *Simon Pietersz Verelst p. 59 *Adriaen Cornelisz Beeldemaker p. 63 *Franciscus Carree p. 64 *Johan le Ducq p. 65 *Marcus de Bye p. 67 *Dani√´l Haring p. 69 *Daniel Mijtens the Younger p. 71 *Jan Weenix p. 79 *Robbert Duval (1639-1732) p. 83 *Johannes Vollevens p. 89 *Anthoni Schoonjans p. 94 *Jan Mortel p. 99 *Abraham Begeyn p. 100 *Elias Terwesten p. 102 *Theodoor Visscher p. 104 *Cornelis de Bruijn p. 112 *Jan van Call p. 117 *Jan Frans van Bloemen p. 121 *Pieter van Bloemen p. 122 *Hendrik Carr√© p. 122 *Michiel Carree p. 125 *Frank Pieterse Verheyden p. 127 *Arnold Houbraken p. 131 *N.

So there is a question: How to find the formulas of the rational functions which possess Herman rings with higher period? According to the result of Shishikura, if a rational function ∆í possesses a Herman ring, then the degree of ∆í is at least 3\\\\. There also exist meromorphic functions that possess Herman rings. Herman rings for transcendental meromorphic functions have been studied by T. Nayak. According to a result of Nayak, if there is an omitted value for such a function then Herman rings of period 1 or 2 do not exist. Also, it is proved that if there is only a single pole and at least an omitted value, the function has no Herman ring of any period.

George Sandulescu Constantin George Sandulescu (11 February 1933, Bucharest ‚Äì 27 October 2018, Monte Carlo) was a Joycean scholar, but in the first place, he was a linguist with twelve years' experience in the Department of Theoretical Linguistics of the University of Stockholm in the 1970s and 1980s, specializing in Discourse Analysis. In that capacity he read a dozen or so papers at various international congresses (see texts below). His education includes a B.A. degree (Bucharest), M.Phil. (Leeds) and Ph.D. (Essex). George Sandulescu has worked as a researcher at university level for 12 years in Romania (between 1957 and 1969), for 12 years in Sweden (from 1970 to 1982), and for 12 years in the Principality of Monaco (from 1984 to 1996). He taught at Bucharest University between 1962‚Äì1969. He has lived, worked, and conducted research and teaching in major institutions in Romania, Sweden, Great Britain, the United States and Italy. After the death in 1983 of Princess Grace of Monaco, he substantially assisted in founding the Monaco library bearing her name, and organised important International Conferences there devoted to James Joyce (1985 and 1990), William Butler Yeats (1987), Samuel Beckett (1991), and Oscar Wilde (1993). On the invitation of Prince Rainier III, and together with the British writer Anthony Burgess, also a resident of Monaco, George Sandulescu was one of the founders of the Princess Grace Irish Library of Monaco‚Äîthe fundamental purpose of which was to publish literary criticism in two distinct series of publications, produced by Colin Smythe Ltd., of Gerrards Cross. More than 25 volumes were published in the period from 1985 to 1997; the programme had stopped by 2000. George Sandulescu attended most James Joyce Conventions, Conferences and get-togethers which took place in Europe (and some of them in the United States) between the years 1975 and 1990. (The same applied to both Theoretical and Practical Linguistics during the same period of time.)He stopped in 1990, after having organized the 12th James Joyce Symposium in the Principality of Monaco. As Director of the Princess Grace Irish Library between 1982 and 1996, George Sandulescu made a point of organizing World Congresses in Monaco, devoted to the Irish writers Wilde, Yeats, Joyce and Beckett. Both the Director Sandulescu, the Reigning Family, the Trustees of the Library, and the Principality as a whole invited the families of these four writers to actively participate in the event, as an essential point in the success and completeness of these manifestations (see Proceedings below).

The Investor Protections and Improvements to the Regulation of Securities is a United States Act of Congress, which forms Title IX, sections 901 to 991 of the much broader and larger Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010., ¬ß 901 Its main purpose is to revise the powers and structure of the Securities and Exchange Commission, credit rating organizations, and the relationships between customers and broker-dealers or investment advisers. This title calls for various studies and reports from the SEC and Government Accountability Office (GAO). This title contains nine subtitles. OverviewSubtitle A ‚Äì Increasing Investor Protection Subtitle A contains provisions: * To prevent regulatory capture within the SEC and increase the influence of investors, the Act creates an Office of the Investor Advocate,, ¬ß 915; amending section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 () by adding: (g) OFFICE OF THE INVESTOR ADVOCATE. an Investor Advisory Committee composed of 12-22 members of whom serve 4-year terms,, ¬ß 911; amending Title I of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 () by adding Sec 39(a): Investors Advisory Committee and an ombudsman appointed by the Office of the Investor Advocate., ¬ß 919D; amending section 4(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as added by section 914) by adding: (8) OMBUDSMAN. The Investor Advisory Committee was actually created in 2009 and therefore predates the passage of the Act, but it is specifically authorized under the Act.Skadden. The Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act: Commentary and Insights . * SEC is specifically authorized to issue \\"point-of-sale disclosure\\" rules when retail investors purchase investment products or services; these disclosures include concise information on costs, risks, and conflicts of interest. This authorization follows up the SEC's failure to implement proposed point-of-sale disclosure rules in 2004 and 2005;For the 2005 proposed rule, see Point of Sale Disclosure Requirements and Confirmation Requirements for Transactions in Mutual Funds, College Savings Plans, and Certain Other Securities, and Amendments to the Registration Form for Mutual Funds, via sec.gov These proposed rules generated opposition because they were perceived as burdensome to broker-dealers. For example, they would require oral disclosures for telephone transactions, were not satisfied by cheap internet or email disclosures, and could allow the customer to request disclosures specific to the amount of their investment. In determining the disclosure rules, the Act authorizes the SEC to do \\"investor testing\\" and rely on experts to study financial literacy among retail investors., ¬ß 912; adding to Section 19 of the Securities Act of 1933 () by adding (e)Evaluation of Rules or Programs Subtitle A provides authority for the SEC to impose regulations requiring \\"fiduciary duty\\" by broker-dealers and investment advisers to their customers. Although the Act does not create such a duty immediately, the Act authorizes the SEC to establish such a standard and requires that the SEC study the standards of care which broker-dealers and investment advisers apply to their customers and report to Congress on the results within 6 months. Under the law, commission and limited product range would not violate the duty and broker-dealers would not have a continuing duty after the investment advice is given., ¬ß 913(g); amending section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 () by adding at the end: (k) STANDARD OF CONDUCT Subtitle B ‚Äì Increasing Regulatory Enforcement and Remedies Subtitle B gives the SEC further powers of enforcement. This includes a \\"whistleblower bounty program\\", ¬ß 922; The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 () by inserting: SEC. 21F. SECURITIES WHISTLEBLOWER INCENTIVES AND PROTECTION. which is based upon a similar program established by the IRS in 2006; the program allows persons who provide information which leads to a successful SEC enforcement to receive 10 to 30% of the monetary sanctions over $1 million. Section 921 under the title allows the SEC to prohibit pre-dispute mandatory binding arbitration. Section 929I exempts the SEC from disclosing information obtained pursuant to 17(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or information \\"based upon or derived from\\" such information \\"obtained by the Commission for use in furtherance of the purposes of this title, including surveillance, risk assessments, or other regulatory and oversight activities\\" ‚Äì meaning information derived from examinations. The SEC rejected a Freedom of Information Act request on July 27, 2010 based upon this new law; while the SEC has stated that this legal change is necessary for registrants to comply with the examinations, the provision has been criticized for allowing the SEC to avoid the typical disclosure rules applicable to federal agencies.Prial D. (2010). SEC Says New Financial Regulation Law Exempts it From Public Disclosure . Fox Business News. Importantly, section 921I amends SEC Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 to allow the Securities Exchange Commission to not disclose records or information that have been obtained for uses such as \\"surveillance, risk assessments, or other regulatory and oversight activities\\" except it may not withhold information from judicial or congressional inquiry., ¬ß 929I. PROTECTING CONFIDENTIALITY OF MATERIALS SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION; (a) SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.‚ÄîSection 24 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78x) is amended‚Äî (1) in subsection (d), by striking subsection (e) and inserting subsection (f); (2) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and (3) by inserting after subsection (d) the following: (e) RECORDS OBTAINED FROM REGISTERED PERSONS The effective result of this change is that the US Freedom of Information Act no longer applies to the SEC; the SEC can refuse to supply documents it deems as being part of its regulatory and oversight activities.

Its effect was to give the Russian Empire control over most of what is now Turkmenistan, thereby nearly completing the Russian conquest of Central Asia. The battle is also called Denghil-Tepe or Dangil Teppe. Sources are inconsistent, but Denghil-Tepe seems to have been the name of the fort and also the name of a small hill or tumulus in the northwest corner of the fort. Geok Tepe ('Blue Hill') seems to refer to the general area, the modern town, a nearby village and a mountain to the south. Skrine says that fort enclosed or more, with mud walls thick and high on the inside and a dry ditch on the outside, although other dimensions are given. The area was part of the Akhal Oasis where streams coming down from the Kopet Dagh support irrigation agriculture. Campaign and siege After Russian forces were defeated in 1879 Russia began to plan for a new campaign. The basic problem was moving up supplies since Akhal was an oasis surrounded by several hundred kilometres of semi-desert. In March 1880 Mikhail Skobelev was put in charge of the Trans-Caspian region. He adopted Lazarev's original plan of a slow and massive advance. Instead of Khoja Kale he chose a base at Bami on the north side of the Kopet Dagh. At some point he decided to take Geok Tepe by siege rather than storm. He arrived at Chikislyar in May, advanced up the Atrek and Sumbar rivers and by June 11 he occupied Bami. The build-up was slow, partly due to the shortage of camels. In July he made a reconnaissance in force to examine Geok Tepe. By the first half of December he had enough men and supplies and moved out to occupy a fort he renamed ‚ÄòSamur‚Äô a few kilometres west of Geok Tepe. On 27 December Aleksey Kuropatkin arrived with five companies, having made a remarkable march across the desert from Khiva. By the end of the month Skobelev had 4020 infantry, 750 cavalry as well as artillery, rockets, several machine guns and heliographs for communications. About 40000 Tekkes were thought to be in the area. On January 1, 1881 he occupied Yanghi-Kala south of the fort to control the water supply and the following day chose the southeast corner as the point of attack and on the following day moved the main camp to Yanghi-Kala. On 4‚Äì8 January the first parallel was built about from the fort and a second begun. To protect this a detachment was sent to capture a small redoubt to the north and General Petrushevich was killed after rushing through the gate. The Tekkes made sorties on the 9th, 11th and 16th. These were largely successful, but cost many Turkoman lives. The camp was twice moved north to make it easier to deal with sorties. The Russians only had enough men to hold a siege line in the southeast corner and the Tekkes were usually allowed to move in and out on the north side of the fort. On January 18 a mine was started on the southeast side and two days later artillery made a breach in the south wall which was quickly repaired. On 23 January the mine was completed and loaded with of powder. Battle Ruins of the fort Battlefield, memorial mosque After the Defeat by Vereshchagin The attack began at 07:00 on January 24. All the artillery opened up and the southern artillery started to reopen the south breach. On the west side a diversionary attack was made to capture a redoubt. The mine was exploded at 11:20 and made a breach in the wall. Kuropatkin led eleven and a half companies into the breach, which was taken. At the same time Kozelkov led eight companies into the southern breach, which proved too small. They were stopped and the breach was only taken when reserves were brought up, the flanks being taken with scaling ladders. The two groups linked up and, following instructions, began to entrench themselves. Meanwhile, the western group scaled the wall. Given this success, Skobelev reversed orders and ordered a general advance. By afternoon the hill at the northwest corner was taken and the Tekkes were fleeing over the north wall, pursued by cavalry. The pursuit continued for 16 kilometers and was only stopped by nightfall. Aftermath For the final day's battle Skobelev reported 59 killed, 304 wounded and 85 slightly wounded. For the month of January \\"Indian Officer\\" gave 1108 Russians killed and wounded out of about 5000 engaged. Ammunition expended was 287,314 bullets, 5,864 artillery shells and 224 rockets (time period uncertain). Thousands of transport camels died during the campaign. Tekke losses were estimated at 20,000. On 30 January the Russians moved southeast and took Ashgabat which was then a fairly small place. They could not go much further because of heavy losses and lack of supplies. Skobelev was removed from command, probably because of the excessive slaughter of civilians. On 6 May 1881, Transcaspia was declared an oblast of the Russian Empire under the Viceroy of the Caucasus. In September Persia signed the Treaty of Akhal formalizing the Atrek River as the border. The next Russian moves were the capture of Merv in 1884 and the push toward Panjdeh in 1885. In the 1990s a mosque was built to commemorate the siege and the defenders. In Turkmenistan the battle is remembered as a national day of mourning, and the resistance is often cited as a source of national pride. The last paragraph of Skobelev's official report reads: \\"After the capture of the fortress, 6,500 bodies were buried inside it. During the pursuit 8,000 were killed.\\" On the previous page he wrote: \\"In this pursuit by the dragoons and Cossacks ... the killed of both sexes amounted to 8,000 persons.\\" See also * Russian Turkestan * History of Turkmenistan * Russian conquest of Turkestan * Aerial view of battlefield and memorial mosque Sources and notes *\\"An Indian Officer\\", \\"Russia's March towards India\\", Chapter XVI, 1894 *Mikhail Skobelev, \\"Siege and Assault of Denghil-Tepe\\", 1881 (official report) Category:History of Turkmenistan Category:Central Asia in the Russian Empire Category:Sieges involving Russia Category:Russian war crimes Category:The Great Game ","title":"Battle of Geok Tepe"},{"id":"29176180","text":"Carnbo is a hamlet in Perth and Kinross, Scotland.

The tax is nearly always computed as the fair market value of the property times an assessment ratio times a tax rate, and is generally an obligation of the owner of the property. Values are determined by local officials, and may be disputed by property owners. For the taxing authority, one advantage of the property tax over the sales tax or income tax is that the revenue always equals the tax levy, unlike the other taxes. The property tax typically produces the required revenue for municipalities' tax levies. A disadvantage to the taxpayer is that the tax liability is fixed, while the taxpayer's income is not. The tax is administered at the local government level. Many states impose limits on how local jurisdictions may tax property. Because many properties are subject to tax by more than one local jurisdiction, some states provide a method by which values are made uniform among such jurisdictions. Property tax is rarely self- computed by the owner. The tax becomes a legally enforceable obligation attaching to the property at a specific date. Most states impose taxes resembling property tax in the state, and some states tax other types of business property. Basics Most jurisdictions below the state level in the United States impose a tax on interests in real property (land, buildings, and permanent improvements) that are considered under state law to be ownership interests.Hellerstein, page 96. Rules vary widely by jurisdiction.Compare The Illinois Property Tax System (hereafter \\"IL System\\"), Louisiana Property Tax Basics (hereafter \\"La. Basics\\"),New York pamphlet How Property Tax Works (hereafter \\"NY Taxworks\\"), and Texas Property Tax Basics (hereafter \\"Texas Basics). However, certain features are nearly universal. Some jurisdictions also tax some types of business personal property, particularly inventory and equipment.Texas Basics, page __. By contrast, the Illinois Constitution prohibits taxation of personal property; see IL System, page 5. States generally do not impose property taxes.IL System, page 5; however, see IL System, page 10, for exceptions. Many overlapping jurisdictions may have authority to tax the same property.Fisher, Glen, History of Property Taxes in the United States , 2002. These include counties or parishes, cities and/or towns, school districts, utility districts, and special taxing authorities which vary by state. Few states impose a tax on the value of property. The tax is based on fair market value of the subject property, and generally attaches to the property on a specific date. The owner of the property on that date is liable for the tax.See IL System, page 23; La. Basics, page 16; and Texas Basics, page 33. The amount of tax is determined annually based on market value of each property on a particular date,Such date varies by jurisdiction, and may be referred to as the assessment date, valuation date, lien date, or other term. and most jurisdictions require redeterminations of value periodically. The tax is computed as the determined market value times an assessment ratio times the tax rate.See La. Basics, Example 13. Assessment ratios and tax rates vary among jurisdictions, and may vary by type of property within a jurisdiction.See, e.g., IL System, page 11. Most jurisdictions' legislative bodies determine their assessment ratios and tax rates, though some states impose constraints on such determinations. Tax assessors for taxing jurisdictions determine property values in a variety of ways, but are generally required to base such determinations on fair market value.IL System, page 10. Fair market value is that price for a willing and informed seller would sell the property to a willing and informed buyer, neither being under any compulsion to act. Where a property has recently been sold between unrelated sellers, such sale establishes fair market value. In other (i.e., most) cases, the value must be estimated. Common estimation techniques include the comparable sales method, the depreciated cost method, and an income method approach. Property owners may also declare a value, which is subject to change by the tax assessor. Once the value is determined, the assessor typically notifies the last known property owner of the value determination. Such notices may include the calculated amount of tax. The property owner may then contest the value.Texas Basics, pages 13 and 21-27. IL System, pages 14-15; La. Basics, page 16. Property values are generally subject to review by a board of review or similar body, before which a property owner may contest determinations.IL System, pages 13-15. After values are settled, property tax bills or notices are sent to property owners.Generally, tax assessors send the bills. In Louisiana, however, the parish sheriff is responsible for billing and collection of property tax. See La. Basics, page 2. Payment times and terms vary widely. If a property owner fails to pay the tax, the taxing jurisdiction has various remedies for collection, in many cases including seizure and sale of the property. Property taxes constitute a lien on the property to which transferees are also subject.  Property subject to tax  Nearly all property tax imposing jurisdictions tax real property.Hellerstein, page 90. This includes land, buildings, and all improvements (often called fixtures) that cannot be removed without damage to the property.IL System, page 5. Taxed property includes homes, farms, business premises, and most other real property. Many jurisdictions also tax certain types of other property used in a business. Property existing and located in the jurisdiction on a particular date is subject to this tax. This date is often January 1 of each year, but varies among jurisdictions. Property owned by educational, charitable, and religious organizations is usually exempt.  Tax rates  Tax rates vary widely among jurisdictions.See the Tax Foundation study Property Taxes on Owner-Occupied Housing by State, 2004 ‚Äì 2009. They are generally set by the taxing jurisdiction's governing body.Texas Basics, page 29. The method of determining the rate varies widely, but may be constrained under laws of particular states. Property tax is likely the first or second highest tax burden on a capital-intensive business so hundreds of thousands of dollars may be at stake. In some jurisdictions, property is taxed based on its classification. Classification is the grouping of properties based on similar use. Examples of classification are residential, commercial, industrial, vacant, and blighted real property. Property classification are used to tax properties at different rates and for different public policy purposes. In Washington D.C. for instance property occupancy is incentivized by taxing residential property at 0.85 percent of assessed value but vacant residential property at 5 percent of assessed value.  Rate or millage  The rate of tax is a percentage of the assessed value of the property subject to tax. This in some cases is expressed as a \\"millage\\" or dollars of tax per thousand dollars of assessed value.See Louisiana Property Tax Basics, page 1.  Assessment ratio  Most jurisdictions impose the tax on some stated portion of fair market value, referred to as an assessment ratio.See La. Basics, page 4. This ratio may vary depending on the type or use of the property. The assessment ratio can, in many jurisdictions, be changed from year to year by the taxing jurisdiction's governing body. Changes in tax rate or assessment ratio may have the same practical effect of changing net tax due on a particular property.  Valuation  sales taxes (brown), property taxes (white), licenses and other fees (grey), individual and corporate income taxes (green) in 2007.upright Determining the value of property is a critical aspect of property taxation, as such value determines the amount of tax due. Various techniques may be used to determine value. Except in the case of property recently sold, valuation has some inherently subjective aspects. Values may change over time, and many states require taxing jurisdictions to redetermine values every three or four years. The value of property is often determined based on current use of the property, rather than potential uses.Texas Basics, page 12. Property values are determined at a particular valuation date for each jurisdiction, which varies widely.  Who determines value  Property owners may make a declaration of the value of property they own to a taxing authority. This is often referred to as rendition.See Texas Basics, page 11 Some jurisdictions require property owners to file a rendition annually for some types of property; see Texas Basics, page 12, and IL System, pages 10-11. The taxing authority may accept this value or make its own determination of value. The value determinations are generally made by a tax assessor for the taxing authority. Some states require uniform values to be determined for each particular property.  Market value  Property values are generally based on fair market value of the property on the valuation date. Fair market value has been defined as that price a willing and informed purchaser would pay to an unrelated willing and informed seller where neither party is under compulsion to act. Sale of the particular property between unrelated persons generally conclusively establishes fair market value on the date of sale. Thus, a recent sale of the same property provides good evidence of market value. Where there has been no recent sale, other techniques must be used to determine market value.  Assessed value  Many jurisdictions impose tax on a value that is only a portion of market value. This assessed value is the market value times an assessment ratio.IL System, page 11. Assessment ratios are often set by local taxing jurisdictions. However, some states impose constraints on the assessment ratios used by taxing jurisdictions within the state. Some such restrictions vary by type or use of property, and may vary by jurisdiction within the state. Some states impose restrictions on the rate at which assessed value may increase.See, e.g., California Constitution Article 13A (adopted in Proposition 13.  Equalization among jurisdictions  Many states require that multiple jurisdictions taxing the same property must use the same market value.IL System, page 16. Generally, such state provides a board of equalization or similar body to determine values in cases of disputes between jurisdictions.See, e.g., California State Board of Equalization; IL System, page 17.  Valuation techniques  Tax assessors may use a variety of techniques for determining the value of property that was not recently sold. Determining which technique to use and how to apply it inherently involves judgment. = Comparable sales = Values may be determined based on recent sales of comparable property.Texas basics, page 12. Note that Texas requires that sales more than 24 months before a valuation date not be considered in determining values. The value of most homes is usually determined based on sales of comparable homes in the immediate area. Valuation adjustments may be necessary to achieve comparability. Among the factors considered in determining if a property is comparable are: * Nature of the property (house, office building, bare land, etc.) * Location * Size * Use of the property (residential, commercial, farm, etc.) * Nature of improvements ** Types and uses of buildings ** Features of the buildings (number of bedrooms, level of amenities, etc.) ** Age of improvements * Desirability of the property (view, proximity to schools, type of access, nearby detracting features, etc.) * Restrictions on the property (easements, building code restrictions, physical restrictions, etc.) * Utility of the property (fertility of land, drainage or lack thereof, environmental issues, etc.) * General economic conditions = Cost = Where recent comparable property sales are not available, a cost based approach may be used. In this approach, the original or replacement cost of a property is reduced by an allowance for decline in value (depreciation) of improvements. In some jurisdictions, the amount of depreciation may be limited by statute. Where original cost is used, it may be adjusted for inflation or increases or decreases in cost of constructing improvements. Replacement cost may be determined by estimates of construction costs. = Income = An alternative valuation may be used for income producing property based on economic concepts. Using the income approach, value is determined based on present values expected income streams from the property. Selection of an appropriate discount rate in determining present values is a key judgmental factor influencing valuation under this approach.  Special use values  Most taxing jurisdictions provide that property used in any of several manners is subject to special valuation procedures.Illinois even has different procedures for assessment of farmland than for other property; IL System, page 11. This is commonly applied to property used for farming, forestry, or other uses common in the jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions value property at its \\"highest and best use\\", with some of these providing exceptions for homes or agricultural land.Texas Basics, page 1. Special valuation issues vary widely among jurisdictions.  Revaluation  All taxing jurisdictions recognize that values of property may change over time. Thus, values must be redetermined periodically. Many states and localities require that the value of property be redetermined at three or four year intervals.Illinois reassessment requirements vary by county; IL System page 11. Such revaluation may follow valuation principles above, or may use mass valuation techniques.  Limits on increases  Some jurisdictions have set limits on how much property values may be increased from year to year for property tax purposes.See, e.g., California's \\"Proposition 13\\"; Texas Basics, page 17. These limits may be applied yearly or cumulatively, depending on the jurisdiction's rules.  Assessment process  The assessment process varies widely by jurisdiction as to procedure and timing. In many states, the process of assessment and collection may be viewed as a two-year process, where values are determined in the first year and tax assessed and paid in the second.IL System, page 6; Texas Basics, page 12. Most jurisdictions encourage property owners to declare the value of their property at the start of the assessment process. Property owners in all jurisdictions are given rights to appeal taxing authority determinations, but such rights vary widely.  Valuation by assessor  Jurisdictions imposing property tax uniformly charge some official with determining value of property subject to tax by the jurisdiction.IL System, page 10; Texas Basics, page 11. This official may be an employee or contractor to the taxing government, and is generally referred to as the tax assessor in most jurisdictions. Some taxing jurisdictions may share a common tax assessor for some or all property within the jurisdictions, especially when the jurisdictions overlap.  Notification to owner  Following determination of value, tax assessors are generally required to notify the property owner(s) of the value so determined.See Texas Basics, page 12. Procedures vary by jurisdiction. In Louisiana, no formal notice is required; instead, the assessor \\"opens\\" the books to allow property owners to view the valuations.La. Basics, page 16. Texas and some other jurisdictions also require that the notice include very specific items, and such notice may cover multiple taxing jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide that notification is made by publishing a list of properties and values in a local newspaper.IL System, page 12. In some jurisdictions, such notification is required only if the value increases by more than a certain percentage. In some jurisdictions, the notification of value may also constitute a tax bill or assessment. Generally, notification of the owner starts the limited period during which the owner may contest the value.  Review  Owners of property are nearly always entitled to discuss valuations with the tax assessor, and such discussions may result in changes in the assessor's valuation.Texas Basics, page 21. Many jurisdictions provide for a review of value determinations. Such review is often done by a board of review, often composed of residents of the jurisdiction who are not otherwise associated with the jurisdiction's government.IL System pages 13-16; Texas Basics, page 21. In addition, some jurisdictions and some states provide for additional review bodies.See, e.g., California State Board of Equalization; IL System, page 16.  Protest  Nearly all jurisdiction provide for a mechanism for contesting the assessor's determination of value. Such mechanisms vary widely.See Texas Basics for a guide to preparing protests of value, with advice applicable to most jurisdictions.  Judicial appeal  All jurisdictions levying property tax must allow property owners to go to court to contest valuation and taxes.Failure to allow appeal has been held to violate the due process clause of the U.S. constitution. See also IL System, page 16; Texas Basics, page 26. Procedures for such judicial appeal vary widely. Some jurisdictions prohibit judicial appeal until administrative appeals are exhausted. Some permit binding arbitration.Texas Basics, page 26.  Levy of tax  Tax is levied at the tax rate and assessment ratio applicable for the year.Illinois refers to the process of determining the tax rate and assessment ratio as \\"levy,\\" to the process of calculating tax amount as \\"extension,\\" and also refers to the preparation of tax bills. See IL System, various sections. Taxing jurisdictions levy tax on property following a preliminary or final determination of value. Property taxes in the United States generally are due only if the taxing jurisdiction has levied or billed the tax. The form of levy or billing varies, but is often accomplished by mailing a tax bill to the property owner or mortgage company.IL System, page 22.  Exemptions and incentives  Taxing jurisdictions provide a wide variety of methods a property owner may use to reduce tax. Nearly all jurisdictions provide a homestead exemption reducing the taxable value, and thus tax, of an individual's home.La. Basics, page 5; IL System, pages 25-26. Many provide additional exemptions for veterans.Texas Basics, pages 15-16. Taxing jurisdictions may also offer temporary or permanent full or partial exemptions from property taxes, often as an incentive for a particular business to locate its premises within the jurisdiction.IL System, page 26. Some jurisdictions provide broad exemptions from property taxes for businesses located within certain areas, such as enterprise zones.IL System, page 27. The largest property tax exemption is the exemption for registered non-profit organizations; all 50 states fully exempt these organizations from state and local property taxes with a 2009 study estimating the exemption's forgone tax revenues range from $17-$32 billion per year. Exemptions can be quite substantial. In New York City alone, an Independent Budget Office study found that religious institutions would have been taxed $627M yearly without such exemptions; all exempt groups avoided paying a combined $13 billion in the fiscal year of 2012 (1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012).  Payment  Time and manner of payment of property taxes varies widely.Dates may also vary within a state; Texas Basics, page 31. Property taxes in many jurisdictions are due in a single payment by January 1. Many jurisdictions provide for payment in multiple installments.IL System, page 22; Texas Basics, page 32. In some jurisdictions, the first installment payment is based on prior year tax. Payment is generally required by cash or check delivered or mailed to the taxing jurisdiction.  Liens and seizures  Property taxes generally attach to the property; that is, they become an encumbrance on the property which the current and future owners must satisfy.IL System, page 23. This attachment, or lien, generally happens automatically without further action of the taxing authority. The lien generally is removed automatically upon payment of the tax. If the tax is not paid within a specified period of time (including additional interest, penalties, and costs), a tax sale is held, which may result in either 1) the actual sale of a property, or 2) a lien sold to a third party, who (after another specified period of time) may take action to claim the property, or force a later sale to redeem the lien.  Attachment date  The tax lien attaches to the propertyTexas Basics, page 33. at a specific date, generally the date the tax liability becomes enforceable.Texas Basics, page 4. This date, known as the attachment date, varies by state, and in some states by local jurisdiction.  Delinquency  Where the property owner does not pay tax by the due date, the taxing authority may assess penalties and interest.Texas Basics, page 32. The amount, timing, and procedures vary widely. Generally, the penalty and interest are enforceable in the same manner as the tax, and attach to the property.  Seizure and sale  Where the property owner fails to pay tax, the taxing authority may act to enforce its lien. Enforcement procedures vary by state. In some states, the lien may be sold by the taxing authority to a third party, who can then attempt collection.IL System, pages 23-24. In most states, the taxing authority can seize the property and offer it for sale, generally at a public auction. In some states, rights acquired in such sale may be limited.  Tax administrations  Property taxes are generally administered separately by each jurisdiction imposing property tax, though some jurisdictions may share a common property tax administration. Often the administration of the taxes is conducted from the taxing jurisdiction's administrative offices (e.g., town hall). The form and organization varies widely.  Assessors  Most taxing jurisdictions refer to the official charged with determining property values, assessing, and collecting property taxes as assessors. Assessors may be elected, appointed, hired, or contracted, depending on rules within the jurisdiction, which may vary within a state. Assessors may or not be involved in collection of tax.La. Basics, page 2, indicates the parish sheriff bills and collects property tax. The tax assessors in some states are required to pass certain certification examinations and/or have a certain minimum level of property valuation experience. Larger jurisdictions employ full-time personnel in the tax assessors office, while small jurisdictions may engage only one part-time person for the entire tax assessor function.  Constitutional limitations  Property taxes, like all taxes in the United States, are subject to constraints under the United States and applicable state constitutions. The United States Constitution contains three relevant provisions: limits on federal direct taxation, an equal protection rule, and the privileges and immunities provisions.Hellerstein, page __. Nearly all state constitutions impose uniformity and equality rules. Most state constitutions also impose other restrictions, which vary widely. The federal government is generally prohibited from imposing direct taxes unless such taxes are then given to the states in proportion to population. Thus, ad valorem property taxes have not been imposed at the federal level. The states must grant residents of other states equal protections as taxpayers.  Uniformity and equality  State constitutions constrain taxing authorities within the state, including local governments. Typically, these constitutions require that property taxes be uniformly or equally assessed. While many states allow differing rates of taxation among tax jurisdictions, most prohibit the same jurisdiction from applying different rates to different taxpayers. These provisions have generally been interpreted to mean the method of valuation and assessment must be consistent from one local government to another. Some state courts have held that this uniformity and equality requirement does not prevent granting individualized tax credits (such as exemptions and incentives). Some states permit different classes of property (as opposed to different classes of taxpayer) to be valued using different assessment ratios. In many states the uniformity and equality provisions apply only to property taxes, leading to significant classification problems.  History  Property taxes in the United States originated during colonial times.See Ely, Richard T., Taxation in American Cities and Towns, 1888 (hereafter \\"Ely\\"), page 110-111, discussing property tax in Springfield, Mass. after 1655. Also see Hellerstein citing Jens P. Jensen, Property Taxation in the United States, 1931, referring to a 1634 Massachusetts property tax statute; New Jersey League of Municipalities \\"Short History of the New Jersey property Tax\\" (hereafter NJLM); and Fisher, Glen W., \\"History of Property Taxes in the United States ,\\" Wichita State University. By 1796, state and local governments in fourteen of the fifteen states taxed land, but only four taxed inventory (stock in trade). Delaware did not tax property, but rather the income from it. In some states, \\"all property, with a few exceptions, was taxed; in others, specific objects were named. Land was taxed in one state according to quantity, in another according to quality, and in a third not at all. Responsibility for the assessment and collection of taxes in some cases attached to the state itself; in others, to the counties or townships.\\" Vermont and North Carolina taxed land based on quantity, while New York and Rhode Island taxed land based on value. Connecticut taxed land based on type of use. Procedures varied widely.Ely, page 116-127. During the period from 1796 until the Civil War, a unifying principle developed: \\"the taxation of all property, movable and immovable, visible and invisible, or real and personal, as we say in America, at one uniform rate.\\"Ely, page 131. NJLM indicates that New Jersey adopted uniform assessments based on actual value in 1851, and the concept was added to the New Jersey constitution in 1875. During this period, property taxes came to be assessed based on value. This was introduced as a requirement in many state constitutions. After the Civil War, intangible property, including corporate stock, took on far greater importance. Taxing jurisdictions found it difficult to find and tax this sort of property. This trend led to the introduction of alternatives to the property tax (such as income and sales taxes) at the state level. Property taxes remained a major source of government revenue below the state level. Hard times during the Great Depression led to high delinquency rates and reduced property tax revenues.Fisher, supra. Also during the 1900s, many jurisdictions began exempting certain property from taxes. Many jurisdictions exempted homes of war veterans. After World War II, some states replaced exemptions with \\"circuit breaker\\" provisions limiting increases in value for residences. Various economic factors have led to taxpayer initiatives in various states to limit property tax. California Proposition 13 (1978) amended the California Constitution to limit aggregate property taxes to 1% of the \\"full cash value of such property.\\" It also limited the increase in assessed value of real property to an inflation factor that was limited to 2% per year. Policy issues There are numerous policy issues regarding property tax, including: * Fairness, or lack thereof * Progressivity, or lack thereof * Administrability/socialist redistribution of taxpayer funds * Allodial title vs. true ownership of property In spite of these issues, many aspects of the property tax, and the reliance of local governments on it as a principal source of revenue, have remained much the same since colonial times. Opinions on property tax= Sprawl  In the absence of urban planning policies, property tax on real estate changes the incentives for developing land, which in turn affects land use patterns. One of the main concerns is whether or not it encourages urban sprawl. The market value of undeveloped real estate reflects a property's current use as well as its development potential. As a city expands, relatively cheap and undeveloped lands (such as farms, ranches, private conservation parks, etc.) increase in value as neighboring areas are developed into retail, industrial, or residential units. This raises the land value, which increases the property tax that must be paid on agricultural land, but does not increase the amount of revenue per land area available to the owner. This, along with a higher sale price, increases the incentive to rent or sell agricultural land to developers. On the other hand, a property owner who develops a parcel must thereafter pay a higher tax, based on the value of the improvements. This makes the development less attractive than it would otherwise be. Overall, these effects result in lower density development, which tends to increase sprawl. Attempts to reduce the impact of property taxes on sprawl include: * Land value taxation - This method separates the value of a given property into its actual components ‚Äî land value and improvement value. A gradually lower and lower tax is levied on the improvement value and a higher tax is levied on the land value to insure revenue-neutrality. A similar method is known as split-rate taxation. * Current-use valuation - This method assesses the value of a given property based only upon its current use. Much like land value taxation, this reduces the effect of city encroachment. * Conservation easements - The property owner adds a restriction to the property prohibiting future development. This effectively removes the development potential as a factor in the property taxes. * Exemptions - Exempting favored classes of real estate (such as farms, ranches, cemeteries or private conservation parks) from the property tax altogether or assessing their value at a minimal amount (for example, $1 per acre). * Forcing higher density housing - In the Portland, Oregon area, for example, local municipalities are often forced to accept higher density housing with small lot sizes. This is governed by a multi-county development control board, in Portland's case Metro. * Urban growth boundary or Green belt - Government declares some land undevelopable until a date in the future. This forces regional development back into the urban core, increasing density but also land and housing prices. It may also cause development to skip over the restricted-use zone, to occur in more distant areas, or to move to other cities.  Distributional  Property tax has been shown to be regressive (that is, to fall disproportionately on those of lower income) under certain circumstances, because of its impact on particular low-income/high-asset groups such as pensioners and farmers. Because these persons have high-assets accumulated over time, they have a high property tax liability, although their realized income is low. Therefore, a larger proportion of their income goes to paying the tax. In areas with speculative land appreciation (such as California in the 1970s and 2000s), there may be little or no relationship between property taxes and a homeowner's ability to pay them short of selling the property. This issue was a common argument used by supporters of such measures as California Proposition 13 or Oregon Ballot Measure 5; some economists have even called for the abolition of property taxes altogether, to be replaced by income taxes, consumption taxes such as Europe's VAT, or a combination of both. Others, however, have argued that property taxes are broadly progressive, since people of higher incomes are disproportionately likely to own more valuable property. In addition, while nearly all households have some income, nearly a third of households own no real estate. Moreover, the most valuable properties are owned by corporations not individuals. Hence, property is more unevenly distributed than income. It has been suggested that these two beliefs are not incompatible ‚Äî it is possible for a tax to be progressive in general but to be regressive in relation to minority groups. However, although not direct, and not likely one-to-one, property renters can be subject to property taxes as well. If the tax reduces the supply of housing units, then it will increase the rental price. In this way, the owner's cost of taxation is passed on to the renter (occupant). = Progressive policies = As property increases in value the possibility exists that new buyers might pay taxes on outdated values thus placing an unfair burden on the rest of the property owners. To correct this imbalance municipalities periodically revalue property. Revaluation produces an up-to-date value to be used in determination of the tax rate necessary to produce the required tax levy. A consequence of this is that existing owners are reassessed as well as new owners and thus are required to pay taxes on property the value of which is determined by market forces, such as gentrification in low income areas of a city. In an effort to relieve the frequently large tax burdens on existing owners, particularly those with fixed incomes such as the elderly and those who have lost their jobs, communities have introduced exemptions. In some states, laws provide for exemptions (typically called homestead exemptions) and/or limits on the percentage increase in tax, which limit the yearly increase in property tax so that owner-occupants are not \\"taxed out of their homes\\". Generally, these exemptions and ceilings are available only to property owners who use their property as their principal residence. Homestead exemptions generally cannot be claimed on investment properties and second homes. When a homesteaded property changes ownership, the property tax often rises sharply and the property's sale price may become the basis for new exemptions and limits available to the new owner-occupant. Homestead exemptions increase the complexity of property tax collection and sometimes provide an easy opportunity for people who own several properties to benefit from tax credits to which they are not entitled. Since there is no national database that links home ownership with Social Security numbers, landlords sometimes gain homestead tax credits by claiming multiple properties in different states, and even their own state, as their \\"principal residence\\", while only one property is truly their residence. In 2005, several US Senators and Congressmen were found to have erroneously claimed \\"second homes\\" in the greater Washington, D.C. area as their \\"principal residences\\", giving them property tax credits to which they were not entitled. Undeserved homestead exemption credits became so ubiquitous in the state of Maryland that a law was passed in the 2007 legislative session to require validation of principal residence status through the use of a social security number matching system. The bill passed unanimously in the Maryland House of Delegates and Senate and was signed into law by the Governor.http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal- te.md.tax15dec15,0,1764841.story (broken link) The fairness of property tax collection and distribution is a hotly debated topic. Some people feel school systems would be more uniform if the taxes were collected and distributed at a state level, thereby equalizing the funding of school districts. Others are reluctant to have a higher level of government determine the rates and allocations, preferring to leave the decisions to government levels closer to the people. In Rhode Island efforts are being made to modify revaluation practices to preserve the major benefit of property taxation, the reliability of tax revenue, while providing for what some view as a correction of the unfair distribution of tax burdens on existing owners of property. The Supreme Court has held that Congress can directly tax land ownership so long as the tax is apportioned among the states based upon representation/population. In an apportioned land tax, each state would have its own rate of taxation sufficient to raise its pro-rata share of the total revenue to be financed by a land tax. So, for example, if State A has 5% of the population, the State A would collect and remit to the federal government such tax revenue that equals 5% of the revenue sought. Such an apportioned tax on land had been used on many occasions up through the Civil War. Indirect taxes on the transfer of land are permitted without apportionment: in the past, this has taken the form of requiring revenue stamps to be affixed to deeds and mortgages, but these are no longer required by federal law. Under the Internal Revenue Code, the government realizes a substantial amount of revenue from income taxes on capital gains from the sale of land and in estate taxes from the passage of property (including land) upon the death of its owner. Milton Friedman noted that \\"[T]he property tax is one of the least bad taxes, because it's levied on something that cannot be produced ‚Äî that part that is levied on the land\\". A 2008 analysis from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was consistent with Friedman's opinion; examining the effect of various types of taxes on economic growth, it found that property taxes \\"seem[ed] to be the most growth-friendly, followed by consumption taxes and then by personal income taxes.\\"Arnold, Jens.

Jaillot) The County of Virneburg was a territory of the Holy Roman Empire in the region of the Eifel in present-day Rhineland-Palatinate.  History  The Counts of Virneburg first appear in the 11th century as witnesses in documents. The administrative centre of the county and family seat was the eponymous Virneburg Castle. The history of the county is closely associated with that of the Counts Palatine of the Rhine, which until the 13th century in the so- called Pellenz possessed important lordship rights. Later the Counts of Virneburg were fief holders of the Counts Palatine. The further history of the county is characterized by the war of the Archbishops of Cologne and Trier with the Counts Palatine and the Virneburgern about the predominance in this region. In 1288 Ruprecht II took part as tactical commander of the Brabanter in the Battle of Worringen. In 1306 Count Ruprecht bought half of the County of Wied from Siegfried of Eppstein, who had inherited this region. The share fell already in the 14th century to Wilhelm of Braunsberg. With Heinrich II of Cologne and Heinrich III of Mainz the Virneburger provided in the 14th century two archbishops. In the 14th century various lordship rights went lost to the Trierer Archbishop Baldwin of Luxembourg. He took advantage of financial difficulties of the Virneburger. In 1419 Phillip of Virneburg married Katharina of Saffenburg, wherewith parts of the County of Neuenahr and the Lordship of Saffenburg reached the family of Virneburg. In 1445 a division took place. In 1545 the Counts of Virneburg died out with the death of Kuno of Virneburg. The true heirs were the Counts of Manderscheid. However, a large part of the estate was lost. In 1592 the Virneburger heritage fell to L√∂wenstein-Wertheim. Until the end of the 18th century, the county remained as a fiefdom of the Electorate of Trier in the possession of the Counts of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Virneburg. Under French control in 1798, canton Virneburg was built out of the county, a canton which belonged to Arrondissement Bonn in the D√©partement de Rhin-et-Moselle.  Location and territory  The possessions of the Counts of Virneburg originated from a region around the castles Virneburg and Monreal and numerous other fiefdoms. Particularly important were the courts of Pellenz. They originated from the \\"great Pellenz\\", a region around Mendig, and the \\"little Pellenz\\", a region around M√ºnstermaifeld. To the enlarged Pellenz-courts belonged the Beltheimer court, the court Bubenheim and the court Lonnig. In the end of the 18th century belonged to the County of Virneburg the flecken Virneburg and the locations of Anschau, Arbach, Baar (Ober-, Mittel- and Niederbaar), Bereborn, Ditscheid, Freilingen (presently a part of Baar), Hirten, Kolverath, Lind, Lirstal, Luxem, Mannebach, Mimbach (presently a part of Anschau), M√ºnk, Niederelz (presently a part of Weiler), Nitz, Oberelz, Retterath, Wanderath (presently a part of Baar), Weiler and Welcherath.

In its original form it is a torpedo-shaped cylinder with a length of 2.5 metres (8.2 ft), developed to transport trapped miners through boreholes after mining accidents. It does not contain explosive: it was called a \\"bomb\\" because of its shape. The Dahlbusch Bomb was developed in May 1955 at the Zeche Dahlbusch coal mine in Gelsenkirchen in Germany's Ruhr area to rescue three miners. Thirty-four-year-old engineer Eberhard Au sketched it on a leaflet.Die Dahlbusch Bombe. Der Spiegel 46/1963. 1963-11-13. Au, who never applied for a patent, was quoted as saying \\"the main thing is, the lads get out\\".[1] Its distinguishing feature was the small diameter of only 38.5 centimetres (15.2 in), which allows miners to be evacuated through significantly smaller boreholes than using other evacuation devices, and whose shape also helps in raising and lowering the device across long distances. At Zeche Dahlbusch, the device was successfully used to rescue three miners, trapped at a depth of 855 metres (2,805 ft) after a mine collapse, through a vertical borehole drilled 42 metres (138 ft) from the next-higher mine level. The 15.2-inch diameter would need its passenger to have his shoulders hunched up or his arms vertical above his head, and not be obese or very muscular. The device was used again on 1956 and 1957, but gained further prominence on 7 November 1963, when eleven miners were rescued after two weeks trapped at a depth of 58 metres (190 ft) in the iron ore mine in Lengede, Germany, in what is known in Germany now as the Wunder von Lengede (\\"Lengede Miracle\\").

Its mission is to improve human health and well- being through basic research, education, and development ventures that transform discoveries into cures.MDI Biological Laboratory Website In 2013, the Laboratory was designated a Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) by the National Institutes of Health, which awarded the Laboratory a grant of $13 million over five years to expand the institution‚Äôs research program.MDI Biological Laboratory COBRE Website The MDI Biological Laboratory has a full-time staff of 63, and will offer 23 research training courses in 2014. Research Scientists at the MDI Biological Laboratory focus on studying regeneration and aging to promote longer, healthier lives. They are developing new approaches for treating and preventing heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, as well as Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, and Huntington‚Äôs diseases. To do so, they pick the most efficient, effective, and economical model organism for each biological question, knowing that our common evolutionary heritage means that humans share a remarkable percentage of our genome with organisms that appear to be completely different than humans.MDI Biological Laboratory Website For example, MDI Biological Laboratory scientists study the tiny nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, with a lifespan of two to three weeks, to study genes that regulate aging and lifespan. Those same genes are present in humans. They study organisms such as zebrafish and salamanders that are naturally able to regenerate diseased or damaged tissue, organs, and limbs using the same genetic mechanisms found in humans. However, for some reason those mechanisms have been turned off in most mammals. MDI Biological Laboratory scientists are learning how to reactivate these mechanisms to promote healing in humans.MDI Biological Laboratory Website In 2013 scientists at the MDI Biological Laboratory formed a spin-off company, Novo Biosciences, to explore the potential of MSI-1436, a naturally occurring compound, to speed wound healing and tissue repair in mammals.MDI Biological Laboratory Website This research was covered by Scientific American in an April 2019 feature article.https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-drug-shows-an- astonishing-ability-to-regenerate-damaged-hearts-and-other-body-parts/ Education and workforce training Education is an important part of the MDI Biological Laboratory‚Äôs mission. Students at all levels, from middle school to medical school, receive hands-on research training that prepares them for the 21st century workforce. In 2014, the Laboratory offered 25 one- or two-week- long courses for Maine undergraduates, medical students, and scientific professionals. Academic year and summer fellowships are offered for high school and undergraduate students. These fellowships provide an extended opportunity for students to work directly with an MDI Biological Laboratory scientist and gain real-world research experience.MDI Biological Laboratory WebsiteMDI Biological Laboratory Website The MDI Biological Laboratory leads the Maine INBRE or IDeA Network for Biomedical Research Excellence, a collaborative network of three Maine research institutions and ten Maine colleges that is strengthening Maine's capacity to conduct competitive biomedical research. Since its founding in 2001, the INBRE program has brought more than $68 million into Maine in federal grants for the research and education programs it supports, as well as an additional $38 million in federal funding for research initiated under the INBRE grant. Half of all INBRE funds are distributed across Maine among INBRE partner institutions to support student research training and junior faculty. The program has trained more than 2,000 Maine students in state-of-the-art research methods. Over 90% of INBRE graduates pursue careers or advanced education in scientific or medical fields.MDI Biological Laboratory Website The 13 institutions participating in the Maine INBRE are the MDI Biological Laboratory as lead institution, The Jackson Laboratory, Bowdoin, Bates, and Colby Colleges, College of the Atlantic, the University of Maine, the University of Maine Honors College, and the University of Maine at Farmington, Fort Kent, Machias, and Presque Isle, and Southern Maine Community College.MDI Biological Laboratory Website IDeA and INBRE are programs administered and funded by the National Institutes of Health. Public and environmental programs Programs at the MDI Biological Laboratory help break down the barriers that often exist between science and the public. The Laboratory offers the MDI Science Caf√©s, Family Science Night, Art Meets Science program, and the Community Environmental Health Laboratory (CEHL).MDI Biological Laboratory Website The Community Environmental Health Laboratory (CEHL) works to identify, locate, and remedy threats to public health and the clean waters on and around Mount Desert Island by putting science in the hands of community volunteers, students, and teachers. Every CEHL project relies on volunteer efforts from students and community members, and involves community education. Current projects at CEHL include the study and restoration of eelgrass beds in Frenchman Bay, eelgrass-based education and outreach in middle and high schools, swim beach water quality monitoring, and phytoplankton monitoring.MDI Biological Laboratory Website CEHL's director, Jane Disney, Ph.D., is the recipient of numerous awards for her community-based science efforts, including the SeaWorld Busch Gardens Environmental Excellence Award (1998), the Governor‚Äôs Award for Environmental Excellence (2000), and the Gulf of Maine Council Visionary Award (2007). She has been instrumental in the forming of the Frenchman Bay Partners, a broad-based stakeholder group committed to a sustainable future for Frenchman Bay.MDI Biological Laboratory Website Human and environmental sustainability summits The MDI Biological Laboratory launched the Human and Environmental Sustainability Summits in 2013 as part of its focus on improving human and environmental health and on using science to solve real world problems. The summits bring together a diverse group of stakeholders to develop actionable solutions to critical problems in environmental and public health. In 2014, forty scientists, engineers, health officials, consumer advocates, food industry representatives, and educators addressed the global problem of arsenic in food and drinking water.MDI Biological Laboratory Website ReferencesExternal links * Category:Biological research institutes Category:Research institutes in the United States Category:Mount Desert Island Category:Bar Harbor, Maine Category:Education in Hancock County, Maine Category:Companies based in Hancock County, Maine ","title":"MDI Biological Laboratory"},{"id":"29176405","text":"Institute of Economic Development (IED) is a UK representative body for economic development and regeneration professionals.

He got the civilian award \\"Padma Shree\\" on the eve of Republic Day, 2018. A graduate from IIT Kanpur (1975 batch), Arvind Kumar Gupta took a year's study leave from TELCO (in 1978) to work with the grassroots village science teaching programme for children in the tribal district of Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh called Hoshangabad Science Teaching Programme. While there, he developed many useful low-cost teaching/science teaching aids using locally available materials. The possibilities of using ordinary things for doing science and recycling modern junk into joyous products appealed immensely to children. Arvind Gupta's first book, Matchstick Models and other Science Experiments, was translated into 12 Indian languages by various Popular Science groups and sold more than half a million copies. Gupta has conducted workshops in over 2000 schools and has won many national and international awards. As a student in the 1970 s in Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Gupta became a socialist in belief but eschewed action- less discourse; he stated that instead he \\"placed more faith in small positive action than empty rhetoric.\\" Gupta began his social service by teaching the children of the mess staff who had no opportunities for formal education. Gandhian in outlook, Arvind Gupta participated in the Hoshangabad Science Teaching Programme (HSTP) in Madhya Pradesh in 1978. While he was there he developed his idea of creating simple toys and educational experiments using locally available materials as well as items usually thrown as trash. These simple toys, he found, fascinated children and Gupta went on to make these as the hallmark of his movement of popularising science. His first book, \\"Matchstick Models and other Science Experiments\\" was reprinted in 12 languages. Gupta's website holds instructions, including short video clips on YouTube, in a number of languages, for making hundreds of improvised toys, which he makes available freely without copyright restrictions. Gupta draws inspiration from a number of people, including Gautama Buddha, George Washington Carver and his mother. His popular TED Talk: Turning Trash into Toys for learning gives an insight into his work and philosophy. This talk was among the 10 best TED talks compiled by Sir Ken Robinson and Sugata Mitra's 5 favorite education talks. Awards and recognition He has won several awards for his lifelong efforts at popularizing science and in designing teaching aids for young children. These include: * Padma Shri by Gov of India in Republic Day 2018 honours list (2018). * Dr. Narendra Dabholkar Memorial Award by the Maharashtra Foundation (2018). * Distinguished Math Teacher's Award, Association of Maths Teachers of India (AMTI) (2016). * 50 Most Talented Social Innovators Award, World CSR Day (2015). * IBN-Lokmat Prerna Award (2014). * The Dadhichi Award given by The Education Society, Ambarnath, Maharashtra (2012). * Sri Chandrasekarendra Saraswati National Eminence Award conferred by the South Indian Education Society, Mumbai (2010). * The TWAS (Third World Academy of Sciences) Regional Prize for Public Understanding and Popularization of Science (2010). * The C.

Rabbi Garber was born in the United States and is a graduate of Ner Israel Rabbinical College in Baltimore, MD. The yeshiva had 16 rabbis and over 5 students. It was a combination of a regular yeshiva of the Lithuanian type and a yeshiva for those who require additional guidance. The yeshiva accepted even students who have limited knowledge of Judaism.

Although mainly American, most English-speaking countries are accepted. Learning was done with original texts in Hebrew or Aramaic, though the lessons were given in English.

The project was launched in July 2009 as the first of three Grand Challenges of the NIH's Blueprint for Neuroscience Research. On September 15, 2010, the NIH announced that it would award two grants: $30 million over five years to a consortium led by Washington University in Saint Louis and the University of Minnesota, with strong contributions from Oxford University (FMRIB) and $8.5 million over three years to a consortium led by Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of California Los Angeles. The goal of the Human Connectome Project is to build a \\"network map\\" (connectome) that will shed light on the anatomical and functional connectivity within the healthy human brain, as well as to produce a body of data that will facilitate research into brain disorders such as dyslexia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. WU-Minn-Oxford consortium The WU-Minn-Oxford consortium developed improved MRI instrumentation, image acquisition and image analysis methods for mapping the connectivity in the human brain at spatial resolutions significantly better than previously available; using these methods, WU-Minn-Oxford consortium collected a large amount of MRI and behavioral data on 1,200 healthy adults ‚Äî twin pairs and their siblings from 300 families - using a special 3 Tesla MRI instrument. In addition, it scanned 184 subjects from this pool at 7 Tesla, with higher spatial resolution. The data are being analyzed to show the anatomical and functional connections between parts of the brain for each individual, and will be related to behavioral test data. Comparing the connectomes and genetic data of genetically identical twins with fraternal twins will reveal the relative contributions of genes and environment in shaping brain circuitry and pinpoint relevant genetic variation. The maps will also shed light on how brain networks are organized. Using a combination of non-invasive imaging technologies, including resting-state fMRI and task-based functional MRI, MEG and EEG, and diffusion MRI, the WU-Minn will be mapping connectomes at the macro scale ‚Äî mapping large brain systems that can be divided into anatomically and functionally distinct areas, rather than mapping individual neurons. Dozens of investigators and researchers from nine institutions have contributed to this project. Research institutions include: Washington University in Saint Louis, the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research at the University of Minnesota, Oxford University, Saint Louis University, Indiana University, D'Annunzio University of Chieti‚ÄìPescara, Ernst Strungmann Institute, Warwick University, Advanced MRI Technologies, and the University of California at Berkeley. The data that results from this research is being made publicly available in an open-source web-accessible neuroinformatics platform. MGH/Harvard-UCLA consortium The MGH/Harvard- UCLA consortium will focus on optimizing MRI technology for imaging the brain‚Äôs structural connections using diffusion MRI, with a goal of increasing spatial resolution, quality, and speed. Diffusion MRI, employed in both projects, maps the brain's fibrous long distance connections by tracking the motion of water. Water diffusion patterns in different types of cells allow the detection of different types of tissues. Using this imaging method, the long extensions of neurons, called white matter, can be seen in sharp relief. The new scanner built at the MGH Martinos Center for this project is \\"4 to 8 times as powerful as conventional systems, enabling imaging of human neuroanatomy with greater sensitivity than was previously possible.\\" The scanner has a maximum gradient strength of 300 mT/m and a slew rate of 200 T/m/s, with b-values tested up to 20,000. For comparison, a standard gradient is 45 mT/m, with a b-value of 700.Improving SNR in high b-value diffusion imaging using Gmax = 300 mT/m human gradients, Proc. Intl. Soc. Mag. Reson. Med. 20 (2012) 2738 Behavioral testing and measurement To understand the relationship between brain connectivity and behavior better, the Human Connectome Project will use a reliable and well-validated battery of measures that assess a wide range of human functions. The core of its battery is the tools and methods developed by the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral function.http://humanconnectome.org/about/project/behavioral- testing.html, Retrieved 2013-03-08  Research  The Human Connectome Project has grown into a large group of research teams. These teams make use of the style of brain scanning developed by the Project. The studies usually include using large groups of participants, scanning many angles of participants' brains, and carefully documenting the location of the structures in each participant's brain. Studies affiliated with the Human Connectome Project are currently cataloged by the Connectome Coordination Facility. The studies fall into three categories: Healthy Adult Connectomes, Lifespan Connectome Data, and Connectomes Related to Human Disease. Under each of these categories are research groups working on specific questions.  Healthy Adult Connectomes  The Human Connectome Project Young Adult study made data on the brain connections of 1100 healthy young adults available to the scientific community. Scientists have used data from the study to support theories about which areas of the brain communicate with one another. For example, one study used data from the project to show that the amygdala, a part of the brain essential for emotional processing, is connected to the parts of the brain that receive information from the senses and plan movement. Another study showed that healthy individuals who had a high tendency to experience anxious or depressed mood had fewer connections between the amygdala and a number of brain areas related to attention.  Lifespan Connectome Data  There are currently four research groups collecting data on connections in the brains of populations other than young adults. The purpose of these groups is to determine ordinary brain connectivity during infancy, childhood, adolescence, and aging. Scientists will use the data from these research groups in the same manner in which they have used data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult study.  Connectomes Related to Human Disease  Fourteen research groups investigate how connections in the brain change during the course of a particular disease. Four of the groups focus on Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Alzheimer's disease and dementia are diseases that begin during aging. Memory loss and cognitive impairment mark the progression of these diseases. While scientists consider Alzheimer's disease to be a disease with a specific cause, dementia actually describes symptoms which could be attributed to a number of causes. Two other research groups investigate how diseases that disrupt vision change connectivity in the brain. Another four of the research groups focus on anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, psychological disorders that result in abnormal emotional regulation. Two more of the research groups focus on the effects of psychosis, a symptom of some psychological disorders in which an individual perceives reality differently than others do. One of the teams researches epilepsy, a disease characterized by seizures. Finally, one research team is documenting the brain connections of the Amish people, a religious and ethnic group that has high rates of some psychological disorders. Although theories have been put forth about the way brain connections change in the diseases under investigation, many of these theories have been supported by data from healthy populations. For example, an analysis of the brains of healthy individuals supported the theory that individuals with anxiety disorders and depression have less connectivity between their emotional centers and the areas that govern attention. By collecting data specifically from individuals with these diseases, researchers hope to have a more certain idea of how brain connections in these individuals change over time.  Status  The project has yet to be officially declared complete.

Influenced by Albert Haueisen, Zureich was best known for his city representations, decorative motives, industrial etchings, illustrations, and satirical designs. Life and career From 1922 to 1926, Zureich studied painting and graphics at the Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe with professors Hermann Gohler, Wilhelm Schnarrenberger, August Froh, Friedrich Fehr, and Walter Conz. From 1934 to 1937, he was a master pupil of graphics with professor Hermann Kupferschmid. Zureich‚Äôs honor awards include the 1932 state prizes: Preis im Saar-Wettbewerb (Saar Competition prize) and the Preis Ausschmuckung der Stadt Karksruhe (Decoration of Karlsruhe prize). Zureich‚Äôs talent for searching character study is obvious from the pencil drawings Zwei Damen und Balkon. From 1939 to 1945, he served in Lapland as a war picture correspondent. After the war, he did freelance artist work in Karlsruhe from 1946 to 1949, which was predominantly pencil drawings and watercolors of city scenes, traditional costumes, greeting cards, and large scale etchings for the steel industry which included blast furnaces, bridge construction, shipbuilding, and refineries. Franz Zureich worked as a freelance employee of the Krupp and Demag companies, from 1949 to 1981.His artwork Krupp: 15000 t-Presse was published in the Leipziger Illustrierte Zeitung (Leipziger Illustrated Newspaper), one of Germany‚Äôs most prestigious weekly news magazines. His artwork Demag: Giesspfannen beim fullen der kokillen (Demag: foundry ladles during fill the mold) was exhibited at the House of German Art in Munich. He also made large-scale etchings of all work in the building of hydro-electric power plants at Waldshut and Bad Sackingen, built for Schluchseewerk AG, operators of the largest hydro-electric power plant complexes in Germany. Zureich made etchings of the movable weirs and dikes around the level reach of the Iffezheim Rhine River Dam hydro-electric power station put into operation in 1978. Iffezheim is one of the largest hydropower stations in Europe. He had a workshop in Baden-Baden, where he continued to produce art until his death in 1992.
