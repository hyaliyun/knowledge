Early life  William Stewart was born in 1653, the son of Sir Alexander Stewart, 2nd Baronet, of Ramelton. His family was from Donegal, Ulster Scots, and Protestant. Career He was appointed Master-General of the Ordnance and colonel of a regiment of foot. In 1682 Charles II created him Viscount Mountjoy and Baron Stewart in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1686 Mountjoy served the Holy League (1684) in Hungary at the siege of Buda, where he was twice dangerously wounded. On his return to Ireland he was made a brigadier-general. Macaulay styled him \\"a brave soldier, an accomplished scholar.\\" In Dublin he was the centre of a small circle of learned and ingenious men, who had, under his presidency, formed themselves into a Royal Society. In 1685 Charles II died and King James II acceded to the throne. James started replacing Protestants in Ireland with Catholics. In 1687 James appointed a new viceroy: Richard Talbot, Earl Tyrconnell. In 1688 James asked Tyrconnell for good Irish troops to defend England. These troops left in September and October 1688. Tyrconnell felt it necessary to replace these troops and decided to raise four new regiments one for each Irish province. The regiment for Ulster was to be raised by the Earl of Antrim, a Catholic nobleman of Scottish origin. Antrim, already in his seventies, hired 1,200 Scottish mercenaries (i.e. redshanks), making sure they were all Catholics. The unit should have been ready by 20 November, but delays occurred. In 1688, Mountjoy commanded the regiment stationed in Derry. During the Glorious Revolution he stayed loyal to James while most Protestants declared for the Prince of Orange. Nevertheless, Tyrconnell did not trust Mountjoy and sought to garrison Derry with more reliable troops. On 23 November 1688 Tyrconnell ordered Mountjoy to march to Dublin for embarking to England. He then sent Alexander MacDonnell, Earl of Antrim to occupy Derry with his newly raised regiment, but when Antrim eventually reached the city on 7 December, he found the gates shut against him by the 13 apprentice boys. This was the beginning of the Protestant revolt in Ulster. Tyrconnell then sent Mountjoy back to Derry. Mountjoy succeeded to strike a deal with the town on 21 December, and two of the companies of his regiment, consisting entirely of Protestants, were let into the town. Mountjoy became governor of Derry but soon delegated the office to Robert Lundy. Despite of this success, Tyrconnell decided to get rid of Mountjoy. He asked him to accept a diplomatic mission to France together with Stephen Rice. After some hesitations, Mountjoy agreed and he and Rice left for France on 10 January 1689. However, Rice had secret letters from Tyrconnell for Louis XIV that insinuated that Mountjoy should be arrested. He was accordingly thrown into the Bastille and kept there until 1692. While he was imprisoned, the Parliament of Ireland passed a bill of attainder requiring Stewart and two to three thousand others to report to Dublin for sentencing; Stewart in particular was directed to break out of the Bastille in order to report, under pain of being drawn and quartered.\\" In April 1692 Montjoy was exchanged for Richard Hamilton. On his release from the Bastille, he did indeed switch loyalties and joined William's army in Flanders as a General, losing his life at the battle of Steenkerque on 3 August 1692. Family He married the Honourable Mary Coote, daughter of Richard Coote, 1st Baron Coote. They had six sons and two daughters, including: * Sir William Stewart, 2nd Viscount Mountjoy (1675‚Äì1728), who married Anne Boyle, daughter of Murrough Boyle, 1st Viscount Blesington, on 23 November 1696. * Alexander Stewart, who had one daughter, Anne Stewart, his sole heiress. * Mary Stewart (c. 1677‚Äì1765), who first married Archibald Preston (1672‚Äì1703). After his death, she married Vice Admiral George Forbes, 3rd Earl of Granard (1685‚Äì1765). * Catherine Stewart, who married Arthur Davys (died 1733), an Irish Member of Parliament, representing Carrickfergus in the Irish House of Commons. * Charles Stewart (1681‚Äì1741), who became an officer in the Royal Navy and a Member of Parliament On his death in 1692, his title passed to his eldest son William. Through his eldest son William, he was the grandfather of five boys and four girls, including William Stewart, 1st Earl of Blessington and 3rd Viscount Mountjoy (1709‚Äì1769). Through his daughter Mary, he was the grandfather of two from her first marriage, including Jane Preston (c. 1690‚Äì1746) who married Alexander Breckenridge (1686‚Äì1743), Col. John Preston (1699‚Äì1747), and three more children from her second marriage, including George Forbes, 4th Earl of Granard who married his cousin Letitia, daughter of Arthur Davys of Hampstead.

A line of apartment buildings will be between Dronning Eufemias gate and the Oslofjord, where the new Oslo Opera House has already been built. Planning and description The Barcode buildings occupy areas B10 through B13 of the general plan for the Bj√∏rvik neighborhood that was adopted by the Oslo City Council in 2003--in the Bispevika section, east of the mouth of the Akerselva River.Byutvikling i Bj√∏rvika - Bispevika - Lohavn: Reguleringsforslag til bystyret, Oslo kommune 2003, pp. 12 (intended nature of area after development), 18 (map), 24 (agreed specifications) retrieved May 14, 2010.Clearer map: Reguleringskart, Fjord City, November 2009 , retrieved May 14, 2010.The city chose between four alternatives: Storg√•rdskvartaler (relatively massive buildings); Bykode (relatively low-rise buildings); Barcode light (thinner buildings); and Barcode. A gallery of renderings of each is at Nye Bj√∏rvika, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation , retrieved May 18, 2010. The general plan was based on an international competition to plan the new Bj√∏rvika, which was won by Dark Architects (of Oslo), a-lab, and MVRDV (of Rotterdam). The general plan specified five high-rise buildings, the tallest in area B11, closest to the Station Common (a new public square and bridge giving access to Central StationStasjonsallmenningen, Bj√∏rvika Utvikling , retrieved May 16, 2010.), rising to 100 m above sea level (\\"contour 100\\") and having approximately 24 floors. The other towers were specified to be lower in height: 70 m in area B13, 78 m in B10, and 81 m in B12.Reguleringsforslag 2003, p. 116.

The Barcode has been planned as a row of different buildings with views between them. The unbuilt spaces between the buildings are to be at least 12 m wide. Several of the buildings will have fewer floors facing the fjord than the railway. The buildings are long and narrow (for example, DnB building B is 21 m wide and 105 long). The stated purpose of choosing such dissimilar building forms is to avoid a massive wall between the fjord and the buildings behind the Barcode, and that the Barcode principle, with segmented construction, will contribute to openness, light penetration, and transparency in the built-up area. The buildings will have a shared basement, entered from Trelastgata.

The architecture has been described as chaotic, as part of a trend of spectacular buildings, which within a few years will be seen as having disfigured the city.

Early life Paul Feiler was born in 1918 in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany into a cultivated family of lawyers, doctors and liberal politicians; his father was a professor of dentistry. He was educated in Zwolle in the Netherlands and then at Canford School in Dorset, England. His parents in 1936 moved to London: his father established himself as a dentist in Harley Street. Paul studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London 1936-1939 with artists such as Patrick Heron, Bryan Wynter and Kenneth Armitage. As an enemy alien in 1939, although thoroughly anglicised, he was interned on the Isle of Man and then in Canada. On his return to England in 1941, he was an arts teacher at Eastbourne College, which had been evacuated to Radley College in Oxford. After World War II, he taught art at the West of England College of Art in Bristol: he became the head of painting there in 1960. In 1975 he moved to the disused chapel in Kerris near Newlyn in Cornwall where he would live until his death. Artistic career Feiler‚Äôs first solo exhibition was a sell-out at the Redfern Gallery in London in 1953. He had four more exhibitions there in the 1950s. The Obelisk Gallery in Washington DC in 1954 had the first of several solo exhibitions across America. Feiler has paintings in many art galleries worldwide including the Tate St Ives, Victoria and Albert Museum, National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris, Bristol Art Gallery, Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, and Kettles Yard in Cambridge. The Tate St Ives had two large solo exhibitions of his work in 1995 and 2005. He worked in his Kerris studio every day until his death in 2013 aged 95. Paul Feiler married the artist June Miles in 1945: they had two daughters and a son ‚Äì the marriage was later dissolved. In 1970 Feiler married the artist Catharine Armitage: they had twin sons.

In addition to teaching, writing, and conducting research, Farid acts as a consultant for non-profits, government agencies, and news organizations. He is the author of the book Photo Forensics. Career Farid specializes in image analysis and human perception. He has been called the \\"father\\" of digital image forensics by NOVA scienceNOW. He is the recipient of a 2006 Guggenheim Fellowship and a 2002 Sloan Fellowship for his work in the field. Farid was named a lifetime fellow of the National Academy of Inventors in 2016. University positions Farid is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and the School of Information. He is also a member of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Lab, the Center for Innovation in Vision and Optics, and the Vision Science program. Prior to joining Berkeley, Farid was the Albert Bradley 1915 Third Century Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College and former chair of Dartmouth's Neukom Institute for Computational Science. Farid was well-known at Dartmouth for teaching the college's introductory course on programming and computer science. Joseph Helble, dean of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, described Farid as a pioneer in the field of digital forensics. Farid joined Dartmouth's faculty in 1999. He remained at Dartmouth until 2019. Consulting and media appearances Farid has consulted for intelligence agencies, news organizations, courts, and scientific journals seeking to authenticate the validity of images.US Experts Confirmed Anwar as Man in Video, Court Told. This is critically important because graphics programs, such as Photoshop, are frequently used to crop and to label figures in scientific publications. Such manipulations can be used to alter or disguise the data. In 2009, after digitally analyzing a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald holding a rifle and newspaper, Farid published his findings concluding that \\"the photo almost certainly was not altered\\".Dartmouth Professor finds that iconic Oswald photo was not faked. 11/05/09. When the 2012 World Press Photo of the Year was alleged as being \\"fake\\", Farid spoke out against the allegation and criticized its underlying method, error level analysis. As of 2018, Farid was a consultant for the Associated Press, Reuters, The New York Times, and the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. PhotoDNA PhotoDNA is a system that uses robust hashing technology Farid worked on with Microsoft, which is \\"now widely used by Internet companies to stop the spread of content showing sexual exploitation or pornography involving children.\\" In late 2015, Farid completed improvements to PhotoDNA that made it capable of analyzing video and audio files besides still images. In 2016, Farid proposed that the technology could be used to stem the spread of terror-related imagery, but there was little interest shown initially by social media companies. In December 2016, Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft announced plans to use PhotoDNA to tackle extremist content such as terrorist recruitment videos or violent terrorist imagery, which was done e.g. to automatically remove al Qaeda videos. in Counter Extremism Project In June 2016, Farid, as a senior advisor to the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), unveiled a software tool for use by Internet and social media companies to \\"quickly find and eliminate extremist content used to spread and incite violence and attacks.\\" It functions similarly to PhotoDNA. To operationalize this new technology to combat extremism, Farid and CEP proposed the creation of a National Office for Reporting Extremism (NORex), which would house a comprehensive database of extremist content and function similar to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children . Truepic In the fall of 2018, Truepic acquired Farid's start-up, Fourandsix Technologies. Farid started Fourandsix Technologies with Kevin Connor, a former vice president at Adobe Systems. The first product released by Fourandsix was called Fourmatch. Fourmatch was designed to detect alterations of digital images. The primary use of Fourmatch was to check the authenticity of images introduced as evidence in court. As of February 2019, Farid was an advisor to Truepic. Education Farid received his undergraduate degree in computer science and applied mathematics from the University of Rochester in 1989. He earned a M.S. in computer science from SUNY/Albany in 1992. His Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania was awarded in 1997. In 1999, Farid completed a two-year post-doctoral program in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Family Farid is married to the neuroscientist Emily Cooper.

Based on Madame de La Fayette's 1678 novel La Princesse de Cl√®ves, the film is about a talented photographer who lands a lucrative job in Paris with a scandal-mongering tabloid and becomes romantically involved with an eccentric children's book publisher while resisting the sexual advances of another photographer. Filmed on location in Paris, Fidelity received the Cabourg Romantic Film Festival Award for Best Actress (Sophie Marceau) and the Golden Swann Award (Andrzej Zulawski). Plot Talented Canadian photographer Cl√©lia (Sophie Marceau) lands a lucrative job in Paris with a tabloid called La Verite run by scandal-mongerer Rupert MacRoi (Michel Subor). Cl√©lia's mother once dated MacRoi years ago while working as a cabaret singer. Once she became pregnant with Cl√©lia, she stopped seeing MacRoi and married Cl√©lia's father. Accompanying her daughter to Paris, she tells Cl√©lia that her strongest principle was honour, and encourages her to get married and settle down. In Paris Cl√©lia gives a television interview and talks about her two successful books of photography: a \\"study of absence\\" showing empty streets and deserted landscapes, and a study of fashion models without showing their faces. While walking the Paris streets taking photographs, Cl√©lia meets Cl√®ve (Pascal Greggory), a bumbling middle-aged children's book publisher who is preparing to marry MacRoi's wealthy daughter to bolster his flagging publishing house. Cl√®ve is immediately attracted to Cl√©lia and invites her back to his office where they make love. Afterwards, she meets Cl√®ve's brother Bernard, a Catholic bishop, and their father. At the La Verite offices, Cl√©lia finds most of her co-workers to be disillusioned and perverse‚Äîall knowing that they \\"earn their keep on dirt.\\" At her first assignment covering a hockey team that MacRoi recently purchased, Cl√©lia finds herself in the team's locker room surrounded by naked players celebrating their victory. MacRoi is there and after teasing her about her taking photos of the naked players asks if she'll join his family for a dinner party. Before she leaves, Cl√©lia has sex with one of the players. At MacRoi's dinner party, Cl√®ve loudly declares his love for Cl√©lia before his entire family, including his fianc√©, Geni√®vre MacRoi, the sister of Rupert MacRoi. Geni√®vre responds by calling off their wedding and hitting him. Later that evening, following MacRoi's announcement of the purchase of Cl√®ve's publishing company, Cl√®ve's father collapses and dies while his son and Cl√©lia look on. Cl√®ve asks Cl√©lia never to leave him. At the funeral, Cl√®ve confides in Cl√©lia his fears that MacRoi will not respect his family's publishing house now that he owns it, saying, \\"He massacres all that is upright and inneficient, delicate and noble.\\" Soon after, Cl√©lia and her mother move into Cl√®ve's house. He gives her his mother's engagement ring. In bed she reads lines from a W. H. Auden poem, \\"This like a dream keeps other time, and daytime is the loss of this, for time is inches and the heart's changes, where ghost has haunted lost and wanted. But this was never a ghost's endeavor, nor finished this, was ghost at ease, and till it pass love shall not near the sweetness here nor sorrow take his endless look.\\" Cl√©lia's first portfolio of photos for La Verite creates a sensation and she is congratulated by her colleagues‚Äîall except N√©mo (Guillaume Canet), a sexy young photographer who promptly propositions her upon their first encounter. In spite of her sexual attraction to N√©mo, Cl√©lia marries Cl√®ve in a ceremony marred somewhat by the presence of La Verite photographers and reporters, including N√©mo. After the wedding, N√©mo leaves his girlfriend, Ina (Ed√©a Darcque), a former African princess and Parisian prostitute whom he met investigating the illegal organ trade. He delivers his wedding photos to Cl√©lia's home, handing them to her mother. Upset at the intrusion, and suspecting her daughter is having an affair, Cl√©lia's mother collapses and soon dies. N√©mo continues to follow Cl√©lia, even taking photos of her in her house making love to her husband. Later she learns that N√©mo was given this assignment by MacRoi who is looking to find dirt on Cl√®ve. Although she continues to see N√©mo, Cl√©lia resolutely keeps to her wedding vows in the face of her suitor's continued advances. She travels by train to Normandy to attend a motorcycle event in which N√©mo is a participant. During the race N√©mo crashes, and Cl√©lia rushes to his side, revealing her feelings for him. At the celebration afterwards, N√©mo gets drunk and loud, talking about his investigation into the illegal organ trade and the shady International characters involved. Later that night he and Cl√©lia take the train back to Paris together. After N√©mo is attacked by a gang hired by the illegal organ traffickers, Cl√©lia asks him to show her the world he is investigating‚Äîa dark world of brutal human fighting to the death. Throughout their time together, N√©mo continues his advances toward her, but Cl√©lia resists. When she returns to her home, Cl√®ve is convinced she is having an affair, despite her promises that she's never lied to him and will never be unfaithful to him. After learning that his brother the bishop has run off with a married woman, Cl√®ve says he will join his brother in Plougastel-Daoulas in Brittany at The Happy Inn. After they make love Cl√®ve writes on the bathroom mirror, \\"Oh but what worm am I the victim of that you then unabashed did what I never wished confessed another love and I submissive, felt unwanted and went out?\\" After he leaves, Cl√©lia calls the offices of La Verite to inform them of Bishop Bernard's \\"love-nest\\" in Brittany, and soon the scandal erupts in the news. Cl√©lia watches the television coverage of his public humiliation. Cl√®ve does not return to his wife, and after sleeping with a transvestite prostitute, he calls La Verite asking that they track his wife who he believes is two-timing him. Meanwhile, Cl√©lia comes to N√©mo's house, where assassins hired by the organ traffickers blast the place with gunfire, but N√©mo and Cl√©lia are able to defend themselves and escape. Soon after, Cl√©lia attends a publicity session with MacRoi and a new partner. MacRoi presents N√©mo with a new expensive motorcycle for his work covering Cl√©lia. During the session, assassins again attempt to kill N√©mo, and during the attack both N√©mo and Cl√®ve are injured. MacRoi is killed by a shard of glass in his eye. After the funeral, MacRoi's daughter reorganizes the company, intending to continue the scandal-mongering. She also fires Cl√©lia, who later begs her husband to come back to her, but he will not reconsider. On their way out of the building he falls down a flight of steps and dies on the way to the hospital, with Cl√©lia at his side. At the funeral she avoids N√©mo's advances and leaves Paris. Sometime later, N√©mo is interviewed on television and talks about his new portfolio dedicated to Cl√©lia, who has disappeared. A few years later, while taking photographs in a monastery, Cl√©lia by chance sees the beginning of an English-language MacRoi Production film called The Princess of Cleve about her life, directed by N√©mo. She laughs as she discovers N√©mo's first name, Fernand, revealed in the opening credits. Before leaving the monastery, she places her wedding rings on a tree branch, while the ghost of her late husband looks on. Cl√©lia can only say, \\"Forgive me.\\" He smiles and retrieves the rings while she weeps.

History  (This section is primarily based on The Early Years of Stony Mountain Institution, by Marc Shaw, as found in the Newsletter of Canada's Penitentiary Museum, Summer of 2004.)FPM Newsletter, Summer, 2004. Retrieved 14 Dec 2010. In the years immediately following Confederation, Kingston Penitentiary was joined by several new institutions: St Vincent de Paul in 1873, British Columbia Penitentiary in 1878, and Dorchester in 1880. The establishment of the \\"Manitoba Penitentiary\\" (as it was known until it was renamed Stony Mountain Institution in 1972) was authorized by the young Canadian federal government in 1872. Lands were expropriated at Stony Mountain, some from Lower Fort Garry, where Sir Garnet Wolseley‚Äôs expeditionary force had been stationed as part of the effort to quell the first Riel (the \\"Red River\\") Rebellion of 1869-70. One of the members of that force, Samuel Lawrence Bedson (1842‚Äì91), did not return East following the Rebellion, but went on to become the first Warden of the new Penitentiary. The site's isolated location and lack of available building materials proved a challenge to the construction process. Stone for the windowsills and the corners was quarried at Lower Fort Garry, dressed and hauled overland during the winter. Timber was freighted from Ontario. A brick- making machine from St. Paul, Minnesota was employed in the manufacture of over 400,000 bricks from local clay. Despite efforts to avoid wastage due to difficulties in transporting materials, by the time the Penitentiary was completed in February, 1877, the final cost was $125,000‚Äîsome $9000 over budget. Some 60 tradesmen worked during the summer months and 25 stonemasons during the winters. In August 1877, with Lord and Lady Dufferin presiding, the Penitentiary was officially opened.Lord Dufferin. The Manitoba Historical Society. Retrieved 14 Dec 2010. 14 inmates, including a female \\"lunatic\\" comprised the original prison population transferred from the gaol at Lower Fort Garry. The original prison building was soon joined by a number of other buildings, as a period of rapid growth commenced. Structures such as stables, schoolhouse, staff quarters, hospital, chapels, forge and slaughterhouse were built. By 1885, some 44 cells were in use. Growth tended to be decentralized and the buildings came to occupy a large area. The original heating system, based on an English model, proved inadequate and the winter of 1877/78 proved very harsh for both staff and inmates. This situation was alleviated by the installation of a steam boiler in the summer of 1878. Due to the severity of the Manitoba winter, heating costs were $3000‚Äîconsiderably more than the identical British Columbia Penitentiary. To cope with this continuing expense, Warden Bedson negotiated with the CPR for a favourable shipping rate for coal. Bedson proved to be an innovative and progressive warden. A system was devised whereby prisoners could communicate their needs to guards without breaking the rule of silence. A four-foot white wand painted black on one end (for ordinary needs) and red on the other (for emergency use) was utilized. He also emerged as a noted prison reformer. He placed high value on religious and educational programs, and spiritual and educational needs were emphasized from the very beginning. Bedson also instituted an early system of inmate wages and parole. He also played a key role as a conservationist. An original investment of 13 head of buffalo grew substantially over the years and after a number of transfers of ownership, the herd was eventually relocated to Wood Buffalo National Reserve in Alberta. Early growth was ambitious, if dispersed. By 1912, perimeter wall construction had begun, and the numerous buildings were completely enclosed by 1922. The entrance to the institution was via the \\"South Gate\\" ‚Äì a handsome two-storey structure that controlled vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The need for additional cell space led to the construction of wings off the main cell-block throughout the 1920s. The building of a new facility to replace the original Administration building commenced in 1933. Due in part to the Depression and the Second World War, this building was left in a partially completed state for many years. The 1877 Administration Building and the South Gate, the last survivors of the original prison structures, were demolished in the late 1960s, and Stony Mountain‚Äôs origins are not readily apparent in the modern facility of today.

For that entire period, he was kept in segregation. This meant that he was in a cell that measured by for 23 hours a day, every day. No doubt this was done for his own protection. Yet the conditions were harsh and for some 97 days he lived a most difficult life. Indeed, during the one hour when he was let out of his cell for exercise and a shower there was no allotted place of exercise.

Hermann von Barth was born on 5 June 1845 at Eurasburg Castle. He initially studied law in Munich, where he was affiliated to the Corps Franconia. As a junior lawyer he began in 1868 in Berchtesgaden to explore the still largely unconquered Berchtesgaden Alps. From 1873 he studied natural sciences and, in 1876, deranged by fever, he committed suicide whilst on a research expedition in Africa. He died on 7 December 1876 in S√£o Paulo de Loanda, Portuguese Angola. Von Barth is most well known for his exploration of the Karwendel mountains. In summer 1870 he climbed, alone, 88 peaks (12 for the first time, including the Birkkarspitze, Kaltwasserkarspitze, Lalidererspitze, Gro√üe Seekarspitze, Grubenkarspitze, Dreizinkenspitze, Eastern Karwendelspitze, Vogelkarspitze, W√∂rner, Kuhkopf). In 1871 he switched to the Wetterstein mountains and was the first to climb many peaks there as well. By 1869 he had explored the Allg√§u Alps, climbing 44 summits, 3 of which were previously unconquered. He typically climbed alone. In 1874 he published the book Aus den N√∂rdlichen Kalkalpen (\\"From the Northern Limestone Alps\\"), in which he documented his experiences and tours. The work is viewed today as a classic amongst Alpine literature. The names of numerous mountain huts, trails, etc., are witness to the services of Hermann von Barth in opening up the Northern Limestone Alps: the Barthgrat (the crossing from the Katzenkopf to the Middle J√§gerkarspitze (III), Karwendel, first conquered by Barth, unaided and alone, in 1870), Barthspitze (Karwendel, named in his honour) and Barthkamin (Risser Falk, Karwendel, first climbed in 1870 by von Barth). The protected climb from the Meilerh√ºtte hut on the Partenkirchen Dreitorspitze is also called the Hermann von Barth Way.

He was for many years speaker of the house in the Rhode Island colonial assembly, attended the 1754 Albany Congress, and was elected a delegate to the 1765 Stamp Act Congress. In 1776 he was appointed to the newly independent state's supreme court. A successful Atlantic merchant, he was financially ruined by the American Revolutionary War, and was in the 20th century revealed to be a paid informant for the British Army. Life Metcalf Bowler was born in 1726 in London, England. In the 1740s he came with his father to North America, where he established himself in the Atlantic trade based in Newport, Rhode Island. His success in trade made him one of the Rhode Island colony's wealthiest men. He is frequently credited as being responsible for the introduction of the Rhode Island Greening apple as part of his merchant business and horticultural interests. He was supposedly responsible for its early propagation and distribution from his estate in Portsmouth. In 1750 he married Ann Fairchild, daughter of Major Fairchild, another prominent Newport merchant. Portrait of Bowler's wife Ann by John Singleton Copley, 1758 He attended one session of the 1754 Albany Congress, at which the idea of colonial union was discussed. During the French and Indian War at least one ship in which he had an interest, the Defiance was commissioned as a privateer. He was chosen to represent the colony at the Stamp Act Congress that met in October 1765 to formulate a united statement by the colonies against the provisions of the Stamp Act, the first attempt by the British Parliament to tax the colonies directly. He sat as a judge on the panel that investigated the Gasp√©e Affair. He served for many years in the colonial assembly, and was its speaker from 1767 to 1776. He served as an Associate Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court from May 1768 to June 1769, and from June 1770 to August 1776, and as Chief Justice from August 1776 to February 1777.Manual - the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (1891), p. 208-13. When Rhode Island declared its independence from Great Britain, Bowler was among the signatories. He remained active in state government, serving on its committee of secret correspondence. When the British occupied Newport in December 1776 Bowler was forced from his Portsmouth estate, and fled to Providence. There he operated a dry goods store and later a boarding house. He died in Providence in 1789, and is interred at St. John's Cemetery in Providence. Unmasked as informer In the late 1920s, when an extensive cataloging of the papers of General Sir Henry Clinton was undertaken, correspondence was found in which Bowler was revealed to be a paid informer for the British at the same time that he was being hailed as an American Patriot. This change of heart was apparently made in an attempt to prevent the plundering of his properties in and around Newport following the British occupation. It is not known whether he gave the British any useful intelligence.

The tree is located on Sunland Farm (Platland Farm), near Modjadjiskloof (previously known as Duiwelskloof), Limpopo Province. In one study the tree was carbon-dated and found to be an estimated 1,060 years old, plus or minus 75 years. Results of other studies have however suggested much higher ages. The tree bloomed profusely in spring and provided a refuge to two pairs of owls, and other bird species. Most of the tree died in 2016 and 2017. Structure It is 22 metres high and 47 metres in circumference. The trunk diameter was 10.64 metres (only the Glencoe Baobab up to its 2009 split was larger), and the crown diameter is 30.2 metres. The trunk consists of two connected sections, each with its own enormous hollow, and these are connected by a narrow passage. One third of the Boabab tree collapsed in August 2016. This was ascribed to age and the natural hollowing of the trunk with time. The property owners intend to leave the fallen trunk section as it fell, allowing natural processes to reshape and assimilate the feature. History When the internal hollows were cleared of compost in 1993, evidence of Bushmen and Voortrekker visitors was found. Carbon investigations inside the hollows testified to fires in 1650 AD, 1750‚Äì1780, 1900, 1955 and 1990. Tourist attraction The Sunland Big Baobab became a popular tourist attraction after 1993 when the owners of Sunland farm established a bar and wine cellar in its hollow trunk. The hollow centre of the tree was cleared of a substantial compost layer to uncover the floor at about a meter below the present ground level. A door was placed in a squared off natural vent in the trunk, and a railway sleeper pub was constructed inside, complete with draft beer, seats and a music system. 60 people once attended a party inside this tree bar. A wine cellar was installed in the second hollow, which remains at a constant 22 ¬∞C temperature thanks to the tree's natural vents. The bar was destroyed in 2017 when the tree split, the second major break in 2 years. According to a study published in 2018, not only the Sunland Baobab, but \\"the majority of the oldest and largest African baobabs [have died] over the past 12 years\\".

He is most famous for his singing career, when he rose to fame as the blond-haired member of the group Smash!!. The group broke up in 2006. Since then Topalov has pursued a solo career.  SMASH!!  In 2000 Sergey Lazarev and Vlad Topalov started the boy band Smash!!. Shortly after they were signed by Universal Music Records in Russia and were one of the biggest Russian pop groups in 2002‚Äì2003. The duo had five No. 1 hits, numerous awards and sold millions of records in Russia, CIS and East Asia (including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand) during their brief career as a group. At the beginning of 2002 the duo shot their first video clip for the song \\"Should Have Loved You More\\". That August Smash!! won the 'New Wave' contest in J≈´rmala and in October 2002 Smash!! released their first single \\"Belle\\". The video for \\"Belle\\" topped MTV Russia's chart for 6 months and entered the list of top 20 clips of the past five years. The story behind this song tells about the formation of the duo Smash!!, apparently Vlad and Sergey rehearsed the song as a birthday present to Vlad's father, but after he heard the song he immediately told all his friends and ended up on the radio as one of his friends started playing at a local station. In February 2003 the band finally released their debut album, Freeway. Over a million discs were sold in Russia and other nations in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Smash!! subsequently toured Russia throughout 2003. The following year Freeway was released in East Asian countries including; Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, India, and the Philippines. The release of the album was followed by the promotional tour in the South-Eastern Asia, during which the band shot a video clip for the cover-version of George Michael's song \\"Faith\\" in Shanghai. In May 2004 Smash!! in cooperation with the Italian band Earphones recorded the song \\"Obsession\\". When the song entered the radio rotation, it immediately gained the top of hit parades and became the top summer hit 2004. That year Smash!! received the award of the MTV Russian Music Awards (RMA in short) 2004 as the pop-project of the year, and the award of the sound-track as the band of the year. On 1 December 2004 Smash!! released the second album, 2Nite. The band split up only one week after the release, Evolution and the breakup of the band (2006) Vlad Topalov released one more album, Evolution, under the band's name, with seven musicians, due to the band's contract obligations with Universal Music. After that, Vlad followed Sergey's footsteps and also went solo, which led to the formal discontinuation of the band. Smash!! reunited for a short performance in RMA 2006, where Sergey and Vlad sang Belle. In 2008 Topalov claimed that he was a regular user of cocaine and ecstasy pills and his drug use was a reason in the breakup of the band.Pro-Kremlin activist says was high on coke for years Studio albums= \\"Smash!!\\" albums  *2003 ‚Äì Freeway *2004 ‚Äì 2Nite  Solo albums  * 2005 ‚Äì Evolution (This album was marked like Smash album but only Topalov took part in recording) * 2006 ‚Äì Odinokaya Zvezda/–û–¥–∏–Ω–æ–∫–∞—è –∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ (Lonely Star) * 2008 ‚Äì Pust' Serdtse Reshaet/–ü—É—Å—Ç—å —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ —Ä–µ—à–∞–µ—Ç (Let heart decide) * 2008 ‚Äì I Will Give It All To You References Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Moscow Category:Russian male singers Category:Russian pop singers Category:Russian State University for the Humanities alumni Category:Russian child singers Category:21st-century Russian singers Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Vlad Topalov"},{"id":"25896502","title":"Burnin' Old Memories"},{"id":"25896514","text":"\\"Everybody Loves Hugo\\" is the 12th television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 115th episode overall. The episode was aired on April 13, 2010, on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz and directed by Dan Attias, who previously directed the first-season episode \\"Numbers\\". The title alludes to the season two episode \\"Everybody Hates Hugo.\\" The episode is centered on Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes, while Desmond Hume and John Locke also received points of view in the flash-sideways universe. In 2007, Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) starts to think blowing up the plane that carried Ajira Airways Flight 316 is a bad idea. Meanwhile, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) arrives at the Man in Black's (Terry O'Quinn) camp. In the flash-sideways, Desmond encourages Hurley to believe Libby Smith's (Cynthia Watros) visions of the other timeline. Plot=2004 (flash-sideways timeline) Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) is a successful businessman and philanthropist. His mother sets him up on a blind date, but instead of his intended date, he meets Libby Smith (Cynthia Watros), who tells him that they already know one another. Libby is led away by her doctor (Bruce Davison), who explains that she is a resident at a psychiatric institution and has wandered away from a group trip. Later, Hurley meets Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who encourages him to believe Libby, and to find out why she thinks she knows him already. Hurley then visits the Santa Rosa Mental Health Institute, where Libby tells him that she remembers them meeting following a plane crash on an island. Hurley is unable to remember, but asks her on a date regardless. They share a picnic, and when Libby kisses him, Hurley begins to remember. Desmond observes their date from a distance, before driving off and visiting the school at which Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) teach. Desmond sees Locke in his wheelchair, and after a short conversation with Ben, he runs Locke over with his car and drives off. 2007 (original timeline) While visiting Libby's grave, Hurley is visited by Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), who warns him that if the group follows through with their plan to blow up the plane on Hydra Island, many people will die and it will be Hurley's fault. Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) collects four sticks of dynamite from the Black Rock. As Hurley voices his concern, Ilana puts down her bag, containing the unstable dynamite, too hard causing it to explode, killing her. Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) leads the group to collect more dynamite. Hurley sneaks off ahead of them and blows up the Black Rock, destroying the dynamite supply, as well as the ship. He claims that Jacob has appeared to him and told him to take the group to The Man in Black. Richard does not believe him, and remains intent on destroying the plane. He takes Ben and Miles (Ken Leung) with him to the Barracks to collect explosives, while Jack (Matthew Fox), Frank (Jeff Fahey) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) remain with Hurley. Hurley confesses to Jack that he did not really see Jacob, but Jack tells he already knows, and is willing to follow Hurley anyway. The group hears whispers from the jungle, and Michael appears again, explaining that the whispers are the voices of deceased island inhabitants who are unable to move on. He apologizes to Hurley for killing Libby. Meanwhile, Sayid presents Desmond to The Man in Black, who takes him to an old well. The Man in Black explains to Desmond that people built wells looking for the source that made compass needles spin at points like this location. The Man in Black then throws Desmond down the well. Upon returning to his camp, Hurley's group arrives to talk to the Man in Black. Reception \\"Everybody Loves Hugo\\" was met with positive reviews.

Girls traditionally learned household skills from their female elders by the age of eight. Hmong women worked as housekeepers, child-bearers and caretakers, cooks, and tailors, and were responsible for making all of their families‚Äô clothes and preparing all meals. Women also planted, harvested, and cleared fields with their husbands, carried water from the river, tended to the animals, and helped build their own houses and furniture. Marriage and widows \\"Marriage is considered vital in every Hmong person's life and is the basis for establishing ties with other family groups.\\"Keown-Bomar, Julie. Kinship Networks Among Hmong-American Refugees. New York: LFB Scholarly Publishing LLC 2004:50 Hmong men traditionally chose a bride from another clan, with the man's father arranging the marriage. It was taboo for a man to choose a bride from his own clan. The father would consult with his own relatives and the bride. She could decline the match, but if she and her family agreed, drinks were made and a bride price was discussed. A traditional Hmong wedding consisted of three separate ceremonies of animal sacrifices and feasts. In the Hmong society, a woman keeps close relationships with her family and never takes her husband's last name. However, after marriage, she joins her husband's family to work and live with them.Ngo, Bic (2002) Contesting ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù: The Perspectives of Hmong American Female Students on Early Marriage. Anthropology and Education Quarterly 33(2):168-88 If widowed, a Hmong woman has few choices. According to a Hmong saying, \\"Widows cry to death\\". The woman's children belong to her husband's family and a woman cannot inherit wealth, which leaves her with virtually nothing. If her husband's brother marries her she can remain in her husband's family. Polygamy is condoned in Hmong society, but rare. Paj Ntaub A large part of Hmong women's culture is sewing. Hmong women are highly skilled and famous for their fine needlework and embroidery called paj ntaub (flower cloth). An example of this ancient craft can be found in Chinese art albums. Women spend years on one piece of clothing for a wedding or other celebratory attire. The cross- stitching, if done exceptionally well, is so fine it can appear to the naked eye as beading. There are five traditional patterns including an eight-point star, a snail shell, a ram's head, an elephant's footprint and a heart, which, when combined create a beautiful display.Ng, Franklin, ed. (1999) Asian American Women and Gender. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc. Women work all day in the fields and in the house and then sew by oil lamp throughout the night so that their children will have appropriate clothes for New Year‚Äôs. Childbirth Hmong families usually consist of many children, fulfilling several crucial purposes. First and foremost, children guarantee the continuation of the lineage and clan. Children also provide helping hands for farm work, housework, and childcare. Being able to produce many children adds to a sense of importance for women, helping them feel a stronger sense of belonging within their clan. Children are also very highly celebrated in Hmong culture, as the Hmong people believe in reincarnation and center their lives around the family.Quincy, Keith. Hmong History of a People 2nd ed.). Cheney: Eastern Washington University Press 1995:99 Pregnancy and labor During pregnancy, Hmong women carried out their daily responsibilities until the day they went into labor. A Hmong woman would follow her food cravings to guarantee that her child would not be born with a deformity. Once her water broke she would then walk to the nearest water source and carry water to her house to wash her baby when it was born. In the book The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, Anne Fadiman discusses a woman who gave birth to twelve of her fifteen children alone in the middle of the night. The woman, Foua, delivered each child into her own hands in complete silence, believing that noise would \\"thwart the birth\\". The father then cut the umbilical cord and the mother washed her newborn. The father proceeded to dig a deep hole in the dirt floor of the house to bury the placenta. If the baby was a girl the placenta was buried underneath her parents' bed, but if it was a boy it was buried with greater honor under the central column of the house. The Hmong believe that after death a soul returns to its birthplace, retrieves its placental jacket, puts it on, and begins its voyage to the sky. Women had a strict postpartum diet that consisted solely of hot foods and drinks. Cold food would \\"make the blood congeal in the womb instead of cleansing it by flowing freely\\".Fadiman, Anne. The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux 1997:9 These beliefs were closely followed to ensure the continued fertility of the new mother and her ability to produce enough breastmilk., Corbett, C. A., Callister, L. C., Gettys, J. P., & Hickman, J. R. (2017). The Meaning of Giving Birth. The Journal of perinatal & neonatal nursing, 31(3), 207-215. Hu Plig A baby was not considered part of the community until a ceremony called the hu plig (soul-calling) occurred three days after its birth. Chickens were sacrificed and if the soul was content in its new body, the chickens' tongues would be curled upward and the skulls translucent. Either string or silver necklaces or bracelets were put on the infant to prevent the soul from wandering from the body. After this ceremony, the infant would be named and considered an official member of the human race. Socio- cultural dynamics Foua, the woman from The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, noted that her personal life was based on her cultural life. Hmong culture is centered around legends, the religion of shamans, souls, high regard for ancestors, and the many rituals and ceremonies the Hmong perform. Women's social life and status is often a direct result of the completion of and attendance at the proper rituals and ceremonies. One Hmong legend tells of a girl who took every man who passed by her as a lover. Eventually, \\"her sexual excesses so destroyed her health that she fell ill and died\\".Quincy, Keith. Hmong History of a People 2nd ed.). Cheney: Eastern Washington University Press 1995:77 In this story, the woman's failure to follow one of the religious tenets of Hmong culture resulted in her death. The Hmong also has stories of great female shamans, showing how social life and cultural life of Hmong women are interrelated. Hmong culture shapes gender roles in that female culture is a culture in itself. The female gender is shaped beginning in childhood and to gain high status, a woman must always fulfill the expectations for the female sex. Current situation The Hmong people's way of life changed drastically during the Vietnam War. The United States could not send troops into Laos, so they instead trained Hmong men to fight in the hopes that they could keep Laos an anti-communist nation. Since the Hmong were fighting against Laos, they had to evacuate their homes there and live in refugee camps in Thailand. After the war was over, Thailand closed the refugee camps and Hmong people were dispersed all over the world to Western countries such as the United States, Australia, France, and Canada. The rest of the Hmong people fled to various countries in Asia. Hmong women in the Western world had a difficult time adjusting to a new way of life, having trouble transferring skills they had learned in Asia to a different culture. The newer generation of Hmong women are generally more assimilated. In Fadiman's book the mother, Foua, declares herself stupid because she is not familiar with American culture. She cannot read or speak English and due to that inability cannot perform simple yet necessary tasks such as grocery shopping. She can no longer farm or provide for her children as she once could. Women's current roles The patrilineal and patriarchal family system has changed little since for those Hmong who emigrated to the Global North. Decisions about any family member of either gender are still passed down through the husband's family elders. Women contribute greatly to their families, but in different ways. Women tend to have somewhat more freedom in choosing a husband, but the families of the bride and groom still have the final say in the match. The woman does not live outside the home before she is married to protect her reputation. Childbirth is also a different process now that hospitals are located in every neighborhood. Once Foua, from Fadiman's book, relocated to the United States she no longer birthed her own children; a doctor did. She no longer bathed her infants; a nurse took care of it. Fiona's husband brought in the proper postpartum food because the hospital offered only ice water. Often a doctor will not release the placenta to the parents of the newborn and the Hmong fear that they will never recover the placental jackets necessary for the afterlife. Over time, the women of this group have lost some of their power and agency. As a result of globalization and assimilation into another culture, women have less control over their lives because they cannot provide food for their families as they did, birth children traditionally, or perform many traditional ceremonies.

(1974). Studying the Yanomamo. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston. There are estimated to be only approximately 35,000 indigenous people remaining.Povos Indigenas no Brasil: Yanomami (2011) They are interfluvial Indians who live in small villages along the Mavaca and Orinoco Rivers, with each village consisting of a single shabono, or communal dwelling.Gordon MacMillan (1995). At the End of the Rainbow? Gold, People, and Land in the Brazilian Amazon. NY: Columbia University Press. Largely uncontacted by the outside world, the Yanomami have been affected by illnesses introduced by gold miners since the 1980s.Dennison Berwick (1992). Savages: The Life and Killing of the Yanomami. London, UK: Hodder and Stoughton, Ltd. Anthropological studies have emphasized that the Yanomami are a violent people, and although this can be true, the women of the Yanomami culture generally abstain from violence and warfare. Although males dominate the Yanomami culture, Yanomami women play an important role in sustaining their lifestyle. Yanomami women decorate their faces with sticks that pierce the cheeks and lip. Photo taken in Homoxi, Brazil June 1997. Domestic life The women in the Yanomami tribe are responsible for domestic duties and chores, excluding hunting and killing large game. Although the women do not hunt, they do work in gardens and gather fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants, fish, small animals, honey and insects for food. The garden plots are sectioned off by family. Bananas, sugarcane, mangoes, sweet potatoes, papaya, manioc, and other crops are grown.Napoleon A. Chagnon (1992). Yanomamo. NY: Harcourt Brace College Publishers. Fourth edition. About 60 different crops are grown in these gardens which account for about 80% of their food. The women also collect nuts, shellfish and insect larvae. Wild honey is highly prized and the Yanomami harvest 15 different kinds. The Yanomami women cultivate these gardens until they are no longer fertile, and then move their plots. As Amazonian soil is not very fertile, a new garden is cleared every two or three years.Schwartz, David M, with Victor Englebert. Vanishing Peoples Yanomami People of The Amazon. New York: Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Books. Women are expected to carry 70 to 80 pound loads of crops on their backs during harvest season, using bark straps and woven baskets.Kenneth Good (1991). Into the Heart: One Man's Pursuit of Love and Knowledge Among the Yanomamia. NY: Simon and Schuster. Plantains and grubs are common sources of food, and are staples in the Yanomami diet.Yanomami woman weaves a basket at the maloca do Eduardo in Brazil, June 1999. While the men hunt, the women and young children go off in search of termite nests and other grubs, which will later be roasted around family hearths. Each family has its own hearth where food is prepared and cooked during the day. At night, hammocks are slung near the fire which is stoked all night to keep people warm. Although hunting accounts for only 10% of Yanomami food, among men it is considered the most reputable of skills and meat is greatly valued by everyone. No hunter ever eats the meat that he has killed. Instead he shares it out among friends and family.Survival International: The Yanomami In return, he will be given meat by another hunter. Sometimes, the women also pursue frogs, land crabs, or caterpillars, or even look for vines that can be woven into baskets. While some women gather these small sources of food, other women go off and fish for several hours during the day.Alcida Rita Ramos (1995). Sanuma Memories: Yanomami Ethnography in Times of Crisis. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. The women also commonly use plants such as manioc to turn into flat cakes, which they cook over a small pile of coals. Yanomami women are expected to bear and raise many children, who are expected to help their mothers with domestic chores from a very young age, and mothers rely very much on help from their daughters. Using small strings of bark and roots, Yanomami women weave and decorate baskets. They use these baskets to carry plants, crops, and food to bring back to the shabono. They use a red berry known as onoto to dye the baskets, as well as to paint their bodies and dye their loin cloths. After the baskets are painted, they are further decorated with masticated charcoal pigment. Puberty and menstruation The start of menstruation symbolizes the beginning of womanhood. Girls typically start menstruation around the age of 12-15. Girls are often betrothed before menarche and the marriage may only be consummated once the girl starts menstruating, though the taboo is often violated and many girls become sexually active before then. The Yanomami word for menstruation (roo) translates literally as \\"squatting\\" in English, as they use no pads or cloths to absorb the blood. Due to the belief that menstrual blood is poisonous and dangerous, girls are kept hidden away in a small tent- like structure constructed of a screen of leaves. A deep hole is built in the structure over which girls squat, to \\"rid themselves\\" of their blood. These structures are regarded as isolation screens.Chagnon, Napoleon A. (1992). Yanomamo. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston.Yanomami girl at Xidea, Brazil, August 1997. The mother is notified immediately, and she, along with the elder female friends of the girl, are responsible for disposing of her old cotton garments and must replace them with new ones symbolizing her womanhood and availability for marriage. During the week of that first menstrual period the girl is fed with a stick, for she is forbidden from touching the food in any way. While on confinement she has to whisper when speaking and she may only speak to close kin, such as siblings or parents, but never a male.Good, Kenneth, with David Chanoff (1988) Into the Heart. London: The Ulverscroft Foundation. Up until the time of menstruation, girls are treated as children, and are only responsible for assisting their mothers in household work. When they approach the age of menstruation, they are sought out by males as potential wives. Puberty is not seen as a significant time period with male Yanomami children, but it is considered very important for females. After menstruating for the first time, the girls are expected to leave childhood and enter adulthood, and take on the responsibilities of a grown Yanomami woman. After a young girl gets her period, she is forbidden from showing her genitalia and must keep herself covered with a loincloth. The menstrual cycle of Yanomami women does not occur frequently due to constant nursing or child birthing, and is treated as a very significant occurrence only at this time. Wedding and marriage traditions In Yanomami society, marriage ceremonies are almost non-existent and are not celebrated in any way. Marriage is a social dynamic within villages, and they are usually driven by political opportunity by men who are seeking alliances with other men from different villages. Polygamous marriages are common, meaning husbands can have many wives. The demand for women outweighs the actual population of the Yanomami women because of the growing practice of polygamy. A girl can be promised to a man at an age as young as five or six, however cannot officially be married off until after her first menstrual period. This is considered a marriageable age. After a Yanomami girl receives her first menstrual period, she is literally handed off by one of her parents to another man, usually a relative. Cross-cousin marriages, which are marriages between the girl and the son of a maternal uncle or paternal aunt, are the most common form of marriage. Most prefer to marry within the same community, for fear of violent breakouts between different communities. The female goes to live with her spouse, and must perform the chores and duties she previously did for her mother. Violence and abuse between couples in Yanomami culture is very common, and if a woman feels she can no longer bear to live with her husband, she may flee to live with her brothers. Polygamy is commonly practiced in Yanomami culture. The elder wife in a marriage usually has precedence over the others, and can act as a boss or a superior over the other wives. She usually no longer has sexual relations with her husband, however she can give the most unpleasant chores to the wife she chooses. The husband is not supposed to show favorites, due to jealousy between the wives. Violence The Yanomami people have a history of acting extremely violently not only towards other tribes, but towards one another.R. Brian Ferguson (1995). Yanomami Warfare: A Political History. Santa Fe: School for American Research Press. Men generally initiate this violence, and women are often victims of physical abuse and anger. Inter-village warfare is common, but does not too commonly affect women. When Yanomami tribes fight and raid nearby tribes, women are often raped, beaten, and brought back to their shabono to be kept in their tribe. During the raids, Yanomami men capture and bring back the other women in hopes of marrying them. Although capturing women is not the focus for these raids, it is seen as a secondary benefit. Wives are beaten on a regular basis, so as to keep them docile and faithful to their husbands. Sexual jealousy causes a majority of the violence. Women are beaten with clubs, sticks, machetes, and other blunt or sharp objects. Burning with a branding stick occurs often, and symbolizes a male's strength or dominance over his wife. Rituals and festivities Rituals are a very important part of Yanomami culture. The spirit world is a fundamental part of Yanomami life. Every creature, rock, tree, and mountain has a spirit. Sometimes, these are malevolent and aggressive (shawara), and are believed to cause illness. Sometimes they are benevolent and help fight off illness (hekura). Although many ceremonies exclude female involvement or participation, women play an important role in preparing for these ceremonies. For large ceremonies, Yanomami women prepare foods and ferment alcoholic drinks for the men. The women also participate in the practice of endocannibalism, where the ashes of a deceased kinsman are mixed with stewed bananas and consumed. This tradition is meant to strengthen the Yanomami people and keep the spirit of that individual alive. The ritual consumption of ashes is accompanied by mourning and a recounting of the individual's biography, the only time that a deceased person's name may be mentioned after her or his death. Politics In Yanomami culture, a woman can become a shaman, but not a headman. This is due to the fact that headmen are expected to be peacekeepers and valiant warriors, both of which require force and violence, which women are not considered to have in Yanomami culture. In this society, women gain respect as they age, after they marry and have children. Elderly women are very respected, and ultimately can become immune to violence and warfare between villages. They are immune from the violence of raiders and can safely travel from one village to another without fear of injury. Usually, elderly women are expected to recover the body of a slain Yanomami who was killed in a raid. Although women are disrespected and belittled at a young age, they are respected and looked highly upon when they age, and have much power in tribal politics and decision-making.

Even though domestic and international authorities work to protect children from sexual abuse, the problem still persists in Thailand and many other Southeast Asian countries. Child prostitution, like other forms of child sexual abuse, not only causes death and high morbidity rates in millions of children but also violates their rights and dignity. History Sexual exploitation of children and women in Thailand dates back many centuries. During the Ayutthaya period from 1351 to 1767, women were circulated amongst men as concubines or treated as spoils of war given to soldiers as rewards. Children and women used as sex slaves had to obey their masters or face punishment. Sexual slavery continued in Thailand for hundreds of years until the 20th century when King Rama V sought a more Western approach in his policy and abolished slavery. The abolition of slavery left many without any means of subsistence, forcing them to turn to prostitution. Prostitution was more active during times of war. During World War II, under the occupation of Japan, Japanese forces used Thai women as prostitutes. During the Vietnam War, Thailand was a popular destination for American soldiers on their R&R; leave. Although the soldiers preferred women rather than young girls, the sex industry in Thailand developed faster than ever before. There were five US bases in Thailand, each housing up to 50,000 troops. Kathryn Farr makes clear that the correlation between the number of troops in Vietnam and the number of prostitutes in Thailand is of significance. \\"In 1957, an estimated 20,000 prostitutes were working in Thailand. By 1964, that number rose to 400,000. By 1972, when the United States withdrew its main combat troops from Vietnam, there were at least 500,000 working prostitutes in the country. From then on, the Thai sex industry simply exploded\\". Since the 1970s, sex tourism in Thailand has been increasing. In 1973, an estimated 1 million sex tourists were in Thailand. It rose to 2 million in 1981. Then 4 million in 1988. In the 1990s, sex tourists were staying longer in Thailand than before, which made sex tourism the highest source of foreign currency revenue in Thailand. When the Asian financial crisis began in 1997, it made Thai currency (also known as the \\"Baht\\") lose significant value, making Thailand an even cheaper destination for sex tourists and, therefore, one of the most-visited countries of South East Asia. The Thailand government spent millions of baht to promote sexual tourism in Thailand, so much so that more than 7.5 million sex tourists visited Thailand by 1998. Contributing factors=Economic disparity In the early-1990s, Thailand became one of several Southeast Asian countries to join the ranks of the NICs, or \\"newly industrialising countries.\\" The country shifted from a rice-based agricultural society to one of rapid industrialisation, and Thailand's GDP doubled in the following decade. Some provinces, such as Isan, however, struggled to keep up with the industrialisation of neighbouring provinces. The costs of food, land, and tools all increased as the economy grew, but the returns for rice production and other agricultural practices remained stagnant. The country currently experiences massive wealth inequality, labelled the Gini coefficient, in which the country sees rapid growth in wealthy areas but no growth or even a decline in other areas. Mikkelson GM, Gonzalez A, Peterson GD (2007) Economic Inequality Predicts Biodiversity Loss. PLoS ONE 2(5): e444. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000444 Many families are forced to find other methods of income if their land isn't fit for agriculture in addition to the growing social pressure to keep up with industrialised Thailand. As Bales writes, \\"Now parents feel a great pressure to buy consumer goods that were unknown even twenty years ago.\\" Traffickers exploit this vulnerability by convincing these families to sell their daughters for money. The daughters are promised stable employment in the city, which could alleviate the families' financial difficulties, and the contracts are often seemingly appealing but false. Moreover, in certain parts of Thailand, parents rely on their children to provide money for the family as they suffer from poverty and cannot earn enough money otherwise. The popular belief in Thailand is that children have the responsibility to provide for the family as a way of repaying parents for giving them a place to live. In turn, due to a lack of self-sustaining jobs nearby, children are sometimes forced into exploitation as sex slaves for money or turn to prostitution, which is highly profitable. Other people have taken advantage of this, especially those from western countries. Not only are children forced into prostitution, but they have minimal incentives to run away. Providing support for the family by any means is widely considered a good deed in the country. This teaching is embedded in their religion, Theravada Buddhism, so it is difficult for some children to leave the sex trade because many parts of the country are accepting of it. Even men in these areas often mention that they aren't bothered by their spouse being a former sex slave because it has made them rich. The chances of marriage aren't reduced for these children, rendering disapproval uncommon.Lisa Rende Taylor, \\"Dangerous Trade‚Äêoffs: The Behavioural Ecology of Child Labor and Prostitution in Rural Northern Thailand,\\" Current Anthropology 46, no. 3 (June 2005): 411-431. https://doi.org/10.1086/430079  Abduction of children  In some circumstances, children who live in Thailand run away or are abducted from their homes. Vulnerable children are often taken by sex trafficking pimps and then sold to individuals or brothels in Thailand. Traffickers can also sell children to individuals who travel to Thailand for child prostitution and will allow the child to leave the country with the individual who purchased them. According to the United Nations, children are kidnapped from Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos to be trafficked to Thailand, where they find a better client base.  Individual risk factors  Both girls and boys, as young as ten years old, are prostituted throughout Thailand. Most of these children are exploited by local men in their communities, and others are also prostituted by pedophiles and foreign sex tourists. Some of these children may have five to ten clients per day. Children who are homeless, runaways, or abandoned are the most likely to be forced into prostitution and are actively recruited by pimps and traffickers. Prostituted children are at a high risk of catching many infectious diseases and sequelae, and they are at higher risk of contracting HIV. According to a study, it has been found that 17% of brothels in Thailand contain individuals and child prostitutes infected with HIV. In addition, prostituted children who have an STD that causes genital ulcers such as syphilis or chancroid are four times more likely to develop an HIV infection. Lack of medical services for children with STDs can increase this risk since they will remain untreated or will self-medicate. Prostituted children who are infected with HIV have a very high risk of developing active tuberculosis. These diseases can be passed to both their children as well as their clients. The ESCAP study found that STD rates are highest in Cambodia (36%), China (78%), and Thailand (38%). Prostituted girls are also likely to have cervical cancer. Developing cervical cancer is associated with having multiple sexual partners or having sexual intercourse at an early age. Those who have a diagnosis are often unaware until a late stage, making successful treatment unlikely. Sexually-active adolescents who do not use contraception have a 90% chance of becoming pregnant each year; thus, since many girls in Thailand do not have access to contraceptives, they become pregnant. These girls are also at high risk of pregnancy-related complications, including death. Moreover, many impregnated prostituted children seek abortions, and unsafe abortions place them at a higher risk of injury or death. Prostituted children in Thailand are likely to have serious, long-term mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and behavioral disorders. Many prostituted children often feel helpless, damaged, degraded, betrayed, and shameful, and they tend to be at high risk of suicide and post-traumatic stress disorder. Prostituted children may also sustain injuries, including rape, as a result of violence from pimps, clients, police, and intimate partners. Girls who are forced into prostitution may be physically and emotionally abused into submission. These youths are also beaten to induce miscarriages, a process that is illegal but continues to be practiced openly. Legislation Child prostitution in Thailand is a controversial topic, and children who are a part of this trade are being compensated by various laws. An act passed in 1996 states that \\"it is prohibited to engage in sexual intercourse or sexual acts in a 'prostitution establishment' with a person under 18 years of age, regardless of consent\\". The slightest idea or mention of child prostitution through public solicitation, advertising, or association with another person involved in prostitution would be considered illegal. The World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children contributed to this act during its meeting in Stockholm, where they \\"work[ed] towards combating all forms of commercial sexual exploitation of children.\\" Prostitution in general is also an ongoing problem, but the Thai government has enacted laws to combat the issue. Thailand passed the Prostitution Prevention and Suppression Act, which focuses on \\"the total elimination of entry into the commercial sex business by children of both sexes under 18\\". The act also finds individuals profiting from prostitution, such as pimps and brothel owners, more culpable than the prostitutes themselves. In addition, any government or law enforcement official involved in prostitution in any way \\"shall be punished with imprisonment of 15-20 years and a fine of 300,000-400,000 baht\\".  Government cooperation  There are organisations formed together to help enforce these laws. The Stockholm Declaration has been described as \\"In accordance with the Stockholm Declaration, close interaction and cooperation between government and non-government sectors is necessary to effectively plan, implement and evaluate measures to combat CSEC.\\" Government officials have set laws in place and intend to follow through with each violation regarding child prostitution. The conference of Stockholm merged the \\"Agenda for Action,\\" which is a set of strategies used to attack child prostitution globally. Another organisation to help is ECPAT, or End Child Prostitution, Pornography, and Trafficking in Children for Sexual Exploitation, and it has become one of the leading NGOs fighting child prostitution on a global scale. Its website states: \\"The ECPAT Foundation advocates the implementation and monitoring of the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC) and its protocols and engages with networks of human rights and child protection agencies at a national and local level. The foundation supports children and young people who have survived exploitation or are still at risk by encouraging them to participate as key actors to protect themselves and other children in similar situations.\\" See also * Prostitution in Thailand * Child Prostitution * Human trafficking in Thailand * ECPAT ReferencesExternal links Category:Child prostitution Prostitution Category:Prostitution in Thailand Category:Child sexual abuse by country ","title":"Child prostitution in Thailand"},{"id":"25896636","title":"Opinion polling for the 2011 Canadian federal election"},{"id":"25896646","title":"Strong Enough to Bend (song)"},{"id":"25896651","text":"right Hollytrees Museum is a free to visit, publicly owned museum in the centre of Colchester and close to Colchester Castle. It is situated in an eighteenth-century house (\\"Hollytrees\\"), which was used as a private residence until 1929, when it became a museum. The first house on the site, known as \\"Symnells\\" after its owner, was later bought by the Shaw family, and passed from John Shaw to John Shaw III and John Shaw IV. When he died a minor, the house passed into chancery; his mother Jane Lessingham bought it but soon died. The modern house was constructed in for Elizabeth Cornelisen, who had bought the site from Lessingham's executors and promptly tore down the existing structure in poor condition. Construction commenced on 10 May 1718 at a cost of ¬£630 plus brickwork and tiling; the total refurbishment was estimated to have cost ¬£2000. She died soon after, bequeathing the house to her niece, Sarah Creffeild (n√©e Webster), who left it to her second husband Charles Gray. It was, at that time, known as \\"Esqr Creffield's \\". Possession of the house reverted to the Creffeilds; through Thamer Creffeild to James Round, who left to his brother Charles, who left it to his son Charles Gray Round, who left to it to his nephew James Round. The Rounds finally sold it to the Corporation of Colchester in 1922, a purchase paid for privately by Viscount Cowdray and his wife. It became a museum in 1929. The house is known as Hollytrees after two holly trees planted in the grounds by Charles Gray in 1729 and is now a free to visit museum serving the centre of Colchester and specialising in local history. It is a grade I listed building.  Ownership  The new house, constructed in 1718, was passed down through the family, as described above. Only those greyed out did not at some time own Hollytrees. It was finally sold by Lt. Col. Charles Round in 1922.

Having learned about taxicabs from working as a driver, in 1962 he bought ABC Union Cab Co., the first of several he would eventually own. By one estimate, the limousine, sedan, shuttle and bus service companies owned by Frias and his wife made up about 33 percent of the transportation industry in southern Nevada. Biography As a young man, he worked alongside his father and grandmother as a delivery boy in the family business. He graduated from Breckenridge High School and then joined the Navy. After being honorably discharged, he returned to San Antonio, Texas and married his wife, Phyllis. Upon arriving in Las Vegas, Charlie took a job as a taxicab driver with ABC Union Cab Company. He worked diligently for this company that he would come to own by 1962. Charlie quickly acquired three more cab companies and opened the first taxicab service in Mesquite, NV, the Virgin Valley Cab Company. He later went on to further expand into the limousine business by adding Airline Limousine and Las Vegas Limousine to his holdings. At the time of his death in 2006, Charlie had enjoyed over 40 years of success in the transportation field as well as other business activities. Civic recognition On March 16, 2004, Nevada Gov.

Since Larkin's death, biographers have highlighted the importance of female relationships on Larkin: when Andrew Motion's biography was serialised in the Independent in 1993, the second installment of extracts was dedicated to the topic. In 1999, Ben Brown's play Larkin with Women dramatised Larkin's relationships with three of his lovers,and more recently writers such as Martin Amis, continued to comment on this subject. Amis is the son of the British novelist, and Larkin's long- standing friend, Kingsley Amis. While primarily a novelist, Amis also wrote more than six volumes of poetry. Biographer Richard Bradford contends that, over the course of Larkin's life, his relationship with Amis transformed from one of mutual appreciation and encouragement, to a much more fraught dynamic. Bradford has stated that in the later years of their relationship Larkin \\"was subterraneously driven by resentment and near hatred\\" of Amis. Eva Larkin Eva Larkin was Philip Larkin's mother. Born in 1886, she lived until 1977, dying 29 years after her domineering husband, Sydney Larkin. Larkin is often considered to have had a tense relationship with his parents; mainly due to the his famous lyric poem \\"This Be The Verse\\" beginning with the line ‚ÄúThey f*** you up, your mum and dad‚Äù. However, mother and son wrote to each other twice weekly for about 35 years from 1940, when Larkin went to Oxford University. The writer Philip Pullen has described these letters as ‚Äúvery significant‚Äù and proof that ‚Äúthe relationship was deeper and more valuable to Larkin than anybody might have thought‚Äù. \\"Reference Back\\" from The Whitsun Weddings, is a poem written from his mother's viewpoint or his imagination of it. Ruth Bowman Ruth Bowman was a schoolgirl living in Wellington, Shropshire when Larkin moved there in 1943 to become librarian at the public library. They met the following year when she came into the library. She was 16, an academically-minded schoolgirl, and the person with whom Larkin had his first sexual encounter a year later when he visited her at King's College London. Their relationship continued and in 1948 they became engaged. The engagement was broken in 1950, shortly before Larkin moved to Northern Ireland. These events are referred to sardonically in the poem \\"Wild Oats\\", written in the early 1960s. She died in 2012, at the age of 85. Monica Jones Monica Jones was born Margaret Monica Beale Jones on 7 May 1922 in Llanelli, South Wales. She moved with her family to Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire, when aged seven. Educated at Kidderminster High School for Girls, she won a scholarship to study English at Oxford University, a period of her life which was immensely influential to her; she acquired her distinctive accent and flamboyant dress sense whilst studying there.Sutherland, John. Monica Jones, The Guardian, 15 March 2001. Larkin's long and extremely close relationship with Monica Jones dated from the autumn of 1946, when they met at Leicester University College. Jones had been appointed as an assistant lecturer in English in January 1946 and Larkin arrived in September, as an assistant librarian. \\"Both had been at Oxford (he at St John's, she at St Hugh's), between 1940 and 1943, but had not met. Both had first class degrees in English. They had been born in the same year, 1922, and came from rather similar provincial middle-class backgrounds.\\" For the first few years of the relationship, Larkin was involved with Ruth Bowman, but when Bowman broke off the engagement, \\"Monica quickly became central to Larkin's attention.\\" Jones had a holiday cottage at Haydon Bridge where she and Larkin spent many summers together. He left the bulk of his estate to her when he died in 1985. She died on 15 February 2001. Jones taught at Leicester University from 1946 until 1981 when she retired. She never published anything during her academic career; she \\"regarded publishing as a bit showy\\", though she was noted for \\"the panache of her lecturing, in which, for example, she would wear a Scottish tartan when talking about Macbeth.\\" Her literary enthusiasms, (not entirely shared by Larkin), included Walter Scott, Jane Austen and George Crabbe. They shared enthusiasm for Thomas Hardy and Barbara Pym, and swapped scornful opinions of C. P. Snow, Pamela Hansford Johnson, William Cooper, and others. They shared a sympathy with animals, both of them deplored vivisection and myxomatosis, were fond of Beatrix Potter's creations, and of real creatures, in particular cats and rabbits, though Monica Jones had a fear of hens, and of some other birds. Larkin's letters to Jones were sometimes \\"embellished with [his] skilful sketches\\", Jones as a rabbit (\\"Dearest bun\\"), himself as a seal. There is evidence that Jones gave Larkin editorial advice on his writing. A copy of 'Jill' he inscribed to her to thank her for making it 'decent, literate'. 'All the evidence suggests he sends her drafts of his work, he‚Äôs constantly asking for her opinion.' In October 1982, she was taken to Hexham Hospital after a fall downstairs in her Haydon Bridge cottage. At Easter 1983 she was stricken with shingles and on leaving hospital this time Larkin, \\"offered her shelter and care in his house in Newland Park, Hull.\\" Following his death, in December 1985, \\"Monica hardly left that house in Hull until her own death in February 2001.\\" She is said to be the model for the character of Margaret Peel, Jim Dixon's manipulative on-again-off-again girlfriend, in Kingsley Amis's novel Lucky Jim (1954). Monica Jones may also be the inspiration for the character Elvira Jones in Robert Conquest's 1955 novel A World of Difference. The book contains other \\"Larkinesque\\" references, including a spaceship named after the poet. She has also been suggested as the model for Viola Masefield in Malcolm Bradbury's first novel, Eating People is Wrong. As with Larkin and another of his long term companions Maeve Brennan, Monica Jones was buried in Cottingham Cemetery near Hull. Her white headstone is of identical design to the one situated at Larkin's grave. Winifred Arnott Winifred Arnott was a young colleague of Larkin's at Queen's University, Belfast. They became close friends but she soon became engaged to her boyfriend and withdrew from the friendship to a degree. Larkin wrote the poem \\"Lines on a Young Lady's Photograph Album\\" about her, and also \\"Maiden Name\\". Both appeared in Larkin's 1955 collection The Less Deceived. Patsy Murphy  Larkin knew Patricia Avis Strang Murphy (1928‚Äì1977) during the 1950s, and wrote her his first love letters. At the time, she was married to Colin Strang, a friend of Larkin's and a lecturer in the Philosophy department at Queen's University, Belfast, where Larkin was under-librarian. She became pregnant by Larkin, but miscarried. As Patricia Avis, she is the author of Playing the Harlot (1996, Virago), a roman √† clef; the character of Rollo Jute is thought to have been inspired by Larkin. Strang discovered and read some of Larkin's sexual diaries.Richard Bradford, (2005) First boredom, then fear: the life of Philip Larkin. Peter Owen. London. Pages 96‚Äì100. Strang would later marry the poet Richard Murphy. Maeve Brennan Maeve Brennan (27 September 1929 ‚Äì 11 June 2003) was born in Beverley, East Yorkshire and was the eldest of three children. Brennan's father was a dental surgeon from Kilkenny, Ireland. Brennan attended Saint Mary's high school for girls in Hull. She had a successful academic career here, becoming head girl, a title she shared with Ruth Bowman and Winifred Arnott, both previous companions of Larkin. Brennan was a colleague of Larkin's at Hull University, from which she graduated with a degree in history, French and English. They first met in 1955 when he moved from Belfast to Hull, but it was in 1960, when Larkin coached her for a Library Association exam, that their relationship became meaningful and romantic. This happened despite Larkin's deep and by then long-standing relationship with Monica Jones. The romantic between the two lasted for eighteen years, while their friendship as a whole spanned nearly three decades. Larkin's longest poem, \\"The Dance\\" is about an evening spent with Brennan. \\"The Dance\\" remains unfinished. The poem \\"Broadcast\\" was also written about her. \\"Broadcast\\" sees Larkin listening to a live transmission of a concert from Hull's City Hall where Brennan was seated in the audience. Much of Larkin's writing was heavily influenced by his relationship with Brennan, including his collection The Whitsun Weddings, which he once described as Brennan's book. Brennan and Larkin's relationship is detailed extensively by Brennan herself in The Philip Larkin I Knew, which was published in 2002. Brennan's book speaks of both the friendship and romantic relationship that existed between her and Larkin, as well as recalling the poet's 30 year tenure of office as librarian of the University of Hull. Brennan aimed for the book to show Larkin in a new light: namely, that the poet was \\"considerably more compassionate, generous and warmhearted than autobiographical, biographical and critical works published since his death have revealed\\". The Philip Larkin I Knew includes a significant collection of letters between Brennan and Larkin, despite many from the last six months of Larkin's life having been previously destroyed. . Brennan also advised on the BBC2 drama, Love Again, which is based on the last 30 years of Larkin's life, as well as contributing to the Channel 4 documentary Philip Larkin: Love and Death in Hull. Brennan died in June 2003 following a short illness, and like both Larkin and Monica Jones, she is buried in Cottingham Cemetery. Her grave is situated approximately 20 metres from that of Monica Jones and the epitaph on its red granite headstone comes from one of Larkin's most famous poems, An Arundel Tomb: \\"What will survive of us is love\\". Betty Mackereth Betty Mackereth (born 1924, in Hull) was Larkin's \\"loaf-haired\\" secretary for most of his time at Hull University, joining the staff in that role in 1957. After his death it was she who, on his wishes, destroyed his diaries, feeding them sheet by sheet into a university shredder. They began an affair in 1975, when they were both in their fifties. She knew about both Monica Jones and Maeve Brennan, and also about his large collection of pornography. In 2002 a poem written to her, \\"We Met at the End of the Party\\", was publicised by her, prompted by the discovery of a notebook which contained its opening lines. As depicted in Larkin's little drawings sometimes added to letters Mackereth appeared as a whale ‚Äì Monica Jones was a rabbit and Maeve Brennan a mouse.

This locale was originally named \\"Stipp\\" for local settler John L. Stipp, whose land claim was just west of present-day Macleay. Stipp donated the land for what is now known as the Stipp Memorial Cemetery. Stipp post office was established in 1880, and the name changed to \\"Macleay\\" in 1882. Donald Macleay was a prominent merchant of Portland, and along with fellow Scot William Reid, was one of the investors in the narrow-gauge Oregonian Railway Company, which was built through the area. Macleay gave money to build a schoolhouse in the Stipp area, near the new railroad station, so the post office was renamed in his honor. Macleay was platted in 1884. Macleay post office ran until 1939. Ownership of the railroad line passed on to Southern Pacific and today it is owned by Union Pacific. The Macleay Country Store has been in operation since 1916.

Heat transfer augmentation using a magnetic fluid under the influence of a line dipole describes ferrohydrodynamic convection by examining the relationship between an imposed magnetic field, and the resulting ferrofluid flow and thus temperature distribution. Mathematical model for the cancer stem cell hypothesis discusses how cancers can occur because of mutations in normal stem cells and presents a predictive mathematical model. It is the first work to show mathematically how repeated insult to mature cells increases the risk of cancer. Single magnetic particle dynamics in a microchannel illustrates how the collection of magnetic microbeads in a microfluidic flow is influenced by a magnetic field, as well as the particle size, magnetic susceptibility, host fluid velocity and viscosity, and length scale. Thermal transport across nanoscale solid-fluid interfaces shows how the nanoscale thermal resistance, or Kapitza resistance, is lowered by making a solid-fluid interface more hydrophilic. Other contributions Puri was a founder and mentor of NanoSpin, which was a startup that has developed a cooling system for computers and electronic devices.

Biography  Schuster studied with Robert Rockabrand at Ball State University, composer Sam Morgenstern in New York City, Kammersaenger Frederick Mayer in Munich, and most recently, Metropolitan Opera tenor, Thomas Studebaker. He has a career which spans nearly 35 years, from his debut with the Albany Symphony Orchestra in Albany, New York, and recital debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in New York City in 1981, to the stages of Spoleto, Italy and the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, Germany, where he was a leading tenor from 1989-1995 singing Radames (Aida), The King (Love of Three Oranges) and the world premiere of Ubu Rex by Penderecki where he was double-cast with Robert Tear as King Ubu. Critics said of Schuster‚Äôs recital debut, ‚Äú[He] shows a young tenor voice not only unusually rich and full in the lower register, but unforced and brilliant in the upper register as well.‚Äù[The New York Times September 1981] Schuster was a tenor soloist with the RTSI Orchestra in Lugano, Switzerland, where he performed many different operatic roles as well as many oratorios. Schuster also toured throughout Europe with the Compagnie d‚ÄôOpera di Milano as Manrico (Il Trovatore) and Pinkerton (Madama Butterfly). The German television program Westfalische Rundschau commented on his portrayal of Manrico, saying ‚ÄúHerr Schuster was an equal to all the Italians on stage and has a resonantly strong voice ... full of temperament and solid on stage.‚Äù And the French press Liberation noted on the performance of Meyerbeer‚Äôs Les Huguenots, \\"[t]he last tenor who could negotiate the tricky tessitura of this role (Raoul) was Franco Corelli. Mr. Schuster follows quite unhindered in Mr. Corelli‚Äôs footsteps.\\" In 2007, together with friend and colleague, counter-tenor Timothy Linwood, he founded Amocanti Inc., a non-profit corporation to promote the education and the understanding of classical vocal music. The organization presents concerts using singers who have or have had careers but may not have reached the top of the profession. Many of the participants are now lawyers, doctors, bankers, etc. The concerts are done informally, with singers' round-table discussions with the audience. While based in New York, Amocanti partnered with DELTUR Kunst- und Musikagentur in Heide, Germany in January 2011 to form Amocanti Europe. The hope is that Amocanti and Amocanti Europe will have franchises around the globe continuing to educate, inform and entertain the millions of school-aged children and their parents who do not have easy access to classical vocal music. In April 2011, following the devastating tsunami in Japan, Schuster together with DELTUR spearheaded the recording of Daniel L√©o Simpson's Ave Maria as part of the international Support Japan effort. During 2011, Schuster, in partnership with mezzo-soprano Debra Patchell, released two CD's - PS* Because We're Not Finished Yet and PS - It's Christmas. In January 2012, Schuster, together with award-winning guitarist, Peter Fletcher, appeared at Carnegie Hall Weill Auditorium in a program of music for the voice and guitar. Included were the world premiere of Clarice Assad's Enquanto a noite durar (While the night endures) and the New York premiere of Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco's The Divan of Moses-ibn-Ezra, op. 207. \\"Viva! New York\\" critic Lucas Eller wrote: \\"From the text, written in English, [The Divan] seemed a ponderous piece, recounting the exile of a 12th century rabbi and philosopher in Spain through his search for God, and the meaning of life and love and death. Mr. Schuster‚Äôs diction was crisp and clear and it was easy to follow the story as it was told without having to refer to the program. In fact, The Divan seemed more like a one-act opera, full of drama and pathos, joy and sorrow. Mr. Fletcher played masterfully, creating many moments of contrast and rhythms. Despite its length (nearly 45 minutes), the audience was swept away by the tale of this 12th century figure; spellbound by Mr. Schuster‚Äôs convincing performance, waking as the last lines of text were spoken dramatically rather than sung, and applauding enthusiastically.\\" In 2015, the tenor returned to Indianapolis where he joined the Indianapolis Symphonic Choir and performed as soloist with the combined Chinese American choirs in a performance of a Chinese Cantata in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. In 2016 Schuster will be heard as soloist in Schubert's Mass in C (February) and with the Butler Opera Theater in a production of \\"Pirates of Penzance\\" (April). In 2017, Mr. Schuster presented a solo concert \\"American Composers - Then and Now\\", as part of the Butler Artists Series, featuring the works of classical composers such as Hoiby, Barber, Rorem and premiered the cycle \\"Fair Haiku\\" by Michael Scherperel. A recording will be released in early 2018. Following the success of the \\"American Composers\\", the artist was invited to take part in the Duckwall Artist Series, where the program is all German (Ein Deutscher Abend\\") and will present another cycle composed by Michael Scherperel, \\"Tagtraume\\", for tenor, string trio and clarinet, as well as works of Beethoven, Mahler and Wagner. This concert will be broadcast and recorded live for release in the summer. Mr. Schuster will then be in Germany for a perforrmance of Franck's \\"Sieben Letzten Worte\\" on Good Friday.

She is the former wife of Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, a disputed head of the House of Savoy. Biography=Family Princess Claude was born in Larache, Morocco as the ninth child and fifth daughter of Henri, Count of Paris, Orl√©anist claimant to the French throne, and his wife Princess Isabelle of Orl√©ans-Braganza. One of eleven siblings, her eldest brother was Henri, Count of Paris, who succeeded their father as head of the Orl√©ans family, and two of her sisters also became consorts of pretenders to abolished thrones; Anne, Duchess of Calabria and Diane, Duchess of W√ºrttemberg. Upon repatriation to France after the law of banishment against her father was repealed in 1950, her family moved from Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera to France, where they grew up at the Manoir C≈ìur-Volant in the Louveciennes suburb of Paris. Education She began school in Portugal, at Lisbon's Saint-Louis-des-Fran√ßais. She then spent some time at the Mayfield School in East Sussex, England. In France, she and her sisters received private instruction, and she completed her studies at the Institut Sainte-Marie in Neuilly-sur-Seine.de Montjouvent, Philippe. ‚Äò‚ÄôLe Comte de Paris et sa Descendance‚Äô‚Äô.

Marriage and issue On 22 July 1964 in Sintra, Princess Claude married her second cousin, Prince Amedeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta. He was the only son of Prince Aimone, Duke of Aosta, second cousin-once-removed of Italy's last king, Umberto II. Aimone was briefly made nominal head of an Italian puppet state during World War II as King Tomislav II of Croatia.Willis, Daniel. The Descendants of Louis XIII. Clearfield, 1999, Baltimore, US. pp. 97, 675‚Äì676. . Claude was the third Orleanist princess to hold the title Duchess of Aosta by marriage. At the time of their wedding, Amedeo was a student at the Morosini Naval College in Venice, which his father had also attended. The couple met while attending the wedding of Infante Juan Carlos of Spain and Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in May 1962 in Athens. They announced their engagement on 4 October 1963. The couple married in S√£o-Pedro de Penaferrim, a parish church twelve miles from Lisbon, The wedding had been planned for earlier in the month, but was rescheduled when King Umberto (godfather of the groom) was hospitalized for an abdominal operation. A Savoy family council having met at King Umberto's residence in exile at Cimiez, France in the summer of 1963, another was held in London secretly at the king's hospital bedside to discuss the prospect of the king's only son Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, choosing to marry a commoner, Marina Doria, which had become the subject of much media speculation. In view of his illness, Amedeo's imminent marriage to a suitable princess, and his son's ongoing relationship with Doria, Umberto contemplated publicly abdicating (having left Italy for exile in 1946 pursuant to an anti- monarchy plebiscite, he had not formally renounced) and recognizing Amedeo as the successor to his claim to Italy's abolished throne. Present at this meeting, along with the princes Vittorio Emanuele and Amedeo, was Umberto's estranged consort, Queen Marie-Jos√©, whose objections dissuaded the king from issuing a declaration. Instead, Amedeo announced that he would postpone his wedding for the duration of Umberto's convalescence to ensure his presence at the nuptials, while Vittorio Emanuele issued a statement affirming that he remained his father's rightful heir and had no intention of marrying Marina Doria (nonetheless, he would do so, without his father's declared consent, in 1970). The wedding was attended by 300 guests, including King Umberto and the Prince and Princess of Spain. Two days later the newlyweds received a nuptial blessing during an audience with Pope Paul VI in the Vatican. After the duke completed his duties as a naval officer, the couple were given the Borro by Aimone's mother, a large estate in the Tuscan village of San Giustino Valdarno, near Fiesole, Italy, where they cultivated vineyards. Occasionally they undertook dynastic responsibilities as representatives in Italy of King Umberto, but largely raised their children in the countryside.

Rosselot (January 11, 1908 - August 12, 1972) was an American physicist and engineering executive at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Georgia Tech Research Institute and Bendix Corporation (now owned by Honeywell). He was an IEEE Fellow. Early life Rosselot was born January 11, 1908 in Westerville, Ohio. As a child, Rosselot traveled to France and England and became somewhat proficient in French. He attended and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Otterbein College in 1929, a Master of Arts from Ohio State University in 1930, and a Ph.D. from Ohio State University in 1936. In 1930, he married Gladys Anna Dickey, and would eventually have five children with her. Georgia Tech In 1934, Rosselot came to Georgia Tech. Initially an Instructor in Physics (1934‚Äì35 and 1936‚Äì37) and Mathematics (1935‚Äì36), he quickly ascended through Assistant Professor in Physics (1937‚Äì39) to Associate Professor of Physics (1940‚Äì41) and later Professor of Physics (1941‚Äì43). In 1950, Rosselot was selected as chairman of the Engineering College Research Council (part of the American Society for Engineering Education conference, held at the University of Washington that year). In 1940, Rosselot was appointed by Georgia Institute of Technology president Marion L. Brittain as the assistant director of the Engineering Experiment Station (now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute). From 1941 to 1952, Rosselot was the organization's director, replacing the recently deceased acting director Harold Bunger. In his tenure as director of Georgia Tech's Engineering Experiment Station, World War II significantly increased the number and value of contracts coming to the station, and is credited with GTRI's entry into electronics, especially telecommunications and electronic warfare. At the end of World War II, Georgia Tech had about $240,000 annually in sponsored research. Other accomplishments during Rosselot's administration at the Engineering Experiment Station included the purchase of an electron microscope in 1946 for $13,000 (), the first such instrument in the Southeastern United States and one of few in the United States at the time. The Research Building was expanded, and a $300,000 () Westinghouse A-C network calculator was given to Georgia Tech by Georgia Power in 1947. Rosselot's administration also included the 1946 establishment of the Industrial Development Council, renamed to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1948 and to its present name, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, in 1984. When the Georgia Board of Regents ruled that all money received in a year had to be spent that year; this was problematic because most government contracts span multiple years. Georgia Tech president Blake Van Leer and vice president Cherry Emerson created the solution, a non-profit corporation that would manage contracts for research services and subsequently hire the Engineering Experiment Station to perform the research. The new organization would also handle patents garnered through research, and distribute funds garnered from contracts and patents as needed. In 1951, there was a dispute over station finances and Rosselot's hand in the foundation of Scientific Atlanta against Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson. When it was founded in October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Atlanta; at issue was potential conflicts of interest with his role at Georgia Tech and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace. Rosselot resigned his post at Georgia Tech in November 1952 (and was on leave until March 1953), but his participation ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and made way for further technology transfer efforts by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center. Bendix In 1953, Rosselot joined Bendix Corporation as their Director of Engineering. He offered for Georgia Tech to match his potential salary at Bendix, but Georgia Tech president Blake Van Leer felt that such a move would be a dangerous precedent. Rosselot became Director of Scientific and University Relations for Bendix in 1955. Rosselot would later become director of Bendix's Research Laboratories Division, and later vice president. In July 1972, Rosselot retired from Bendix due to illness, and he died of acute leukemia on August 12, 1972.

The force collaborates with law enforcement agencies of the federal government of the United States such as the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the United States Marshals Service, and the Department of Homeland Security among others. History FURA's story dates back to the early establishment of the Spanish Civil Guard as this police system used as a main transport horses. After the Spanish-American War where Puerto Rico becomes possession of the United States, the Insular Police Puerto Rico was established February 1899, during the period for provision of the Military Governor Guy B. Henry. By this time the main ways of transportation on the island were the horses. Therefore, these were used by police to move their staff to address the grievances of the people and force the security system in place then. Over the years, the development progress of the island and the changes in the way of life, the new technology replaces the use of horses which had rendered a service of great benefit to the town. By the end of the 1950s at the behest of the Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, in response to booming tourist area of San Juan, became necessary to resort again to the implementation of the horses as an additional tool in preventing crime. This unit composed of one Sergeant, four officers and four horses purchased locally. In 1960 a sergeant and four PRPD officers were trained at the New York Police Mounted Academy. In 1963, a new tool came to the PRPD, and that was the helicopter. The PRPD air unit was stationed at Isla Grande Airport, later to be known as Roig Police Air Base. Its fleet consisted of Fairchild Hiller FH-1100 and OH-23 Raven. On January 1, 1971 the Order was drawn up which implements 71-1 Labor Standards and Procedures for the Mounted Unit. This indicated that it offers its services mainly in the coastal area in the prevention and enforcement of laws as established in Puerto Rico. If necessary and required the unit can expand its services to anywhere in the island. In 1979, the Puerto Rico Special Weapons and Tactics (S.W.A.T.) was formed within the Tactical Operations Division of the San Juan area, under the supervision of Sgt. Faustino Mendoza and Commander Jose E. S√°nchez. The Puerto Rico Police, decided to create this group after the events occurred with Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. The division as well was created in 1986 under Executive Order 4645-B as the \\"United Forces of Rapid Action Corps. (FURA) against drug trafficking.\\" It will integrate the units of Rescue, Mounted, Divers, SWAT, Aereal Services, Canine and Maritime. On February 25, 1993, by Executive Order EO-1993-07, was converted into a regular program of programmatic and organizational structure of the Puerto Rico Police Department. Today, FURA works in conjunction with law enforcement agencies of the U.S. government, such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Coast Guard, among others. During 2019, FURA agents confiscated 8659 kilos of cocaine, 65 lbs and 256 marijuana plants and 3 kilos of heroin. Units The United Forces of Fast Action has 6 units that united forces with U.S. agencies to prevent the entry of drugs, weapons and illegal immigrants to Puerto Rico. Also provides support to units of the Puerto Rico Police Department and the police departments of 78 municipalities during interventions, riots, police raids or other situation that requires help from FURA. These units are: Mounted Unit Is the oldest unit from the Puerto Rico Police, formed in the time of the Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico, before the U.S. invasion of 1898. It became official as a unit in 1899 by Col. Frank Thacher. It was an essential unit during the first half of the 20th century. Then, governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n put the mounted unit to the tourist areas of Puerto Rico to call the attention of the tourist and provide better protection. Today, the PRPD Mounted unit is used in tourist areas of the San Juan Metropolitan Area like beaches and waterfronts. They are trained to use their horses to stop offenders, and they can use their horse as a method of intimidation in times of police intervention with offenders. There are 3 stations of the Mounted Unit, and if needed by police to patrol an area at festivals or family activities of large concentration of the audience, the unit moved its staff to that area needed for as long as necessary. The unit has its stations at: * San Juan * Pi√±ones (Loiza) * Boquer√≥n (Cabo Rojo) * Ensenada (Gu√°nica) Air Services The Air Services of FURA was formed in 1963 as the Puerto Rico Police Air Unit at the Isla Grande Airport, later to be known by the police as Roig Police Air Base, in honor of whom formed the unit, Salvador T. Roig. Its fleet consisted of Fairchild Hiller FH-1100 and OH-23 Raven. The environment in the unit was light and quietly, unit the drug era of the late 1970s when Puerto Rico was becoming a bridge for drugs to the United States. In the early 1980s, the violence for drugs in Puerto Rico was rising in an alarming rate, and the helicopters was becoming a coastal patrol unit to catch in sight boats with thousand of pounds of drugs and illegal weapons. In the streets, the helicopters use at day was better that at night, because of the need of better equipment. In 1986, when FURA was formed, U.S. funds for law enforcement helped the unit to get better equipment, including state of the art helicopters. The fleet was changed to three MBB/Kawasaki BK 117, 3 MD Helicopters MD 500 and Bell 206 with Tail Numbers N117PD,N118PD and N119PD respectively. Those BK117 by that time were \\"state of the art\\" on equipment for the police patrolling missions. One has weather radar and full IFR capable. The Puerto Rico Police become one of the first air unit, through the United State to operate a large fleet of BK117 on the police mission. Today, those BK117 are not airworthy because of mechanical problems and most of them were auctioned. In the mid 1990s, the air unit receive one MD 520N NOTAR system, tail number N128PD. Also, one Beechcraft Super King Air, from the program High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. This aircraft have the same equipment as United States Customs Service aircraft. The primary mission is drug trafficking monitoring. In 1995 the Puerto Rico Air Unit received, five Bell OH-58 Kiowa from U.S. Army Donation. The OH-58C are Demilitarized (\\"demilitarized\\" means converted to non-military use or purpose, returned to a civilian field). Today, this fleet of OH-58C is \\"Not Airworthy\\". In 2000, the air unit received three brand new helicopters, Bell 407 tail number N137PD and N311DJ, one Bell 412 tail number N136PD. The Bell 412 was equipped \\"multi- mission\\" with rescue cable. In 2006, FURA received two new Bell 407 tail number N138PD and N139PD helicopters with new Wescam technology, including more powerful searchlights and heat-seeking monitors that it can use to search for a person under any obstacle. Also, it received a telephoto camera that can see a license plate very clearly from in the air. The system are capable of transmitting live image to ground units. The air services is divided in 2 regions: * Northern: Based at Roig Police Air Base in Isla Grande, patrols from the coast of Aguadilla to Yabucoa. *Southern: Based at Mercedita Airport in Ponce, it patrols from Maunabo to Rincon. Today, airworthy fleet consists of one Cessna 310, two Cessna 404, four Bell 407s, one Bell 412, and three MD Helicopters MD 500 and one MD520N. The Beechcraft Super King Air and the OH-58 Kiowa were remove from the fleet because of maintinace cost. The air services is the main component of FURA, and collaborates in SWAT exercises and rescue mission, coastal patrol and air support for ground units. Maritime Unit The Maritime Unit of FURA is in charge of coastal and harbor patrol, illegal utilization of recreational boats, sea rescue and prevent the entrance of illegal drugs, weapons and immigrants to Puerto Rico. It was created as a single unit of the PRPD in the late 1930s, with headquarters in the San Juan harbor. Today, the Maritime Unit has 11 stations located in different places around Puerto Rico, creating a barrier for drugs, weapons and illegal immigrants, and better protection for citizens in coastal waters. They coordinate with air units of FURA, U.S. Coast Guard and CBP's Office of Air and Marine. S.W.A.T. Created in 1979 within the Tactical Operations Division of the San Juan area, the Special Weapons and Tactics Team of the PRPD retains its original responsibility to intervene in situations of hostage rescue, anti-sniper operations, search and arrest dangerous fugitives and to support other units of the PRPD. The unit works with U.S. federal agencies to fill raids and other high-risk situations. Also, the team is highly trained to conduct missions to protect dignitaries from other countries. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 nationwide SWAT teams are responsible for serving as primary units to intervene in places where the use or suspected use of weapons of mass destruction, where the assigned personnel are trained. Divers The Divers Unit of FURA performs search and rescue of missing persons in the water bodies of Puerto Rico. They also make inspections of ships and cruises as part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the San Juan Bay and on the entrance of the Ponce harbor. They perform special services for maritime surveillance, such as raids, coastal patrols and others. Rescue The rescue Unit of FURA are responsible for the rescue efforts of search and rescue missions for missing persons, building collapses, landslides or other situation requiring their assistance. They also help fire rescue units and or emergency management units in traffic accidents or people who need to be displaced by floods. Also, provides support to PRPD units at the time of rupture or penetrate steel doors, gates, windows, etc.. Also, with the help of Air Services Unit and Maritime Unit, serve as rescue swimmers in times of offshore rescue or flooded areas.

It currently houses 4,500 animals representing 550 species. The public aquarium currently consists of five main exhibits. History The Loveland Living Planet Aquarium was founded in 1997 by Brent Andersen, a Utah native and marine biology graduate from the University of California Santa Barbara. It is a regional attraction with over 850,000 annual visitors. The initial plan was to build a aquarium that showed ecosystems from around the world. Site locations for the aquarium were considered in Salt Lake County and Utah County, and feasibility studies indicated downtown Salt Lake City would be the best location. The first education component was launched in February 1999, when the Aquavan was outfitted with educational portable marine exhibits and began visiting Utah schools. In 2004, in order to garner support for the full- size aquarium, the young organization opened a 10,000 sq ft exhibit at the Gateway Mall in downtown Salt Lake offering an exclusive experience of marine and freshwater life that was not then available in Utah's arid climate. The Living Planet Aquarium Preview Exhibit featured freshwater fish, sharks, stingrays, eels, a coral reef, a giant octopus, a small theater, and other interactive exhibits. Attendance reached over 150,000 visitors per year the first two years and the small space was quickly outgrown. The Aquarium relocated in June 2006 to a much larger space in Sandy, Utah. Attendance reached 460,000 visitors per year. The long range plan to eventually construct a campus that would house an Aquarium and a Science Learning Center continued to get support from the community over the next 4 years and in 2010 several prominent members of the business community joined to lead the Board of Trustees including Ken Murdock, Jim Loveland, Tim Cosgrove, Jeff Flamm, Rick White, Ron Nielsen, Michele Hilton and Paul Hutchinson. . The Loveland Family Foundation had been a long time donor, and in 2011 presented a lead gift that allowed the organization to accelerate fundraising, purchase 17 acres of land and raise $27 million to build the Aquarium's permanent home in Draper, Utah.. The Loveland Living Planet Aquarium opened to the public on March 24, 2014 and saw over 1.1 million visitors the first year of operation. The Aquarium is a 501(c)(3)non-profit organization. Exhibits= Ocean Explorer  Ocean Explorer features saltwater species from all over the world including sea jellies, eels, seahorses and seven species of sharks. Shark species include brown-banded bamboo sharks, nurse sharks, sandbar sharks, blacktip reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks, grey reef sharks, and zebra sharks. One of the most popular features is the 40-foot shark tunnel. Guests can view the sharks, sea turtles and sting rays swimming just inches away! The shark tunnel weighs 26,000 pounds and was lifted through the roof of the aquarium with a crane. The tunnel is made from 3.5 inch thick acrylic.  Journey to South America  Journey to South America takes you through the rain forests of South America, where you will encounter a 14-foot anaconda, piranha, caiman, desert insects, tree boas, electric eels, tree frogs and Amazon giants. The exhibit also educates guests about the biodiversity of rain forest ecosystems, the benefits rain forests provide us and how we all can help protect these amazing habitats!  Discover Utah  Discover Utah houses some of Utah's threatened and endangered species such as June suckers and least chub. The largest exhibit in this gallery features three male North American river otters which will serve to educate visitors about river otters, otter reintroduction efforts, and release locations in Utah. Families can learn all about the importance of preserving and protecting Utah's waterways as they explore and experience this exhibit.  Antarctic Adventure  Antarctic Adventure immerses guests in a Falkland Islands research station where they will meet gentoo penguins.  Expedition: Asia  Expedition: Asia opened on June 15, 2016. The traveling exhibit features three male Asian small-clawed otters, three Asian arowana, and many different species of Asian birds, fish, and reptiles. The main feature of Expedition: Asia are the aquarium's two clouded leopards, Koshi and Rhu. New Expansion A new expansion was added to the Loveland Living Planet Aquarium. The large, alien-like structure was once used in U2's stage for their 360¬∞ World Tour. Now, visitors will have the opportunity to experience more sights and sounds in the plaza. Community outreach The aquarium's education department currently operates two outreach programs: the Utah Waters Van and the Rain forest Van. The outreach programs visit over 450 elementary schools statewide each year, reaching nearly 80,000 students. Field trip programs for pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade and a teacher professional development program with resources for fourth grade teachers are offered.

Plot The story revolves around a teenage boy named Al Haddin, nicknamed \\"Aladdin\\", who is living with his widowed mother Janet and his alcoholic grandfather Jeremiah in Miami, Florida. He and his family live in poverty since his father's untimely demise; his mother slaves away in the nightclub of Monti Siracusa, a local mobster boss who runs a citywide protection racket. Jeremiah aggravates this situation by blowing the little money Janet makes on alcohol and horse races. Al has to work part-time in an antique shop to support his family as best he can. One day, Al's boss brings an old lamp, which a fisherman acquaintance of his has just salvaged from the ocean, to the store and orders Al to polish it. As Al rubs on the lamp, a genie - the very one from Aladdin's tale - suddenly appears before him and proclaims him his new master. After recovering from his first shock, Al begins to use the genie's power to fulfill some of his most eager wishes: beating up a bully and his gang, winning the affection of Patricia, his long- time crush, and riding in a real Rolls Royce, something his late father had always dreamed of. More importantly, Al begins to view the Genie as a friend and asks him only for his most fondest wishes without overindulging himself. The presence of the Genie and his powers, however, gradually begin to draw in trouble. Patricia's father, Police Sergeant O'Connor, begins to take an unwelcome interest in the brand-new Rolls Royce cars Al suddenly begins to get out of nowhere; the Genie interferes with Siracusa's illicit business, which frustrates the mobster to no end, and is arrested twice for driving without a license, which earns him two temporary stints in prison (although he escapes once Al summons him again). In addition, his powers only work during the day, as they have to regenerate overnight, which proves a bit problematic at times, such as when Al is kidnapped by a band of child snatchers and has to wait come morning before the Genie can overcome the gangsters. In due time, the Chief of the Police learns of the Genie's mysterious abilities and orders his superintendent to bring the Genie to him. Eventually, Siracusa abducts Janet and Jeremiah and begins to brutally question them about the Genie. Although it is night when Al summons him, the Genie's physical strength proves more than enough to finish Siracusa's gang by himself, and the gangsters are arrested. Under a false pretense, the Genie is taken away to be dissected, but Al, fearing the worst, finds him before this deed can be executed and manages to convince the Police Chief that he is not an alien but a real-life genie. The Chief then asks Al to have the Genie disable the entire world's military arsenal - all except of his own private army, so that he can seize control over the world. The Genie, however, refuses to fulfill this wish, as it would seriously upset the balance of power, and he and Al make their escape on the Chief's office carpet converted into a flying carpet. The pair proceeds to the Bermuda Triangle, where the Genie prepares to sink the lamp into the depths of the sea to prevent his powers from being abused. Al, however, unwilling to let his friend go, asks for one final wish, which is fulfilled. With the reward money from Siracusa's capture, the Haddins buy the nightclub and celebrate its reopening, with the Genie staying with them as a normal human being.

Studies show that the recycling rate for beverage containers is vastly increased with a bottle bill. The United States' overall beverage container recycling rate is approximately 33%, while states with container deposit laws have a 70% average rate of beverage container recycling.

Proponents of container deposit legislation have pointed to the small financial responsibilities of the states. Financing these programs are the responsibility of the beverage industry and consumers. Producers are responsible for disposing of returned products, while consumers are responsible for collecting their refunds. In Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, and Massachusetts the courts have ruled that unclaimed deposits are deemed abandoned by the public and are therefore property of the state.

Sustained Ottoman resistance allowed French and British troops to build up a significant army in Varna, even though after six weeks of siege the Russians were about to storm the fortress, they decided to lift the siege and retreat from the area, thus ending the Danubian phase of the war. Background This battle took place during the Danube campaign of the Crimean War. In the spring of 1854, following the winter lull in campaigning, the Russians determined to advance into Ottoman territory. In the east an army numbering 50,000 under General A. N. Luders crossed the border from Bessarabia into Dobruja to occupy various strong points there. By the beginning of April the Russians were at the site of Trajan's Wall, 30 miles east of Silistra. Meanwhile, the central force under Prince Mikhail Gorchakov had crossed the river and had advanced to lay siege to Silistra itself. Silistra was defended by an Ottoman force of 12,000, under Commander Omar Pasha, and was heavily fortified. Action In 1854 Silistra was fortified with an inner citadel and an outer ring of ten forts while outside a mobile army protected access to supply routes. The Ottoman army at Silistra was composed mostly of albanians and egyptians; two British Officers, Captain James Butler and Lieutenant Charles Nasmyth, were some of the foreign officers assisting the Ottoman troops, Nasmyth arrived at the town of Silistria on the Danube before it was besieged by the Russians on 28 March 1854, and, with Captain Butler of the Ceylon Rifles, offered his services to the garrison, both men had served with the East India Company Army. 300x300px On 5 April the vanguard of the Russian force under General Karl Schilder and his assistant Lieutenant-Colonel Eduard Totleben arrived at the fortress and commenced building entrenchments. However, they were unable to completely surround the town, and the Ottoman forces were able to keep the garrison supplied. On 22 April Field Marshal Prince Ivan Paskevich, the commander of all Russian forces, arrived to take charge of the siege. On 28 May, after a sally from the Turkish Garrison, the heavily fortified fort of Arab Tabia, a key outwork, was assaulted and briefly captured, but the attackers were left without support and were ordered to withdraw, losing 700 men in total, including General Dmitriy Selvan, who was mortally wounded in the assault. Official Ottoman proclamations announced that their losses were 189 men. Musa Pasha, a Turkish commander, was among the dead. On 10 June Ivan Paskevich claimed to have been hit when an Ottoman shell exploded nearby. Although he was not wounded, the seventy-two-year old Field Marshal retired and returned to Warsaw while his place was taken by Prince Gorchakov. On 13 June Schilder was also wounded and died shortly after, a week later, on 20 June, Arab-Tabia was finally captured. On 21 June the Russians prepared to storm the main fortress. However at 2am on 21 June, just two hours before the assault was due to take place and in the midst of troop movements, Gorchakov received orders from Paskevitch to raise the siege and return to his positions north of the Danube. The concentration of allied French and British troops in the vinicity of Varna as well as Austria's new treaty with Turkey signed on 14 June, made Nicholas I order a strategic withdrawal. The order was obeyed immediately on 24 June the Russian army crossed the Danube destroying the bridge behind them. The Russians casualties were 2,500 dead and 1783 wounded during the siege. Aftermath The Russian offensive had been stopped by diplomatic pressure and the threat of military action by the Austrians. Following the retreat Nicholas I acceded to the Austrian-Ottoman occupation of the Danubian principalities thus signalling the end of the Danubian phase of the war.

The text of the treaty establishes a boundary that runs for 220 nautical miles and separates the Cayman Islands from the Honduran Swan Islands and Cayo Gorda. From its northernmost point the boundary proceeds southeast until it turns due east when it is almost halfway between the 18th and 17th parallel north. Each of the two portions of the boundary consists of a single straight-line maritime segments. The entire boundary is defined by three individual coordinate points. The far western point of the border is a tripoint with Haiti. The most western part of the boundary forms an agreed tripoint with Cuba, while the easternmost part forms a not-yet-confirmed tripoint with Jamaica. The treaty came into force on 1 March 2002 after it had been ratified by both states. The full name of the treaty is Treaty between the Government of the Republic of Honduras and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the delimitation of the maritime areas between the Cayman Islands and the Republic of Honduras.

Thomalla was in charge of construction for the Operation Reinhard death camps Be≈Ç≈ºec, Sobibor and Treblinka during the Holocaust in Poland. Operation Reinhardt Born in Annahof in the former Upper Silesia region of the German Empire (now, the village of Sowin, Opole Voivodeship, Poland). Thomalla became a member of the Nazi Party in 1932: (no. 1,238,872) and SS (no. 41,206). The first death camp to be constructed under Thomalla's supervision was Be≈Ç≈ºec. Construction started on 1 November 1941 and was completed in March 1942. He then proceeded to design and supervise the construction of Sobibor in March 1942. Workers employed for building the camp were local people from neighboring villages and towns.Klee, Ernst, Dressen, Willi, Riess, Volker The Good Old Days: The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders, p. 231. . These workers consisted of about eighty Jews from ghettos within the vicinity of the camp. A squad of ten watchmen trained at Trawniki concentration camp guarded these workers. Upon completion of the camp, these Jews were shot. When Thomalla completed his building assignment in Sobibor he was replaced there as commandant by Franz Stangl in April 1942. He then proceeded to Treblinka which copied the design of Sobibor. SS commander Erwin Lambert who had previously been assigned to the Action T4 euthanasia program and had constructed the new gas chambers in Treblinka, testified about Thomalla: Between July 1942 and October 1943, around 850,000 people were killed in Treblinka.Henry Friedlander.

Cooke House, later known as the Marks Estate, at 3860 Old Pali Road, Honolulu, Hawaii, was built for Clarence Hyde Cooke, the second son of Charles Montague Cooke and Anna Rice Cooke, heirs of the Castle & Cooke fortune. It was designed by the architect Hardie Phillip, built in 1929-32, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 as a fine example of the upper-class, Hawaiian-style, great mansion of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Phillip first worked in Honolulu as a member of the firm of Bertram Goodhue and Associates of New York City, who also designed the Honolulu Museum of Art on the site of the former home of Anna Rice Cooke, the C. Brewer Building downtown, and Lihiwai, the residence of Territorial Governor George R. Carter in Nuuanu Valley. For Clarence Cooke, Phillip designed a sprawling 24-room mansion fit for the lavish entertainment it became known for. Features of the evolving Hawaiian Regional style of the era include numerous lanai and open spaces, double-pitched hipped roof (\\"Dickey\\" roof), and lushly landscaped grounds. The two-story, whitewashed building is constructed of brick on the ground floor and board and batten on the upper floor. A porte cochere topped by an open lanai leads to a formal entry hall with staircase, which provides access to both floors of two wings running in opposite directions. There are also three guest cottages, a gatehouse, and a four-car garage with servants' quarters above, and a swimming pool with dressing rooms at the rear of the property. The pool area was earlier designed in Neoclassical style by Hart Wood. Cooke left the estate to the Academy of Arts, which sold it in 1946 to Elizabeth Marks, the wealthy daughter of Lincoln L. McCandless. Her husband Lester Marks was a land commissioner for the Territory who resigned in 1949 when Governor Ingram M. Stainback decided to build a new Pali Highway up Nuuanu Valley, right through the middle of their estate. They sued to block the use of their land for the highway, but in 1956 the Territory finally bought the estate for $624,000. However, the Markses were allowed to live in their old home until 1976, when Mrs. Marks was evicted. By that time, she was a widow, but still wealthy enough to buy a new house at Black Point in Kahala. State government departments then took it over, using it for office space, conferences, and special events. After trying to sell it for years, in 2002 the State finally auctioned off the property, which had been appraised at $4.5 million. The winning bid of $2.5 million came from Unity House Incorporated, a labor union nonprofit organization, which planned to use it for office space and a retiree activity center. In 2006, it was purchased by Douglas Himmelfarb, a Hawaii art and furniture dealer, for $4.41 million. During that time, much of the house was renovated and in 2010 was put up for sale at $9.9 million, then reduced to $8.5 million without finding a buyer. After Himmelfarb experienced financial difficulties, JPMorgan Chase Bank took possession of the property in 2014 for $6.5 million through a foreclosure. The home was eventually sold in late 2016 for $3.9 million.

This is done mainly through its expression in the hippocampus and the amygdala. Studies supporting the role of CREB in cognition include those that knock out the gene, reduce its expression, or overexpress it.  Memory  Research suggests that CREB has a role in the molecular steps that stabilize memory in the brain, including that of emotional memory. Evidence of CREB's role in emotional memory falls into three experimental categories: negative manipulations (where the levels of CREB were lowered), positive manipulations (where the levels of CREB were increased), and non-interventions (where the endogenous levels of CREB were tracked before and after learning). Knockout Knockout studies in Aplysia sea slugs indicated that decreasing CREB function blocks long-term changes in synaptic function, but not short- term ones. Changes in synaptic function (i.e., synaptic plasticity) are required for learning and memory As evidence of this, a line of mice with a targeted disruption of the Œ± and Œ¥ isoforms of CREB showed intact short-term memory, but disrupted long-term memory in several behavioral tasks, including contextual conditioning and spatial learning in the Morris water maze, two hippocampal-dependent learning tasks. Also, hippocampal electrophysiological studies revealed that the CREB mutation disrupted the stability of synaptic plasticity Genetic studies in Drosophila fruit flies also uncovered a role for CREB in memory, suggesting that CREB has a role in memory conserved evolutionarily. Knockdown There are several methods of knocking down (reducing the expression of) CREB: Antisense Antisense oligonucleotides (single strands of DNA or RNA that are complementary to a chosen sequence) against hippocampal CREB mRNA can lower levels of CREB within 6 hours of infusion and impair spatial memory. Tests given immediately after training showed that the antisense oligonucleotides against CREB do not disrupt short- term memory. Dominant negative Another strategy for interfering with CREB function is the use of a dominant negative transgenic strategy. In this strategy, a fragment of the CREB gene was expressed from a transgene in mice. The resulting transgenic protein was engineered to interfere with the normal function of CREB by competing with wild type (non-mutated) CREB for binding sites in the DNA; the transgenic protein lacks the domains required for making functional complexes. To regulate when the dominant negative CREB fragment interfered with normal CREB function, the mutant DNA was used to generate a fusion protein that also included a mutated ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen receptor, binding to tamoxifen rather than to estrogen. When exposed to tamoxifen, the dominant negative fragment changed the conformation of the fusion protein, became active, and could therefore interfere with CREB binding sites. One advantage of this inducible transgenic system is that the altered protein is constitutively present and can therefore be rapidly activated following the administration of tamoxifen. Use of the LBD system to knock down CREB protein function during training (using both contextual freezing and tone fear paradigms) produced a deficit in long-term, but not short-term, memory. Impairing CREB function did not impair retrieval of the consolidated memory. RNA interference Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can induce a selective degradation of the mRNA of the protein of interest. Infusion of siRNA segments against CREB have produced deficits in both contextual conditioning and forward trace conditioning. Activation A line of lacZ reporter mice (mice that have E. coli's gene attached to their CREB gene to produce a protein that is easily visualized), when trained with a context protocol, showed higher levels of CREB-mediated transcription in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus when compared to untrained mice or mice that did not associated content with shock (in fear conditioning) due to latent inhibition. Likewise, the lacZ mice that were trained with a tone protocol showed higher levels of CREB-dependent gene transcription in the amygdala than either mice with no training or mice in the unpaired group. There was no difference in CREB- dependent gene expression in the hippocampus of animals trained with a tone protocol. Rescue When a herpes simplex virus expressing CREB was infused into the amygdala of CREB knockout mice, the expression of CREB in the amygdala rescued the deficit, indicating that amygdal CREB is critical for memory in tone conditioning. Overexpression The role of overexpression of CREB has not been examined systematically in fear conditioning, and studies of other conditioning paradigms has produced mixed results. A 2001 study, which used viral transfection to overexpress CREB in the basolateral amygdala of rats, found that overexpression increased the fear-potentiated startle response. This suggests that CREB levels are limiting during the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle and that these levels are related to the strength of this form of memory. A more recent paper (2009), using a similar viral approach in the hippocampus, found that additional CREB expression could also enhance contextual fear conditioning, a result consistent with a role of the hippocampus in this form of conditioning. While viral CREB reversed the conditioning deficits in CREB knockout animals, additional CREB did not seem to enhance memory of the wild-type controls. Chronic enhancement of CREB, using genetic manipulations in mice, did not seem to enhance memory in a water maze task. Another 2009 study, which overexpressed CREB using the tetracycline transgenic dox system, found that, while additional CREB did not enhance acquisition, it did interfere with memory retrieval, suggesting that there may be an optimal level of CREB activation for normal memory function. Other papers suggest that CREB helps control intrinsic excitability, providing an additional mechanism by which CREB can contribute to memory acquisition and expression. Enhanced CREB-dependent gene expression increases the excitability of neurons in the basal amygdala and primes the consolidation of contextual and cued fear memory.

The hand is a very complex organ with multiple joints, different types of ligament, tendons and nerves. Hand disease injuries are common in society and can result from excessive use, degenerative disorders or trauma. Trauma to the finger or the hand is quite common in society. In some particular cases, the entire finger may be subject to amputation. The majority of traumatic injuries are work- related. Today, skilled hand surgeons can sometimes reattach the finger or thumb using microsurgery. Sometimes, traumatic injuries may result in loss of skin, and plastic surgeons may place skin and muscle grafts.Common Hand Problems Eaton Hand Surgery. Retrieved on 2010-01-20  Types  3D medical animation still showing Arthritis infected hand. Arthritis of the hand is common in females. Osteoarthritis of the hand joints is much less common than rheumatoid arthritis. As the arthritis progresses, the finger gets deformed and lose its functions. Moreover, many patients with rheumatoid arthritis have this dysfunction present in both hands and become disabled due to chronic pain. Osteoarthritis is most common at the base of thumb and is usually treated with pain pills, splinting or steroid injections.Hand Pain And Problems University of Maryland Medical Center. Retrieved on 2010-01-20 Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder of the hand. This disorder results from compression of an important nerve in the wrist. Disorders like diabetes mellitus, thyroid or rheumatoid arthritis can narrow the tunnel and cause impingement of the nerve. Carpal tunnel syndrome also occurs in people who overuse their hand or perform repetitive actions like using a computer key board, a cashiers machine or a musical instrument. When the nerve is compressed, it can result in disabling symptoms like numbness, tingling, or pain in the middle three fingers. As the condition progresses, it can lead to muscle weakness and inability to hold objects. The pain frequently occurs at night and can even radiate to the shoulder. Even though the diagnosis is straightforward, the treatment is not satisfactory.Hand Injuries UeMedicine Health. Retrieved on 2010-01-20 Dupuytren's contracture is another disorder of the fingers that is due to thickening of the underlying skin tissues of the palm. The disorder results in a deformed finger which appears thin and has small bumps on the surface. Dupuytren's contracture does run in families, but is also associated with diabetes, smoking, seizure recurrence and other vascular disorders. Dupuytren's does not need any treatment as the condition can resolve on its own. However, if finger function is compromised, then surgery may be required. Ganglion cysts are soft globular structures that occur on the back of the hand usually near the junction of the wrist joint. These small swellings are usually painless when small but can affect hand motion when they become large. The cysts contain a jelly like substance and usually do disappear on their own. If the ganglion cyst is not bothersome, it should be left alone. Just removing the fluid from the cyst is not curative because fluid will come back in less than a week. Surgery is often done for large cysts but the results are poor. Recurrences are common, and there is always the possibility of nerve or joint damage. Inflamed tendons of the hand. Tendinitis is disorder when tendons of the hands become inflamed. Tendons are thick fibrous cords that attach small muscles of the hand to bones. A Tendon is useful for generation of power to bend or extend the finger. When repetitive action is performed, tendons often get inflamed and present with pain and difficulty for moving the finger. In most cases, tendinitis can be treated with rest, ice and wearing splints. In some cases, an injection of corticosteroid may help. Tendinitis is primarily a disorder from overuse but if not treated properly, can become chronic. Trigger finger is a common disorder which occurs when the sheath through which tendons pass, become swollen or irritated. Initially, the finger may catch during movement but symptoms like pain, swelling and a snap may occur with time. The finger often gets locked in one position and it may be difficult to straighten or bend the finger. Trigger finger has been found to be associated with diabetes, gout and rheumatoid arthritis.  Causes  Fractures of the fingers occur when the finger or hands hit a solid object. Fractures are most common at the base of the little finger (boxer's fracture). Nerve injuries occur as a result of trauma, compression or over-stretching. Nerves send impulses to the brain about sensation and also play an important role in finger movement. When nerves are injured, one can lose ability to move fingers, lose sensation and develop a contracture. Any nerve injury of the hand can be disabling and results in loss of hand function. Thus it is vital to seek medical help as soon as possible after any hand injury.Hand Injuries and Disorders Medline Plus. Retrieved on 2010-01-20 Sprains result from forcing a joint to perform against its normal range of motion. Finger sprains occur when the ligaments which are attached to the bone are overstretched and this results in pain, swelling, and difficulty for moving the finger. Common examples of a sprain are jammed or twisted fingers. These injuries are common among ball players but can also occur in laborers and handy men. When finger sprains are not treated on time, prolonged disability can result.Common Orthopedic Hand and Wrist Injuries EmedMag. Retrieved on 2010-01-20  Diagnosis  Fracture of the tuft of the finger Finger injuries are usually diagnosed with x-ray and can get to be considerably painful. The majority of finger injuries can be dealt with conservative care and splints. However, if the bone presents an abnormal angularity or if it is displaced, one may need surgery and pins to hold the bones in place.  Treatment  Most hand injuries are minor and can heal without difficulty. However, any time the hand or finger is cut, crushed or the pain is ongoing, it is best to see a physician. Hand injuries when not treated on time can result in long term morbidity.Hand and Wrist Injuries American Academy of Family Physicians. Retrieved on 2010-01-20 Antibiotics in simple hand injuries do not typically require antibiotics as they do not change the chance of infection. Many hand injuries need surgery, but the time from injury to surgery (delays of up to 4 days) doesn't increase the chance of infection Epidemiology About 1.8 million people go to the emergency department each year due to hand injuries.

Mill Street is a street in Oxford, England. It is a cul-de-sac that runs south from the Botley Road close to Oxford railway station. It includes residential houses, mainly terraced, and some office space. Mill Street was built in the 1860s as part of the development of New Osney on what was then known as Osney Island. Overview At its southern end was Osney Mill (a disused flour mill on the River Thames), after which the street is named. The mill stood on the site of the now-destroyed Osney Abbey. Little is left of the abbey today, but there is still a rubble and timber- framed structure at the mill site, which may date from the 15th century, on private land but visible from the street. The remnants were Grade II listed in 1954. In 2004, plans for a new development of homes on the mill site were given planning approval by Oxford City Council. Between 2012 and 2014 the area around the mill was finally redeveloped. Close to the site of the former mill is Osney Lock, and to the south is Osney Mill Marina. To the east is Osney Cemetery, established in 1848 but now disused, between Mill Street and the railway tracks. Osney Lane leads from Mill Street over a footbridge across the railway tracks towards Oxpens Road and central Oxford to the north of the cemetery. Explosion On 14 February 2017, a large explosion heard across much of Oxford occurred at the southern end of Mill Street, in a three-storey block of flats at the junction with Gibbs Crescent, completely destroying the building. The end of Mill Street was cordoned off by police and local residents were evacuated from their homes. Local residents were left in a state of limbo after the explosion, being unable to return to their homes.

The boundary consists of 105 straight-line maritime segments defined by 106 individual coordinate points. The complexity of the boundary was a result of relatively strict adherence to the principle of forming a border at the precise equidistant line between the two territories.

An alternative form is \\"Hell is full of good meanings, but heaven is full of good works\\". Origin The exact origin of this proverb is unknown and its form has evolved over time. The modern expression, \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\\", was first published in Henry G. Bohn's A Hand-book of Proverbs in 1855. An earlier iteration, \\"Hell is full of good meanings and wishes\\", was published in 1670 in A Collection of English Proverbs collected by John Ray. In his play Romeo and Juliet, William Shakespeare wrote \\"Mercutio : The best intentions pave the way to Hell.\\" The earliest known text resembling this phrase occurs in Virgil's Aeneid: \\"facilis descensus Averno (the descent to hell is easy)\\". A biblical resemblance can be found in Ecclesiasticus 21:10, \\"The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell.\\" The proverb is commonly misattributed to Bernard of Clairvaux who supposedly wrote ( 1150), \\"L'enfer est plein de bonnes volont√©s ou d√©sirs\\" (hell is full of good wishes or desires). This citation was made in 1640, some five hundred years after his death, and this text has not been found in any of his published works. Another resemblance also can be found in one Hadith that Muhammad said: \\"Paradise is surrounded by hardships, and the Fire is surrounded by desires.\\" John Foxe quotes Tyndale as writing \\"Beware of good intents.\\" (The second part of \\"Chapter 213\\" of Acts and Monuments cites \\"Fol. 87\\" of \\"The Wicked Mammon\\".) Meaning A common meaning of the phrase is that individuals may have the intention to undertake good actions but nevertheless fail to take action. This inaction may be due to procrastination, laziness or other subversive vice. As such, the saying is an admonishment that a good intention is meaningless unless followed through. A different interpretation of the saying is that wrongdoings or evil actions are often undertaken with good intentions; or that good intentions, when acted upon, may have unintended consequences. An example is the introduction of invasive species, like the Asian carp introduced into the US, which has become a nuisance due to unexpected proliferation and behaviour. Studies Psychological studies of the effect of intention upon task completion by professors Peter Gollwitzer, Paschal Sheeran and Sheina Orbell indicate that there is some truth in the proverb. Perfectionists are especially prone to having their intentions backfire in this way. Some have argued that people are more likely to interpret their own actions as more well intended than the actions of others. Attempts to improve the ethical behaviour of groups are often counter-productive. If legislation is used for such an attempt, people observe the letter of the law rather than improve the desired behaviour. During negotiation, groups that are encouraged to understand the point of view of the other parties are worse at this than those whose perspective is not enlightened. The threat of punishment may make behavior less rather than more ethical. Studies of business ethics indicate that most wrongdoing is not due directly to wickedness but is performed by people who did not plan to err. Stephen Garrard Post, writing about altruism, suggests that good intentions are often not what they seem and that mankind normally acts from less worthy, selfish motives--\\"If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, it is partly because that is the road they generally start out on.\\" Artistic references Authors who have used the phrase include Charlotte Bront√´, Lord Byron, Randy Travis, Samuel Johnson,\\"Hell is paved with good intentions.\\" April 14, 1775 Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sir Walter Scott, S√∏ren Kierkegaard,Kierkegaard, Soren. (2013), Kierkegaard's Writings, XVI: Works of Love, Princeton University Press, p. 94, and Karl Marx. Ozzy Osbourne used the term in the song \\"Tonight\\" on his album Diary of a Madman. In his play Romeo and Juliet, William Shakespeare wrote it best: \\"Mercutio : The best intentions pave the way to Hell.\\" In the movie Highway to Hell, the phrase is taken literally to create one particular scene. The Good Intentions Paving Company has a team of Andy Warhols who grind good-intentioned souls into pavement. \\"I was only sleeping with my husband's boss to advance his career\\", says one. The figurative meaning of the phrase is a big part of the plot too, as several characters offer help the two protagonists on the Road to Hell, but all of them have ulterior motives. In the Discworld novel Eric by Terry Pratchett, as the Wizard Rincewind and teenaged demonologist Eric Thursley escape Pandemonium, they notice that the individual cobbles on the Road on Hell have good intentions written on them. These included \\"for the good of the kids\\", \\"I meant it for the best\\" and \\"we are equal opportunities employers\\". Pink used the phrase in her 2006 song \\"Dear Mr. President\\" to refer to the No Child Left Behind Act. Madonna uses this line in her 2008 single \\"4 Minutes,\\" featuring Justin Timberlake and Timbaland, off her eleventh studio album Hard Candy. The Chainsmokers utilize this phrase in their song \\"Good Intentions\\" featuring BullySongs The phrase is used in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"In the Pale Moonlight\\". The phrase is also used by Lauryn Hill in Mr. Intentional The phrase is also used in the 2020 \\"Living the Dream\\" by Five Finger Death Punch on their F8 album. A similar phrase, \\"our best intentions pave the way to hell\\", was used in 2013 film Romeo & Juliet by Mercutio after he was stabbed by Tybalt. This phrase was used in Jurassic Park 3 when Billy steals the raptor eggs to fund his University Department. The phrase was alluded to in both the title and lyrical poetry in Joanna Newsom's track \\"Good Intentions Paving Co.\\" on the 2010 album Have One on Me.

It consists of three main installments, Lost Planet: Extreme Condition (2006), Lost Planet 2 (2010) and Lost Planet 3 (2013) and a spin-off titled E.X. Troopers (2012). While Capcom developed Lost Planet, Lost Planet 2 and E.X. Troopers internally, Spark Unlimited were hired as an external developer for Lost Planet 3. As of December 31, 2019, the game series has sold 6.2 million units worldwide.CAPCOM  Game Series Sales Games=Lost Planet: Extreme Condition (2006) The first Lost Planet game takes place in the year known in the game as T.C. -80 on the fictional planet of E.D.N. III. After the Earth's conditions become too hostile for humans due to war, global warming and pollution, a fictional interstellar megacorporation named Neo-Venus Construction (NEVEC) plans to colonize E.D.N. III, a new Earth-like planet in the grip of a brutal ice age. NEVEC discovers that E.D.N. III is inhabited by an aggressive and territorial insectoid alien species named the Akrid, which come in all shapes and sizes and generate their own precious thermal energy. 150 years after a great war was fought in which the humans lost to the Akrid, the plot of the game revolves around Wayne Holden, a \\"snow pirate\\" who attempts to overthrow the ruthless NEVEC, who still vie for control over E.D.N. III, and help colonization efforts for the remainder of the human race by destroying the Akrid, all the while attempting to survive both betrayals and the extreme conditions of the planet. Lost Planet received mixed reviews on the PlayStation 3 and PC, but more positive reception for the Xbox 360 version which was the original lead platform. The game shipped over a million copies worldwide by January 2007 marking Capcom's second million seller for Xbox 360. As of March 2016, the game has sold over 1,600,000 copies on the Xbox 360 alone including downloadable copies. IGN gave the Xbox 360 version their Editor's Choice award, and it won the award for best Xbox 360 game at the Leipzig Games Convention. Lost Planet: Extreme Condition Colonies Edition (2008) The Colonies Edition is a gold edition version of Extreme Condition for the Xbox 360 and PC with new multiplayer maps, a Human vs Akrid multiplayer mode, and a selection of new multiplayer characters and weapons.Rumor: Lost Planet Colonies Finally AnnouncedSorry, But Lost Planet: Colonies is Lost Planet Redux, Joystiq Colonies also introduces four new single-player modes: Score Attack (points are given for each kill using combos), Time Trial Battle Mode, first person shooter mode, and Unlimited Mode. The game also includes cross-platform play between Xbox Live and Games for Windows ‚Äì Live users. The Colonies Edition is not compatible with the original Lost Planet save games or multiplayer game, so players of each release may only play with others who have the same release. The game was released in North America on May 27, 2008; in Japan on May 29; and in Europe on June 6. The Xbox 360 version saw positive reception in comparison to a mixed response for the PC version. Lost Planet 2 (2010) Lost Planet 2 is the sequel to Lost Planet: Extreme Condition, taking place ten years after the events of the first game, on the same fictional planet. It is both developed and published by Capcom. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on May 11, 2010 in the United States and in Europe (on May 20 in Japan). It was also released for Microsoft Windows for North America on October 12 and for Europe on October 15. Lost Planet 2 sold 1,900,000 copies between all platforms by March 2016 and across all platforms. Reception for the PlayStation 3 version matched the Xbox 360 version, however the PC version saw notable criticism. E.X. Troopers (2012) E.X. Troopers is a spin-off game of the Lost Planet series, it is developed by Capcom and released only in Japan for Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation 3 on November 22, 2012. The game added new and more dangerous hostile Akrid enemies along with several new weapons. Some revisions include a focus on lock-on based movement and shooting both on foot and in Vital Suits akin to Gundam vs Gundam as well as a series of Monster Hunter elements as the title shared the producer of recent installments of that series. The game saw lower sales than other games in the Lost Planet franchise, but positive reception from Famitsu. It also possesses a cult following leading to the western Capcom branch addressing interest and the Japanese branch releasing music tracks on the anniversary of the game's release. Lost Planet 3 (2013) Lost Planet 3 is the third numbered entry in the series and was developed by Spark Unlimited instead of internally by Capcom. It was released on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows in August 2013 and takes place in the same ice-age like environment as the first instead of the varied environments of the second. While all versions of the game received a mixed reception, Famitsu offered praise in their review for the renewed story focus. ReceptionDevelopment The main character, Wayne, shown in a promotional advertisement for the first Lost Planet Capcom first introduced Lost Planet on December 10, 2005 at an invite only press conference announcing Jun Takeuchi as both the producer and executive producer, Kenji Oguro as the designer and Shin Kurosawa whom wrote the original story. At the conference, Capcom announced that they would follow the tradition of basing the main character of their game after a real person. Capcom decided to base the main character Wayne after the famous Korean star, Byung Hun Lee. To capture the full essence of Lee, Capcom used a program called Face Robot. This allowed Capcom to use Lee's basic expressions and translate them to Wayne in the game. Capcom had Lee dress up in a recreation of Waynes attire and then did full body 3D scan to translate Lee into Wayne using a function called GATOR. But instead of using Lee for character animations, the developers did so manually. As for environments, Capcom used up to 300,000 to 600,000 polygons in the screen at once for a single battle. They then used an XSI program and then manually added in elaborate details. One of the main focuses of Lost Planet was to make a game that could be a commercial success in both North America and Japan. Lost Planet 2 runs on the MT-Framework 2.0, an updated version of the engine used in several Capcom- developed games. A support for the campaign mode can have up to 4 players working together via the internet.  Plot  The first Lost Planet begins in the year of the game T.C. -80 where the Earth has become too hostile for human life. A company named NEVEC (Neo-Venus Construction) tries to start colonization on the planet E.D.N. III. Upon arriving on the planet, NEVEC discovers an alien race called Akrid and are forced off the planet, momentarily stopping colonization efforts. Returning to E.D.N. III with an army prepared to fight, they find that the Akrid can only function because their bodies contain reserves of thermal energy (T-ENG), humans must also carry supplies of thermal energy to survive on E.D.N. III. NEVEC builds the first Vital Suit (VS), a mecha powered by T-ENG, to fight the Akrid. Meanwhile, civilian colonists and bands of E.D.N. III military personnel continue to seek out a nomadic existence as \\"snow pirates,\\" harvesting T-ENG from fallen Akrid. The story of the sequel takes place back on E.D.N. III, 10 years after the events of the first game. The snow has melted to reveal jungles and more tropical areas that have taken the place of more frozen regions. The game centers on a civil war to gain T-ENG. Player(s) can assume control of several different groups of soldiers, called Snow Pirates, and battle the Akrid. The Akrid have expanded their armies and return much more powerful in Lost Planet 2. Lost Planet 3 is a prequel to the first two games in the series, following the story of Jim Peyton on E.D.N. III. Film adaptation In July 2008, David Hayter (voice of Solid/Naked Snake in the video game series Metal Gear Solid and screenwriter of films such as X-Men, X2: X-Men United and Watchmen) was in talks with Warner Bros. to write and direct a film adaptation of Lost Planet. On July 15, at the 2008 E3 Expo, Capcom announced their partnership with Warner Brothers to make the film based on this game.Blast - E3 2008: Capcom‚Äôs big announcement was ... a movie- The Online Magazine Father and son producing team Avi and Ari Arad (The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man) also having been tapped to work on the project, and although no cast have yet been signed on, the film was initially set for release sometime in 2013. In 2010, Hayter told MTV that he penned a few drafts of the screenplay adaptation of the Capcom game, but he declared that they \\"had some internal issues between a couple of the companies, which I think has caused a delay there\\", indicating that the project had stalled. In 2014, Hayter revealed that plans for the film simply faded after the studio hit a \\"financial crash\\" around the time he submitted his draft.

His father was the reigning Duke of Lorraine and his mother a member of the House of Bourbon, then ruling the Kingdom of France. He became the Hereditary Prince at the death of his older brother Louis in 1711, but died of smallpox in 1723 at the age of sixteen, unmarried and without descendants. Biography Prince Leopold in 1710, portrait by Pierre Gobert. He was born at the Ch√¢teau de Lun√©ville to L√©opold, Duke of Lorraine and his wife √âlisabeth Charlotte d'Orl√©ans. L√©opold was the third son born to his parents. His eldest brother, also L√©opold (1699‚Äì1700), died aged eight months. Three other older siblings died in an outbreak of smallpox at Lun√©ville: √âlisabeth Charlotte (1700‚Äì1711), Marie Gabri√®le Charlotte (1702‚Äì1711) and Louis (1704‚Äì1711). The smallpox epidemic had killed other royalty such as the Grand Dauphin and the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I at the same time. In 1722 L√©opold also became the heir to the Duchy of Teschen which was given to his father in compensation for his father's maternal grandmother's rights to the Duchy of Montferrat in northern Italy, which Emperor Charles VI had taken and given to his allies, the Dukes of Savoy. In 1723 he was sent to Vienna to carry out his education under the supervision of Charles VI, his father's first cousin. Another reason for his journey was to forge a Habsburg-Lorraine alliance through a marriage with the Archduchess Maria Theresa. Soon afterward the prince caught smallpox at Lun√©ville and quickly died at the Ch√¢teau there. He was buried in the Ducal Crypt at the Church of Saint-Fran√ßois-des- Cordeliers, Nancy. His younger brother Francis Stephen became the Hereditary Prince and later married Maria Theresa, Habsburg heiress and future Queen regnant of Hungary and Bohemia.

Although simply modeled, this head is very expressive and, although it is small (6 cm) the details can clearly be seen. She wears a head band and her hair, piled on the left is also tied bt the scarf. There is a leaf over her right ear. Her ear rings are large and tubular Majapahit Terracotta is the terracotta art and craft dated from Majapahit era circa 13th to 15th century. Significant terracotta earthenware artifacts from this period were discovered in Trowulan, East Java. Over the years many terracotta sculptures and artifacts have been discovered as a result of agricultural activities, building roads etc. Some of these finds were brought together in the museum at Trowulan before World War II, but in the subsequent years much of this collection has been lost. Post WW II many of the pieces has been unearthed as the result of digging for gold. After the crops have been harvested the farmers lease their land to diggers who dig pits panning the alluvial soil for gold. The terracottas are an incidental find, often bearing the mark of the digging implement.H. R. A. Muller, Javanese Terracottas, Terra Incognito. 1978 Uitgeversmaatschappij De Tijdstroom B.V., Lochem. p. 7 Today, Trowulan Museum and National Museum of Indonesia host large collections of Majapahit terracotta art. Method High fired figurine with a glaze drip on her breast The word terracotta derives from the Latin word meaning burnt earth. Nowadays the word refers to all unglazed red earthenware objects. Much of the archeological studies of the area have focused on the reconstructions of the ruins.Hilda Soemantri, Majapahit Terracotta Art, 1997 Ceramic Society of Indonesia. p. 17 So far, in East Java no kilns have been found and most of the objects are relatively low fired, suggesting that the craftsmen worked by the earthenware method. They probably worked in a way similar to that being used today in Kasongan, near Yogyakarta and the one in Bali, where the figurines are sun dried. Then rice husks and straw heaped over them and set on fire. To attain a harder object the firing is repeated. So far no kilns that would have allowed higher temperatures to be reached have been discovered.Soedarmadji J H Darmais, Majapahit Terracotta, 2012, BAB Publishing, However, there is some evidence that there may have been kilns from one figurine that is of a stone ware and has a glaze drip on the breast. Artifacts=Containers Containers in various sizes and shapes have been discovered in Trowulan. The containers probably used for various purposes, from water container to grain container. From large jar to box shaped water container. The typical kendi, a bulbous and tall neck water vessel with breast-like spout, similar to those still in use today have been found from Majapahit period sites.Soedarmadji J H Darmais, Majapahit Terracotta, 2012, BAB Publishing, , p. 25 File:2 Majapahit Terracotta pot 2 with top.JPG File: 2 Majapahit terracotta pot 1 (2).JPG File:Majapahit terracotta Kendi, Ht 6.5 x 7 cm from the collectionof Balique Arts of Indonesia..JPGMiniature Kendi Ht 6.5 cm  Heads  Majapahit Terracotta head Many small heads are found in the surrounding environs with no bodies. These range in size from 3 cm up to 10 cm. Many of these heads show Javanese features with hair style and ear ornamentation. Some think that the reason there are so many more heads and headless bodies found than complete figurines is that they were decapitated in ritual offerings.Soedarmadji J H Darmais, Majapahit Terracotta, 2012, p. 88, BAB Publishing, If one is to look at contemporary Bali as a shadow of Majapahit, even today a small ceremony is sometimes performed in which a pair of small figures are placed on the rice field wall. These are made out of clay, unfired and are left to be reabsorbed by the elements, For the most part these heads are solid, but occasionally thin walled examples are found. It is postulated that the more heavily ornamented faces represent ladies belonging to the upper classes.H. R. A.

However, construction techniques may also have rendered them fragile. Another explanation is that these figurines were secular play objects, cast aside once broken.Northern Territory Government Museum.www.nt.gov.au/nreta/museums/virtual/seagallery/gallery/figurines.html Commonly the figurines are small, measuring and constructed by the coil and pinch methods with carved or incised decorations, a forming method that is sculptural.Hilda Soemantri, Majapahit Terracotta Art, 1997 Ceramic Society of Indonesia, p. 34 Other figurines are made by moulding, as is the figure in the first image two images below. This is an unusual example in that there is no fracture line at the neck. The variety of expression is infinite with naturalistic postures and facial expressions. Complete figurines are rare compared to the many headless figures or heads without bodies. They often take the form of a woman sitting in a polite female pose, on her calves with her feet tucked underneath.Soedarmadji J H Darmais, Majapahit Terracotta, 2012, BAB Publishing, , p. 88 The figure on the Right is complete. The second figurine the head has been separated but the two fragments were found together. She sits holding something to her chest. This is either a talam or offering tray, or as Kunst (1927) thought, it may be a drum.Kunst, J. 'Een en ander over de Hindoe-Javaansche Muziekinstrument van Oost Java', Djawa V111,1927 pp. 129‚Äì144,16 pl. The third figurine is sitting and playing what can clearly be seen as a musical instrument. Next to her is a figurine with a red slip around her neck, presumably where at the place where the head would be separated. The reason for there being so many heads without bodies is unknown but it is speculated that the figurines were possibly decapitated in a ritual offering.

The technique of construction are similar to the carved stone reliefs seen in the temples of central Java such as Borobudur.

Frequently the figures in the panels are depicted in the East Java style, in which the body is full frontal, the face in the three quarter and the legs are in profile.Hilda Soemantri, Majapahit Terracotta Art, 1997 Ceramic Society of Indonesia, p. 60 File:Majapahit Terracotta frieze TC 216.JPG File:TC 001 Majapahit terracotta low relief brick of a Kala head.JPG Other purposes [Pot stand] The people of Majapahit exploites terracotta earthenware method, producing various objects for their daily needs.

Example detail of Hammer-headed key.'' Hammer-headed tenon joints are one method that can be used to join curved members of joinery components. The hammer-headed tenon is used to join a curved member to a straight member such as a curved head member to a jamb. The tenon is formed on the jamb and the mortise to receive the tenon is formed on the curved member. The mortise is increased in size to receive a pair of folding wedges each side of the tenon. The hammer-headed key is used where there is no straight member to form the tenon. It is difficult to form a strong tenon on curved cut timber as the short grain there will weaken it, so two mortise sockets are formed one in each piece and a separate tenon piece called a key is formed to fit. As with the hammer-headed tenon the mortise sockets are increased in size to allow for the folding wedges each side of the tenon.

(2003). ; Jagota, S. P. When the treaty was concluded in 1978, the treaty set out the boundary between what was known as the Netherlands Antilles and Venezuela. Today, it establishes the boundary between Aruba and Venezuela, between Cura√ßao and Venezuela, and between the BES islands and Venezuela. The treaty was signed on 31 March 1978. The text of the treaty establishes a complex border that is set out in four individual maritime sectors. Sector A creates the boundary between the ocean west of Aruba and Venezuelan territory. Sector B creates the boundary between the Venezuelan mainland and the Leeward Islands of the Netherlands Antilles (including Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura√ßao). Sector C creates the boundary between Bonaire and Venezuelan territory. Finally, further north, Sector D creates the boundary between Isla Aves (Venezuela) and Saba and Sint Eustatius (Netherlands Antilles). The far eastern point of Sector C and the far western point of Sector D are connected by the west‚Äìeast United States ‚Äì Venezuela boundary, which was agreed to in the United States ‚Äì Venezuela Maritime Boundary Treaty, signed just days before the Netherlands‚ÄìVenezuela treaty. In places, the boundary lines were adjusted from the natural equidistant lines because of considerations of the placement of oilfields and other mineral deposits in the area. The full name of the treaty is Boundary Delimitation Treaty between the Republic of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. NotesReferences * Anderson, Ewan W. (2003).

Of Dumas' contribution to macroeconomic theory, Kenneth Boulding wrote in the preface to Dumas' book, The Overburdened Economy, \\"This is a very important book. ... Lloyd Dumas has challenged one of the implicit assumptions of the Keynesian Revolution ... the assumption that all activity which is paid for must be productive. His questioning of this assumption may well set off a reorganization of the economic information system ... Dumas's work is a very valuable contribution to the coming transformation of economic thought\\" (pg. xi). In praise of the same book (see blurbs or dust jacket), Galbraith wrote \\"This is a book of real substance by a scholar of high competence. ... I urge for it and for Professor Dumas the attention they both deserve.\\" and Jan Tinbergen wrote \\"[The Overburdened Economy] throws much light on the problem of the deceleration of economic growth of both the USA and the Soviet Union.\\" Publications=Books *The Peacekeeping Economy: Using economic relationships to build a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure world (Yale University Press, 2011).Review of The Peacekeeping Economy *The Technology Trap: Where human error and malevolence meet powerful technologies (Greenwood Press, 2010). *Lethal Arrogance: Human Fallibility and Dangerous Technologies (New York: St. Martin's Press/Palgrave, December 1999) *The Overburdened Economy: Uncovering the Causes of Chronic Unemployment,Inflation and National Decline, preface by Kenneth Boulding, former President of the American Economics Association.

Warners had previously filmed it in 1930 under that title with Belle Bennett. The number of children in the play was eight; this was reduced to four. It was the first movie Kay Francis made for Warners' B unit under Byrnie Foy. Francis was being paid a high salary and Warners were keen for her to quit but she refused in order that she could still get her salary. She would make five films for him in all. Vincent Sherman said he had to rewrite the script in only a few days ‚Äì he was given the play on Thursday and he handed in a script on Monday. John Farrow was attached to direct in March 1938. Farrow later said he directed Francis by polite but businesslike suggestions, Louise via picturesque comments that would amuse her and arouse her imagination, Granville needed encouragement and praise, and Bobby Jordan required occasional sarcasm.

The speedway changed its name from Dixie Speedway to Birch Run Speedway in 2017. Track History Birch Run Speedway opened in 1948 as a 1/3 mile dirt oval. The track spent its opening decade plus as a dirt track before being paved in the early-1960s. The track experienced consistent growth over the decades, under the ownership of the Doering and Scrivo families, with a Figure 8 course being built through the in-field pit area, moving that area to outside of the 1/3 mile oval. The Kern family took ownership in 1996 and the Speedway then saw its greatest period of growth. A luxury VIP box was built at the top of the main grandstands, new bathrooms were installed, brand new stadium quality lights were installed to replace to outdated system previously there, a new tech barn was built in the pits and the most noticeable addition was the building of a progressively banked 4/10s mile oval. At the conclusion of the 2008 season, the Kern family announced their intentions to retire as track operators, handing over the reins of the facility to Checkered Flag Promotions. In 2017 the track was purchased by local car dealer Andy Suski and renamed the Birch Run Speedway & Event Center. Though the facility name has been changed the big ovals in the middle are still called the Dixie.

The film marked the feature debut of writer/director Richard Ledes. It received its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2003. Plot Anna (Michelle Williams) is a young woman in an American suburb in the early 1950s. She is disturbed by her family‚Äôs rejection of her brother, a World War II veteran who comes home shell shocked. The impressionable girl is lured into a relationship with Billy, a local mob boss. When Anna‚Äôs brother dies and she witnesses Billy murder a local nightclub owner, she is driven to the edge of sanity. She develops a fixation with mental health that drives her to seek out a transorbital lobotomy. Anna learns about the procedure through sensational newspapers and Life magazine, which advertises the operation as the new vogue in American medicine. Also, her small town is buzzing about it when Dr. Harold Ashton, the foremost practitioner of this brand of lobotomy, comes to town. He starts performing the ‚Äúicepick lobotomy‚Äù on alcoholics, veterans, and other troubled outsiders. Billy is concerned with his girlfriend's obsession. He directs his girlfriend to a fake clinic fronted by Tom, a Korean War veteran on Billy‚Äôs payroll who masquerades as a neurologist. Tom convinces Anna to delay the procedure and visit him that night. Tom and Anna share their traumas with one another and grow closer. Billy finds them together and sets off a final conflict that draws the film to a close. Development The idea for A Hole in One was born out of a performance piece Ledes had staged at the American Fine Arts Gallery in SoHo in the early 1990s. The performance was based on the records of a WWII veteran who had experienced a psychotic break and for whom it had been recommended that he receive a lobotomy. Ledes conducted extensive research for the film over many years, including volunteering at an outpatient center for severely mentally ill. Additionally, he visited George Washington University, which holds the archives of Dr. Walter Freeman. Rather than doing a documentary on Freeman or case studies on mental illness, Ledes opted for fiction: ;;‚ÄúI never considered doing a documentary. For me it was always important to tell the story in this way. That there were truths about the subject of mental illness and the use of transorbital lobotomy that were inseparable from the truths that one finds in storytelling rather than the true and false of science.‚ÄùRichard Ledes. Audio commentary. A Hole in One. Dir. Ledes. Perf.Michelle Williams. Meat Loaf Aday. 2003. DVD.Fox Lorber. 2004. Ledes‚Äô screenplay draws heavily on documents such as the New York Departmental of Mental Hygiene Annual Report of 1953. In his DVD commentary for A Hole in One, Ledes mentions other insightful sources: Great and Desperate Cures: The Rise and Decline of Psychosurgery and Other Radical Treatments for Mental Illness and Last Resort: Psychosurgery and Other Radical Treatments for Mental Illness by Jack David Pressman. He also cites The Lobotomist: A Maverick Medical Genius and His Tragic Quest to Rid the World of Mental Illness by Jack El-Hai, which came out after A Hole in One, as a reliable reference point. Ledes has compared the character of Dr. Ashton to Dr. Strangelove. While he isn‚Äôt modeled on one historical person, he is derived from real-life figures.

It originates in the New World, but has been introduced and has spread in Europe. It is a small, whitish insect and feeds on the underside of the leaves, sucking sap. There are reports in Europe of C. cilata landing on people and biting them. Reports from Italy, France and Romania indicate that some people experience adverse reactions, e.g., dermatosis.  Description  The adult sycamore lace bug is milky white in colour and between in length. It is similar in appearance to the cotton lace bug (Corythucha gossypii) and the Florida oak lace bug (Corythucha floridana), but lacks the brown crescent- shaped band on the carina (ridge on the body-wall) of the former and is larger than the latter. The only brown colour is a small spot on the protuberance on each elytron (wing-case). The nymphs are oval in shape, dorso-ventrally flattened, black and prickly. This lace bug can most easily be distinguished from other species by its presence on sycamore.  Distribution and hosts  C. ciliata is native to North America and is found where its host trees grow. The main host is the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) but it is sometimes found on other species of Platanus, and it has been recorded on Broussonetia papyrifera, Carya ovata, Chamaedaphne sp., Fraxinus sp., Quercus laurifolia and Liquidambar styraciflua. In Europe, C. ciliata was first observed in 1964 in Padova, Italy, and has since spread throughout Southern and Central Europe, infesting the European hybrid plane (Platanus √ó acerifolia).Pralavorio, d'Aguilar R.; Rabasse J.M.; Mouton R. 1977. Introduction en France du tigre du platane: Corythucha ciliata (Say) (Het. Tingidae). Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Entomologique de France 82: 1-6. Although it does not of itself kill trees, in Central Europe it is often found in association with two plant-pathogenic fungi which can kill trees, Apiognomonia veneta and Ceratocystis fimbriata, leading to the hypothesis that it may act as a vector for these fungi.  Life cycle  Lateral view After the adults have mated, the female lays eggs on the undersides of leaves of the host tree, usually near a fork in the veins. When the eggs hatch, the juveniles stay close together at first, only moving onto a new leaf at the fourth instar stage. They puncture the epidermis of the leaf with their mouth parts and suck sap. There are five instars, after which the nymphs undergo incomplete metamorphosis to become adults. During the summer in Oklahoma, the whole cycle takes about 44 days. In the warmer parts of the insect's range, there may be several generations each year. The insects are restricted to the underside of the leaves where little black mounds of dried frass can be seen and the shed skins of the nymphs often adhere to the leaf. The upper surface of the leaf is speckled with white, near the veins at first, and the leaf becomes progressively paler or bronzed and may fall early. Overwintering generally takes place as adults in crevices or under flakes of bark, the insects being able to withstand temperatures down to at least .

By analyzing the product's response to such tests, engineers can make predictions about the service life and maintenance intervals of a product. In polymers, testing may be done at elevated temperatures to produce a result in a shorter amount of time than it could be produced at ambient temperatures. Many mechanical properties of polymers have an Arrhenius type relationship with respect to time and temperature (for example, creep, stress relaxation, and tensile properties). If one conducts short tests at elevated temperatures, that data can be used to extrapolate the behavior of the polymer at room temperature, avoiding the need to do lengthy, and hence expensive tests.  Purpose  ALT is primarily used to speed up tests. This is particularly useful in several cases: * Low failure - Testing even a very large sample at normal conditions would yield few or no failures in a reasonable time. * High longevity - The product must be reliable for a much longer time than can be reasonably tested at normal conditions. * High wear-out - The primary cause of failure occurs over an extended amount of time.Test Plan Development: How To Do It, G. Sharon, November 19, 2015, https://www.dfrsolutions.com/resources/test-plan- development-how-to-do-it For instance, a reliability test on circuits that must last years at use conditions (high longevity) would need to yield results in a much shorter time. If the test wanted to estimate how frequently the circuits needed to be replaced, then the category of low failure would also be applicable. Furthermore, if the circuits wore out from gradual use rather than extreme use (such as a large sudden shock), the wear out category would be involved. If a sudden shock was the primary cause of failure, a Highly Accelerated Life Test may be more appropriate.  Setting up a test  Designing a test involves considering what factors affect the test object, what you already know about the test object's behavior, and what you want to learn from the test.  Test Conditions  All factors thought to influence the test object should be involved and tests should be conducted at various levels of each factor. Higher stress levels will speed up the test more however the cause of failure or other response measured must not be changed. For instance, melting components in a circuit would alter why the circuit failed. Increasing the number of tests or the number of test objects in each test generally increases how precisely one can infer the test object's behavior at operating conditions.  Picking a Model  A model is an equation that accurately relates a test object's performance to the levels of stress on it. This can be referred to as an acceleration model, with any constants called acceleration factors.Temperature and Humidity Acceleration Factors on MLV Lifetime, G. Caswell, https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Temperature-and- Humidity-Acceleration-Factors-on-MLV-Lifetime.pdf?t=1514473946162 The acceleration model is usually related to the types of materials or components tested. A few equations used for acceleration models are the Arrhenius for high temperature fatigue, Eyring for temperature and humidity, and the Blattau model for temperature cycling. When the model is known in advance the test only needs to identify the parameters for the model, however it is necessary to ensure that the model being used has been well verified. Established models must show agreement between extrapolations from accelerated data and observed data across a range of stress factors. When the appropriate model is not known in advance, or there exist multiple accepted models, the test must estimate what model fits best based on the context of the test and results from testing. Even if two models fit data at high stresses equally well, they may differ by orders of magnitude at lower stresses. This issue can be approached by more tests at a greater range of stresses however the cause of failure must remain unchanged. A possible pre-experiment approach to minimize this is to estimate what data you expect from testing, fit a model to the data, and determine if one would be able to make reliable conclusions if everything went as expected.  Acceleration Factors  Inference from the results of an accelerated life test requires being able to relate the test object's response (lifespan, corrosion, efficiency, etc...) to the levels of applied stress factors over time. How one factors in the effect of time depends largely on what one is measuring. For instance, a test that is measuring lifespan may look only at the mean time to failure of the test objects, or it may try to fit a statistical distribution to the data. This is usually referred to as a life distribution, the probability density function of which represents the proportion of products failing at a given time. Several distributions for this purpose are the exponential, Weibull, log-normal, and gamma distributions. In any case, the parameters would be related to the test subjects and the levels of the stress factors being tested. As a simplified example, consider a test object with a life distribution that roughly matches a normal distribution. Tests at various stress levels would yield different values for the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. (its parameters) One would then use a known model or attempt to fit a model to relate how each stress factor influenced the distributions parameters. This relation would then be used to estimate the life distribution at operating conditions.  Step-Stress Accelerated Life Test  A step stress ALT is a variant of ALT that tests a component at multiple stress levels, one after the other. Components that survive one test are immediately subjected to the next. These are widely modeled under the assumption that survival life of a product depends only on the current level of stress and how many test subjects have failed so far. Step stress ALT can increment low to high, high to low, or through a mix of levels. A step stress ALT test that is interested in extrapolating a life distribution to constant operating conditions must be able to relate the life distribution observed under changing stresses to one of constant stresses.

The decision established the extent of the Exclusive Economic Zone of the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas, p. 288; Charney, Jonathan I. et al. (2005). International Maritime Boundaries, pp. 2141‚Äì2158. Background In 1972, Canada and France signed a treaty that delimited the territorial maritime boundary between Canada and the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. However, the maritime boundaries beyond the territorial sea (including extent of the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of both countries) continued to be disputed. The extent of each country's EEZ was significant because it would determine where the countries had an exclusive right to fish. Years of failed negotiations led Canada and France to agree in March 1989 to establish an ad hoc arbitral tribunal that would resolve the dispute. Arbitral tribunal The arbitral tribunal was composed of five arbitrators‚Äîthree neutral parties and one representative from each country. The neutral arbitrators were Eduardo Jim√©nez de Ar√©chaga of Uruguay (president), Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz of Italy, and Oscar Schachter of the United States. Canada's representative was Allan Gotlieb and France's was Prosper Weil. Decision The arbitral tribunal issued its decision and award on 10 June 1992. It was a 3‚Äì2 decision, with the representatives of both Canada and France dissenting from the decision. The zone that was awarded to France was unusual and in two parts: first, the boundary was set at an equidistant line between the French islands and the Canadian island of Newfoundland. Added to this was a 24 nautical mile bulge on the west of the islands. Lastly, a long north‚Äìsouth corridor south of the islands was awarded to France, presumably to allow France access to its EEZ from international waters without having to pass through the Canadian EEZ. The corridor is narrow, being approximately 10¬Ω nautical miles wide. The shape of the award has been likened to a keyhole, a mushroom, and a baguette. The award was approximately 18% of the territory that France had initially been claiming. Criticism Since the 1992 award, the decision has been criticised by both Canadian and French commentators as well as neutral observers, noting that a straightforward application of the Convention on the Law of the Sea would extend Canada's EEZ beyond the limits of the French corridor, a circumstance that was not intended by the arbitral tribunal. Indeed in 1996, Canada unilaterally extended its EEZ using Sable Island as a base point, meaning that the French EEZ became entirely enveloped within Canada's EEZ. NotesReferences * Anderson, Ewan W.

Early life Auza was born on 10 June 1959, in Balintawak, Talibon, Bohol, Philippines, the eighth of twelve children of Meliton Garcia Auza and Magdalena Polestico Cleopas. After preliminary education in Talibon, he entered the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary in Tagbilaran City. He then enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas, Manila, where he obtained his Licentiate in Philosophy in 1981, Licentiate in Theology in 1986, and Masters in Education also in 1986. Auza was ordained a priest by Bishop Daniel Francis Walsh of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Santa Rosa in California on 29 June 1985. At the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum), he obtained a Licentiate in Canon Law in 1989 and a Doctorate in Sacred Theology in 1990. He attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy to prepare for a diplomat's career. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See on 1 June 1990 and worked in Madagascar and the South Indian Ocean (1990‚Äì93), Bulgaria (1993‚Äì96), Albania (1997‚Äì98), the Secretariat of State in the Section for Relations with States (1999‚Äì2006), and the Permanent Mission of the Holy See to the UN (2006‚Äì08). Apostolic Nuncio On 8 May 2008, Pope Benedict XVI named Auza Titular Archbishop of Suacia and Apostolic Nuncio to Haiti. He was consecrated as a bishop on 3 July 2008 by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, Secretary of State. On 2 July 2014, Pope Francis appointed him Permanent Observer to the United Nations in New York representing the Holy See. On 16 July, his responsibilities were expanded to include the role of Permanent Observer to the Organization of American States (OAS). In October 2014 Auza called for a broad definition of the term ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù that includes respect, dignity, and justice. The rule of law should be ‚Äúboth rationally and morally grounded upon the substantial principles of justice, including the inalienable dignity and value of every human person prior to any law or social consensus,‚Äù said Archbishop Berardito Auza, the nuncio, in a statement made during a committee meeting at the UN General Assembly. ‚ÄúAs a consequence of the recognition of this dignity, those elements of fundamental justice such as respect for the principle of legality,‚Äù Archbishop Auza said, ‚Äúthe presumption of innocence and the right to due process.‚Äù Among nations, he added, the rule of law should mean ‚Äúthe paramount respect of human rights, equality of the rights of nations; and respect for international customary law, treaties ‚Ä¶ and other sources of international law. This definition, with its reference point in the natural law, sidesteps self-referential definitional frameworks and anchors the orientation of the rule of law within the ultimate and essential goal of all law, namely to promote and guarantee the dignity of the human person and the common good.‚Äù In the same speech he noted the Vatican‚Äôs hope that ‚Äúthe alarming, escalating phenomenon of international terrorism, new in some of its expressions and utterly ruthless in its barbarity, be an occasion for a deeper and more urgent study on how to re-enforce the international juridical framework of a multilateral application of our common responsibility to protect people from all forms of unjust aggression.‚Äù His assignment to the OAS ended on 31 August 2019.

James (27 August 1797 ‚Äì 28 October 1861), a 19th-century American botanist, geologist, and medical practitioner, was an important figure in the early exploration of the American West. James was also known for his time spent creating relationships with Native Americans in the United States, and also aiding African Americans to escape slavery. James is primarily remembered for his participation in the expedition of 1819-1820 led by Major Stephen Harriman Long, into still largely unknown territory acquired in the Louisiana Purchase. James served during the expedition's more productive second year. (The original botanist/surgeon, William Baldwin, died during the first year.) That expedition \\". . . was the first scientific survey of the region and dramatically increased the country‚Äôs geographical knowledge of the West.‚Äù http://www.americanjourneys.org/aj-144c/summary/ James was primarily responsible for producing the report, Account of an Expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains, Performed in the Years 1819, 1820, published in 1823. (see below, Works). During the expedition, James accomplished the first recorded mountain ascent in North America to over 14,000 ft. elevation, and was the first to collect many alpine plant species, including what he called \\"the mountain Columbine\\", Aquilegia coerulea E.James, later to become the state flower of Colorado, now with the common name Colorado Blue Columbine. Colorado Blue Columbine Aquilegia coerulea E.James The expedition's extensive collection of information on flora, fauna, geology and geography, as recounted in James' Account, is reminiscent of the efforts, just two decades earlier, by Alexander von Humboldt in Central and South America. A copy of Humboldt's Personal Narrative of Travels of the Equinocial Regions of the New Continent was carried by the Long expedition. The Account influenced the literature of the Far West. Historian William H. Goetzmann suggested \\"the most important literary event of 1823 was the publication of Dr. Edwin James's Account of an Expedition ...\\" (See also Benson in Further reading, p. xviii.) In a more recent homage to James, Lyndgaard said: \\"The passages that deal with landscape description, bison, and Native Americans, especially the Pawnee, were immediately recognized for their quality, and were thus mined by novelists as well as celebrated by reviewers.\\" Education Born in Weybridge, Vermont, to Daniel and Mary (Emmes) James, he prepared for college at Addison County Grammar School before entering Middlebury College in 1812. After receiving his A.B. in 1816, James moved to Albany, New York, to continue study in medicine (with his physician brother), botany with John Torrey, and botany and geology with Amos Eaton. In 1819 James became a part of the American Geological Society and within one year had authored articles on the subject. Within this same time frame he also prepared the first list of Vermont plants.  Expedition to the Rocky Mountains  The second year of the Long Expedition began June 6, 1820 when the members, now including 22-year-old Edwin James, left the overwintering camp, Engineer Cantonment, near the eastern border of the current state of Nebraska. They headed west toward the Rockies, following, for the most part, the Platte River, then south along the Rocky Mountain front, before heading east toward the expedition's ending location (which occurred on September 13, 1820) at Fort Smith, in what is now western Arkansas. On July 13, James and two others set out to climb Pikes Peak. As James writes in his Account: > \\"On the morning of the 14th . . . we continued the ascent, hoping to be able > to reach the summit of the Peak, and return to the same camp in the evening. > . . . A little above the point where the timber disappears entirely, > commences a region of astonishing beauty . . . covered with a carpet of low > but brilliantly flowering alpine plants. . . . We now found it would be > impossible to reach the summit of the mountain, and return to our camp of > the preceding night, during that part of the day which remained; but as we > could not persuade ourselves to turn back, after having so nearly > accomplished the ascent, we resolved to take our chance of spending the > night, on whatever part of the mountain, it might overtake us. . . . We met, > as we proceeded, such numbers of unknown and interesting plants, as to > occasion much delay in collecting, and were under the disagreeable necessity > of passing by numbers which we saw in situations difficult of access.\\" (Note: Historian Roger Lawrence Williams used the phrase \\"a region of astonishing beauty\\", from the above, for the title of his 2003 book on Rocky Mountains botanical history. see Further reading) After reaching the Peak, James describes the natural history of the summit, and goes on to describe the view in all directions in some detail, including smoke in a valley to the north \\"supposed to indicate the encampment of a party of Indians.\\" It was the first time in recorded history that a mountain of such height (4,302 m/14,115 feet) had been scaled in North America. (In South America, Alexander von Humboldt reached ca. 5,800 m (19,000 ft) on Mt. Chimborazo in 1802.) In a commemoration 100 years later, the day was considered as \\"undoubtedly the most notable day of the expedition for botanical collecting\\" by George Everett Osterhout, a prominent Colorado botanist. James' Telesonix Telesonix jamesii (Torr.) Raf. Due to traversing a largely uncharted country, it was not always clear from James' Account exactly where each camp and collecting site was. The expedition's path was retraced 170 years later, relying not only on the Account but also James' diary and scenic paintings of the expedition's artist, Samuel Seymour. In spite of considerable change over the years, sites were located with accuracy. Cliffbush Jamesia americana Torr. & A.Gray var. rosea Limber Pine Pinus flexilis E.James, USDA During the Expedition James collected ca. 700 plant species in the mountains and over the prairies, of which 140 were new to science. In addition to Aquilegia coerulea, James named many other species (e.g., Limber Pine, Pinus flexilis E.James), and many were later named after him by John Torrey (notably the Cliffbush, Jamesia americana Torr & A.Gray, often found at high elevations growing in cracks in vertical rock surfaces), and by others who worked on his collections (e.g., Telesonix jamesii (Torr.) Raf.). All in all, 24 plant species were named in James' honor. In his 1920 100 year anniversary commemoration, Osterhout noted: \\"In general the native plants still grow and blossom as they did when Dr. James saw them in 1820; but a great change has been wrought in the country. Fruitful farms have replaced much of what seemed to be sterile soil, and towns and cities and a busy industry have come to their silent and uninhabited plains and hills.\\"  Later  After completing the expedition, most members went, by various routes, back to the East Coast. Most (especially James) suffered from malaria, which delayed returning. James did not get to Philadelphia, the meeting place, until the autumn of 1821. James was assigned the primary responsibility (with collaboration by Long and Say) of writing the Account's narrative, to append the collected data, and to prepare the results for publication, a job completed near the end of 1822. (See also Benson in Further reading, p. xii.) Subsequently James was appointed US Army surgeon to serve at various frontier outposts including the Great Lakes region; he served from 1823 to 1833. While with the Army he interacted with Native Americans, most notably the Ojibwe with whose language he became familiar. A EuroAmerican, John Tanner (captive), captured by the Ojibwe when a child and raised among them, worked closely with James in the production of the New Testament in the Ojibwe language, and in the telling of Tanner's life story. (See Works, 1830, 1833.) In 1827, while still working for the Army but during a return visit to the East, James married Clara Rogers. His \\" ... beautiful wife ... was a woman of talent and fond of society ... \\". They had one child, a son named Edwin Jr., born in 1828. By ca. 1840 (the exact date is uncertain) they had permanently settled on land near Burlington, Iowa, which they developed into a productive farm. There James maintained, in his house, a station on the Underground Railroad Clara died in 1854, leaving James in great sorrow. James himself died in 1861, the result of an accident on his farm. From Lammers (2016): > \\"He was buried next to his wife in Rock Spring Cemetery . . .

Established in 1775, all of its ships were destroyed or captured by 1779. In the remaining years of the war a few smaller ships were commissioned to interdict smuggling between the Connecticut shore and Tory-controlled Long Island. One the Connecticut Navy's most distinctive commissions was the Turtle, a submarine whose use in New York harbor in 1776 constitutes the first documented instance of submarine warfare. Early acquisitions After the American Revolutionary War began in April 1775, the Connecticut General Assembly in July authorized the Governor and Council of Safety to procure and outfit two armed vessels. On July 24, Governor Jonathan Trumbull and the Council appointed a committee to identify potentially useful vessels in the colony's harbors. On August 2, the committee filed its report, and noted that there was some opposition in the colony to attempting to match the Royal Navy's might. In spite of this, Governor Trumbull and the council decided to outfit William Griswold's 108-ton ship Minerva, and appointed another committee to acquire a \\"spy vessel, to run and course from place to place, to discover the enemy, and carry intelligence\\" of about 25 tons, to be captained by Samuel Niles.Paullin, p. 356 The next day they hired Giles Hall to be the captain of the Minerva, established a pay scale, and authorized Hall to hire 40 sailors and 40 marines. On August 14, they authorized the purchase of the Britannica, a sloop in Stonington, which was to be renamed Spy, with Robert Niles as its captain. The Spy began service early in October, and promptly brought in the navy's first prize, a British supply ship. Minerva began service on October 9, with orders to capture transports bound for Quebec. However, most of the crew refused to obey Hall's orders, and she returned to port. The mutinous crew was dismissed, and in December Hall was ordered to return the ship to its owner. Expansion In December 1775 the General Assembly authorized the acquisition of more ships, specifically another armed vessel and four row galleys, \\"for the defence of this and the neighboring colonies.\\"Paullin, p. 358 A brigantine was purchased, named Defence, and Seth Harding was given her command; she entered service in April 1776. The governor and council decided to order the construction of a vessel as the third of the authorized ships. This resulted in the June 1776 launch of the 300-ton Oliver Cromwell, with William Coit as its captain. Oliver Cromwell was the first purpose-built warship commissioned by the Connecticut General Assembly--Minerva, Spy, and Defence were all already under construction or launched when purchased. Of the four row galleys, only three were built: Whiting, Shark, and Crane, which were outfitted with sloop riggings, were ready for service in July 1776. In February 1776, after a presentation by inventor David Bushnell, authorized the payment of ¬£60 so that he could complete the construction of what became the Turtle, a small one-man submarine designed to attach a mine to another ship. She was used in an attempted attack on in New York harbor in 1776; the attack failed. The Turtle was sunk in 1777, but was supposedly recovered later by Bushnell. Additional ships were authorized but had relatively short service lives. The Mifflin and the Schuyler were only in active service in 1777, and Guilford in 1779. Administration The assembly had vested in the governor considerable authority in naval matters, including the setting of regulations. As the Continental Navy was also organizationally taking shape, the governor and council assembled a set of regulations that harmonized as much as possible with those of the Continental Navy. They also retained Nathaniel Shaw, a wealthy New London merchant, as the state's agent for outfitting its ships and disposing of its prizes, and also had an agent in Boston to deal with matters when the state's ships or prizes were in Massachusetts ports. Instead of setting up dedicated admiralty courts, the assembly authorized the state's courts to act as admiralty courts, adjudicating marine disputes and the distribution of prizes, with a right to appeal decisions to the Continental Congress. The state did not issue its own letters of marque; instead, the governor was authorized to issue Congressional letters. In 1779 the state established a formal naval administrative structure, but by then most of its ships had been lost. The state authorized the commission of up to twelve armed vessels in 1780 for the purpose of interdicting smuggling; it retracted the commissions in 1781 after it was established that they had been completely ineffective at stopping illicit trade. Operations Most of the navy's cruising was in Long Island Sound, although some ships, notably Spy and Oliver Cromwell, went further afield, and the three row galleys served in the Hudson River above New York, where the British eventually captured or sank them. Spy served the purpose for which it was purchased, and was one of several ships sent to France in 1778 with news that Congress had ratified the Treaty of Alliance. Of the ships sent, she was the first to arrive; unfortunately the British captured her on the return voyage. All told, the Connecticut Navy captured about thirty prizes, but all of her ships were captured or destroyed by July 1779. Oliver Cromwell was captured after an engagement off Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and Guilford was captured in July.

August was a member of the House of W√ºrttemberg and a Prince of W√ºrttemberg by birth. Family August was the fifth and youngest child of Prince Paul of W√ºrttemberg, brother of William I of W√ºrttemberg, and his wife Princess Charlotte of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Military career After 16 years of military service to the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in 1831, August was promoted to Rittmeister in the 1st Cavalry Regiment. In April 1831, August was granted permission by his uncle William I of W√ºrttemberg to serve in the Prussian Army. In the Prussian Army, August was assigned initially to the Gardes du Corps and a year later he was promoted to Major. In 1836, August was further promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and in 1838 to Colonel. He served as commander of the Guards Cuirassier Regiment. In 1844, as Major General, August assumed the leadership of the 1st Guards Cavalry Brigade and as early as 1850 he was promoted to Lieutenant General. From 1854 to 1856 he commanded the 7th Division in Magdeburg. In September 1857, August served as Commanding General of III Corps, but as of 3 June 1858 became commanding general of the Guards Corps. He held the position for 20 years. In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, August, by now a General of the Cavalry, and his corps belonged to the Army of Frederick, Crown Prince of Prussia. He led it into the victorious battles of Soor and Burkersdorf. The Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz on 3 July 1866 witnessed the decisive occupation of Chlum (now part of V≈°estary, known for its cemetery) by his units. However, a significant share of their victories were attributed to August's chief of staff, Lieutenant Colonel Ferdinand von Dannenberg. After the campaign, William I of Prussia awarded August the Order of Pour le M√©rite, and appointed him honorary Colonel-in-Chief of the Posen Ulan Regiment Number 10 in Z√ºllichau, that bore its name until its dissolution in 1919. In the Franco-Prussian War, the Guard Corps participated in the Battle of Gravelotte- Saint Privat on 18 August 1870. The attack on the broad plain was made hastily and without supporting artillery fire. Even the subsequent envelopment of the enemy by the Royal Saxon Army troops could not therefore be exploited. The Guard Corps, under the leadership of August, was assigned to Albert, Crown Prince of Saxony, and participated in the Battle of Sedan, and in part in the Siege of Paris. Chief of Staff during the later campaign was still Ferdinand von Dannenberg, by now promoted to Major General. After the war ended, August von W√ºrttemberg he continued to command his corps. For his war service the king awarded him the Oak Leaves of the Pour le M√©rite and both classes of the Iron Cross. On 2 September 1873, he was appointed Colonel General of the Cavalry with the rank of Field Marshal. In the place of Field Marshal Friedrich Graf von Wrangel, August was transferred in June 1878 to the Oberkommando der Marken and remained in this position for another four years. On 24 August 1882, he asked for his discharge from active duty, which was granted to him by making him a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle. Death and legacy During a hunting trip in Zehdenick near Berlin, August died on 12 January 1885. His funeral was held four days later at Berlin's Garnisonkirche. He was transferred to Ludwigsburg Palace where he was interred at the palace chapel. Fort August von W√ºrttemberg, one of the inner belt of fortifications of the Fortifications of Metz, was named in his honor. W√ºrttemberger Chamber of Lords As a prince of the Royal House of W√ºrttemberg since 1830, August was one of the lords in the W√ºrttembergische Landst√§nde, but never took part in their meetings. He was represented by other members of the chamber, the last one being Andreas Renner. Marriage and issue August married morganatically to Marie Bethge on 14 November 1868.

As well he was \\"a little deformed man,\\" whose \\"back was bent from fever\\". Bidlake was curate of Plymouth's Stonehouse Chapel, now St George's Church, from 1785 to 1812. He also held the position of Common Chaplain to the Prince of Wales (later to become George III) and the Duke of Clarence (later to become William IV). In 1811 Bidlake gave the Bampton Lecture delivered at St Mary's Church, Oxford and titled The Truth And Consistency Of Divine Revelation, With Some Remarks On The Contrary Extremes Of Infidelity And Enthusiasm: In Eight Discourses. Unfortunately, during this lecture he suffered a stroke as a result of which he lost his eyesight. The Lecture was later to be published as a book in an effort to raise funds for his welfare; \\"The Rev.

In spite of France's colonial rule in Algeria, many Algerians chose to immigrate to France from the 1960s to the present due to political turmoil. Tensions between the countries endure today. A recent attempt to \\"improve\\" the situation was the banning the Muslim women from being free to wear the religious attires Burqa and the Hijab in schools by Jacques Chirac. Nicolas Sarkozy furthered his support of the outlawing of conspicuous religious symbols by ridiculing the burqas as a \\"sign of subservience of women\\".  History = Preimmigration Culture  The colonization of Algeria by Charles X greatly affected the culture of Algeria. A new ideal of individual land ownership and the exclusion of tribal practices from the work sector threatened the Algerian way of life; many revolutionaries rose up against the exploitation though Algeria was not independent until 1962.Creamean, Letitia \\"Membership of foreigners: Algerians in France\\". 1996 Arab Studies Quarterly 18(1). Two famous academics visited and studied tribal groups in Algeria‚ÄîPierre Bourdieu, a theorist in sociology who studied the pseudo- colonized French Algeria and Melville Hilton-Simpson an anthropologist who studied the Shaw√≠a in the mountains of Algeria. Bourdieu extensively researched the destruction of Algerian culture under French rule; Algerians were forced into cities to support the economic interests of the French and destroying their old tribal living and working situations.Bourdieu, Pierre. 2008 Political Interventions: Social Science and Political Action. Gregory Elliot trans. London: Verso Press Though some definitely benefitted from the industrialization of the country, many suffered through unemployment and poverty, inciting violent revolutions and wars throughout the 20th century. In his article \\"Culture, Violence and Art\\", Hassen Bouabdellah cites Algeria as the prime example of the violence that erupts after a peoples have had their culture forcibly stripped away. Though France had once enslaved them, Algerian citizens chose to migrate to France because they were still very dependent upon France for trade and many people already knew the language.Bouabdellah Hassen \\"Culture Violence and Art\\". pg 2 = Religion = The vast majority of the population in Algeria practices Islam with increasing numbers of Evangelists. Jews who left Algeria following Independence in 1962 also constitute a large number of Algerian migrants to France. = Workplace = In industrialized cities of Algeria, men and women worked in harsh conditions and for little pay to maximize the profit of colonial rulers. Though most immigrants to France came from urban areas in Algeria, many of those people were pulled away from their original communities in more remote parts of Algeria. In the rural areas where surviving tribes lived, the traditional roles of males and females were quite different from those in the cities. Females were assigned to the informal work tasks of childcare and cooking as Hilton-Simpson noted when the village women prepared his meal.Hilton-Simpson, Melville Among the Hill-folk of Algeria. 1921, New York: Dodd, Mead and Company. The women made \\"simple\\" meals in their homes which are built on the sides of cliffs while males were in charge of specialized tasks, like medicine. Hilton-Simpson found interesting medical practices among the tribes that survived the French colonized Algeria. Among the Shaw√≠a, men were typically those who could train to be a healer. Hilton Simpson observed that the doctors of the tribe performed more advanced medical procedures such as surgeries in addition to herbal remedies and some more supernatural practices. However, the surgeries could not be closely studied because French colonialists banned the practice in the 1800s. Bans ultimately resulted in medicine becoming a very secretive ritual. = Marital Practices = The legal age for marriage is eighteen for women, twenty-one for men.[5] Many Algerian women are getting married and starting families at much older ages than they did under French Rule. Education, work commitment, and changing social attitudes are the reasons for the change. In 2010, the total fertility rate was 1.76 children born/woman. This is a drop from 2.41 in 2009 and 7.12 in the 1970s just after the Algerian War of Independence from France = Civil War = Shortly after gaining independence from France, Algeria began to experience serious political turmoil eventually leading to the civil war of the 1990s that caused many Algerians to leave the country. On 4 January 1992, the military took over the Algerian government, putting Mohammed Boudiaf in place shortly afterward. On 29 June 1992, Mohammed Boudiaf was assassinated by a body guard with supposed Islamic ties‚Äîthis incited much more violence and the formation of the Armed Islamic Group.BBC News \\"Timeline: Algeria\\" October 21, 2009. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/811140.stm Many changes in power occur and violence from many groups, especially the Armed Islamic Group and the Berbers, continues today. The power struggle between these two groups is the root of the upheaval in Algeria that caused these women immigrants to give up their old way of life in search of a better one in France.  Emigration to France  The impact that the Arabs left on Algerian culture was large and has not yet left the minds of the people. Islam gave hope to many poorer women in the countryside, leaving a deep seated belief in Islam that was carried to France. It is mainly this clash of religious values, rituals and even rumors that has caused a cultural conflict in France.\\"Quelsques Observations Sur la Psychologie en Algerie\\" International Journal of Psychology  Franco-Algerian Culture  First generation Algerian immigrants generally moved to France to make a better life for themselves and for their families if they had the proper resources. M√©dine, a Franco-Algerian rapper, wrote an article detailing his experience and that of his parents as Algerian immigrants. M√©dine's parents spent most of their time in France working to be completely assimilated into French culture. If they were identified as immigrants, they were berated with racist remarks, and were subjected to repeated identification checks by police.M√©dine 2005 \\"How Much More French Can I Be?\\". Time 166(20). Many journalists and researchers have reported a strong sense of \\"homogenous national French identity\\" that many citizens are afraid will disappear with the influx of immigrants from Algeria and other North African countries; there have also been numerous terrorist attacks in France that have inspired a sense of fear towards Islam.Geesy, Patricia \\"North African Immigrants in France: Integration and Change\\" 1995 Substance 77(76) p138. The bigotry from French natives and alleged decreased rights under Islamic tradition were the least of poorer women's worries. These women both receive pressure to assimilate as well as endure increasing misogynist violence in the projects of France according to Fad√©la Amara, a civil rights activistCrumley, Bruce \\"Acting on the Outrage\\". 2004 Time Europe October 11 http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2004/amura.html France created a welfare program that targeted women and children who recently emigrated to France; the target of this program was to help women get on their feet so that they would embrace French culture instead of calling for Algerian independence.Lyons, Amelia H. \\"The Civilizing Mission in the Metropole\\" Geschichte und Gesellschaft, 32(4) 489-516 These services gave women the chance to move out of bidonvilles, or shantytowns on the outskirts of the city; however, this was at the expense of giving up their cultural identity for a more Western life which to some was too great of a price. = Religion = The overwhelming majority of Franco-Algerian immigrants are Muslim, as are the majority of native Algerians. Again, the culture and practice of Islam seems to be most serious issue with immigrants today after the terrorist attacks in France made my Islamic extremists‚Äîsuch as the 1995 public transportation bombing. After these events, 66 percent of French citizens reported that they felt \\"too many Arabs\\" were in France and 64 percent felt that the immigration of peoples from Algeria and other countries were a threat to the French identity.Memet, Gerard Francosopie. Racism is high toward People of North African Descent in France and many youth feel alienated by their french peers,thus the government promotes terrorist activities in its home soil by refusing to allow Franco-Algerian citizens to integrate for the past 40 years.1993 Paris: Larousse. Though this feeling of resentment has somewhat decreased, for Muslim women it is still exceedingly difficult to blend Islamic and Algerian culture with French culture. It is still a social and political issue in France today whether Muslim women should be allowed to practice group prayer, wear head scarves and participate in other specifically Muslim practices that may or may not be dangerous to their rights as womenSilverstein, Paul A. Algeria in France: Transpolitics, Race and Nation. 2004 Bloomington: University of Indiana Press. p13 = Marital Practices = The Algerian practices of marriage in France are still mostly monogamous and heterosexual though some instances of polygamy still exist; not much has changed since emigrating to France.Geesy, Patricia \\"North African Women Immigrants in France: Immigration and Change\\" 1995 Substance 24(76):p137-153. Therein lies the cause of the political and social upheaval between France and its Algerian immigrants. However, much of the French population believes that Islam and Algerian culture has led to this violence in marriages. Thus, the \\"deterritorialized culture wars\\", a term Paul A. Silverstein coined, are a pressing issue in France today.Silverstein, Paul A. Algeria in France: Transpolitics, Race and Nation. 2004 Bloomington: Indiana University Press. p2. Women are strictly forbidden from exogamy and must still be tolerant of polygamy in some cases; the women who emigrate usually come to join their husbands and are still expected to obey men and traditionAlexander, Livia 2000 French-Algerian: A Story of Immigrants and Identity. http://spot.pcc.edu/~mdembrow/Benguiguiinterview.htm = Art in France = In Paris, Algerian immigrants have used graffiti as an outlet for frustration and to voice their political views. The graffiti expresses the feeling of being an outsider-- \\"La France aux fran√ßais; l'√©tranget√© aux √©trangers\\" or France for the French; foreign lands for foreigners.Geesy, Patricia \\"North African Immigrants in France: Integration and Change\\" 1995 Substance 77(76) p137. Though some of the graffiti may have been done by women, it is impossible to tell because graffiti artist remain anonymous. Many of Algeria's artists immigrated to France during the Algerian Civil war. Art in exile has become very popular among the women immigrants in France; it expresses the loss of their country and helps exercise their newly gained freedoms. Many painters, writers and actors had to emigrate as well during the violent period of the 1990s creating a large presence in France.Bedarida, Catherine \\"Algerian Women in Exile\\". World Press Review July 1995 42(7): p46  Cultural Conflicts  In order to preserve French culture, there is little to no consideration of multiculturalism. In the movie They Call Me Muslim, the young women interviewed expressed their concern over the issue saying that wearing the Hijab is a choice that brings them closer to God. However, the editor of Le Monde Diplomatique also said in the video that women receive pressure from males to wear the Hijab.Ferrero, Diana They Call Me Muslim. Italy/France/Iran: 2006. Currently, 49% of Muslim women favor the ban.Margaronis, Maria \\"Letter From Paris\\". The Nation: March 15, 2004. Cultural conflicts are a more difficult area to explore in the lives of Franco-Algerian women. Many have reported a generally unwelcome atmosphere if they stand out from regular French culture. The young women in They Call Me Muslim reported running during lunch time to attend afternoon prayer at a mosque because such practices are not allowed in French schools. The French public will have to either accept the idea of multiculturalism or keep the Algerian women from their old way of life, into accepting fully the French culture.  Legal Conflicts  In the France's constitution, there is a clause named La√Øcit√© which denotes the separation of church and state. Many Muslims who would like to wear the Hijab of their choosing cite this part of the Constitution.Ferrero, Diana They Call Me Muslim italy/France/Iran: 2006 On the other hand, La√Øcit√© also could be used to prohibit the display and practice of religion in schools, making daily prayer and the Hijab constitutionally unacceptable.Creamean, Letitia Membership of foreigners: Algerians in France. Arab Studies Quarterly 1996 18(1) The French are afraid not only of the destruction of their culture, but of the destruction of women's rights. Muslim women's views on the issue range widely depending on the cultural context. While women in Britain say that the hijab frees them from the predatory gazes of men; in France women are angry that they do not get to choose to wear the Hijab, while women in Iran have expressed that it is a symbol of male governmental oppression. There eventually was a law passed by the French National Party and Nicolas Sarkozy making it illegal to wear a Hijab or any other conspicuous religious symbol (such as a large crucifix) in French schools. In addition, there are conflicts in schools over Muslim girls' participation in mandatory Physical Education courses that require swimsuits or other clothing deemed unacceptable by the Muslim community. Teachers complain that their classes have been disrupted by such complaints and there is no protocol for dealing with the situation. After 50 or more years of large numbers of Algerian immigrants, the cross cultural differences still have not been reconciled.

He is one-third of the American country music band Lady A, in which he plays guitar, piano and mandolin, and sings backing vocals. Early life Haywood's father, Van, is a dental instructor/dentist who invented a teeth-whitening method (originally discovered by Dr. Bill Klusmeier) and his mother, Angie, is a teacher. Both are involved in music in their church. Haywood's mother taught him to play piano and his father taught him to play guitar. Their family sang and played instruments together as he was growing up. He also sang in Trinity-on-the-Hill United Methodist Church's youth choir called Love Unlimited where he served as the president during his senior year of high school. Dave and his family lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for about a decade when his father taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's School of Dentistry. In 1993, the Haywoods moved back to Augusta. Haywood first met Charles Kelley at Riverside Middle School in Evans, Georgia. He was in a jazz band with Charles's brother Josh Kelley when he attended Lakeside High School and graduated in 2000. He attended college at the University of Georgia where he graduated in 2004. Haywood formed the country music group as Lady Antebellum in 2006, in Nashville, Tennessee along with Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott.

In 2004, he engineered and produced, co- wrote and sang harmony vocals on a CD for Mary Bragg titled Certain Simple Things. Lady A In 2005, Haywood would meet up with Kelley, his old middle school classmate, every other weekend in Atlanta, Georgia to write songs together. Kelley convinced Haywood to move to Nashville in 2006 to write songs together and to help Kelley to become a successful solo country artist. Haywood quit his job with Protiviti, Inc. in Atlanta and moved to Nashville to focus on music full-time. Shortly after, Hillary Scott recognized Kelley at a bar in Nashville from Kelley's MySpace page that Haywood had created. Kelley invited Scott to join him and Haywood to write songs together which led to them creating the new group, in which they named Lady Antebellum.

The treaty was signed in Paris on 2 April 1980. The boundary set out by the text of the treaty is 364.8 nautical miles long and trends northeast‚Äìsouthwest. The boundary consists of six straight-line maritime segments defined by seven individual coordinate points. The boundary is an approximate equidistant line between the two territories. The northwest endpoint of the border stops at the exact midway point between Mauritius, R√©union, and Tromelin Island. (The end point is from each of the islands.) Tromelin Island is claimed by both France and Mauritius, so the boundary was deliberately terminated to allow for future resolution of the dispute.

It was originally scheduled to premiere on ABC on January 27, 2010, but it was preempted by the State of the Union address and pushed back a week to February 3, 2010. The episode was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by Jason Winer. In the episode, Mitchell tries to offer his legal advice to Gloria after a car crash she was involved, believing that it was not her fault. Claire meets an old friend from work, Valerie, and thinks that Valerie pities her for leaving her job years back to raise her family. Claire wants to prove to her that she made the right decision. Jay and Cameron go to the gym to play racquetball but an incident in the locker room does not allow Jay to concentrate on the game. The episode achieved a Nielsen rating of 3.9/10, attracting 9.07 million viewers and received positive reviews from critics. Plot Jay (Ed O'Neill) asks Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) for legal advice for Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) who had been involved in a car crash. While Mitchell thinks that it is not Gloria's fault, Manny (Rico Rodriguez) informs him that it was his mom's fault since she is a terrible driver. Mitchell tries to bring up the possibility that it was her fault but Gloria gets mad accusing him of being stereotypical. She leaves saying that she does not need him as a lawyer anymore. A little bit later, she comes back to apologize and to ask for Mitchell's help again for a second car crash. This time she crashed into a restaurant while she was attempting to leave. Claire (Julie Bowen) is going to meet with an old friend from work, Valerie (Minnie Driver). While they are talking, Claire realizes that Valerie pities her for quitting her job to raise a family. Claire wants to prove to her that this was not a bad decision and she brings her home to meet her family. Things at the house though are not as perfect as Claire was hoping. In the meantime, Jay goes to the gym with Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) to play racquetball. A disturbing moment at the locker room though, that Cameron names \\"moon landing\\", is enough to make Jay not be able to concentrate at the game. Also, Haley (Sarah Hyland) and Dylan (Reid Ewing) break up and Dylan tries to win her back by standing outside her window playing music on his iPod. Reception=Ratings The episode surprisingly survived against American Idol with 9.194 million viewers and a Nielsen rating of 3.9/11. The episode ranked 14 in the 18‚Äì49 rating, but couldn't break the top 20 in total viewership. Reviews The episode got positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8, saying that it was \\"Impressive\\" and \\"If any one of these story lines had been given more time within the episode, their comic potential could have been better fulfilled. It's possible Valerie could have become more of a character than a cutout. Jay could have had more time to deal with, and more politically incorrect things to say about, his butt bump. But as it were, though the stories were less than fulfilling, Modern Family still delivered a decent amount of laughs.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad gave it a positive review saying that \\"Sometimes I wonder if I could just write up a review of 'Modern Family' by listing all of the great quotes that come out of this show. Line for line, this has to be one of the cleverest series on television today. Even the episode title, 'Moon Landing,' recalls a great moment\\". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave it a B+, saying fans of the ABC hit Lost would be satisfied by the episode. Lesley Savage of Entertainment Weekly gave it a positive review saying that \\"Could last night‚Äôs episode of Modern Family been any funnier? I mean, I may as well have transcribed the entire episode, because every line had me practically running to my own Porta- Potty.

It was released in Japan on December 10, 2009 and in North America on April 2, 2010. It was originally titled Again: Eye of Providence. Plot A string of serial murders from 19 years ago have started up again. The player takes the role of J, an agent of the FBI and sole survivor of the murders. J has a special ability called \\"past vision\\" to solve puzzles, which he uses as he investigates the murders committed by the serial killer known only as \\"Providence\\". Gameplay The game is presented in FMV cutscenes. While playing the game, the DS is held vertically, using two screens for the visions. Environments are explored in first person, with the player moving around using the control pad. The player can use J's psychic abilities to see into the past, which allows him to investigate crime scenes as they happened. The player can inspect items and interact with the environment using the touch screen, and can view visions of the past by manipulating the area to make it look like what it looked like when the crime was committed. After all of the visions in an area have been found, the player will be given a series of clips that are out of order. Putting the clips in order reveals a short video where the murder is shown. J has a \\"psychic health meter\\" which depletes if the players uses his abilities on areas irrelevant to the case. Completely draining the meter results in a game over, forcing the player to restart the investigation. J can also interview witnesses for additional information through a branching dialogue system. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Critics praised the concept, FMV artstyle, and controls, but criticized the \\"Psychic health meter\\", mechanics, sense of direction, dialogue system, and ending. Writing for Eurogamer, John Walker gave a disappointed review, stating, \\"It's a game that asks the player to think more deeply, or at least demands that one be slightly pretentious when discussing it. But rather sadly, it's also rubbish.\\". Writing for Game Informer, Annette Gonzalez called the game a \\"Huge snoozefest\\" and criticized the area graphics, calling them \\"Muddy and pixelated\\". Writing for IGN, Arthur Gies was harsh on the game, calling it \\"Full of bad adventure game cliches\\" and \\"Mired in repetition\\". In a review for GameSpot, Nathan Meunier criticized the game's plot progression, calling it \\"Awkward and clunky\\", but praised the FMV artstyle, saying it \\"[Made] the [game] stand out in a good way\\". In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, two sevens, and one eight, for a total of 30 out of 40. Randy Nelson from Nintendo Power praised the game mechanics that recreate past crimes for bringing \\"a fresh new twist\\" to the DS hardware but felt there wasn't enough of it. He concludes by calling Again \\"an open-and-shut case for budding crime- solvers with a taste for the unusual.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:2009 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Detective video games Category:Cing games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Tecmo games Category:Video games about police officers Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Visual novels Category:Illuminati ","title":"Again (video game)"},{"id":"25899914","text":"Jordi Torras Badosa (born 24 September 1980), commonly known as Torras, is a Spanish futsal player who plays for Asti as an Ala / Cierre.

Ferry and Bridge on the Monongahela He owned a ferry that ran from the end of Wood Street across the Monongahela. The ferry was operated by William Graham, who kept a tavern at the northwest corner of Wood and Water Street. The ferry was in operation until 1818, when it was replaced by the Monongahela Bridge, in which he was a shareholder. One of Beltzhoover's coal wagons was on the bridge when it collapsed in 1832. The collapsed north end of the bridge was re- built, and the bridge re-opened on 29 October 1832. The bridge was destroyed in The Great Fire of Pittsburgh on 10 April 1845. Mine In 1825, he opened a mine on the northern side of Mt. Washington, across the river from the town of Pittsburgh. This penetrated the hill to the southern side in 1861, and was later enlarged to become the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel.

Porter Collegiate Institute, officially known as the Scarborough Academy of Technological, Environmental and Computer Education @ W. A. Porter Collegiate Institute (SATEC, SATEC @ W. A. Porter C.I., WAPCI, W. A. Porter or Porter) is a secondary school located in Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario, Canada serving grades 9-12 as part of the Toronto District School Board, formerly part of the Scarborough Board of Education. Founded in 1958, the school offers an innovative program that combines rigorous academics with in-depth applications of technology, computer and environmental studies. SATEC @ Porter provides a climate for structured and accountable learning with high academic and citizenship expectations for all students, including student uniforms and adherence to a code of behaviour. SATEC is an enriched science, technology, engineering and mathematics focused school. It is consistently ranked #1 in Toronto for Technological Studies, and within the top three for Math and Science. Porter's motto is Vincit qui se Vincit which means \\"He conquers who conquers himself\\". History Located on 14.9 acres of land, W. A. Porter Collegiate Institute had its cornerstone laid and constructed in 1957 and opened for classes on September 9, 1958 to serve the south-west area of Scarborough as the city's fifth collegiate. The building was designed by the Toronto-based architectural firm Carter, Coleman and Rankin Associates.http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/892 The school's namesake, William Arnot Porter (1893-1956) began teaching in 1922 at Scarborough High School as a science teacher, specializing in the science of agriculture. He became the school‚Äôs principal in 1954, and continued his lifelong work until his death in 1956. The school's founding principal was J. Ross Stevenson who served a year at Porter until he was transferred to the new David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute in 1959. https://www.thomsonforever.ca/newsletters-archive/1997-Fall-Thomson- Tradewinds.pdf By 1961, the swimming pool was added. Additions were made in subsequent years. With enrollment numbers dwindling, the SBE considered closing either Porter or Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute. However, instead, it was decided that at the start of the 1997-98 school year, W. A. Porter Collegiate was designated as the Scarborough Academy of Technological, Environmental and Computer Education by the SBE, although the original name continues to exist. As of the 2000-01 academic year, Porter's attendance area was expanded after Midland closed that June. Since then, Porter‚Äôs enrollment has rapidly increased. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008, coinciding with the PEO Engineering Education Conference of the same year. In 2010, Porter C.I. became a certified, platinum Eco-School of the TDSB. Porter has a range of specialized programs like MST (Math and Science Technology), Cisco, High Skills Major, and many more. It celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2018. Porter's feeder schools are Clairlea Public School, Danforth Gardens Public School, General Brock Public School and Regent Heights Public School Overview Admissions to SATEC @ Porter Collegiate are competitive and based on three factors: the entrance test, which is held each December, the student's Ontario grade 7 final report card, and the extra-curricular and leadership supplementary application. Along with this, applicants must bring a $10 fee and photo identification to the test. Students are ranked based on all three factors, and those at the top of the ranking are admitted first, whereas students who are not accepted may be placed on a waiting list if deemed necessary by school administration. The school allows re-applying for admissions up until grade 9. SATEC/Porter is regarded as a magnet school by the school board because of its strong technology program and its policies. It is a CISCO regional academy with certification in CISCO Networking and A+ Computer Service Technician Certification for the senior program. It has been named ‚ÄúBest For Technology‚Äù every year since 2006 among the secondary schools of Toronto. Along with R. H. King Academy, it is one of the few schools to have uniform policies and to accept students out of area. The school offers two Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) programs: ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and the Environment. In each program, students are required to complete a set number of courses, including a two-credit co-op course, along with obtaining industry standard certification. The first graduates from SATEC/Porter with the Specialist High Skills Major accreditation were the Class of 2011. Facility W. A. Porter currently sits on 14.9 acres in a two-storey building. Unlike Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute and West Hill Collegiate Institute which were both designed by Harold Carter, the academic areas and gymnatorium layout are the shape of a backward letter L. Other features include a 500-seat auditorium, library resource centre, four gymnasiums, cafeteria, technical-vocational shops and a six-lane pool located at the eastern corner of the school. There are 15 fire exits. During the summer months, the YMCA leases out the school and operates children's camps with the school's facilities. In January 2016, the TDSB released a list of schools which needed major repairs ranked by the province in \\"critical\\" condition. SATEC/Porter, built in 1956, was ranked 26th of 136 in the repair backlog list at 96.09%.Nearly a quarter of Toronto public schools in 'critical' condition - CTV News, January 20, 2016.

Common names include beaked willow, long-beaked willow, gray willow, and Bebb's willow. This species is also called red willow by native Americans according to The Arctic Prairies Appendix E by Ernest Tompson Seton. Leaf underside This plant is typically a large, fast-growing, multiple-stemmed shrub or small, shrubby tree capable of forming dense, colonial thickets. It can be found in loose, saturated soils such as that on riverbanks, lakesides, swamps, marshes, and bogs. It is capable of tolerating heavy clay and rocky soils, making it highly adaptable and durable. It is a dominant species in many marshland areas in its native range. Leaves are alternately arranged, simple, and ovate in shape, widest near the midrib and narrowing to a tapering base and pointed tip. The leaf edges are generally entire, though sometimes finely serrated. The leaves are dull blue-green in color and smooth in texture when mature; new leaves are coated in downy hairs. The leaves are up to 5 in long and 1.5 in wide. Like other willows, this plant is dioecious, with male and female plants producing small, dangling catkins. Female flowers yield spherical seeds covered in long, threadlike fibers that help them disperse on the wind. The plant also spreads via vegetative reproduction, sprouting from the base of the stem or from segments of root, and by layering, allowing the plant to form colonies of clones.US Forest Service Fire Ecology This is the most important species of diamond willow, a type of willow which produces fine, colorful wood used for carving. The twigs and branches are used by Native Americans for basket weaving and arrowmaking. Many parts of the plant are consumed by animals, especially domestic cattle, which find the foliage a palatable forage. This species readily hybridizes with several other species of willow.Flora of North America ReferencesExternal links Trunk of large tree growing at the far south of its range *Jepson Manual eFlora (TJM2) treatment of Salix bebbiana *UC Photos gallery: Salix bebbiana bebbiana Category:Flora of the Northwestern United States Category:Flora of Western Canada Category:Flora of the Southwestern United States Category:Flora of the North-Central United States Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America) Category:Flora of Eastern Canada Category:Flora of the Northeastern United States Category:Flora of Alaska Category:Flora of California Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States Category:Plants described in 1895 ","title":"Salix bebbiana"},{"id":"25900097","text":"John Henry Curran was an Irish professional baseball player who appeared in three games for the Philadelphia Athletics in .

Nutrients derived from the prey are used to supplement the nutrient-poor substrate that the plant grows in. Uniquely among Pinguicula species from the Americas, p. orchidioides produces gemma-like basal buds which elongate into stolons and serve as a means of asexual reproduction. In the winter the plant forms a non-carnivorous rosette of small, fleshy leaves that conserves energy while food and moisture supplies are low. Single purple flowers appear between July and September on upright stalks up to 22 centimeters long. The species was first described in 1844 by Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle, but following an unfortunate misidentification by his contemporary William Jackson Hooker, was relegated to the ranks of botanical synonymy and generally forgotten until it was rediscovered through the works of botanists in the 1990s. The generic name Pinguicula is derived from the Latin pinguis (meaning \\"fat\\") due to the buttery texture of the surface of the carnivorous leaves. The specific epithet orchidioides refers to dainty, orchid-like flowers. Plant characteristics Bulblets around the base of a summer rosette elongating into stolons Habit and phenology Like many Mexican butterworts, P. orchidioides is seasonally dimorphic, in that it undergoes two distinct growth habits throughout the year. During the summer when rain and insect prey are most plentiful, the plant forms a ground hugging rosette up to 10 centimeters (4 in) in diameter and composed of ovate to lanceolate leaves with distinct petioles. These leaves are carnivorous, having a large surface area densely covered with stalked mucilaginous glands with which they attract, trap, and digest arthropod prey, most commonly flies. These so-called \\"summer leaves\\" are replaced by \\"winter rosettes\\" of small, glandless succulent leaves with the onset of the dry season in November or December. This protective winter rosette allows the plant to undergo winter dormancy until the first rains begin in May. Flowers born singly on upright 7‚Äì22 centimeters (3‚Äì9 in.) peduncles emerge from July‚ÄìSeptember as the summer growth begins. Leaves and stolons Stolons allow for vegetative propagation The leaf blades of the summer rosettes of P. orchidioides are smooth, rigid, and succulent, and generally green in color. The laminae are generally ovate to lanceolate, between 20 and 46 millimeters (2‚Äì5 in.) long and 6‚Äì18 millimeters wide, and have deeply involute margins. These are supported by 10‚Äì30 millimeter petioles with ciliate margins. The \\"winter\\" or \\"resting\\" rosette of P. orchidioides is 6‚Äì13 millimeters (¬º‚Äì¬Ω in.) in diameter and consists of 25 to 36 small, compact, fleshy, non-glandular leaves. These are each 5 to 11 millimeters (‚Äì1 ¬º in.) long and one to three millimeters (‚Äì‚Öõ in.) wide, acuminate, acute, and densely covered with fine hairs.Ruiz 2001, pg. 202 In a feature unique among Mexican Pinguicula,The Spanish P. vallisnerifolia and Ecuadorian P. calyptrata share this trait, though with shorter stolons P. orchidioides produces stolons throughout the summer growing period. These start out as gemma-like buds in the winter rosette and elongate into whip-like stolons up to 8 centimeters (3 in) long during the summer.Luhrs, 1995 These stolons, which have small non-glandular leaves interspersed along their length, can take root to form new plantlets upon contact with a suitable growing substrate. This trait allows the species to form clumps of plants, many of which are genetically identical. As is typical in the genus, the upper lamina surface of the summer leaves is densely covered by peduncular (stalked) mucilagenous glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.Legendre, L. 2000 Flowers P. orchidioides flower Pinguicula orchidioides produces one to three flowers during each flowering period. These are borne singly on upright flower stalks which are 7 to 22 centimeters (3‚Äì9 in.) long, cherry red in color, and glabrous except near the calyx. The flowers themselves are composed of five petals which are fused at one end. The throat, the portion of the flower near the attachment point which holds the reproductive organs, is funnel shaped, and the petals flare out from there into a five-lobed zygomorphic corolla. Below the attachment point to the stem the petals are fused into an 18‚Äì26 millimeter long spur which protrudes backwards roughly perpendicular to the rest of the flower. The violet-purple flowers are 30 to 48 millimeters (1 ¬º‚Äì2 in.) long, and have a deeply bilabiate corolla, with a 2-lobed upper lip and a 3-lobed lower lip. The upper lobes are 10‚Äì14 millimeters (‚Öú‚Äì‚Öù in.) long by 5‚Äì9 millimeters (‚Äì‚Öú in.) wide and generally oblong-obovate. The outer lower lobes are oblong-lanceolate, 11‚Äì16 millimeters (¬º‚Äì¬æ in.) long by 4‚Äì7 millimeters (‚Äì in.) wide, narrowing at the tip. The central lower lobe is slightly longer than its neighbors, 15‚Äì19 millimeters (‚Öù‚Äì¬æ in.) long by 4‚Äì5 millimeters (‚Äì in.) wide, and is marked with a white stripe at its base. The floral tube that houses the reproductive organs and is visible at the base of corolla lobes is short 3‚Äì4 millimeters (‚Öõ‚Äì in.) long and lacks a palate. The ovary and attached pistil protrude from the top of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Anthers hang from recurved filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated.Legendre, L. Pollination of Pinguicula flowers. Retrieved on January 2, 2007. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 4‚Äì5 millimeter (‚Äì in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1 millimeter long seeds. Botanical history Hooker's \\"P. orchidioides\\", in reality P. moranensis Pinguicula orchidioides was first described by French-Swiss botanist Alphonse Louis Pierre Pyramus de Candolle in 1844 based on collections by G. Andrieux (130).Concerning G. Andrieux, Hemsley (1886-1888) states: \\"An excellent collector of Mexican plants, concerning whom we have been able to find no particulars beyond the fact that he sent dried plants, collected in the States of Oaxaca, Puebla, and Mexico, to Delessert before 1835. The Hookerian herbarium contained a set of Andrieux's plants ; but Gray's herbarium, purchased by Sir Joseph Hooker, included a much fuller set, inscribed 'Dedit Andrieux, 1834.'\\" De Candolle, in subdividing the genus Pinguicula, included the species in the newly created section Orcheosanthus along with other species with purple, deeply bilabiate corollas with 5 sub-equal lobes, a short floral tube, and a large spur not protruding past this tube.From Ruiz, S.J. 2001, orig. Candolle, A.P. De. 1844 Two years later, Hooker described a plant he saw growing at Kew Botanical Gardens and, thinking it to be similar to Candolle's P. orchidioides, applied that name.Hooker, 1846 Unfortunately, this specimen was actually a P. moranensis var. neovolcanica, causing great confusion for taxonomists who thereafter treated P. orchidioides as a synonym of P. caudataHemsley 1879-88Ernst, 1961 or P. macrophylla.McVaugh & Mickel, 1963 Recognition of the species was only maintained by Sprague (1928), who contended that De Candolle's species was discrete from the plant described by Hooker. Casper, while omitting the species from his revision of the genus in 1966, noted that P. orchidioides auct. non A.DC.: Hook. was probably a nomen dubium vel ambiguum.Casper, 1966 However, the identification of P. orchidioides A.DC. was left unaddressed and was forgotten, so that when Hans Luhrs described stoloniferous Pinguicula specimens in 1995, he did so under a new name: P. stolonifera. It wasn't until 1998 that the species was re- described under the name P. orchidioides by Mexican Pinguicula specialist Sergio Zamudio. He noted its distinction from other species based on leaf shape, stolon production, flower morphology and geographical isolation (from P. oblongiloba). Capable of asexual reproduction, P. orchidioides tends to be clump-forming. Distribution and habitat Distribution of P. orchidioides in Mexico and Guatemala Pinguicula orchidioides is currently known from only a handful of sites, most of them in the state of Oaxaca, though a few locations are also known from the state of Guerrero and the Guatemalan department of Solol√°. The lack of records from Chiapas and other intermediary zones is likely the result of sampling bias.Ruiz, S.J; 2001; Revision de la seccion Orcheosanthus del Genero Pinguicula (Lentibulariaceae) Here it grows in mountainous regions between 2000 and 2700 (3000) meters (6500‚Äì8850 ft) in altitude. Pinguicula orchidioides seems to prefer humid hillsides, slopes or embankments, where it grows amongst pine-oak woodlands in reddish-brown to brown, clay or sandy-clay soil. Other companion plants include members of the genera Arbutus, Arctostaphylos, and Clethra. NotesReferences *Casper, S.J. 1966. Monographie der Gattung Pinguicula L. Heft 127/128, Vol 31.

It belongs to the subfamily Tortricinae and therein to the tribe Cnephasiini, of which it is the type genus.Baixeras et al. (2009a) Taxonomy and systematics The type species around which Cnephasia was established by J. Curtis in 1826 (in the explanations to plate 100 of his British Entomology) was claimed to be \\"Tortrix logiana\\". However, this was a misidentification; the name of T. logiana (described by C.A. Clerck in 1759 and nowadays called Acleris logiana) was until the early 20th century frequently applied to related species in error.Curtis, [1826], Baixeras et al. (2009a), and see references in Savela (2010) Curtis simply repeated the mistake of A.H. Haworth, who had in his 1811 volume of Lepidoptera Britannica discussed a Cnephasia under Clerck's name, but the original misidentification may well go back to Linnaeus' treatment of \\"T. logiana\\" in Systema naturae. Eventually, this was resolved, and the type species of Cnephasia was determined to be the tortrix moth described as Olethreutes pasiuana by J. H√ºbner in 1822.Curtis, [1826], Razowski (1998): 243 Species The currently recognized species of Cnephasia are:Baixeras et al.

Diagnosis Isodemis is characterized by the labial palpus obliquely uprising almost as high as the upper edge of the eye. The forewing is dominantly yellowish brown or ochreous brown, the median fascia is interrupted or indistinct near the costal margin. The male genitalia have a hooked gnathos and the valva have a C-shaped plica, with numerous fine wrinkles between the plica and costa. The female genitalia usually have a ductus bursae with a cestum and the single dentate signum with a conspicuous globular process placed posteriorly in the corpus bursae. Distribution China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka.
