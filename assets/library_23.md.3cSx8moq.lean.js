In May 2010, Wozniak murdered his neighbor and friend, PFC Samuel Eliezer \\"Sam\\" Herr and Herr's friend, Juri \\"Julie\\" Kibuishi, as part of a plan to frame Herr for Kibuishi‚Äôs murder and steal his savings. Wozniak was deeply in debt and wanted money to finance his upcoming wedding and honeymoon. Wozniak and his then-fianc√©e, Rachel Mae Buffett, lived in the same apartment complex as Herr in Costa Mesa, California. After more than five years of court proceedings, Wozniak went to trial and was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. He was found guilty and sentenced to death in September 2016. He is incarcerated at California's San Quentin State Prison. Crimes and cover-up On May 21, 2010, Wozniak shot and killed his neighbor, PFC Samuel \\"Sam\\" Herr, a 26-year-old OEF Army Veteran of the 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team at a Los Alamitos theater. At the time of the murders, Wozniak was deeply in debt and unemployed. After Herr told him that he had savings of about $62,000 from combat pay, Wozniak decided to kill Herr in order to steal his money. In an effort to misdirect police and cast blame upon Herr, Wozniak then used Herr's cell phone to text Juri \\"Julie\\" Kibuishi, a 23-year-old college student who had been tutoring Herr at Orange Coast College. Wozniak lured Kibuishi to Herr's apartment where he shot and killed her. Wozniak then staged the crime scene to make it appear as though Kibuishi had been sexually assaulted, suggesting that Herr had committed her assault and subsequent murder and then gone on the run. The same evening, Wozniak went on to perform in his local theatre production. Afterwards, Wozniak dismembered Herr‚Äôs body by removing his limbs and head. An extensive manhunt for Herr was launched by authorities who then believed Herr was responsible for Kibuishi's murder and was on the run. Wozniak came under suspicion after he instructed a sixteen-year-old to withdraw money from Herr's accounts. When the police confronted the boy, they were told by the boy that Wozniak had asked him to withdraw the money for him.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzO4A-tPdTg Soon after, Wozniak was apprehended at his bachelor party two days before his wedding. After repeatedly lying to police, Wozniak finally confessed. Wozniak led authorities to Herr's body where it was found buried at El Dorado Nature Center in Long Beach. After more than five years of court proceedings, Wozniak went to trial and was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to death in September 2016. In November 2012, Wozniak's then-fianc√©e, Rachel Mae Buffett, was arrested and charged with three felony counts of accessory-after- the-fact based on allegations that she had lied multiple times to police investigators. On September 12, 2018, Buffett was convicted on two of those counts with a maximum possible sentence of 44 months and, on November 8, 2018, was sentenced to 32 months, with probation, time served, and good conduct, Buffett expected to serve between one and two years in the Orange County Jail. In popular culture The case has been covered by numerous crime and news programs in the United States, including: * Dr. Phil (\\"Actress Accused: Was She an Accessory to Murder?\\", first aired February 5, 2013). During the show, Samuel's father, Steve Herr, showed resentment toward Rachel Buffett, Wozniak's then-fiance√©, and her claims of not knowing anything about the murders. Buffett was charged in 2012 as an accessory-after-the-fact in the murders. * Lockup (MSNBC, \\"Lockup Orange County: Extended Stay: Unholy Trinity\\"). The episode was filmed in the Orange County Jail and featured an interview with Wozniak as he proclaimed his innocence. The episode outraged the relatives of Wozniak's victims, who said he charmed the camera and proclaimed his devotion to the Bible and the two people he killed. * Dateline NBC (\\"Plot Twist\\", first aired January 15, 2016; \\"Final Curtain,\\" first aired November 30, 2018; \\"Plot Twist\\" repackaged and shown on Dateline: Secrets Uncovered, a part of Oxygen, aired July 5, 2019).

The concept was formulated by Dziembowski et al. in 2015 and with a different formal definition by Ateniese et al. in 2014. Proofs of space are very similar to proofs of work, except that instead of computation, storage is used. Proof-of- space is related to, but also considerably different from, memory-hard functions and proofs of retrievability. After the release of Bitcoin, alternatives to its PoW mining mechanism were researched and PoSpace was studied in the context of cryptocurrencies. Proofs of space are seen as a fairer and greener alternative by blockchain enthusiasts due to the general- purpose nature of storage and the lower energy cost required by storage. Several theoretical and practical implementations of PoSpace have been released and discussed, such as SpaceMint and Burstcoin. PoS is also being used in cloud storage technologies in which the peers contribute their free disk space and get service proportionately. However, peers can also get paid if they let their free space to be used by peers that need more space. Storj is a PoS based cloud storage example.  Concept description  A proof-of- space is a piece of data that a prover sends to a verifier to prove that the prover has reserved a certain amount of space. For practicality, the verification process needs to be efficient, namely, consume a small amount of space and time. For soundness, it should be hard for the prover to pass the verification if it does not actually reserve the claimed amount of space. One way of implementing PoSpace is by using hard-to-pebble graphs. The verifier asks the prover to build a labeling of a hard-to-pebble graph. The prover commits to the labeling. The verifier then asks the prover to open several random locations in the commitment.  Proof of space-time  It is a variant of proof of space, used by Filecoin.  Uses  Proofs of space could be used as an alternative to proofs of work in the traditional client puzzle applications such as anti-spam measures and denial of service attack prevention. Proof-of-Space has also been used for malware detection, by determining whether the L1 cache of a processor is empty (e.g., has enough space to evaluate the PoSpace routine without cache misses) or contains a routine that resisted being evicted.Markus Jakobsson Secure Remote Attestation Cryptology ePrint Archive. Retrieved 8 January 2018. Proofs of space have been developed further in several concept papers and in one live cryptocurrency implementation.  Implementations  Burstcoin = Proof of space or Proof of capacity is used in the Burstcoin cryptocurrency founded in August 2014. Proof of capacity consumes disk space rather than computing resources to mine a block. Unlike PoW, where the miners keep changing the block header and hash to find the solution, the Proof of capacity implementation in Burstcoin generates random solutions, also called plots, using the Shabal cryptographic algorithm in advance and stores it on hard drives. This stage is called plotting and it may take days or even weeks depending on the storage capacity of the drive. In the next stage - mining, miners match their solutions to the most recent puzzle and the node with the fastest solution gets to mine the next block.  Concepts  SpaceMint = In 2015, a paper proposed a cryptocurrency called SpaceMint.Park et al. SpaceMint: A Cryptocurrency Based on Proofs of Space. Cryptology ePrint Archive. Retrieved 31 October 2016. It attempts to solve some of the practical design problems associated with the pebbling-based PoSpace schemes. In using PoSpace for decentralized cryptocurrency, the protocol has to be adapted to work in a non-interactive protocol since each individual in the network has to behave as a verifier. = Chia = In 2018, a proposed cryptocurrency Chia presented two papers presenting a new protocol based on proof of space and proof of time.

The crossing lends its name to the sparsely populated Black Falls community of the Navajo Nation which is located in the area. Geology Around 20,000 years ago the Grand Falls Lava Flow consisting of alkali olivine basalt proceeded along the Little Colorado River bed from a vent near Merriam crater. At Black Falls Crossing the lava flow has blocked the river channel so that when the river is flowing a ten-foot high waterfall is formed. At other times the rock is completely covered by sand. Uranium mining The Navajo people have been affected by uranium mining in the area. There are a large number of abandoned uranium mines to the north and east of the crossing. In 2007 the Navajo People of the Black Falls community were awarded an Environmental Justice Grant by the EPA due to uranium pollution of drinking water wells. History Black Falls Crossing has long been a significant crossing place. It was on the major Hopi trail from villages to the San Francisco Peaks , was the turning point of the Sitgreaves Expedition and rest stop on the Mormon Trail. In 1940 Black Falls Irrigation Project was commenced by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Civilian Conservation Corps to improve farming prospects in the area. Black Falls Dam was built adjacent to the crossing in an attempt to divert water to an irrigation system. The project was abandoned in 1942 due to a lack of funds, leaving the dam in place. Black Falls Trading Post In 1941 Black Falls Trading Post was established by Emmett Kellam on the south- west side of the river to trade with Navajos camped on the north side working for the irrigation project. After the project ceased the trading post continued to serve the Navajo living in the area, and became one of the most important locations for local Navajo trading activity through the 1940s and fifties. A 1943 land transfer had made the post part of the Wupatki National Monument, and it consequently served as a centre for social activities and meetings. The post was demolished in 1964.

Life Johann Christoph Schwab was born in Ilsfeld, a small country town in the hills north of Stuttgart. His father was an accountant employed in the public service. Schwab attended the University of T√ºbingen where he studied Philosophy and Theology, obtaining his degree in 1764. After this he spent eleven years working in the French speaking region to the north of Lake Geneva, taking a succession of tutoring posts. By the end of these years he had acquired a deep knowledge of French literature and of the French language. In 1778 he was appointed to a professorship for Logic and Metaphysics at the Hohe Karlsschule (academy) in Stuttgart. Friedrich Schiller was a student there at the same time. Schwab was not an admirer of the new Kantian critical philosophical approach emanating from K√∂nigsberg. His lectures tended to ignore Kant. In numerous books and essays he refuted the significance of the new approach as a reformulation of old thought patterns: he took every opportunity to characterise Kant's contribution as insignificant and shot through with inconsistency and contradiction. The spread of Kant's ideas had an increasingly polarising impact, and as he grew older Schwab moved from a position of nuanced conservatism, becoming progressively more \\"spirited\\" in his advocacy of the \\"traditional\\" philosophical structures identified by Leibniz and Wolff. Over the years Schwab received several prizes for his philosophical writings, including three from the Berlin based Prussian Academy of Sciences of which he became an external member in 1788 and an honorary member in 1812. Perhaps the most significant of those prizes was the first, awarded in 1784, in an essay investigating why French had become a universal international language across Europe, how long this situation might continue, and whether the distinction was merited. It was shortly after receiving that first prize that he was summoned to Berlin by a committed user of the French language and admirer of French culture, King Frederick. He was offered a post at the Military Academy in Berlin, which at this time was the principal government supported education establishment in Prussia. In the event, however, Schwab received more persuasive offers of preferment at home. The Prince of W√ºrttemberg gave him a government appointment as privy secretary in Stuttgart. The duke died in 1793 and was succeeded by his brother, Duke Louis Eugene, who had known Schwab when they had been young men in the French speaking area north of Geneva. Johann Christoph Schwab now received further promotion, becoming a privy councillor. There was some opposition from those who questioned whether a background as an establishment philosopher was an appropriate basis for accelerated promotion to a senior position in government service, and in 1798 an anonymous letter appeared defending Schwab's position. Controversy nevertheless rumbled on, although the impact of the French Revolutionary Wars was a more pressing concern for government during the 1790s. Schwab continued to hold a succession of government appointments during these turbulent years, and in 1816 the new king, William I, appointed him an Oberstudienrat (senior counsellor). Despite his government responsibilities, Schwab continued his work as a philosopher at least till 1813. His final work, \\"On the dark precepts\\" (\\"Von den dunkeln Vorstellungen\\") continued to apply and refine the Leibniz method even though he was well aware that by now this left him isolated from what had become the intellectual mainstream. Johann Christoph Schwab died at Stuttgart on 15 April 1821. Personal Schwab married Johanna Philippina Friderika Rapp who came from a well established Stuttgart based merchant family. She was a niece of the sculptor Johann Heinrich von Dannecker. Children of the Schwab marriage included the Justice Minister and privy councillor (1781-1847) and the writer-priest Gustav Schwab (1792-1850).

The single was released by Aladdin Records on a 78 rpm, 10\\" shellac single record. Background The words \\"mother for you\\" or \\"mother fuyer\\", as minced oaths for \\"motherfucker\\", were used in blues and R&B; records from the 1930s. Examples include Memphis Minnie's \\"Dirty Mother For You\\" (Decca Records, 1935) and Washboard Sam (1935), plus Roosevelt Sykes in 1936, with the slightly amended title of \\"Dirty Mother For You (Don't You Know)\\". The singer Stick McGhee, whose recording of \\"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\\" was a hit in 1949, claimed that he had originally heard the song as \\"Drinking Wine, Motherfucker\\". Record Red Nelson found no reason to be particularly oblique over the title of this jump blues track, which he recorded in 1947. It was released using the nom de disque, Dirty Red, by Aladdin Records (catalog reference 194A). The effective minced oath seemed to have confused the censors. The dirty blues lyrics included the lines \\"I got to put this mule to jumpin' in yo' stall, I'm a lovin' muther for ya\\". The track, which Nelson claimed to be his own on the record label, was clearly a variant of the earlier songs of a similar nature and song title. Dirty Red's \\"Mother Fuyer\\" has been included on numerous compilation albums, including The Aladdin Records Story (1994). Dirty Red's recording was played on episode two of Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour, when the themed title was 'Mother'. Cover versions The song was covered by Chick Willis on his 1972 album Stoop Down Baby... Let Your Daddy See, and released as a B-side on a single on La Val Records. Willis claimed songwriting credits. The song was also covered by B.B. King in 1977 and appeared on his album, King Size, with King this time claiming ownership of the songwriting. It was also on his subsequent compilation albums, King of the Blues (1992) and Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. B.B. King (2012).

Bottom: A magnetic nano next to a U.S. quarter dollar coin, for size comparison. A magnetic nano, (often shortened to just 'nano'), is a small metal container, measuring a centimetre in height and width, with a screw-top lid and a thin, cylindrical magnet at its base. They often have an O-ring seal between the lid and the body to make them easier to open and partially waterproof. Original use Magnetic nanos were originally manufactured in 2001 to store flashing LED lights for use as jewellery, giving them the colloquial name 'blinkies'. The LED went inside the lid, with two button batteries the nano's tube and a rare-earth magnet at the base, so the nano could attach to clothing and jewellery. Use as geocache containers A silver magnetic nano geocache attached to a gatepost in Aargau, Switzerland. When it was discovered that magnetic nanos can be used as geocache containers, they were quickly mass-produced and sold for that purpose. They are widely known in the geocaching community as one of the smallest geocache containers. Magnetic nano geocaches only contain a thin, rolled-up paper sheet for geocachers to sign their username initials on. Popularity Due to their very small size, they have become especially popular in urban locations (particularly cities), allowing for geocaches to easily be hidden in these areas. With larger geocaches, there are limitations to where urban geocaches can be well hidden without raising alarm. Magnetic nanos, however, are often too small to be noticed and their magnetic nature means they can attach to, and blend in with, the vast majority of urban metallic structures such as benches, metal fences/railings and road signs. Size Classification Some geocache listing websites, such as Geocaching.com, don't have 'nano' as a size to select from when creating a cache listing, so geocachers are advised to list nano geocaches as 'micro', as they are less than 10 millilitres in volume Some geocachers believe that 'nano' should be a separate size to 'micro' due to their noticeable size difference, so use the 'other' or 'not specified' size option. Issues Magnetic nanos are not completely weatherproof, even with an O-ring seal, and this can present some issues: The paper log sheets inside nanos can sometimes become jammed and difficult to extract and roll back up, particularly if water has entered the nano. As a result, it is recommended that geocachers bring tweezers if they are finding nano caches and this is usually written on the geocache's webpage. Also, in cold conditions, if no rubber seal is present, then the nano can freeze and become difficult to open.

Life Born in Mirsk . Ephorinus enrolled at the Cracow Academy in 1515, earning a baccalarius in 1522 and a magister in 1527. He briefly lectured there on dialectics and logic. He also worked as a tutor and counted a young Jan Boner and the son of Justus Ludovicus Decius among his pupils. With the former, Ephorinus travelled widely, stopping in Erfurt and N√ºrnberg, reaching Freiburg in 1531. There, Ephorinus stayed with Erasmus for some months. He studied medicine in Padua, earning a medical doctorate on 11 April 1534. Ephorinus returned to Cracow in autumn 1537. On his return to Cracow, he was appointed as the first town doctor, and not long thereafter the king appointed him physician to the Wieliczka salt mine. In Cracow, Ephorinus was part of the Erasmian circle of Leonard Cox. Franciszek Mymer wrote a poem, titled \\"In salvum reditum Anselmi Ephoryni...\\" (1538) celebrating Ephorinus‚Äô return to Poland. He corresponded with Erasmus.Halina Kowalska, ‚ÄúAnselmus Ephorinus‚Äù in Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation, edited by Peter G. Bietenholz and Thomas Brian Deutscher (Toronto; Buffalo: University of Toronto Press, 1985): 436-37. Ephorinus is now considered an early advocate of a distinct Silesian identity. In their correspondence Erasmus frequently referred to Ephorinus as a Pole. To put this to rest, Ephorinus signed a letter: Tuus et suus, Anselmus Ephorinus, Silesius non Polonus (Your and my own, Anselmus Ephorinus, a Silesian, not a Pole). Anselmus Ephorinus died in 1566.

The plugin has five million active installations and has been downloaded more than 202 million times.WordPress Plugin advanced view  History  Yoast SEO created its first All in One SEO Pack plugin in 2007 - originally named WordPress SEO: it was developed as a WordPress plugin by SEO consultant Joost de Valk In 2012, the plug-in was renamed Yoast SEO. In 2012, a premium version of the plug-in was launched.Yoast: About Us In 2015, Yoast hosted the first YoastCon conference which was hosted at the Lindenberg Nijmegen Culture House in Nijmegen, Netherlands. In 2015 a flaw was discovered in version 1.7.3.3 and earlier versions. The flaw could have left users of Yoast SEO open to hackers and was discovered by a security consultant. Over 2018, Yoast had a total turnover of ‚Ç¨ 10 million.  Company  Yoast SEO can trace its origins to 2005 when Joost de Valk launched a website named \\"joostdevalk.nl\\". After moving to and eventually selling the domain \\"css3.info\\", de Valk created the Yoast platform in 2009, launched the first version of WordPress SEO in 2010 and founded the company Yoast BV in 2010. Initially, Yoast focused on SEO consultancy and developed both the Yoast SEO plugin and a Google Analytics plugin, both for WordPress. In 2012, a premium version of Yoast SEO was launched. In April 2016, Yoast BV sold the Google Analytics for WordPress plugin. According to Yoast, as of September 2018 they have almost 100 employees of which 85 are based in their HQ in Wijchen, Netherlands.  Reception  The software runs on more than 11 million sites and on 15.4% of the top 1 million sites in the world. On WordPress alone, it has amassed over five million downloads. Its software was rated \\"5 out of 5\\" by Syed Moiz Balkhi, founder of WPBeginner, a blog for new users to the WordPress platform. Michael David, the author of WordPress Search Engine Optimization (2015) book, referred to it as \\"the granddaddy of all SEO plugins\\". Brian Santo, editor of EE Times, uses Yoast for estimating ranking of articles on Google by using analysis results (e.g. keyphrase, keyword density, links, readability), but criticizes the negative effects SEO has had on journalism and suggest Google use more human or artificial intelligence to improve search. Sponsorship In September 2020, Yoast decided to sponsor a professional basketball team in the province of Gelderland. The team named Yoast United will play in the Dutch Basketball League (DBL).

Superposition of uniform flow and source flow yields the rankine half body flow. A practical example of this type of flow is a bridge pier or a strut placed in a uniform stream. The resulting stream function (\\\\psi) and velocity potential (\\\\phi) are obtained by simply adding the stream function and velocity potential for each individual flow.  Solution  Flow profile of a Rankine half body The flow equations of the Rankine half body are solved using the principle of superposition, combining the solutions of the linear flow of the stream and the circular flow of the source. Given the linear flow field U and the source m, we have : \\\\psi_{uniform} = Ur\\\\sin{\\\\theta} : \\\\psi_{source} = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma \\\\theta}{2\\\\pi} :\\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\psi_{superimposed} & = & \\\\psi_{uniform}+\\\\psi_{source} \\\\ & = & Ur\\\\sin{\\\\theta}+\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma \\\\theta}{2\\\\pi} \\\\ \\\\end{array} :\\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\phi_{superimposed} & = & \\\\phi_{uniform}+\\\\phi_{source} \\\\ & = & Ur\\\\cos{\\\\theta} + \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma \\\\ln{r}}{2\\\\pi} \\\\end{array} The stagnation point for this flow can be determined by equating the velocity to zero in either directions. Because of symmetry of flow in y-direction, stagnation point must lie on x-axis. :u = \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x} \\\\text{ and } v = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial y} Equating both u and v to zero, we obtain U=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{2 \\\\pi b}. At x=-b and \\\\theta = \\\\pi we have stagnation points. :\\\\psi_{stagnation} = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{2} :y = b (\\\\pi - \\\\theta) (equation of flow over Rankine half body) Significance This type of flow provides important information about flow in front part of streamlined body. It is probable that at the boundary, flow is not properly represented for real flow. The pressure and velocity of flow near to boundary layer is calculated by applying the Bernoulli's principle and is approximated with potential flow. The above equations may be used to calculate the stress on the body placed into the flow stream.

At the NIH, much of her work has focused on cell signaling, cellular regulation, lipid metabolism, and the identification of key proteins associated with cholera toxin and pertussis toxin. Vaughan first came to the NIH in the agency‚Äôs fledgling National Heart Institute, now NHLBI, and with the title of senior assistant surgeon worked on protein synthesis in the Building 3 laboratory of biochemist and public scientist Christian B. Anfinsen, Ph.D., who went on to share the 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Among scientists mentored by Vaughan was 1998 Nobel Laureate Ferid Murad, M.D., Ph.D., who in the late 1960s worked as a researcher studying hormone regulation in her NIH laboratory. ‚ÄúShe too was an excellent mentor...she gave me considerable freedom,‚Äù he said in his Nobel lecture. For more than 6 decades at the NIH, Vaughan was active in professional biochemistry societies and other scientific organizations, serving on various editorial and advisory boards. Over the years, she also held a number of research administrative appointments at the NIH related to translational medicine and cell metabolism and metabolic regulation. Education In 1944, Vaughan, a Wisconsin native,1940 Census received her Bachelor of Philosophy degree from the University of Chicago, where noted geneticist Janet Rowley (then Davison) was a classmate. In 1949, Vaughan received her M.D. from the Yale School of Medicine. She then began her research career as a research fellow in Yale‚Äôs Department of Physiological Chemistry. Vaughan completed her internship at Yale‚ÄìNew Haven Hospital. In 1949, while at Yale, Vaughan chaired the Yale School of Medicine chapter of the Association of Internes and Medical Students (AIMS), a national, young doctors' organization founded in 1941.Yale University Library The Yale chapter was known as the Harvey Cushing Chapter. AIMS was concerned the rights of medical students, the draft, vivisection, universal health insurance, racial equality in medical education, and other progressive issues of the time. The organization disbanded in the early 1950s. Honors and awards In 1985, Vaughan was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and served as a member of its Committee on Human Rights. In 1991, she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The event took place within a larger ongoing assault on the city of Mosul by a wide coalition of anti-ISIL forces, which managed to capture Hamam al-Alil on 7 November.  Background  The Battle of Mosul began on 16 October 2016 with forces besieging ISIL-controlled areas in the Nineveh Governorate surrounding Mosul. Massacre and recapture of town By October 29, the town of Hamam al- Alil was \\"almost 90% surrounded\\" as Iraqi security forces and federal police continued their push northward to Mosul. News reports suggested at least 42 civilians were killed by ISIS in the town the day before, and numerous more taken north to serve as human shields in the upcoming offensive. On November 4, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees announced that ISIS was instructing residents of the town to hand over boys aged 9 and older, apparently to fight for the group. Around 150 families from Hamam al-Alil were reportedly moved to Mosul itself. The Commissioner's office estimated that as many as 1,600 civilians may have been forcibly moved from Hamam al-Alil to Tal Afar earlier in the week, and could be transferred even further west into Syria. Prior to the 2014 ISIS offensive, the town and surrounding villages were home to around 65,000 people. By the next day the town was under direct attack from Iraqi forces, with militants using previously planted landmines and bombs to stop their advance. Military reinforcements were sent to the area to help counter the attacks, including aerial support by Iraqi planes and attack helicopters. On November 6, the government offensive succeeded in breaching through to the city center, as the Iraqi forces estimated at least 70 IS fighters, mostly foreign, were left to defend the town. Some militants attempted to escape across the river, while Iraqi troops and police managed to prevent three attempted suicide car bombings. Shortly after Hamam al-Alil was declared fully liberated on November 7, Iraq's military announced it had discovered around 100 beheaded bodies in the College of Agriculture and Forestry (part of the University of Mosul), on the southern outskirts of town. It was not immediately known if those included the 42 reported killed previously, or if they constituted a separate mass killing.  Aftermath  After government forces pushed out ISIS on November 7, locals expressed their joy that the group's reign of terror had been brought to an end, with many re-opening their shops or taking the opportunity to bathe in the town's sulfur springs. Officials with the federal police said they will focus on clearing operations around Hamam al-Alil before proceeding north toward Mosul.

She has directed one full-length documentary, four short documentaries and one animated documentary. Ghaemmaghami‚Äôs most recent film, Sonita (2015), tells the story of Sonita Alizadeh teenage Afghan refugee in Iran who uses rap music as a way to escape the traditionally limiting roles of women in Afghanistan after her family tries to sell her into marriage. when Sonita's mother decides to sell Sonita to a marriage, Rokhsareh cannot keep her objective role as a documentary filmmaker and pays 2000$ to the mom and helps Sonita to record a music video and escape her situation. Interference of filmmaker in protagonist circumstances made this documentary controversial. The film won the World Documentary Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2016, and it also won the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the IDFA Amsterdam Film Festival. The film received the True Life Fund at the 2016 True/False Film Festival in Columbia, Mo. The fund sponsors the subject of one film each year, and it offers the viewers a chance to make a monetary donation to help the film‚Äôs subject. The fund collected $42,500 for Sonita, which is the most the True Life Fund has ever raised. Ghaemmaghami currently lives in the United States, but is traveling to show Sonita at film festivals across the world.  Life and career  Ghaemmaghami is from Tehran and received her Bachelor of Arts in filmmaking and Master of Arts in animation from Tehran Art University. She researched documentary animation and published ‚ÄúAnimated Documentary, a New Way to Express‚Äù as her Master‚Äôs research. She directed a short, animated documentary during her research in 2007 called Cyanosis, which showed the work of a Tehran street artist. Ghaemmaghami‚Äôs documentary Going Up the Stairs tells the story of an illiterate Iranian woman who discovers her painting talent late in life. Akram was married at the age of nine, and she finds an outlet much later in her life through painting. Her work is discovered and an exhibition of her art is going to be shown in Paris. However, she needs her husband‚Äôs permission to go to the showing. Ghaemmaghami uses the documentary to show traditional Iranian marriages and the struggle women face in these marriages. Many of Ghaemmaghami‚Äôs films tell the stories of artists overcoming barriers to their success.  Sonita  Ghaemmaghami‚Äôs first full-length documentary, Sonita, shows how, as both director and character in the film, Ghaemmaghami struggled between a desire to help Sonita or continue filming as the story unfolded. ‚ÄúI wanted to just let the story happen but at some point the situation became such that I had to help,\\" Ghaemmaghami told The National. Regarding Ghaemmaghami‚Äôs role in the film, The Guardian says, ‚ÄúThe approach works: to witness Sonita‚Äôs rise from timid rapper to empowered activist over a three-year span is thrilling.‚Äù One of the most- discussed elements of the documentary, and what Ghaemmaghami herself calls the biggest challenge of making the documentary, is when she inserts herself into the documentary and gives Sonita‚Äôs family $2,000 ‚Äî a sum that will help her buy time before she is sold into marriage. ‚ÄúMaking \\"Sonita\\" was a journey into the depths of society to understand poverty, immigration, war, identity, sexism, tradition and human values versus filmmaking conventions,‚Äù Ghaemmaghami told Women and Hollywood. Ghaemmaghami‚Äôs involvement in the film has also been attributed to Sonita‚Äôs growth as a woman. The Hollywood Reporter says: ‚ÄúGhaem Maghami's camera is never any kind of fly on the wall, and the voluble Sonita's chattily informal relationship with the older director ‚Ä¶ is clearly a crucial element in her personal development into the super- confident, irrepressible young woman she becomes.‚Äù  Style  Ghaemmaghami describes the main theme of her documentaries as ‚Äúoutsider art.‚Äù When the audience leaves the theater, Ghaemmaghami told Women and Hollywood, ‚ÄúI want them to think about small changes they can make happen.‚Äù  Filmography  * Sonita (2015) * Going Up the Stairs (2011) * A Loud Solitude (2010) * Born 20 Minutes Late (2010) * Cyanosis (2007) * Pigeon Fanciers (2000) Awards and nominations= Sonita  * Winner, Audience Prize (Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival) * Winner, DOC U!

It was part of a series of guns designed after the British military reverted to rifled muzzle-loading artillery until a more satisfactory breech- loading system than that of the Armstrong guns was developed.  Description  Ammunition for the 25-pounder RML The gun consisted of a central toughened steel \\"A\\" tube surrounded by two wrought-iron coils. Rifling was the \\"Woolwich\\" pattern of three broad grooves, with a uniform twist of 1 turn in 35 calibres (i.e. in 166.25 inches).Treatise on the Construction and Manufacture of Ordnance in the British Service, 1877, Page 258.

The guns used black powder charges in silk bags to fire three types of ammunition ‚Äì common shell, shrapnel shell or case shot. A copper vent towards the end of the bore of the gun enabled friction tubes to be used to fire the gun.

She was based out of Baltimore and later Portsmouth for service as an inspection tender. She also serviced aids to navigation in the Chesapeake Bay. In April 1889, President Benjamin Harrison, his family, Secretary of State Blaine and Secretary of the Treasury Windom rode the Holly down the Potomac River and back. In April 1893, on her way down the Potomac River, she rescued Congressman Reyburn when his yacht, the Gretchen, was found burning off Marshall Hall, Maryland. Less than a week later, with Commodore Fighting Bob Evans aboard, Holly and her crew rescued 28 African Americans when their boat capsized near Old Point Comfort. Later reconfigured as a lightvessel, she served on the Wolftrap Shoal station in 1893, the Bush Bluff station in 1894 and later saw service as a relief lightship. She was restored to her configuration as a tender, along with an overhaul and hull lengthening in 1898. After this reconfiguration, the Holly was capable of servicing lighthouses outside the Chesapeake Bay. In 1916, she was still servicing lighthouses and other aids to navigation in the Chesapeake Bay and Pocomoke Sound, between Baltimore and Norfolk. Her principal duties was servicing buoy inspection and overhauling work and delivering fuel to isolated light stations. The June 1917 Annual Report of the Light-House Board recommended replacing Holly, as she had been worn out in service. However, in August 1917, she was towed to Baltimore for overhaul costing over $6,000. The extensive overhaul was completed by the end of October 1917, and she returned to her lighthouse service duties in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. She was laid up in 1921 due to a lack of funds but was put back into service later that decade. She was decommissioned on 1 August 1931 and was sold for $691 on 4 December of that same year. Sometime later her owners removed her engine and converted her for use as the barge Wright No. 1. She was \\"discarded\\" in 1944.

Following the gradual downturn of the Islamic Golden Age, the Timurid Empire, based in Central Asia ruled by the Timurid dynasty, witnessed the revival of the arts and sciences. The movement spread across the Muslim world and left profound impacts on late medieval Asia. The French word renaissance means \\"rebirth\\", and defines a period as one of cultural revival. The use of the term for the description of this period has raised reservations among scholars, some of whom see it as a swan song of Timurid culture. The Timurid Renaissance was marked simultaneously with the Renaissance movement in Europe.The Connoisseur - Volume 219 - Page 128Europe in the second millenium: a hegemony achieved? - Page 58 It was described as equal in glory to the Italian Quattrocento. The Timurid Renaissance reached its peak in the 15th century, after the end of the period of Mongol invasions and conquests. Based on Persian-Islamic ideals,World History as the History of Foundations, 3000 BCE to 1500 CE By Michael Borgolte, page 293 the symbols of the Timurid Renaissance include the rebuilding of the Samarkand and the invention of Tamerlane Chess by Timur, the reign of Shah Rukh and his consort Gawhar Shad in Herat (a city which rivaled Florence of the Italian Renaissance as the center of a cultural rebirth),Periods of World History: A Latin American Perspective - Page 129The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia - Page 465 the period of the astronomer and mathematician Ulugh Begh (along with notable polymaths and Islamic scholars), and the construction of additional learning centers by the art patron Sultan Husayn Bayqara. The Timur reign experienced revived interest in classical Persian art. Large-scale building projects were undertaken, creating mausoleums, madrasas, and kitabhane - medieval Islamic book workshops. Mathematical and astronomical studies were reinvigorated, and at the beginning of the 16th century, mastering firearms was achieved. Major commissions from the Timur's lifetime were the Summer Palace in Shahrisabz, Bibi-Khanym Mosque, and the construction of the Registan. The city of Herat became an important center of intellectual and artistic life in the Muslim world during this time. Samarkand, a center of scholarly study which was previously destroyed during the Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia, became the center of the Renaissance and Persian culture in general due to the reconstruction during the period. The Timurid Renaissance differed from previous Buyid dynasty cultural and artistic developments in that it was not a direct revival of classical models, but rather a broadening of their cultural appeal by including more colloquial styles in Persian language, as by including more widespread Turkic language and the official language. The Timurid Renaissance was inherited by the Mughal Empire Strange Parallels: Volume 2, Mainland Mirrors: Europe, Japan, China, South Asia, and the Islands: Southeast Asia in Global Context, C.800-1830 by Victor Lieberman Page 712Imperial Identity in the Mughal Empire by Lisa Page 4Sufism and Society: Arrangements of the Mystical in the Muslim World, 1200‚Äì1800 edited by John Curry, Erik Ohlander, Page 141 and had significant influence on the other states of the Age of the Islamic Gunpowders (Ottoman Turkey and Safavid Iran).The Silk Road: A Very Short Introduction by James A.

The Timurid Empire was founded by Emperor Tamerlane in 1370 after the conquest of several Ilkhanate successor states. After conquering a city, the Timurids commonly spared the lives of the local artisans and deported them to the Timurid capital of Samarkand. After the Timurids conquered Persia in the early 15th century, many Persian artistic traits became interwoven with existing Mongol art. Timur's establishment of Sharia later in life made Samarkand one of the centers of Islamic art. In the mid 15th century the empire moved its capital to Herat, which became a focal point for Timurid art. As with Samarkand, Persian artisans and intellectuals soon established Herat as a center for arts and culture. Soon, many of the Timurids adopted Persian culture as their own.B.F. Manz; W.M. Thackston; D.J. Roxburgh; L. Golombek; L. Komaroff; R.E. Darley-Doran (2007). \\"Timurids\\". Encyclopedia of Islam, online edition. \\"During the Timurid period, three languages, Persian, Turkish, and Arabic were in use. The major language of the period was Persian, the native language of the Tajik (Persian) component of society and the language of learning acquired by all literate and/or urban Turks. Persian served as the language of administration, history, belles lettres, and poetry.\\"  Arts  Sultan Husayn Bayqara,a patron of Art, constructed multiple centers of learning. Timurid art absorbed and improved upon the traditional Persian concept of the \\"Arts of the Book\\". The new, Timurid-inflected works of art saw illustrated paper (as opposed to parchment) manuscripts produced by the empire's artists. These illustrations were notable for their rich colors and elaborate designs. Due to the quality of the miniature paintings found in these manuscripts, archaeologist and art historian Suzan Yalman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art noted that \\"the Herat school [of manuscript painting] is often regarded as the apogee of Persian painting. Timurid silver-inlaid steel is often being cited as being of particularly high quality. Painting was not limited to manuscripts, as many Timurid artists also created intricate wall paintings. Many of these wall paintings depicted landscapes derived from both Persian and Chinese artistic tradition.\\"Timurids\\" The Columbia Encyclopedia (Sixth ed.). New York City: Columbia University. Retrieved 2006-11-08. While the subject matter of these paintings was borrowed from other cultures, Timurid wall paintings were eventually refined into their own, unique style.Lentz, W. Thomas.

Pelican History of Art, . Sultan Husayn Bayqara reign saw a further rise in the arts. He was renowned as a benefactor and patron of learning in his kingdom. Sultan Husayn built numerous structures including a famous school;He has been described as \\"the quintessential Timurid ruler of the later period in Transoxiana\\" and his sophisticated court and generous artistic patronage was a source of admiration, particularly from his cousin, Babur of the Mughal India. Timurid architecture Timurid architecture drew on the aspects of the Seljuk architecture. Turquoise and blue tiles forming intricate linear and geometric patterns decorated the facades of buildings. Sometimes the interior was decorated similarly, with painting and stucco relief further enriching the effect.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Timurid Dynasty\\", Online Academic Edition, 2007. \\"Turkic dynasty descended from the conqueror Timur (Tamerlane), renowned for its brilliant revival of artistic and intellectual life in Iran and Central Asia. ... Trading and artistic communities were brought into the capital city of Herat, where a library was founded, and the capital became the centre of a renewed and artistically brilliant Persian culture.\\" Timurid architecture is the pinnacle of Islamic art in Central Asia. Spectacular and stately edifices erected by Tamerlane and his successors in Samarkand and Herat helped to disseminate the influence of the Ilkhanid school of art in India, thus giving rise to the celebrated Mughal (or Mongol) school of architecture. Timurid architecture started with the sanctuary of Ahmed Yasawi in present-day Kazakhstan and culminated in Timur's mausoleum Gur-e Amir in Samarkand. Timur's Gur-I Mir, the 14th-century mausoleum of the conqueror is covered with \\"turquoise Persian tiles\\".John Julius Norwich, Great Architecture of the World, Da Capo Press, 2001. p. 278. Nearby, in the center of the ancient town, a \\"Persian style madrassa\\" (religious school) and a \\"Persian style mosque\\" by Ulugh Beg is observed. The mausoleum of Timurid princes, with their turquoise and blue-tiled domes remain among the most refined and exquisite Persian architecture.Hugh Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live In, Da Capo Press, 2007. p. 237 Axial symmetry is a characteristic of all major Timurid structures, notably the ShƒÅh-e Zenda in Samarkand, the Musallah complex in Herat, and the mosque of Gawhar Shad in Mashhad. Double domes of various shapes abound, and the outsides are perfused with brilliant colors. Timur's dominance of the region strengthened the influence of his capital and Persian architecture upon the Indian Subcontinent.Banister Fletcher, Dan Cruickshan, Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture, Architectural Press, 1996. pg 606  Metalwork, ceramics, and carving  The Timurid Empire also produced quality pieces of metalwork. Steel, iron, brass, and bronze were commonly used as mediums.

Theorem of Al-Kashi Papers from Ali Qushji's scientific works. Jamshid al-Kashi was one of the most influential contributors in the fields of mathematics and astronomy. He got immense support from both Emperor Shah Rukh and Queen Goharshad, who were very interested in the sciences and encouraged theirs court to study the various fields in great depth. Consequently, the period of their power became one of many scholarly achievements. The rein of Sultan Ulugh Begh saw the scientific peak of the empire. During his rule, al- Kashi produced sine tables to four sexagesimal digits (equivalent to eight decimal places) of accuracy for each degree and includes differences for each minute. He also produced tables dealing with transformations between coordinate systems on the celestial sphere, such as the transformation from the ecliptic coordinate system to the equatorial coordinate system. The Sullam al-Sama was authored, which provided the resolution of difficulties met by predecessors in the determination of distances and sizes of heavenly bodies such as the Earth, the Moon, the Sun and the Stars. The Treatise on Astronomical Observational Instruments was also written which described a variety of different instruments, including the triquetrum and armillary sphere, the equinoctial armillary and solsticial armillary of Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi, the sine and versine instrument of Urdi, the sextant of al-Khujandi, the Fakhri sextant at the Samarqand observatory, a double quadrant Azimuth- altitude instrument he invented, and a small armillary sphere incorporating an alhidade which he invented. The invention of the Plate of Conjunctions was seen, an analog computing instrument used to determine the time of day at which planetary conjunctions will occur, and for performing linear interpolation. Invented was also a mechanical planetary computer which he called the Plate of Zones, which could graphically solve a number of planetary problems, including the prediction of the true positions in longitude of the Sun and Moon, and the planets in terms of elliptical orbits; the latitudes of the Sun, Moon, and planets; and the ecliptic of the Sun. The instrument also incorporated an alhidade and ruler. Ulugh Begh founded an institute in Samarkand which soon became a prominent university. Students from all over the Middle East, and beyond, flocked to this academy in the capital city of his sultanate. Consequently, Ulugh Beg gathered many great mathematicians and scientists of the Middle East, including Ali Qushji. Ali made significant development of astronomical physics independent from natural philosophy, and for providing empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation in his treatise, Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy. In addition to his contributions to Ulugh Beg's famous work Zij-i-Sultani and to the founding of Sahn-ƒ± Seman Medrese, one of the first centers for the study of various traditional Islamic sciences in the Ottoman caliphate, Ali Ku≈ü√ßu was also the author of several scientific works and textbooks on astronomy. Qushji's most important astronomical work is Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy. Under the influence of Islamic theologians who opposed the interference of Aristotelianism in astronomy, Qushji rejected Aristotelian physics and completely separated natural philosophy from Islamic astronomy, allowing astronomy to become a purely empirical and mathematical science. This allowed him to explore alternatives to the Aristotelian notion of a stationary Earth, as he explored the idea of a moving Earth instead (though Savage-Smith asserts that no Islamic astronomers proposed a heliocentric universe. It was also found that the empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation through his observation on comets and concluded, on the basis of empirical evidence rather than speculative philosophy, that the moving Earth theory is just as likely to be true as the stationary Earth theory.F.

The Greek vernacular name is ŒëŒ¥œÅŒ±ŒªŒØŒ¥Œ± (Adralida), meaning \\"handsome Lida\\". The leaves are pinnate, and may be up to 1 cm wide. The ligulate flowers are yellow. The species is an endemic of Greece.  Description  H. graecum is a perennial herb with glandular, rough but softly hairy shoots. It has twenty chromosomes (2n = 20). The rosette consists of pinnately lobed leaves, the end-lobe largest, oval, with a rounded tip, and segments often with teeth. Few small leaves on the stem are slightly pinnate and linear further up. The plant is of average height (20‚Äì70 cm). It usually has 1-3 yellow inflorescences (heads) per stem, each on a peduncle of 10‚Äì30 cm. The narrow yellow ligulate florets with five short teeth at the tip sometimes have a whitish base, the tube being hairy. The fruits (or cypselas) are 4‚Äì5 mm long and stiffly hairy, and are topped by 12‚Äì14 mm long pappus scales. The hairless involucre consists of hairless, cartilaginous bracts (or phyllaries) with papery, sometimes serrated edges. Those on the outside are oval, the inner phyllaries are narrower.  Differences with related species  The genus Hymenonema contains two species, 'H. laconicum, which is known from the southern Peloponnesos and H. graecum. H. graecum has yellow florets with yellow anther tubes, which sit on 3¬Ω-5 mm long and ¬æ-1¬æ mm thick, sparsely hairy cypselas, encircled by pappus that differs maximally 5 mm in length, and basal leaves with a narrow top segment of usually 3‚Äì10 mm. H. laconicum differs in having yolk yellow ligulate florets with a purple spot at the base and dark purple anther tubes, which sit on 4¬æ-6 mm long and 1¬Ω-2 mm wide cypselas and the pappus differing 8‚Äì15 mm in length, and basal leaves with a broader top segment of 10‚Äì35 mm wide.  Taxonomy  Catananche graeca was described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, based on a specimen from the Cyclades. In 1817 Henri Cassini described Hymenonema tournefortii, which is now considered a synonym of Catananche graeca L.. In 1838 Augustin Pyramus de Candolle moved the species to Cassini's genus, recombining it with Linnaeus' epithet to Hymenonema graecum. Confusingly, and also in 1838, Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent and Louis Athanase Chaubard in their Nouvelle Flore du P√©lopon√®se et des Cyclades described Catananche graeca, but now based on a specimen from the Peloponnesos. Pierre Edmond Boissier and Theodor von Heldreich realised that the plants described by Linnaeus and by Bory and Chaubard, belonged to related but different species, therefore the last assigned name was no longer available, and hence invalid. They proposed a new name for it, Hymenonema laconium, which they published in 1875. hosted on  Distribution and habitat  This species is endemic to Greece, and is only known from the Cyclades and doubtfully from western Crete. It grows on rocky soils, under scrubs, in dry meadows, along roads and at the seaside. The species is tolerant to moderately increased salinity.

Background  Early issues of POST magazine on the iPad were identified with a unique suffix; the first and second issues were titled 'POSTgravity' and 'POSTperformance'. \\"POST offers a map for others to follow,\\" The New York Times stated in May 2011. The website was launched in 2013 under the name 'POSTmatter'. No further iPad editions were released following its launch, and POSTmatter was adopted as the official name of the online magazine.  POSTmatter special projects  As part of the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011, POSTmatter created a physical pavilion and accompanying app titled ‚ÄòCommercial Break‚Äô in partnership with Neville Wakefield and Dasha Zhukova. It featured the work of over 130 international artists, including Ari Marcopoulos, Aleksandra Mir, Raymond Pettibon, Cyprien Gaillard, Christian Jankowski and Agathe Snow. POSTmatter worked with artist Doug Aitken in 2012 to create an app-based experience based on his large-scale multimedia production ‚ÄòALTERED EARTH‚Äô, commissioned by the LUMA Foundation.  POSTmatter exhibitions  In 2014, POSTmatter staged its first exhibition at the Accademia di Brera in Milan. A series of interactive installations were displayed, showing three fashion films that could be altered by human touch or movement. One of these installations, 'Ripple', was exhibited again in 2015 at Fashion Space Gallery, London, as part of the exhibition 'Digital Disturbances'. POSTmatter presented a 3-part talk series at the London College of Fashion to accompany the exhibition. In 2015, POSTmatter took part in fig-2 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. An exhibition was curated by POSTmatter that brought together photography, sound and video works, while artists, writers and curators were invited to participate in live writing events that were published online.

Overview  Founded by a group of Londoners with European roots, the aim was to send the British people a \\"love bomb\\" to make them stay in the European Union. Europeans were hugging Brits and posting images of it on social media to encourage a Remain vote in the referendum. Photos and videos of those hugs were shared via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and also became very popular in the traditional media in Britain and internationally. The campaign went viral just before the referendum in April and May 2016. Despite a strong voice in the media, the campaign was not able to turn around the vote, which resulted in an overall decision to leave the EU.  Positioning  While the official Remain and Leave campaigns focused mainly on the economy and migration, Hug A Brit became a significant part of the referendum campaigns by putting positive emotions in the centre. Instead of negative campaigning and scaremongering, the movement focused on personal stories and relationships and was therefore recognised widely as a positive outlier.  Nigel Farage  While Hug A Brit strongly advocated for a Remain vote, it did not exclude Eurosceptics from hugging. On April 15 Birgit Maass, Co-Initiator of the movement, hugged leading Leave campaigner Nigel Farage live on the BBC television.  Founding members  Hug A Brit was founded by a group of European nationals living in the United Kingdom, without political affiliations to any party nor support or external funding. After the EU referendum, the group's activity decreased. It is not known if further campaigns are planned around the British exit negotiations with the European Union.  The Europe State Award  #Hugabrit was nominated for the Europe State Award 2016 by the Austrian ministry for Foreign and European Affairs.

He was raised between his home town of El Vendrell as well as in Barcelona. He is most well known for the \\"Jumping Brain\\" sculpture. Biography Emilio Garcia, known by his brain-related sculptures was born in January 1981 in Tarragona, Spain. Fascinated by the cognitive development and pop culture, Emilio Garcia explores the neuroplasticity of human brain by creating contemporary iconic eye-catching sculptures and paintings in vibrant colors. He graduated from Escola d'Art i Disseny de Tarragona in Graphic Design in 1999, combining study with work at different cartoon animation studios in Barcelona as layout artist and illustrator... Since 1999 he has worked as freelance art director for international major companies like Berlitz Corporation, Hitachi, Diesel, Inditex, Metro, Vans or The North Face specializing in user interface design and interactive content. His work is published in several \\"Web Design Index\\" books by Pepin Press & Agile Rabbit (2002‚Äì08) and \\"Taschen's 1000 Favorite Websites\\" (2003) among others. Concerned with the digitalization of our society, saw his culture moving slowly away from the tactile. As reaction to this, in 2008 he left his multimedia career and embraced the physical objects. Fascinated by the creative possibilities of plastic, he started a new stage as product designer, sculptor and painter under his own brand The Secret Lapo Laboratories (also known as Lapolab.). Arts and products His first independent project was the now famous \\"Jumping Brain\\", a combination of brain and frog, inspired by \\"the historical stories about crazy and funny ideas that people had to go over the Berlin Wall\\" as he states in an interview. The first sculptures were homemade by himself as limited editions, and was awarded first prize in the Plastic and Plush Toy Awards, Best Sculpting Category in 2008. Early 2009 he partnered with the designer toy company Toy2R to produce it as a designer toy. This simple idea with its clean, detailed design and a sense of whimsy has positioned him in the top tier of most select collectors selling out extremely quickly. Large scale and bronze versions of the \\"Jumping Brain\\" were sold in \\"SCOPE Art Show 2011\\", \\"Swab Barcelona Contemporary Art Fair 2012\\" and was also image of \\"MIA Art Fair 2012\\".

Then he start being involved in all sorts of neuro-urban merchandising, from designer toys to skate decks, clothing, prints and more, collaborating with brands like Disney or Chanel and artists like Paul Frank or Mark Ryden. His work have been on display in different museums around the world like the \\"Mus√©e des Beaux Arts\\" in Qu√©bec and the \\"International Museum of Surgical Science\\" of Chicago.http://streetanatomy.com/2010/09/12/street-anatomy-group-gallery- show-‚Äì-opening-night/#sthash.5HOOqXjL.dpbs He's gone on to create many other whimsical brain-based sculptures and paintings including the recent \\"Sponge Brain\\" and \\"Brain Heart\\", the latter for \\"Art Fair Tokyo 2016\\" and \\"Swab Barcelona Contemporary Art Fair 2016\\". Publications Emilio Garcia's artwork is reviewed on many art, design and culture magazines like Clutter, Neo2 or Juxtapoz, featured in several exhibition catalogues, and have contributed in different books such \\"We are Indie Toys\\" by HarperCollins , \\"Resin Toys\\" by Lemo Editorial or \\"Skullture: Skulls in Contemporary Visual Culture\\" by Gingko Press He also was interviewed and contributed in the documentary \\"An Artisan Designer Toy\\" by Jose .M Cu√±at & Victor M.

Early life  Harriet Jemima Winifred Clisby was born in St. James's, London, in 1830, and moved with her parents and two siblings to Adelaide, South Australia, when she was eight years old. She married sailor Henry Edward Walker on February 25, 1848. Clisby was a vegetarian from 1847, the same year in which she became a member of the Swedenborgian New Church.Uglow, Jennifer S; Hendry, Maggy. The Northeastern Dictionary of Women's Biography. Northeastern University Press. p. 130. She also practiced gymnastics.  Career  While in her twenties she moved to Melbourne, where she worked as a magazine editor for the Southern Phonographic Harmonia and, with Caroline Dexter co-published The Interpreter, the first Australian magazine published by women. She also organized a community home for the rehabilitation of women prisoners in 1858. Inspired by Elizabeth Blackwell's 1852 book on women's health, Clisby decided to study medicine. She traveled to England and studied nursing at Guy's Hospital, where she met with Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, a prominent woman physician and hospital founder who advised her to train in the United States. With a friend's financial support, Clisby trained at the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, graduating in 1865. In 1871, Clisby moved to Boston, where she practiced homeopathy and lectured on hygiene. Clisby wrote a series of travel writings about Australia for the Woman's Journal, a Boston-based woman suffrage newspaper edited by Lucy Stone and Henry B. Blackwell, in 1873. The \\"Sketches of Australia\\" reflected on the young Clisby's immigration to and early life in Australia. In 1877, while still living in Boston, Clisby and several friends founded the Women's Educational and Industrial Union to address the problems of poor women, especially unemployed immigrants. In a large building on Boylston Street, women could take English language lessons, learn millinery, dressmaking, and needlework, and obtain free legal advice. Later the WEIU provided job placement services and training for domestic and retail work, and eventually established a women's credit union. The WEIU remained in operation well into the 20th century, providing many of the same services as a settlement house. Clisby served briefly as the organization's first president before resigning for health reasons, and was vice president from 1882 to 1889.  Later years  After retiring from medicine she moved to Geneva, where she founded L'Union des Femmes. She remained active for many years, giving lectures on medical and spiritual subjects into her nineties. She died in London in 1931 at the age of 100. In 1930, she was described as the oldest woman doctor in the world.\\"Dr. Harriet Clisby 100 Years Old\\". The Register News-Pictorial (October 18, 1930). Clisby is remembered in connection with the WEIU on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. Clisby Close, in the Australian Capital Territory suburb of Cook, is named in her honour.

Although initially trained as an architect, he produced over 100 works of art, influenced by movements as diverse as Cubism, Abstract Expressionism and Symbolism.Luca Keseru, Andrew Fekete January 2014: http://www.andrewfekete.net/uploads/8/3/2/1/8321682/andrew_fekete_by_luca_keseru__english_version_.pdf A practising Jungian alchemist, Fekete believed his art was a form of self- therapy for the mental illness with which he struggled his entire life. Alongside his visual art, Fekete kept extensive illustrated diaries which included numerous poems, essays and novellas, dealing with subjects ranging from art history and mythology to theosophy and mysticism.  Early life  Andrew Julian Fekete was born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London on 1 May 1954. His parents, Andrew Fekete, and Elizabeth n√©e Szeleczky, were displaced people at the end of the Second World War, coming to the UK as refugees under the official Resettlement Programmes; first his mother in 1947, followed by his father a year later in 1948.Peter Fekete, Biographical Sketch, p.1 October 2016 The Fekete family originates from Transylvania, while the Szeleczky family trace their origins to the Alfold plain of Hungary. After escaping from Hungary during the period of the Stalinist regime of M√°ty√°s R√°kosi, Andrew's father became a successful restaurateur in the West End of London, while his mother trained as a nurse. After the birth of his brother Peter in 1958 and his sister Elizabeth in 1959, Andrew's mother returned to work as a night-sister at a hospital in Croydon. Fekete's early years were set against a background of strong Hungarian identity. His parents were closely connected to the Hungarian National Club, at that time based in St John's Wood, and the family initially shared a house with an elderly Hungarian couple in Streatham. The family also had a mixed religious background; his mother was a Roman Catholic, whilst his father's family were strongly associated with the Translyvanian Unitarian Church. Both nationalist and religious influences were muted once the family moved to Thornton Heath, South London- although initially raised bilingual, Fekete appeared to have forgotten Hungarian as he matured. Fekete attended David Livingstone Primary School from 1959 to 1966 where he was a popular pupil and the family entered fully into the local school community. Subsequently, Fekete attended Selhurst Grammar School, where Fekete's burgeoning sense of individualism appears to have left him relatively isolated. It was during his middle years at Selhurst that he began to develop awareness of his homosexual identity, and on account of this appears to have suffered from bullying.Peter Fekete, Sketch, p.1 Fekete's immersion in art began at an early stage. His mother used to take the children on family outings, and they visited all the museums, galleries and stately homes within reach by coach of the family house in South London. His mother- who, like Fekete had a talent for drawing and design- was also a skilled dress-maker. During his secondary school years Fekete developed the custom of going for very long walks, and also to traveling into London on his own to visit museums, galleries and to study the streets and their buildings. He became immersed in architecture, making designs for houses, and from an early age he chose architecture as his vocation. Fekete was also introduced to Modernist literature by one of his school masters, and it was there that he developed a fondness for the poetry of T.S. Eliot.Andrew Fekete, \\"The Serpent\\" in The Quest for Gold, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 2016, pp.69-70 He started writing his own poetry while still at school. He kept a diary almost continuously from the age of 16, and fifty of these diaries have survived his death. It is within these diaries that he began to record his visionary experiences from childhood.  Training  Fekete was accepted to Jesus College, Cambridge to study Architecture, but narrowly failed to make the required grades, owing to his weaker Mathematics.Peter Fekete, Sketch, p.2 He matriculated to the University of Liverpool to study Architecture, where the faculty was under the direction of Professor John Tarn. Fekete studied at Liverpool between September 1972 and June 1974. Alongside his studies, it was during these formative years in Liverpool that Fekete began to paint in earnest; perhaps the most significant work of this period were the preparatory sketches for the large canvas ‚ÄòIt Jives‚Äô. In early 1976, Fekete experienced a crisis, possibly connected with his sexuality, and was placed on a course of tranquilizers by a University doctor. This would mark the first official recognition of the lifelong struggle with mental illness he endured his entire life. In June 1976 Fekete failed the engineering sections of his second year examinations, and, rather than returning to London, he chose to go to Italy, before eventually returning to the family home in South London. He chose not to resume his studies at Liverpool, and started working as a telex operator, and redactor of news for various agencies in North London. During this time, his mother began divorce proceedings; his father left the house in June 1975 and the decree nisi came in 1976. Fekete became increasingly focused on his painting, attending evening class and took an A level in History of Art. Through his father, Andrew became friendly with Dame Elizabeth Frink, who encouraged him in his artistic endeavours.  Career  Two of Fekete's works were accepted for the Summer Show of the Royal Academy in 1976 (Convergence, Pyrimidal Composition). Together with a friend of his from Liverpool days, Andrew joined an architectural pressure group called the New Architectural Movement (NAM). It is from this time that Andrew started to immerse himself in the study of Freud and particularly Jung, and his writings on architecture began to exhibit psychoanalytic influences. From September 1976 to June 1977 Fekete studied at the Central Polytechnic in London (now Westminster University), where he repeated successfully his second year in architecture. Lack of finance prohibited him from completing the third year and obtaining an undergraduate degree, however, he formed close connections during his time there, including associates who would go on to be Professors of Architecture at Liverpool John Moore's University and McGill University. Around this time Fekete began exploring the gay scene of London, frequenting many of the clubs in Soho and making new friendships. He found work with a news agency, which provided him with a period of stable income. The divorce between his parents being effected, his father remarried, and, accepting an invitation to stay with them at their flat in Bayswater, he completed It Jives, the designs for which were started during his Liverpool days. The artist's so called ‚ÄòMonochrome period‚Äô (see below) also began while living with his father. He subsequently moved back to his mother's house and began work on a novel called Aaron, the manuscript of which has been lost. Moving out of his mother's in August, Fekete continued to be active within London's gay scene, where he met a number of like-minded individuals sharing his interest in Jungian psychology and analysis. It was during this period that he began his experiment in regaining the visionary experiences of his infancy; this experiment is described in his retrospective autobiographical essay The Voyage into Night, as well as in a more direct way in his surviving diaries. Fekete started to experience intense visions, which include three visions of the Buddha that are described in his diaries and his autobiographical novel, The Quest for Gold. His dream life was also intense, and he began to have what he called conjunctio experiences; though the precise nature of these events is a matter of interpretation, they are described as at once disturbing and elevating. In his art, he emerged from his Monochrome period into a style that he called \\"Lyrical Abstract Expressionism\\". Leaving the news agency in 1980 due to personal disagreements, he obtained temporary work with an architectural practice, Grogan Associates. By 1982, Fekete's work with Grogan Associates assumed a more permanent characteristic, and Andrew started working with them on a number of projects and, in particular, competition entries. Fekete contributed significantly to the designs of all of these projects, including their competition entries for the redevelopment of Whiteleys (London Town Square) in Bayswater, and for the Extension to the National Gallery. Fekete also met and worked with SOM architect Bruce Graham during this period. The intensity of the architectural work prevented Fekete from further painting. However, it was during this time that he wrote The Quest for Gold (September 1982 to March 1983) based on autobiographical experiences connected with his friends and acquaintances in London.Andrew Fekete, \\"Selected Diary Entries for the Period During the Composition of The Quest for Gold\\" in The Quest for Gold, pp.139-159  Death  In January 1984 Fekete resigned from Grogan Associates, initiating what can be understood as the final period of his life, marked by financial and personal distress. During this time the prime focus of his creative life shifted to his poetry. He also started a \\"city survey\\": a preparation to further development projects which he made as he walked around the city of London taking notes on every new building site. He began by drawing on family and friends for funds in order to meet obligations. It also appears that Fekete was intending to train as a Jungian analyst during this period, though financial and eventually physical constraints prevented him from doing so. His financial difficulties intensified over Christmas 1984; however, he refused to participate in the family gathering, but rather remained alone in bed and breakfast accommodation. In February 1984 he staged an attempted suicide, and as a result his siblings arranged for him to return to his mother, who had by this time moved to Streatham. Supported by his mother, Fekete resumed his creative projects, writing and arranging his poetry, working on a photographic record of all the buildings in London designed by Hawksmoor. He wrote his essay Symbols of Creation and Destruction, in response to Jung's Symbols of Transformation.Peter Fekete, n.1 in \\"Symbols of Creation and Destruction\\" in The Quest for Gold p.171 He started visiting the clinic at St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington, where he was eventually diagnosed as HIV positive. He became convinced that the drug that he was being prescribed, Ketoconazole, was causing hallucinations. On March 6, 1986 he voluntarily admitted himself to St. Mary's Hospital for psychological assessment. The following day he underwent respiratory failure and collapsed. He was placed on a life-support machine. He died on March 31, 1986, having briefly regained consciousness. His mother was in attendance.Peter Fekete, Sketch, p.4  Influences, style & method  As one critic has pointed out,Luca Keseru, Andrew Fekete despite Fekete's work being produced in the seventies and eighties, it shares much more affinity with the genesis of twentieth-century painting. Many of his early paintings directly reference the Cubist movement in some way (Dunes‚ÄîCubism and the Curve reconciled (1972), Cubist Exercise: Tonal Diffusion (1973) for example). However, much of what Fekete refers to in his earlier paintings as Cubism actually might owe more to Orphists such as Robert and Sonia Delaunay, with their bright colours and swirling patterns. Given Fekete's strong Eastern European roots, one might also look to the various members of the Russian Avant-Garde for his inspiration. A number of the earlier ‚ÄòCubist‚Äô compositions share some similarities with Rodchenko's Constructivism, while his later mystical landscapes, with their numerous hidden faces are strangely analogous to Pavel Filonov's disturbing abstractions. Some of Fekete's sketches from the Monochrome period (Sentinel, The New Gate to the Gunnery are reminiscent of M. C. Escher's non-Euclidean geometric universe, but also share some of the architectural and sculptural sensibilities of van Doesburg's and van‚Äôt Hoff's Neoplasticism. Of course, the difference between these artist's work and Fekete's is that his was done in trance-like states, induced by deliberately refraining from sleep for weeks on end. As such, not all these automatic drawings feature the same clean lines. Writing of this method, Fekete said, \\"Absent-mindedly, I always drew little scribbles in notebooks, elaborate doodles which were given little conscious thought but which on later inspection proved to be beautifully ordered.\\" A number of references to the Symbolist painter Arnold Bocklin, in particular his painting The Isle of the Dead, can be found within The Quest for Gold. If one were to speculate, we might wish to link the composition and theme of The Gateway to the City of the Scream to Bocklin's masterpiece. Seeing as Fekte dubbed his later abstract pieces ‚ÄòLyrical Abstract Expressionism‚Äô we can only assume that he took something, if only as a starting point from the Germans, Russians and Americans who championed Abstract Expressionism. In truth though, his compositions resemble their work less visually than they do thematically. Like Rothko, Klee and Kandinsky before him, Fekete's paintings were interested in penetrating to the mystical heart of human experience; like these artists, Fekete viewed his painting primarily as a spiritual activity. The majority of Fekete's work are rendered in oil on paper and are remarkably small in size. There are a few exceptions; Pyramidal Composition is watercolour whilst Fekete's earliest surviving work, Cubist Study, is rendered in Tempera. The Monochrome sketches are, of course, pencil or graphite on paper, whilst many of his architectural pieces were drawn free-hand with nothing more than black biro.  Themes = Jungian Alchemy & Psychoanalysis  Universal Mythology  Transgression = Reception and legacy = Critical reception  Due to Fekete's fairly limited circulation outside of specialist circles, he has not garnered extensive critical attention. However, art historians and critics who have encountered his work have reflected positively on his work. Julia Carter has remarked on the artist's similarity to a number of artists associated with the German Blaue Reiter,Julia Carter, 'Preface'.

There are two possible situations that can qualify as acts of invisible support. The first possibility entails a situation where \\"recipients are completely unaware of the supportive transaction between themselves and support-givers\\". For example, a spouse may choose to spontaneously take care of housework without mentioning it to the other couple-member. Invisible support also occurs when \\"recipients are aware of an act that takes place but do not interpret the act as a supportive exchange\\". In this case, a friend or family member may subtly provide advice in an indirect manner as a means to preserve the recipient's self-esteem or to defer his or her attention from a stressful situation. Invisible support can be viewed on both ends of an exchange, in which the recipient is unaware of the support received and the provider enacts support in a skillful, subtle way.  Background  It is known that perceptions of social support availability predict better adjustment to stressful life events; it has been found that the perception of support availability is inherently comforting, and can serve as a psychological safety-net that motivates self-reliant coping efforts in the face of stress. Although the perception of support availability is associated with better adjustment, the knowledge that one has been the recipient of specific supportive acts has often been unhelpful to effectively reduce stress. The knowledge of receiving help may come at a cost with decreased feelings of self-esteem and self- efficacy, because it increases recipients' awareness towards their personal difficulties to manage stressors. People's well-intentioned support attempts may also be miscarried, and their efforts could either fail or even worsen the situation for a person under stress. Since supportive acts benefit recipients but their actual knowledge of receiving support is sometimes harmful, it has been theorized that the most effective support exchange would involve one in which the provider reports giving support but the recipient does not notice that support has occurred. From a cost-benefit point of view, invisible support would be optimal for the recipient because the benefits of provision are accrued while the costs of receipt are avoided. Using the same idea, it also implies that the least effective type of support would be one in which the provider does not report providing support but the recipient reports receiving it. The first investigation of invisible support involved a couples study in which one member was preparing for the New York State Bar Exam. Support receipt and provision were measured by having both couple members complete daily diary entries. Over the course of one month, stressed individuals who reported low frequency of received support (but whose partner ranked his or her own actions as highly supportive) rated themselves low on anxiety and depression compared to other individuals who reported high frequency of received support.  Compared to visible support  A substantial body of work has evidence to suggest that support is most effective when it is invisible or goes unnoticed by recipients. While invisible support has been shown to benefit recipients over visibly supportive acts in some cases, there have also been instances where recipients have benefitted from visible support as well. For example, greater observed support enacted by intimate partners during couples' support-relevant exchanges have been shown to build feelings of closeness and support, boost positive mood and self-esteem, and foster greater goal achievement and relationship quality across time. It has been recently suggested that acts of invisible support and visible support may be beneficial or costly depending on different circumstances. To investigate this idea, a recent study in 2013 compared the short-term and long-term effects of visible and invisible support reception during romantic couples' discussions of each partner's personal goal. It was found that either type of support was more beneficial depending on the emotional distress that recipients felt at the time. Visible emotional support (support through reassurance, encouragement, and understanding) was associated with perceptions of greater support and discussion success for recipients who felt greater distress during the discussion. In contrast, invisible emotional support was not associated with recipients' post-discussion perceptions of support or discussion success. For long-term support effects, it was found that only invisible emotional support predicted greater goal achievement across the following year. When put together, these findings suggest that visible support and invisible support have unique functions for well-being. When people are under distress, visible support appears to be a short-term remedy to reassure recipients that they are cared for and supported. These benefits are only present when recipients are actually distressed during the time that the supportive act takes place. On the other hand, while invisible support tends to go unnoticed by recipients, it seems to play an integral role in the long-term success of goal- maintenance.  Effects on support providers  The effects of invisible support on recipients have been extensively investigated, but the consequences of invisible support on providers are less known. One study in 2016 investigated the benefits and costs of invisible support on couple-members who enacted supportive behaviors by differentiating the processes of invisible emotional support (support through reassurance, encouragement, and understanding) from processes of invisible instrumental support (providing tangible aid such as sending money or childcare). No costs of support-giving were found for providers when they demonstrated acts of invisible emotional support. The effects for invisible instrumental support told a different story, where providers who reported high relationship satisfaction were unaffected, but providers who reported low relationship satisfaction were negatively affected by their acts of invisible instrumental support with an increase in negative mood. These findings suggest that emotional comfort may be a more central function to maintain close relationships than instrumental support. Therefore, providing invisible emotional support may lead to less perceptions of a costly inequity than providing invisible instrumental support on average. However, since invisible instrumental support did not incur costs for providers who reported high relationship satisfaction, it implies that high relationship satisfaction may buffer potential costs that would otherwise be felt by support-providers. The differential results between invisible instrumental and emotional support indicate that a solid distinction between instrumental and emotional social support may be useful to take into account when investigating effects of invisible support as a whole.

An expert on Asian cuisine and cooking methods, Nguyen has written numerous cookbooks on the food of her native Vietnam, as well as an account of her family's escape during the Fall of Saigon. She writes an active blog, as well as articles for newspapers and food magazines and teaches cooking classes throughout the country. Early life Andrea Quynhgiao Nguyen was born in 1969 in Vietnam and fled with her family of seven when Saigon fell in 1975. Fleeing the communist regime, her family emigrated with only enough belongings for a vacation, but brought with them a notebook filled with her mother's recipes. They settled in Southern California and attempted to buy foods they were familiar with, but the dishes were mass produced and not very tasty. Nguyen's mother suggested they replicate foods from their homeland, by making the dishes themselves. After a childhood spent in San Clemente, Nguyen attended the University of Southern California and graduated with a B.S. in banking and finance and M.A. in communication management. Career Upon completing her schooling, Nguyen first worked as a bank auditor and then a university administrator, while she and O'Brien were living in Santa Monica, before she began writing restaurant reviews. In 1997, she wrote her first book, an autobiographical tale, Trip to Freedom (1997) which was written to explain her family's migration and the events surrounding the decision to children. Nguyen wrote a letter to pitch an article on her mother's mooncakes to Saveur and they accepted it. She then developed her website and worked on a proposal for her first cookbook. She continued writing articles about the food of Vietnam in various newspapers and magazines, like the Los Angeles Times, Saveur, The Wall Street Journal, and Rodale's Organic Life. Starting fall 2017, she has had a monthly column in Cooking Light called \\"The Teacher.\\" Nguyen's first cookbook Into the Vietnamese Kitchen (2006) has been called \\"indispensable\\" for those wanting to cook Vietnamese foods, as Nguyen sees culinary history as integrally entwined with culture. Her detailed instructions were clear and precise with photographs and explanatory techniques provided in sidebar. It was a finalist in the 2007 James Beard Foundation Award, as best Asian cookbook and was nominated for best first book and best international cookbook by the International Association of Culinary Professionals that same year. In March 2012, both Into the Vietnamese Kitchen and Nguyen's second cookbook, Asian Dumplings were selected as two of seven cookbooks honored in the Asian section of Cooking Light‚Ä≤s Best 100 Cookbooks of the Past 25 Years Award. Asian Dumplings covered a wide array of dumplings from throughout Asia, dividing the recipes by dough and wrapping type. The detailed instructions included line drawings to demonstrate how to form the dough into traditional shapes, as well as sections on sauces, stocks, seasonings and ingredients and various cooking equipment needed to make the dishes. Asian Tofu (2012) was more than a guide to making tofu, as Nguyen included buying guides, as well as tips on selecting ready-made tofu. Her recipes featured both vegetarian and meat dishes, which could use either homemade or store-bought tofu and was noted as an \\"essential\\" guide. With The Banh Mi Handbook (2014), Nguyen added another layer to her history of cooking in Vietnam, showing how the marriage of French colonial staples, such as the baguette were combined with Asian p√¢t√©s, barbecue and pickles to create a \\"delightful balance of tastes and textures\\". Her 2017 book The Pho Cookbook explores variants in the dish, noting that traditionally pho was a simple, rustic soup, which mirrored the sensibility of Hanoi. As it made its way southward toward Saigon, the dish became sweeter and spicier and more cosmopolitan, with custom additions of sauces and herbs, representing the more capitalist influences of the commercialized south. In 2018, Nguyen won a James Beard Award for Best Cookbook for The Pho Cookbook. Nguyen is a recognized authority on Asian cuisines and has taught cooking classes throughout the United States.

From then on he concentrated on the trumpet and was soon proficient enough to perform in public while still in his teens.

The band achieved a further thirteen Top 20 hits between 1966 and 1973, becoming one of Ireland's most successful showbands. While most of their recordings highlighted Dunphy's singing voice, Earl Gill's trumpet took the lead on the instrumental single, \\"Sunset\\" (an arrangement of Offenbach's ‚ÄúBarcarolle‚Äù), released in 1967. \\"Sunset\\" failed to make the top twenty but Gill had greater success with his next solo recording, which he also produced. Wearing a false beard, shabby clothes and Wellington boots, he adopted the persona of \\"Tim Pat\\", a down-at-heel farmer who appeared on The Late Late Show to perform his new single, \\"The Poor Poor Farmer\\".

Commissioned by the Hull and East Riding Co-operative Society, for the exterior of the side of their new store at 32-38 Jameson Street, it was erected in 1963. Depicting three stylised trawlers, it commemorates Hull's fishing fleet. The mural is made from 4,224 panels, each square and made in turn from 225 cubes of Italian glass - over one million in all. The panels are fixed to a curved, , concrete wall. The mural was built to Boyson's design, by Richards Tiles Ltd (subsequently part of Johnsons Tiles Ltd). Included in the mural is the Latin text ' (\\"the success of industry\\"). It also includes the letters in the ships' masts. These appear fortuitously and not through deliberate design. After the Co-operative Society vacated the building, it was for a time a branch of BHS. In May 2007 the mural was locally listed by Hull City Council, who described it was a \\"superb example of modern public art\\". The council subsequently pledged to retain the mural when the site is developed. In November 2016, a proposal by Hull Civic Society to give the mural statutory protection at a national level was rejected. The society announced its intention to appeal the decision. The mural was placed on the National Heritage List for England on 21 November 2019 at Grade II.  Fish mural  An additional mural by Boyson, inside the store on the fourth floor, was rediscovered during refurbishment in 2011. Depicting a shoal of fish, it is over long and is made from ceramic tiles, marble and stone. Located outside the former Skyline Ballroom (later Romeo and Juliet's, a nightclub), it had been hidden behind a false wall. The building's then owners, Manor Property Group, announced plans to feature it in their designs for the building's decor. It was made as part of the same commission as the exterior mural.

The organization was established mainly to counter the ongoing social reform movements led by protagonists such as Raja Ram Mohun Roy and Henry Derozio. More specifically, the impetus of forming the organization came from a new law enacted by the colonial British rule which banned the practice of sati in the country; the focus of the new association was to repel the law which was seen as an intrusion by the British into the religious affairs of the indigenous people by some sections of the Hindu community. Dharma Sabha filed an appeal in the Privy Council against the ban on Sati by Lord William Bentinck as it went against the assurance given by George III of non-interference in Hindu religious affairs; however, their appeal was rejected and the ban on Sati was upheld in 1832. The Dharma Sabha campaigned against the Hindu Widow Remarriage Act, 1856 and submitted a petition against the proposal with nearly four times more signatures than the one submitted for it by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar.However Lord Dalhousie personally finalized the bill despite the opposition and it being considered a flagrant breach of Hindu customs as prevalent then, and it was passed by Lord Canning.

Transmission of the disease is believed to be autosomal recessive. Symptoms of the syndrome are intellectual disability, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma (MEDNIK).Martinelli et al. 2014Martinelli et al. 2013 The disorder was discovered by Dr. Patrick Cossette and his research team from the Universit√© de Montr√©al. MEDNIK syndrome was initially reported in a few French-Canadian families near Quebec who all shared common ancestors. MEDNIK syndrome has been shown to create a defect in copper metabolism. Before MEDNIK, the only two inherited copper metabolism disorders known were Menkes disease and Wilson's disease. Menkes and Wilson's disease are both caused by mutations in copper ATPases that are distinct for each disease. Both ATPases, ATP7A (Menkes) and ATP7B (Wilson's) are located in the trans-Golgi network and are responsible for transporting copper to cuproenzymes synthesized within the secretory compartments. Patients with MEDNIK syndrome have been shown to display combined clinical and biochemical signs of both Menkes and Wilson's diseases. The transport of copper, recycling of copper ATPases, and copper detoxification are reliant on proper intracellular copper trafficking. The defect in the AP1S1 gene causes improper function and trafficking of copper ATPases resulting in less retention in the trans-Golgi and excess copper in the plasma membrane. Cause The mutation that causes the MEDNIK syndrome occurs in the gene, AP1S1, which codes for the smallest subunit of the AP1 adaptor complex. The AP-1 complex is one of five Adaptor Protein complexes that are found in eukaryotic cells. AP complexes mediate trafficking linking clathrin or other coat proteins to receptors in coated vesicles, selectively sorting cargo between cell membrane, trans-Golgi network, and endosomal compartments. The AP-1 complex is found in the trans- Golgi network and is responsible for controlling AP-1-coated vesicles and the trafficking of the ATPase's ATP7A and ATP7B. A mutation in AP1S1 causes abnormal intracellular copper trafficking which subsequently affects copper- dependent enzymes leading to the symptoms of MEDNIK disease. Management There is currently no cure or treatments tailored directly toward MEDNIK syndrome. However, symptoms can be treated on an individual basis. Treatments can include: diuretics, steroids, pain medications, antidepressants, hydrotherapy, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics.NHS Choices 2016, Rychik and Spray 2002 References Ref Syndrome de Kamouraska: https://sante.canoe.ca/news/chealth/3733?newssource=0 , http://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2018/07/27/vivre-avec-le-syndrome-de-kamouraska (French) Sources  *  External links  Category:Genetic diseases and disorders Category:Syndromes ","title":"MEDNIK syndrome"},{"id":"52216764","text":"Karen Espelund (born 1 February 1961 in Trondheim, Norway) is a former Norwegian football player and a former football official.

It is a loose remake of Hideo Nakata's film Chaos (2000). It is available in the United States on Netflix in September 2020. Plot Iris Doriot, a beautiful 30-year-old Parisian, convinces a stranger to help fake her own kidnapping in order to leave her husband, Antoine, and start a new life. Max Lopez, a mechanic in debt, agrees to the plot after fixing her car. Iris disappears from the street after lunch with her husband, a rich banker. Iris hides at an empty flat she is watching for a friend. Max ties her up and takes a photo to send to her husband, along with a request for 500,000 euros. Though told not to phone the police, Antoine does so anyway. They tap his phone and set up surveillance at the train station where Max told Antoine to bring the money. Though the police are not visible, Max hesitates and gets on the train instead of collecting the money from Antoine, who stays on the platform as the police instructed. Max returns to the house that night to find Iris dead on the bed, with a head wound, just as the police arrive. Max quickly hides her body in a blanket. The police explain the neighbors called because they heard a woman screaming in the flat, but Max is able to convince them his wife left following an argument. That night he buries Iris's body, still wrapped in a blanket, in the woods. Detectives Nathalie and Malek are suspicious of the kidnapping, but still look into anyone who may have had a grudge against the bank. This leads them to Max, who has a police record in addition to his home being foreclosed. Max denies having anything to do with it, but later sees a news report on Iris Doriot's disappearance. He is shocked to see that the photo shown is not the same woman he knew as Iris, but a woman of a similar age with brown eyes. In a panic, he returns to the woods and digs up the body, which is the same woman shown on TV. Meanwhile, the woman Max knew as Iris arrives at the bank, where Antoine chastises her for appearing. She worries that Max will go to the police, but Antoine assures her that they have set him up so well that he will not say anything. Max openly follows Antoine to an exclusive, high-end sex club for fetishists, where the fake Iris is performing. Her name is revealed to be Claudia. A flashback reveals that after Max tied Claudia up and left the flat, she freed herself and dragged Iris's dead body, in a state of advanced rigor mortis, onto the bed. After speaking with Iris's psychiatrist, the police interview Antoine again and ask him about his troubled sex life. He admits he likes S&M; and hires prostitutes, as his wife had no interest. Antoine, nervous by the police's line of questioning, calls Max and arranges to meet him. He tells him that they set him up because he is such a failure, but that they didn't expect him to take the body out of the flat. Antoine tells him if he takes credit for Iris's death, all of his debt will be wiped out. Instead, Max kidnaps Claudia. In a flashback, it is revealed that Iris followed Antoine to his S&M; session, where she attacked Claudia, who killed her in self-defense. While Claudia is tied up, Max once again demands 500,000 euros from Antoine, who has no choice but to give him the money. Max calls Antoine and tells him that he can find Claudia at the flat, but he takes her to a hotel instead, where they have sex. When Antoine arrives at the flat, he discovers Iris's body. He takes her body to his ch√¢teau in Normandy and digs a grave, unaware there is police surveillance. The police arrive as Antoine shoots himself in the head, falling into the open grave on top of Iris. The next morning, Max and Claudia part, splitting the money equally.

By late 1943 the Luftwaffe was facing multiple problems in navigation and control of its assets in the European airspace. Allied jamming of existing VHF voice radio links and MF navigation beacons was becoming extremely effective, At the same time training of pilots was being curtailed by the lack of fuel. This resulted in fighter formations being unable to find the allied bombers and frequently getting lost. Work was then carried out with regards to solving these issues. Part of the research resulted in the radio systems such a Hermine and Bernhard. However a simpler system that could be rolled out faster and was usable by minimum hour pilots in single seat fighters was also developed. Origin It was based around the work done for the Y-Ger√§t system of bomber guidance. There were differences in frequency and a dedicated transponder was not required. Initially it used a modified FuG17E radio but this was soon replaced by an add on to the standard radio FuG16Z turning it into the FuG16ZY. Functionality The system worked by using sites known as Y-Stations. Each station had 5 radio operation systems. Each consisted of an omnidirectional transmitter an omnidirectional receiver and a direction finder. This allowed each site to control 5 fighters. The transmitter would send out a signal which was picked up by the FuG16ZY in the fighter (known as the Y Fighter), this repeated the signal back on a frequency 1.9 MHz lower than the transmitted frequency. Using the direction finder (DF) the angle was measured. Range was calculated by a timing system connected to both the transmitter and the omnidirectional receiver. Height could not be measured. However voice could be transposed onto the ranging signal allowing the ground controller to talk and listen to the pilot of the plane he was controlling, hence the pilot could report altitude when requested to do so. Controlling a single fighter was of not much use in practice so the Luftwaffe developed group control, where a Y-Fighter was part of a group of fighters intercepting an allied bomber stream, The Y-Fighter was painted a distinctive colour and the rest of the flight simple followed him. The flight leader could also listen into the ground controller channel and hear what the ground controller was saying while also being able to talk to the flight. The Y-Fighter was never the group controller. the system was susceptible to jamming on the FuG16ZY wavelength but was at least partially usable for the rest of the war. Controllable range was approx 250 km depending on aircraft height. One source mentions that relay stations could be used to extend the radio range. The relay station would consist of a single transmitter/receiver/DF finder system without the rest of the communication and guidance systems of the main Y site. The radio system used was a modified FuG16 radio. The Y-Site also contained other systems such as radio communications for talking to area control. Utility The system was usually used to control groups of day fighters intercepting American bomber streams but it could be used to guide individual night fighters.

Limited types of cannabis- derived products are permitted for medical uses. History=French Egypt During Napol√©on Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt in 1798, alcohol was not available as Egypt was an Islamic country. In place of alcohol, Bonaparte's troops resorted to trying hashish, which they found to their liking. As a result of the conspicuous consumption of hashish by the troops, the smoking of hashish and consumption of drinks containing it was banned in October 1800, although the troops mostly ignored the order. Subsequently, beverages containing hashish were banned in Egyptian cafes; cafes that sold them were shut down and \\"boarded up\\", and their proprietors were jailed. During this time, hashish imported from other countries was destroyed by burning. Upon the end of the occupation in 1801, French troops brought supplies of hashish with them back to France. Metropolitan France In the mid-1800s, following travel and studies in Asia, French psychiatrist Jacques- Joseph Moreau studied hashish extensively and produced the 1845 work Du Hachisch et de l'ali√©nation mentale (Hashish and Mental Illness). In the 1800s, hashish was embraced in some European literary circles. Most famously, the Club des Hashischins was a Parisian club dedicated to the consumption of hashish and other drugs; its members included literary luminaries such as Th√©ophile Gautier, Moreau de Tours, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Charles Baudelaire and Honor√© de Balzac.Levinthal, C. F. (2012). Drugs, behavior, and modern society. (6th ed.). Boston: Pearson College Div. Baudelaire later wrote the 1860 book Les paradis artificiels about the state of being under the influence of opium and hashish. Legality French cannabis legalisation activist Jean-Pierre Galland in 2007 In France, possession and use of cannabis fall under criminal law and the Loi du 31 d√©cembre 1970, regarding health measures against drug abuse and suppression of trafficking. Medical cannabis France is a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Convention on drugs, and accordingly banned cannabis as a medical treatment in 1953. Since then, the importation, sale, transport and production of cannabis and cannabinoids has been illegal in France. However, in 1999, the Agence Fran√ßaise de S√©curit√© Sanitaire des Produits de Sant√© (AFSSPS) authorised the issuance of ATUs (temporary use authorizations) for health products otherwise not permitted on the French market. However, in 1991 a court rejected the demands of the NGO Mouvement pour la L√©galization Contr√¥l√©e concerning the importation of cannabis to supply 10 patients suffering terminal illness, arguing that such was incompatible with France's adherence to the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and MLC's inability to scientifically control and administer medical cannabis. As of 8 June 2013, cannabis derivatives can be used in France for the manufacture of medicinal products. The products can only be obtained with a prescription and will only be prescribed when all other medications have failed to effectively relieve suffering. The amended legislation decriminalises \\"the production, transport, export, possession, offering, acquisition or use of speciality pharmaceutials that contains one of these (cannabis-derivative) substances\\", while all cannabis products must be approved by the National Medical Safety Agency (Agence nationale de s√©curit√© du m√©dicament ‚Äì ANSM). A Pharmacists' Union spokesperson explained to the media that the change will make it more straightforward to conduct research into cannabinoids. In September 2018, the french National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM) started an experimentation on therapeutic cannabis. They created a scientific committee to evaluate a new public policy and distribution network for specific diseases. This experiment will gather 3000 patients and provide dried flowers and oils for people going under epilepsy, neuropathic pain or to treat side effects of chemotherapy. The first test should start in September 2020 and will go on for two years. Because of the coronavirus crisis, the ANSM informed that the experimentation will be delayed to January 2021. Reform On 25 May 2017, the Minister of the Interior indicated his intention to implement reforms, promised by President Emmanuel Macron during his campaign, to substitute citations rather than arrest and trial for use and possession of cannabis.¬´ L‚Äôusage de cannabis bient√¥t puni par une simple contravention ¬ª, lemonde.fr, 26 mai 2017. On 23 November 2018 the penalty for possession of cannabis (and other illegal drugs) was reduced to a 200 euro fine, following a 28‚Äì14 vote by the National Assembly. On 1 September 2020, the French Government introduced a 200‚Ç¨ fine for cannabis consumption instead of being taken into custody. This measure will also be applied for cocaine detention.  Consumption  Trends in cannabis usage for ages 15‚Äì44 between 1990 and 2000 In 2012, 13.4 million French people between age 15 and 64 had tried cannabis, and 1.2 million people in Metropolitan France considered themselves regular users.Observatoire fran√ßais des drogues et toxicomanies, cit√© par Fr√©d√©ric Joignot, France, terre de joints, cahier Culture et Id√©es, Le Monde, 27 juin 2014. France ranks fourth in the European Union in terms of monthly consumption (following the Czech Republic, Spain, and Italy) and second only to Denmark in terms of persons who have ever used cannabis.OEDT (2007), p. 41 In 2015, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction published a new report on drugs, saying that the French people were still the biggest cannabis consumers, especially in the 15‚Äì34 segment. The report is also affirming that the product quality is increasing, due to competition and technical innovation.https://www.20minutes.fr/societe/1624079-20150604-rapport-oedt- france-premiere-consommatrice-cannabis-europe  Opinion  A poll conducted by CSA in November 2013 indicated that, 55% of French people were opposed to the decriminalization and of cannabis, while 44% said that the prohibition on cannabis is an abridgment of individual liberty.Sondage CSA, cit√© par Fr√©d√©ric Joignot, France, terre de joints, cahier Culture et Id√©es, Le Monde, 27 juin 2014.

Background  Following the referendum, the official remain group in the 2016 EU referendum, Britain Stronger in Europe, changed its name on 25 August 2016 to Open Britain. Open Britain defines itself as campaigning for the United Kingdom to be open and inclusive, open for business, open to trade and investment, open to talent and hard work, open to Europe and to the world. It is originally campaigned for Britain to remain in the Single Market as part of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. In October 2016, Open Britain launched a 'Write to Remain' letter-writing campaign directed at Theresa May asking her to guarantee the right of EU nationals to stay in the UK. The individuals involved in the campaign group include former Ministers Pat McFadden (Labour) and Norman Lamb (Liberal Democrat). Conservatives Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, and Dominic Grieve cut their ties with Open Britain in April 2017 after it began to campaign against the re-election of anti-EU members of parliament, mostly Conservatives. Open Britain continues to campaign in collaboration with other major pro-European campaign groups such as Britain for Europe and European Movement UK. It launched and promotes People's Vote in April 2018 to campaign for a second referendum. In October 2019, shortly before the 2019 UK General Election, CEO James McGrory was forced out of People's Vote and Open Britain. Almost all the directors resigned. As the lead organisation behind the People's Vote campaign, this led to a major staff walk out in protest of Roland Rudd, the Chairperson's, actions.

History  The club started in 1969 and played against a number of other clubs from Athens, including Keratsini, Zografou (today known as Ilisiakos F.C.), Taxiarchis Alsoupolis, Aino Petroupolis and Kerameikos. Then, in 1971, the club participated in friendly games, in which they went off against Ios A.O., resulting in a 1-0 victory, Pannaxiakos 2-1 and Rin, the team of a French navy ship. With an attendance of more than 10,000 fans, Rin lead the match until two goals from Biralis (25') and Gavalas (88') secured a win for the Santorinians. In 1972, the club applied for a membership in the Piraeus Football League, yet only two other teams then participated: AO Syrou and Astir Syrou. AO Mykonos had withdrawn from the league the year before. They were rejected, along with all other teams based in the Cyclades, as several attempts had already been made before to expand the league there. In 1980, the Football League of Cyclades was founded. Since then, they have won the 1st division three times (1984‚Äì85, 1987‚Äì88, 2015‚Äì16) and the Cyclades Cup twice, in 1989 and 2016.

In 2017, the PBR honored the bull with the Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor, which is the equivalent of a hall of fame. This is the highest honor the PBR can award to a bull. He is only the seventh bull to receive this honor. His owners retired Mossy Oak Mudslinger after the 2006 season ended, while he was still in his peak. Mossy Oak Mudslinger died in 2012 when he was almost 15 years old. His owners buried him on their ranch.  Background  Mossy Oak Mudslinger was born in 1997 and raised on the Rockin P Ranch in Ardmore, Oklahoma, owned by D&H; Cattle Company. D&H; Cattle Company is owned and operated by Dillon Page and his son, H.D. Page. They are one of the largest stock contractors in the bucking bull business. They run their bulls in both the PBR and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) circuits. They can claim a few world champions. Mudslinger was a Brangus cross. He was a dark brown brindle. He weighed . He had large horns that pointed upwards diagonally. Mudslinger can claim all Page cows for his breeding. His paternal grandsire was Super Dave. His maternal grandsire was Broke Back V. At that time, it was not common to name the maternal side. His sire was Page 01, and his dam was Page 590-228. His maternal granddam and paternal granddam are referred to as \\"Page Breeding.\\"  Career  Mossy Oak Mudslinger bucked almost exclusively in the PBR circuit, with only a couple rides falling outside. Mudslinger bucked from 2001 until 2006. Every year except 2006 he bucked exclusively on the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS), the elite series of the PBR. His final year, 2006, he did buck about three times outside the BFTS. Specifically, he bucked two times on the PRCA and once on a lower level tour of the PBR. Mudslinger bucked a total of 94 times on the PBR tour, including 93 times in the BFTS championship round. He has an average bull score of 45.83 points. Bull riders only completed rides on him 27 times. Of those 27 times, only 15 riders were round-winners. Those 15 riders averaged a score of 91.87 points on Mudslinger. Cory McFadden managed the highest score on Mudslinger when he rode him in 2001 at the PBR World Finals at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, for a high score of 95.5 points. In 2006, the year he retired, riders who got a qualified ride on him scored an average of 91.6 points. Based on this average, he was still bucking at almost as high a level at the end of his bucking career. PBR and PRCA bull rider, Cody Whitney said, \\"I got on Mudslinger four times, and I rode him twice. Each time felt different than the time before.\\" He also stated that Mudslinger is, \\"Hands down one of the rankest bulls I ever got on, you had to have your game on point to ride that bull.\\" Two-time World Champion Justin McBride attempted Mudslinger around six or seven times. McBride claims that he attempted Mudslinger more times than he has been on any other bull in his career. He won a great deal of money on Mudslinger both riding and bucking off the bull. In 2003, Mudslinger was the last bull McBride got on to win the PBR World Finals and he bucked off him. McBride said, \\"If you didn't mess him up, you were going to win first.\\" In 2001, PBR Livestock Director Cody Lambert, recalls that Mudslinger looked fantastic the first time he saw him ridden. It was an event in Columbus, Georgia, on the BFTS. Mudslinger was 3 years old at the time. It was his third trip that year. Bull rider Adam Carrillo rode him for a very high score of 94.5 points. The ride made the PBR 90-Point Club. In 2001, his name was Washita Mudslinger. That year he finished as runner-up to the world champion. In 2002, his owners changed his name to Mossy Oak Mudslinger. He finished as runner-up to Little Yellow Jacket. Dillon Page strongly felt Mudslinger should have won the title that year. He was only ridden once. He bucked off two-time World Champion Chris Shivers \\"after a 7.6‚Äìsecond ride in Phoenix that everyone said would probably have been the all‚Äìtime points record\\". However, the riders voted for Little Yellow Jacket. In 2004, bull rider Mike Lee rode Mudslinger for 93.75 points. That ride tied with another ride for the highest score of the year. Lee won the World Champion bull rider title that year. Mudslinger's final showings occurred at the 2006 PBR World Finals. It was Greg Potter who scored the last qualified ride of his career on Mudslinger. He drew him for the fourth time in his career in round 2. Potter finally rode him for 89.75 points. Then, Mudslinger bucked off the 2008 World Champion Guilherme Marchi in 5.1 seconds for his last trip. He did this in round 6 and was marked a high score of 46.5 points. Mudslinger launching Marchi off him while bucking helped Adriano Moraes win his third World Champion bull rider title. Mudslinger spent six years on tour and had qualified for the finals each of those years. He was runner-up for the world champion bull title, in 2004 and 2005, as well as being the high money bull in 2005. Then, in 2006, he won the World Champion Bull title for himself. Mudslinger \\"is often credited as a major reason why D&H; Cattle Co. was named Stock Contractor of the Year\\" from 2001 to 2005. Lambert explained that the bulls who are picked for the championship round at the finals are based on how they performed on the rounds leading up to the championship round. Lambert held Mudslinger, Dr. Proctor, and Pandora's Box out of the 2006 championship round for the same reason, their performance was not up to par in the rounds leading up. He further explained that \\"I thought it'd be kind of cool for (Mudslinger) to go out with some of his sons who had moved up from the Classic event\\". Nonetheless, Mudslinger had a great last out. Page said \\"He still has outstanding days, he just can't put them together all the time\\". The Pages and partner Tom Teague collected a trailer and $200,000 cash prize for the honor. Dillon related, \\"I actually wanted to retire him last year, but with Little Yellow Jacket and Blueberry Wine retiring in 2005, I was talked out of it. I'm glad we waited until this year.\\"  Legacy and retirement  After his last ride on Mudslinger, Potter reflected on him. He felt \\"This is one of the greatest bulls of all time. Everybody likes him and everybody wants to draw him. From the time he first runs into the chutes, he gives you a fair shot every time. You make a mistake, you're on the ground...You can't say that about Dr. Proctor or Pandora's Box\\". It was after Mudslinger won the 2006 world champion bull title that his owners evaluated his next career move. H.D. reflected Mudslinger qualified for the PBR World Finals five times. He was most responsible for turning their business profitable. He was well-known. And he already had calves selling for $30,000. Dillon felt Mudslinger earned his retirement, so the Pages provided him an area for breeding with cows. Dillon referred to him as \\"a part of our family\\". Mudslinger lived on the ranch until he was almost 15 years old in 2012. After he died, they buried him on the ranch. Mudslinger continues to live through his sons, such as Velvet Slinger, Double Oak, Hot Stuff, Copperhead Slinger, and LIttle Snake. More recently, the Pages are benefiting through his grandsons. The late bull Long John won the title in 2015, and Bruiser won the title in 2016-18. Bruiser tied Little Yellow Jacket and Bushwacker for winning 3 world titles in 2018, also tying Little Yellow Jacket for winning three in a row. Both champions have Mudslinger's daughters for their dams. H.D. says Mudslinger is \\"irreplaceable\\". Lambert pointed out that most of Mudslinger's trips were in the competition rounds, which makes them even more impressive. He was always competing against the best bull riders of the weekend and of the era. Lambert believes Mudslinger was on a par with other bulls that won one championship or just came close to winning one. Bulls such Red Wolf, Chicken on a Chain, and Blueberry Wine. He helped make other multi-titled bulls great too, like Dillinger and Little Yellow Jacket, by challenging them. He finished second to both bulls in world championship bull races. After four years of being close in the race, he was the champion in his last race. In 2017, the PBR decided to honor this bull with the Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor. He is ranked fifth in the Probullstat Hall of Fame listing. And he is listed seventh in the all time historical ranking on Probullstats.com due to his adjusted average score marking of 45.86.

She was the wife of the painter and caricaturist Jean-Louis Forain. Family and personal life She was born in the Marais district of Paris on 25 January 1865. Her father, Michel Bosc, taught French, Latin and Greek at the Coll√®ge Rollin. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 her family moved to Auvers-sur-Oise, where they remained for several years. There the young Jeanne Bosc met Camille Pissarro, who encouraged her parents to allow her to study art. On the family's return to Paris, the 18-year old Jeanne Bosc studied with various teachers including Louise Abb√©ma. She married Jean-Louis Forain in 1891. She and her husband travelled extensively in Europe and elsewhere, visiting the United States in 1893 and Constantinople, the Holy Land and Egypt in 1913. Their only child, a son named Jean-Loup, was born in 1895. Work Jeanne Forain specialized in portraits, particularly favouring children as subjects. Her style was influenced by Vel√°zquez, Quentin de la Tour and Hogarth. She exhibited a pastel portrait entitled T√™te de jeune-fille at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© des artistes fran√ßais in 1889, and participated in the Salon du Champs de Mars beginning in 1890. Her subjects were generally members of her family and the literary and artistic circles to which she and her husband belonged. In 1904 Henri de R√©gnier wrote to Andr√© Gide that Jeanne Forain was painting a portrait of Pierre Lou√øs. The critic Armand Dayot wrote in 1921 that she \\"excelled at expressing... the first movements of thought, the first shivers of the soul\\". In 1904 Jeanne Forain encountered a troupe of puppeteers whose wagon had fallen into a ditch on the road near Deauville. She took them to her house on the rue Spontini in Paris, where she organized a benefit performance for them. This experience led her to create her own marionette theatre, which she called the Th√©√¢tre des Nabots. She sculpted most of the puppets' heads and bodies, while her society friends sewed costumes for the approximately 80 figures, representing dancers, princesses, jugglers and other characters. The head of one marionette, representing a young dancer, has been attributed to Edgar Degas, who was a close friend of Jeanne Forain and her husband. The proceeds from the puppet shows went to purchase clothing for poor Parisian children. Many of the puppets were later acquired by the French puppetteer and were sold at auction in 2014. Jeanne Forain died in 1954 in Le Chesnay, France. The Mus√©e Carnavalet, the Centre national des arts plastiques, and the Mus√©e du Petit Palais own works by her. The first comprehensive solo exhibition of works by Jeanne Forain was held in the summer of 2016 at the in Pont-Audemer, France.

Biography  Goldberg was born in Athens, Greece. She received a Diplom in economics from the University of Freiburg in 1986 and a PhD from Stanford University in 1992. Goldberg is on public service leave from Yale University, where she is the Elihu professor of economics. She previously held faculty positions at Columbia University (1999‚Äì2001), Princeton University (1992‚Äì99 and 2007‚Äì10), and Yale (2001‚Äì07 and 2010‚Äìpresent). In 2011, she became the first woman appointed as editor-in-chief of the American Economic Review, one of the most prestigious journals in economics. She was the editor-in-chief from 2011 to 2016 and co-editor from 2010‚Äì2016 and in 2017. Goldberg was appointed as the chief economist of the World Bank on April 27, 2018, and joined in November 2018. In February 2020, she announced that she would resign effective March 1, 2020, to return to her position at Yale. She was succeeded by Aart Kraay, director of research in the Development Research Group, as interim chief economist until a permanent successor could be found. She did not state her reasons for resigning, but The Economist speculated that displeasure at senior World Bank officials, who are alleged to have suppressed research finding that some World Bank foreign aid is captured by local elites, may have played a role. She is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, a fellow of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, fellow of the Econometric Society and its president for 2021, a faculty research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a member of the board of BREAD (Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development), and a research affiliate of the International Growth Centre of the London School of Economics. She is a recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship and the Bodossaki Prize in social sciences.  Research  Goldberg's dozens of published works focus on applied microeconomics, international trade, and industrial organization. More recently, she has studied the impact of trade liberalization on growth and the income distribution, the effects of intellectual property rights enforcement in developing countries, and the determinants of incomplete exchange-rate pass- through. In joint work with Nina Pavcnik, Amit Khandelwal, Petia Topalova, and Jan De Loecker, Goldberg has studied the effects of the 1990s trade liberalization in India on domestic production and the variety of products available in the domestic Indian marketGoldberg et al., 2010a, 2010b and on the costs faced by Indian producers.Goldberg et al., 2016 In a paper published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2020, jointly written with economists Pablo K. Fajgelbaum, Patrick J. Kennedy, and Amit K. Khandelwal, Goldberg analyzed the effects of the 2018 Trump tariffs and China‚ÄìUnited States trade war on the US economy and estimated losses of $68.8 billion to consumers and producers due to higher prices. The total effect, which also accounts for the benefits of higher prices to US producers and government revenue from tariffs, was estimated to be $7.8 billion. The authors further analyzed the distribution of losses across sectors and counties, finding that workers in tradeable sectors in heavily Republican counties were especially worse off. Her research on measuring human capital, joint with Simeon Djankov, Noam Angrist and Harry Patrinos, underlies the World Bank's Human Capital Index.

She lived, traveled, and collected art in East Asia from 1904 to 1938. In 1922 she became the curator for life and first director of the University of Oregon Museum of Art (today, the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art) at the University of Oregon, helping to design the historic building with famed architect Ellis F. Lawrence. She had the museum built to house the collection of more than 3,700 works of art, the Murray Warner Collection of Oriental Art, named after her late husband, Murray Warner.. She donated the collection to the University in 1933. She traveled throughout China, Japan, Korea, and Russia purchasing works of art and artifacts, taking photographs, and writing extensive field notes. She visited thousands of cultural sites and studied Shintoism, Buddhism, and Chinese and Japanese etiquette, and the human experience, and became an innovator in the promotion of Asian art and culture appreciation, Asian studies, and multiculturalism. She is considered a female pioneer of museum studies. Today, Warner's legacy includes the material collection at the JSMA, the Murray Warner Collection of Asian Art, which includes 3,700 objects, and the Gertrude Bass Warner Collection: hundreds of papers, letters, journals, manuscripts (including the unpublished \\"When West Meets East\\"), and thousands of photographs, rare n≈çsatsu or senjafuda (votives slips), and hand-tinted lantern slides comprising the Gertrude Bass Warner Collection, managed by University of Oregon Special Collections & University Archives (SCUA) in cooperation with Oregon Digital and the JSMA.  Early life  Gertrude Bass Warner was born May 14, 1863, in Chicago. She was the daughter of Clara Foster and Perkins Bass (U.S. District Attorney under Abraham Lincoln). Foster had inherited wealth from his grandfather John Foster.and purchased real estate early in the development of Chicago; Warner would eventually benefit from the family's wealth. The Fosters lived in Peterborough, NH. Warner's mother advocated for women's education and even sponsored the construction of the first women's dormitory on the University of Chicago campus (1892). Warner attended school in Philadelphia, a boarding school in Paris where her family had an apartment, and, then Vassar College in New York, where she studied art and photography. She finished her studies at the University of Chicago, where she met her first husband, George F. Fiske. They married in 1888, and moved to Chicago to start a family. She had two boys, Samuel Perkins Fiske (b. 1889) and George Foster Fiske Jr. (b. 1890), and daughter, Clara (b. 1893), who died before her first year. Two years later, they divorced, each taking custody of one of the boys, Sam staying with Gertrude. . Following the 1895 divorce, she and Sam went to live on the wealthy family estate in Peterborough, NH. A brother, John Foster Bass, was a noted journalist, war correspondent, and author, first, for the New York Journal and later throughout Eurasia for the Chicago Daily News, the Chicago Record, and Harper's Weekly. During his time working for Harpers, Warner journeyed to Asia for the first time in 1904, living with John in the foreign enclave quarter of Shanghai while he covered the Boxer Rebellion in China.  Marriage and early career  Gertrude Bass Warner met Major Murray Warner (1869‚Äì1920) through her brother John. Murray, an engineer and quartermaster major in the U.S. military, had studied engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the 1890, and served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898) as a U.S. Army lieutenant He moved to China in 1900 to establish the engineering department of the American Trading Company and was positioned as an American Company of Volunteers for Shanghai to protect U.S. citizens living abroad during the Boxer Rebellion. Gertrude and Murray married on October 1, 1905, and resided in Shanghai for the next four years. Her son, Sam, would eventually legally adopt Warner's last name and spend much time traveling with his parents. They bought a houseboat, the Illinois, and Warner describes in her diary traveling along Chinese waterways. At this time (1904‚Äì1909) Warner began taking photographs for future use as lantern slides. Numerous images of crowded Chinese streets and sacred sites fill her later slide collection. The Warners continued to live in Shanghai intermittently, spending more and more time in the U.S. at their new home, the Fairmont San Francisco, CA, but also traveling to parts of Japan. By 1916, Warner had begun to travel in Japan, where she developed a love of Shintoism. The lantern-slide collection also includes hundreds of Japanese sacred sites, cityscapes, and daily life activities, and the Warners captured numerous photographs of Meiji and Sh≈çwa period. During her travels throughout Japan, Warner began documenting the manny shrines she visited. She maintained a diary from 1913 to the 1920, with field notes giving valuable descriptions of Shinto shrines (jinja), particular rituals, and site histories. Murray died of a heart attack in San Francisco; on October 4, 1920 at the age of 51. Shortly after, Warner moved to Eugene, Oregon, to live near her son, Sam Bass Warner, who had accepted a teaching position in Criminal Law at the University of Oregon.  The Murray Warner Collection  Warner established what would become the East Asian Studies department at the University of Oregon. She took five collecting trips to Asiaf rom the 1920s to 1940s, at times accompanied by her friend UO art historian and collector Maude Kerns or others, . She visited and collected art in China, Japan, Korea, Cambodia, and Russia. She met with other collectors, such as Frederick Starr, and regional specialists, including Asian professors of art and religious history. She purchased turn-of-the- century lantern slides, including Starr's photographs from trips to Korea. Warner befriended artist Elizabeth Keith in the late 1930s, and acquired and display numerous of her works, along with other artists (Helen Hyde, Maude Kerns, Charles W. Bartlett).  University of Oregon Museum of Art  Following Murray's death, she moved to Eugene, Oregon, to live near her son Sam, and began finding a permanent home for her collection. In 1922,Warner donated the first of many objects to the University of Oregon. At the time the university lacked a museum, and the collection was housed in the Woman's Memorial Hall (now Gerlinger Hall). With funding and support from Irene Hazard Gerlinger, the university's first woman regent, a permanent professional museum was built to house the collection. Work began in 1925, headed by architect and professor Ellis F. Lawrence. Called \\"one of Lawrence's finest buildings [for its] exotic blend of Modernistic, oriental and European styles\\", the University of Oregon Museum of Art realized Warner's transnational learning philosophy. Warner and Lawrence envisioned it as a physical representation of \\"the meeting of eastern and western civilizations on the Pacific Coast.\\" The building was renamed the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art in 2005https://jsma.uoregon.edu/history.  Later years  In the 1930s, she composed an unpublished manuscript \\"When West Meets East,\\" y. Before World War II, she stopped visiting and collecting art in Asia, and in 1944, moved to live near Sam, once again, in Peterborough, NH. Warner died at the age of 88 from a heart attack on July 29, 1951 at the family home in Hillsborough, NH. Her death certificate lists her \\"usual occupation\\" as \\"housewife.\\" She was buried in the Pine Hill Cemetery with her tombstone noting simply \\"Wife of Murray Warner.\\"  Legacy  Warner was awarded an honorary degree of master of arts in public service from the University of Oregon in 1929, \\"in recognition of her scholarly contribution to a better understanding of the art and civilization of Oriental peoples through her discriminating selection and organization of material contained in the Murray Warner Collection, and her tireless efforts in the promotion of international goodwill.\\" Warner supported internationalism and transcultural study, sponsoring some of Oregon's first international organizations and societies for the propagation of art history and museum research. She created a scholarship and funding source for research on Asian art and history, and founded the Murray Warner Essay writing contest, sponsoring UO students to study abroad and Japanese students to come study at the UO. She also funded the UO's first International Club and encouraged faculty to use the material wealth of the museum for educational purposes. She was a delegate to 1929 Institute of Pacific Relations in Japan and sponsored the development of museums in Shanghai, at missionary schools such as St. Mary's Hall and the International Institute. In 1958, in a dedication ceremony for the Gertrude Bass Memorial Reference Library for the UO Museum of Art, her friend Maude Kerns explained how she hoped the University of Oregon would continue Warner's mission \\"to build a bridge of love and understanding between East and West, so desperately needed in solving today's problems.\\"Gosselink Orr, Ellie (2015). \\"Remarkable Gertrude!\\" UO Libraries Special Collections & University Archive, Personal Copy The JSMA honors her with the Gertrude Bass Warner Award, recently awarded to former UO student and, later, professor of literature Yoko Matsuoka McClain (1924-2011).

He was the father of the founder of the EasyJet airline, Stelios Haji-Ioannou. Family Born into a poor Greek Cypriot farming family at the village of Pedoulas on September 15, 1927, Haji-Ioannou was the eldest of 12 children. Early career Haji-Ioannou left the village school when he was 17 and he worked as a salesman until 1950. His uncle, a trader, hired him as an accountant before appointing him as manager of his office in Saudi Arabia. When his uncle died, Haji-Ioannou started his own import-export business in Saudi Arabia. At the time it was hard to be allowed to trade within the kingdom without a local partner and he became one of the few foreign businessmen to achieve that. Later, during the construction boom of the late 1950s, he became the only importer of Heracles and Titan cement. In 1959, Haji-Ioannou moved to London and he entered the shipping industry by buying a 10,500-ton dry cargo ship which he named Nedi, after his wife. While living in London, until 1965, he built a fleet of more than 20 cargo vessels and became an important client of British shipbrokers, especially Clarkson plc. Later he moved to Athens and he realised that the future of shipping was in international oil trade. He bought his first tanker in 1969 and became a big force in the market, within 10 years.

Career  Born in Tel Aviv, Halperin grew up in Israel and first pursued a career as a tennis player. She studied music at the Tel Aviv University and continued her studies at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis with a focus on historically informed performance. She obtained her PhD at the Juilliard School in New York City on Johann Sebastian Bach. She specialises in Baroque music, but also pursues projects of contemporary music. She recorded with the jazz pianist Michael Wollny the album Wunderkammer which was awarded the ECHO Jazz in the category piano album in 2010. She recorded a sequel, Wunderkammer XXL, with Wollny and the hr-Bigband which was awarded the Echo Jazz in the category big band. She played harpsichord and celesta with Wollny at the Jazzfest Bonn 2016. In 2011, she played works by Bach on the harpsichord at the Baroque Christophoruskirche in Wiesbaden-Schierstein, as part of the Rheingau Musik Festival. In 2012, Halperin recorded Lieder by Haydn, Mozart, Schubert and Brahms with her husband, the countertenor Andreas Scholl, titled Wanderer. The reviewer of a similar program at Wigmore Hall noted in The Guardian that she \\"proved to be a wonderfully subtle accompanist and a performer of real distinction\\", offering piano works by Mozart and Brahms in addition to the songs. In 2016 she published an album with music by Erik Satie on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of his birth, played on different keyboard instruments including, besides piano and harpsichord, hammond organ and Wurlitzer piano.

Socially, it served a role of linking and disseminating ideas of popular content that claimed the most urgent rights of the masses. Such examples are, among others, revealed to us in the Guaman Poma, a graphic chronicle of the Inca Peru of the conquest, the Calaveras y corridos of Jos√© Guadalupe Posada, a marked influence on the peasant revolution of Mexico, and the series of woodcut novels of Frans Masereel, which express with sharp features and cutting criteria the strange aspects of daily life.\\"Declaraci√≥n del artista, \\"Contraluz\\" V√≠ctor Rebuffo, \\"Contraluz\\", Talleres Graficos Germano, Buenos Aires, 1979 In 1943 he was appointed Artistic Director of the Peuser publishing house, where he made illustrations for several books, among them Los Gauchos Jud√≠os (The Jew Gauchos) by Alberto Gerchunoff, Reinaldo Solar by R√≥mulo Gallegos and Los Santos Evangelios (The Holy Gospels).

Context The evolution of Blaenau's passenger stations was complex, with five different railway companies providing services to the area. History Stesion Fain opened on 1 April 1881 between and the line's northern terminus at . It was aimed primarily at exchange traffic with the LNWR's Conwy Valley Line station which opened a few yards away on the opposite side of North Western Road on the same day. Target customers could be travelling from (say) Porthmadog to or from to . A few could be travelling from (say) via to , using the FR for the last leg. Naming The station's nameboards declared the station to be Blaenau Festiniog Junction, with the anglicised single \\"F\\", but *the station was not at or near a passenger junction *locally it was known as \\"Stesion Fain\\" (Narrow Station), often misspelled as \\"Stesion Fein\\" *in FR material and Bradshaw's FR timetable it appeared as \\"Blaenau Festiniog (L&NW;)\\" (i.e. connection for the LNWR) *Bradshaw's LNWR timetable mentions it only by inference by citing a page number. *One authoritative source refers to the station as \\"Blaenau Ffestiniog exchange\\" (lower case \\"e\\") whilst another uses \\"Blaenau Ffestiniog Exchange (LNWR)\\" Interchange traffic The FR sought to tap custom not only from Blaenau Ffestiniog itself, but also its wider connections. It co-operated with the LNWR whose permanent northern terminus was an underarm stone's throw away on the opposite side of North Western Road. Timetabling was sympathetic; in 1910, for example, three of the FR's four non-workmen's trains from arrived between 27 and 42 minutes before an LNWR train headed north, giving a traveller from (say) a good chance of getting to even if his first train was 15 minutes late. Bradshaw may have been mealy-mouthed about the proximity of the FR station, but the LNW station boasted a very large station nameboard proclaiming \\"BLAENAU FESTINIOG CHANGE HERE FOR NARROW GAUGE LINE TO MINFFORD AND PORTMADOC\\". The FR's 1936 timetable for \\"Tourist\\" trains stated they \\"formed suitable connections with the L.M. and S. and G.W. Coys. in both directions at Blaenau Festiniog.\\" Station buildings The station had one very low platform, similar to that at , a metal waiting shelter with a slate roof and small buildings at both ends, with that at the Tan-y-Grisiau end containing a refreshment room, opposite and a few yards west of which stood a slate water tower topped with a metal tank. The wilderness years The station stood derelict for some years after closure in 1939, being progressively demolished by the elements, vandals and eventually officialdom. The water tower lived a charmed life, outliving the station buildings. The site seemed doomed when road alterations buried a stretch of the track in 1963. In 1956 the waiting shelter was dismantled and re-erected for use by spectators at Manod Football Club, though it was replaced in turn in the 2000s by a more modern structure. For a period in the 1970s the FR locomotive \\"Princess\\" was mounted on a plinth at the station site as a symbol of remembrance and intention to return. Modern times The station site was a serious contender for the location of the Ffestiniog Railway's return to Blaenau, the location remained as first built, back-to- back with the ex-LNWR which was the town's sole surviving station from 1960. In the event, in 1982 both British Railways (BR) and the FR opened wholly new stations on the site of , meaning that the line through Blaenau Festiniog Junction was reinstated, but the station was not. The site is commemorated with a raised flowerbed.

But in April he took a step back, finishing 17th of 18 horses in the Satsuki Sho, also known as the \\"Japanese 2000 Guineas.\\" Suzuka Mambo was not yet eligible for the Tokyo Yushin (Japanese Derby) due to insufficient winning prize money, so his connections chose the G II Kyoto Shimbun HA for his next run, where he finished second and thus was able to get into the derby. In Tokyo for the May 30 race, he was not popular, ranking 15th, but finished a respectable fifth out of 18 horses. After a break of three months, Suzuka Mambo's next race was the G III Asahi Challenge Cup at Hanshin Racecourse on September 11, 2004, where he was the favorite and won his only race of the year.

Biography  He began his studies in 1890 at the local School of Fine Arts; winning several awards for his sketches and ink wash paintings, although his interests soon turned to decorative work. Later, he went to Paris and spent some time studying with Albert Maignan at the √âcole des Beaux-arts.Biographical notes @ Univers d'Arts. Centennial Poster He participated in the Salon from 1901 to 1903. At the Salon of 1907, he was awarded third place. That same year, he and Paul Jouve became the first winners of the Prix Abd-el-Tif. One of the benefits of the prize was a year's stay at the Villa Abd-el-Tif in Algiers. He was already thirty-years old and had a promising career in France, but immediately became enamored of North Africa. He exhibited fifty of his paintings at an Orientalist exhibition in Paris in 1909 and, pleased with their reception, decided to remain in Algeria. Shortly after, he became Director of the ; a position he held until his death. In 1925, he was placed in charge of decorating the Algerian Pavilion at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts. After the exhibition, his works were moved to the \\"Palais d‚Äô√ât√©\\"; official home and headquarters for the French admirals in Algiers (A building that would later be the scene for the assassination of Fran√ßois Darlan). Five years later, he designed the poster commemorating one-hundred years of French rule in Algeria. Thirty-thousand copies were made and distributed worldwide. This was followed by several more poster designs, for shipping companies in the tourist trade. In 1932, for his last major work, he created a large canvas depicting the Ouled Na√Øls that was shown at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais. Since 1990, it has been on display at the Mus√©e des Ann√©es Trente. Overall, he concentrated on scenes of daily life as opposed to the more \\"exotic\\" aspects of Arab culture.

It is one of a very few Thompson novels to feature a traditional love story as a major part of the plot where the lovers have a happy ending together rather than one murdering or betraying the other as is the norm in most of Thompson's novels. As with most of Thompson's novels it takes place in the Southwest (Texas) where Thompson grew up and it leverages Thompson's diverse life experiences in creating the characters and situations in a community dominated by the oil industry. Plot The Transgressors opens with deputy sheriff Tom Lord riding on a Texas road with the town prostitute Joyce Lakewood. They are lovers and Lord treats her more respectfully than any man Joyce has beem with but he refuses to marry her. This leads to them alternately trading insults and flirting. As they argue it is made clear that although he talks like a local with little education, Lord is highly educated. He almost completed medical school when he was forced to drop out to care for his sick father. His father lingered on for years requiring Lord's full-time care and as a temporary way to bring in money Lord took a job as a deputy sheriff. The job turned out to be permanent as by the time his father passed away Lord felt he was too old to return to school and he uses his clownish yokel way of talking to blend in with the rest of the men in the sheriff's office. Joyce and Lord have a minor accident. The look on Lord's face after the accident reminds Joyce of another time he had such an intense look and she remembers a feud he had with Aaron McBride, a supervisor for the Highlands Oil and Gas company. There was oil on land that Lord owned and he signed a contract with McBride to have Highlands drill the oil. However, Highlands swindled him by a loophole in the contract. As a result, Lord waited for an opportunity to take revenge on McBride. When McBride wore a gun on his hip into town Lord confronted him for wearing a gun without a permit. McBride pushed Lord into a storefront. This was the opening Lord was looking for and he quickly pummeled McBride. From that point on McBride was a different man. He never came into Lord's town again but he swore that if he saw Lord outside of Lord's legal jurisdiction he would kill him. Joyce recalls this story as Lord pulls their car off the road. They are in the middle of the dessert but Lord spots a wildcat well near by. As they walk towards the well Joyce and Lord see a sign indicating it is a Highlands well supervised by McBride. Joyce tries to dissuade Lord from approaching it but he uses his mock ignorant humor to deflect her pleas. As they approach the well they are greeted by two Highlands workers named Curly and Red who know Lord. They help him repair his car and are almost finished when McBride comes to supervise the site. On seeing Lord McBride is overcome with rage. McBride pulls his gun. Lord never carries a gun so he rushes toward McBride hoping to disarm him before he can fire. The two struggle and McBride is shot and killed. Curly, Red, and Joyce all tell Lord that they will support him and corroborate that Lord acted in self defense. Lord thinks that their testimony will not be believed since they are all known to be his friends. Instead he asks them to simply say nothing unless they are questioned and to let McBride's body be discovered by some other Highlands employee. Lord drops Joyce off at her home and then goes directly to the court house where he confesses to his boss sheriff Bradley that he has killed McBride. For quite some time Bradley has had a growing hostility to Lord because it is an open secret that Lord really runs the sheriff's office and the Bradley is just a figurehead. Bradley takes Lord's confession as an opening to come down on him. However, rather than act contrite as Bradley expects, Lord reacts with rage and abruptly quits his job as deputy. As he storms out of the court house Bradley calls after him to come back in vain. Bradley's tone goes from pleading to threatening as he tells Lord that he will get no special favors if Bradley is pressed to investigate McBride's death. Lord returns home and goes on an alcoholic bender, remaining drunk for several days. The novel then changes scenes to the story of McBride's young wife Donna and the corruption of Highlands. When her husband was killed Donna was already in the hospital having a C-section for what would be her first child with McBride. While in the hospital Donna received the news that her child died after the procedure and then that her husband is dead. Donna doesn't believe that her husband committed suicide and goes to various people in Highlands demanding an investigation. She receives no satisfaction from Highlands but her demands make the Italian mobsters who actually run the company nervous that their illegal activities associated with Highlands will be discovered. The man really in charge of Highlands is August Pellino. He mistakenly comes down hard on the figurehead boss of Highlands who kills himself as a result. This means there are now two apparent suicides of senior Highlands employees making the mobsters who Pellino reports to nervous. Pellino is made to realize by his associates that he must see that Lord takes the fall for McBride's death. In the meantime, Donna comes to Lord's town attempting to get answers. She ends up at Lord's home, lured in by the doctor's shingle that Lord's great grandfather put on the house and the door which Lord always leaves open. Lord can tell that she is near exhaustion and gives her a shot to make her sleep. As he does so, she assumes Lord is his dead father who was a doctor. As Donna sleeps Lord looks through her handbag and finds a loaded gun which he correctly assumes she purchased to kill her husband's murderer. Donna is appalled when she wakes up and discovers that Lord not only gave her the shot but undressed her and put her to bed. She is alternately enraged and amused by Lord's clownish replies to her questions. Eventually, after eating a meal Lord prepared for her she succumbs to her exhaustion and falls back into a natural sleep. Lord comes to realize that Pellino has come to town and that the gangster is trying to discretely keep tabs on him. Lord recognizes Pellino from a mug book of known criminals. Lord drives out of town all the time amused that he knows Pellino is following him even though Pellino clearly thinks his prey is still unaware of his presence. Lord takes refuge in a small shack in the Texas desert and notes that Pellino follows him. Meanwhile, Donna wakes up in Lord's home. She finds a humorous note that Lord left her and continues to go from anger to amusement when thinking of him. She is grateful for his kind treatment but angered by his clownish behavior. She leaves Lord's house and talks to sheriff Bradley. Bradley implicates Lord as her husband's murderer. Donna then meets Pellino who masquerades as a friend of her husband's from Highlands and also implicates Lord and drives Donna to the shack where Lord is staying. Pellino believes that either Donna will kill Lord or Lord will have to kill Donna in self defense, either way making the focus for McBride's death move away from Highlands to Lord. Donna meets Lord at the remote shack and tells him she has come to kill him. Lord makes jokes rather than claiming he is innocent and this infuriates Donna. She shoots Lord at point blank range several times and Lord falls to the floor with agonizing screams. As soon as she fires Donna regrets her decision. She realizes that she's been manipulated to think Lord murdered her husband without any actual evidence. As she weeps over his body Lord jumps up from the floor of the shack and says \\"Look ma, no holes!\\". He changed the bullets in her gun to blanks when she was sleeping. Donna believes Lord's story that the death of her husband was a result of Lord defending himself. She is exhausted from her recent C-section and sleeps in Lord's little cabin. Meanwhile, a gunman who isn't identified finds Pellino and takes him to the tool shed for the wildcat well where McBride was killed. He locks Pellino in the shed. Pellino realizes he can easily break down the door but he decides that is what his assailant is expecting so instead he removes the floor boards and tries to crawl underneath the shed to a spot where he could escape without being seen. However, the shed has a den of rattlesnakes living beneath it. Pellino is attacked by a swarm of snakes and dies in agony from their bites. Pellino's presence in town is soon followed by four other mobsters who have been following Pellino and will kill him and Lord if Pellino fails to. They are all ambushed and killed as they drive out to Lord's shack. Donna thinks that Lord killed these men and Lord exhibits his usual arrogance that she might even think such a thing. Lord realizes that the real killers are coming for him next and tries to get Donna to safety but she stubbornly refuses to leave. He goes out to confront the killers who turn out to be Curly and Red, the two wildcat oil workers whose boss Tom killed. Although they hated McBride, his death and the subsequent troubles with Highldands made it impossible for them to get money and as time went by they blamed Lord and developed a scheme to frame him for the murders they committed. Lord manages to kill Curly but Red has him cornered when a rifle shot comes from nowhere and shoots Red in the arm. Donna refused to follow Lord's order to remain safe in their shack and saves his life. At first Lord is furious with her and they argue some more but eventually he realizes how foolish he is to be angry with someone who saved his life and the novel ends as they realize they are both in love with each other.  Background  The Transgressors started from a contract Thompson received to write a novelization of a movie. The movie was to be titled Cloudburst and was about a woman in the old American west who sets out to find her husband's murderer and ends up falling in love with him. Thompson began writing the novel but he changed major parts of the film script. For example, he changed the setting from the 1800s old west to present day (1961) Texas, Swedish con men to Italian mobsters, and the ending from a melodramatic death of the protagonist into a happy ending. Rather than killing her husband's killer, she marries him. This generated significant push back from his publisher but ultimately the movie Cloudburst was never filmed which made correspondence between the novel and the film script irrelevant. However, Thompson still felt push back from his publishers who wanted him to continue the noir fiction style that he had cultivated in previous books rather than to tell a traditional romantic story with a happy ending.  Themes  The character of the deputy sheriff who plays the fool but is in reality highly intelligent appeared in four of Thompson's novels. In addition to The Transgressors, the character appeared in Wild Town, The Killer Inside Me and Pop. 1280. In Wild Town as in The Transgressors, the sheriff was a heroic figure, a man who though highly intelligent and capable of achieving much more was forced by circumstances to take a job that was beneath his intelligence and who played the fool as a way to fit in with his less educated co-workers. In the novels The Killer Inside Me and Pop. 1280, the sheriff was a sociopath who used his clowning and the fact that people assumed he was a fool as a way to manipulate others and get away with crimes including multiple murders. The sheriff character was partly inspired by Thompson's father who was also a sheriff and who was an expert at manipulating people. Also, like the character Thompson's father put on a veneer of a friendly easy going man but underneath was highly cynical and almost misanthropic in his view of humanity. The sheriff character was also partly inspired by an experience Thompson had with an actual deputy who arrested him when he neglected to pay a fine for being drunk and disturbing the peace.

He was the leading layman of the General Association of Negro Baptists in Kentucky and played a key role in the founding of Simmons College of Kentucky by the group in 1879. He continued to play an important role in the college during his life. He was also co-founder of the American Baptist, a journal associated with the group, and Steward went on to be the journal's editor. He was a leader in Louisville civic and public life, and played a role in extending educational opportunities in the city to black children. In 1897, his political associations led to his appointment as judge of registration and election for the Fifteenth Precinct of the Ninth Ward, overseeing voter registration for the election. This was the first appointment of an African American to such a position in Kentucky. He was elected president of the Afro-American Press Association in the 1890s He was a close associate of Booker T. Washington, and in the late 1890s and early 1900s, Steward was a prominent member of the National Afro-American Council, which was dominated by Washington. He was president of the Council from 1904 to 1905. He was a lifelong opponent of segregation and was frequently involved in anti-Jim Crow law activities. In 1914 he helped found a Louisville branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which he left in 1920 to become a key player in the Commission on Interracial Cooperation (CIC).

An uncle helped him find a job as laborer of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, and he was promoted to messenger in 1875 for the cashier and purchasing agent of the Railroad. In 1867 he was Baptized into the Baptist Church and was an active member, leading the choir at the Fifth Street Baptist church in Louisville and teaching in the Sunday School.  Early career  In February 1876, he left the railroad and became a letter- carrier in the Louisville post-office, becoming the first black letter-carrier in Kentucky. He was respected in this position and was elected to represent the state in the National Letter-Carrier's Association meeting in 1882 in Philadelphia. Steward was frequently involved in religious and secular conventions. In 1873, he was secretary of the Kentucky Baptist State convention in 1873, statistical secretary of that body in 1876, and secretary of the General Association of Colored Baptists of Kentucky from 1877 until after 1887. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Louisville Orphans' Home, which he helped found in 1877. In 1879, Steward was the leading layman of the General Association of Negro Baptists in Kentucky and played a key role in the founding of Simmons College of Kentucky, first called Kentucky Normal and Theological Institute and opened on November 25, 1879. Steward chose the location of the school on a two and one half acre tract on Kentucky Street between Seventh and Eighth Streets in Louisville.Wright, George C. Life Behind a Veil: Blacks in Louisville, Kentucky, 1865--1930. LSU Press, 2004. p127 For most of the rest of his life, Steward served as chairman of the Board of Trustees at Simmons College. He also was a music instructor at the school.The Colored People.

He served as city editor, associate editor, and then as editor and business manager. In 1881, Steward joined the Masonic Fraternity. He became well respected in the group, and was made Worshipful Master of United Lodge No 12, High Priest of Enterprise Chapter no. 4, Eminent Commander of Cyrene Commandry No. 1, and was twice elected Worshipful Master of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky. He was associated with public schools in Louisville and promoted their growth and development, particularly in securing appointments for African American teachers. He also was a strong supporter of a black YMCA in the city which formed in 1892. In 1893, he opposed African American teacher William T. Peyton's attempt to gain the principalship of Central High School. In part, the opposition was based on Peyton's ambition and disloyalty, as Peyton had denounced the Republican Party and joined the Democrats in an effort to gain a patronage based appointment to the position. Steward was successful, and three years later Peyton was dismissed from the school system. Steward felt that the Democrats were responsible for Jim Crow laws and much of the discrimination of blacks, and were opposed to Republican sponsored 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments increasing the civil rights of African Americans. Until the mid-1890s, Steward generally worked with white politicians of both parties. However, Steward's support for Republicanism played an important role in the 1897 victory of the Republican party in local elections. During the campaign, a black political organization called the Elliott Club named for recently deceased Robert Brown Elliott was formed, it was claimed, to sow dissent among black Republicans. Steward shared the suspicion and opposed the club and its effort to discredit Louisville Mayor George Davidson Todd. Steward gained Todd's ear, and had some influence over patronage appointments made by the mayor. Shortly after the meeting, Steward was appointed judge of registration and election for the Fifteenth Precinct of the Ninth Ward, overseeing voter registration for the election. This was the first appointment of an African American to such a position in Kentucky.Wright, George C. Life Behind a Veil: Blacks in Louisville, Kentucky, 1865--1930. LSU Press, 2004. p181-183 National activities Steward's role in the American Baptist greatly increased his national reputation. He was elected secretary of the National Baptist convention in St. Louis on August 25, 1886, and continued to hold officer positions at numerous later conventions. He was a delegate to the 1892 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis where he supported Benjamin Harrison,Colored Delegates, The Inter Ocean (Chicago, Illinoia) June 15, 1892, page 10, accessed November 8, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7365731/colored_delegates_the_inter_ocean/ who won the nomination but lost the election to Grover Cleveland. In the 1890s he was elected president of the national Afro-American Press Association. In 1896, as president of the group, Steward was active in supporting the candidacy for president of William McKinley. Afro-American Council at 1902 meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota. As a leader in the community, Steward was consistently involved in issues of race relations. His methods were generally moderate, seeking to further African American interests without offending his white supporters. Even before Booker T. Washington became a national figure, Steward became associated with Washington; and as with Washington expressed a philosophy of racial self-help and of working with whites, even when white viewpoints were paternalistic. Like Washington, he frequently worked behind the scenes, and did so with Washington's help in 1904 in opposing a bill to disfranchise blacks in the Kentucky Legislature. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, Steward was a prominent member of the National Afro-American Council. He was president of the Council from 1904 to 1905, following Journalist Timothy Thomas Fortune and preceding Bishop Alexander Walters in that position. The Council was dominated by Washington and included a number of important leaders including W. E. B. Du Bois who went on to form the NAACP and anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells.Justesen, Benjamin R. Broken Brotherhood: The Rise and Fall of the National Afro-American Council. SIU Press, 2008. p82 Later life in Louisville In 1906, leading Louisville African Americans including Steward, Rev. Charles H. Parrish, and Rev. John H. Frank formed the Cave Dwellers Life Association, a life insurance company.Wright, George C. Life Behind a Veil: Blacks in Louisville, Kentucky, 1865--1930. LSU Press, 2004. p222 In January 1910, Steward, school principal Albert E. Meyzeek, and Rev. Charles H. Parrish met with white Louisville streetcar officials and civic leaders regarding protests and boycotts of streetcars by blacks in response to a Jim Crow streetcar ordinance. Whites had called for the ban of blacks from the cars complaining that black men were sitting next to white women. Steward's efforts to calm the situation prevented three efforts to ban blacks between 1910 and 1918. In 1914, a Louisville branch of the NAACP was founded by Steward, Parrish, and several other local ministers, continuing Steward's anti-segregation and pro-education work. In November 1917, Steward worked with the NAACP and other black leaders in litigation which went to the US Supreme Court where Louisville's Residential Segregation Ordinance was overturned.Kleber, John E., ed. The Kentucky Encyclopedia. University Press of Kentucky, 2015. p855 In 1920, Steward and Parrish were ousted from the executive board of the branch due to pressure from businessman Wilson Lovett over a bond issue. The pair left the NAACP and began working on the Commission on Interracial Cooperation (CIC). The group worked for similar goals, but frequently broke with the NAACP. For instance, when Louisville officials adopted an ordinance disallowing blacks from public parks in June 1924, the NAACP denounced the ordinance, while the CIC called for opening parks in black neighborhoods. When city officials soon after opened a new park with a swimming pool, the CIC praised the mayor and park commissioners, in-spite of the fact that other parks blacks lacked basic facilities and were simply vacant lots.  Death, honors, and legacy Later in his life, Shaw University gave Steward an honorary Master of Arts degree. In 1917, Alabama A&M; University awarded Steward a LL.

History Strade Friary was founded c. 1240 by Jordan de Exeter, or his son Stephen, at the bequest of Jordan's wife Basilia, daughter of Meyler de Bermingham. It was inhabited by the Order of Friars Minor (Observant Franciscan Friars), before being refounded by the Dominican Order in 1252/53. It was burned in 1254. In 1266, Thomas, bishop of Lismore, acknowledges to have ‚Äòreceived at Athlone, on July 2, 1266, from Friar Henry de Siscle and Friar John Matugan [Madden], of the Dominican convent of Athletan [Straide], the sum of 28¬Ω marks, Crusade money, collected by them and their brethren in their own district. In 1434 Pope Eugene IV granted an indulgence to all who would give help towards the restoration of Strade Abbey. Strade Friary was dissolved in 1578 and leased to James Garvey. In 1588 a lease of the abbey was granted to Patrick Barnewall for forty years. In 1756, there were seven friars in Strade Abbey, and four in 1767. Fr. Patrick D.

Its first period of occupation can be traced to the 1 century BCE. By the Middle Ages the site continued to be occupied by a small community. On 8 November 2004, an interpretative centre was inaugurated by the Secret√°ria de Estado das Artes e Espect√°culos (Secretary- of-State for the Arts and Performances), Teresa Caeiro. In 1930, archaeological excavations under the direction of Ab√≠lio Miranda. Excavations were continued in 1943, under the direction of El√≠sio Ferreira de Sousa, and in 1947, under the supervision of Fernando Russell Cortez. Between 1974 and 1979, a new excavation was carried out by Carlos A. Ferreira de Almeida. A similar excavation began in 1982 (ending ten years later) by the archaeologist Teresa Soeiro. The artefacts unearthed included fragments of ceramics dating to the Iron Age and Roman occupation, including pots, glass, Imbrex and tegula, millstones, coins and metallic elements (including artesanal, defensive and agricultural implements). In addition there were decorative jewellery in silver and bronze Transmontanan fibulas, in addition to granite statuary and altars (an epigraph, fragment dedicated to Jupiter and another truncated to the foculus). These and other artefacts were housed and on display in the Museu Municipal de Penafiel (Penafiel Municipal Museum), Museu de Etnografia e Hist√≥ria do Porto (Porto Museum of Ethnography and History) and the Museu de Antropologia da Universidade do Porto (University of Porto's Anthropologic Museum). Architecture The fortified settlement was located in an isolated, rural hilltop covered in pine forest, overlooking the Ribeira da Camba. It is erected in the southern part of the municipality, between the parishes of Santo Est√™v√£o de Oldr√µes and Galegos. The castro covers an area of 20 hectares, defined by four lines of walls that encircle the settlement, at a maximum of thick at the doorways. The settlement was structured by principal dwellings oriented north to south, articulated with lateral lodgings, aligned orthogonally. Archaeological excavations completed during its history exhumed circular constructions, with or without vestibule, and rectangular plans, with habitational structures framed by dwellings and defined by the walls, forming blocks. Above the settlement is a vast ellipsoid courtyard, also defined by wall, presenting a space that could have acted as a public space. Close to the upper courtyard and principal lodgings, accessible by a bent ramp, is a probable temple constituted by a rectangular cell and podium along the longest side and fronted by other rectangular constructions. In the third wall is a possible funerary monument, heavily ruined, but with a good foundation marked by a rectangular cavity conserved and framed by stones. It is a turriform mausoleum with columns and sculptures, and many elements lying around its base. To the northwest, near the outer wall was a necropolis made up of two sepulchral boxes structured with small stones, covered by slate, with shelf where ceramic containers were deposited.

It was devised in the early 1930s by Ely Culbertson. Most four-notrump conventions (Blackwood and its variants being the best known) demand that bidder's partner define their hand using agreed codified responses. In contrast, the Culbertson 4-5 describes the bidder's hand, and invites partner to use their judgement in the light of that information. Description A bid of four notrump (subject to common-sense defined exceptions) shows either: * Any three aces, or * Two aces, and the king of any suit previously bid by either partner. In response: * A bid of five notrump shows either: ** Any two aces, or ** One ace, and the kings of all suits previously bid by either partner. * A bid of a new suit shows first-round control (ace or void) there, but is not compulsory with such a holding. * Six of a previously-bid suit shows a desire to play there (holding one ace, or the kings of all bid suits). * Five of the lowest-ranking suit bid by either partner is a conventional sign-off, denying the values to make any of the stronger bids. If the four notrump bidder next bids five notrump, that shows all four aces. A bid of five notrump not preceded by four notrump shows three aces and the king of a bid suit. In subsequent bidding, common-sense rules apply. History Culbertson's proposal of this convention threatened to disrupt the publication of the 1935 version of the Laws of Contract Bridge. The Portland Club, guardian of the laws in England, considered it equivalent to playing with exposed cards. Noel Mobbs persuaded the Club that they were wrong. In his 1949 book Design for Bidding, \\"Skid\\" Simon called the Culbertson 4-5 \\"an adult weapon\\" and Blackwood \\"merely a nice toy\\". The Culbertson 4-5 has been superseded by Blackwood and other conventions, but was reported in 1967 to still be popular among some leading British players.

It was preceded by the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It was succeeded by the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It was attended by 1,936 delegates representing more than 46 millions of party members and included 200 foreign journalists who were invited to attend the opening and closing ceremonies. In addition, the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the CPPCC National Committee, representatives from the National Federation of industry and commerce, non- party people, ethnic minorities and religious people were invited to this congress as audience. The congress reaffirmed the correctness of the policy of reforms and the Open Door that was adopted during the Third Plenum of the 11th Congress in December 1978. It also saw the rejuvenation of the party leadership as veterans from the Long March retired and was replaced by younger and better educated technocrats.  Agenda  The agenda for the Congress was as follows: (1) To review and adopt the report of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. (2) To review the report made by the Advisory Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. (3)To review the report made by Commission of Discipline Inspection of the Central Committee. (4) To adopt the recommend amendments to the Constitution of the Communist Party of China. (5) Election of the 13th CPC Central Committee, the CPC Central Committee Advisory Committee and the CPC Central Committee for Discipline Inspection Commission.  Significance of the Congress = Personnel change  Deng Xiaoping personally orchestrated the retirement of more than 90 party elders who were critics of market-oriented reforms adopted in the process of his Four Modernizations. The elders included Peng Chen, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Chen Yun, leading party economist; Hu Qiaomu, harsh critic of bourgeois liberalism and Li Xiannian, the President of the PRC. Deng himself relinquished all of his positions except his chairmanship of the Military Commission through a special party constitutional amendment. Zhao Ziyang was arranged to become the first vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission with Yang Shangkun as its permanent vice-chairman. The new 285 member Central Committee consisted of 175 regulars and 110 alternate members. Around 150 aged leaders (43%) of the previous 348 members Central Committee failed to win reelection. Hua Guofeng was noted to have retained his membership in the central committee. Average age of the new ruling was 55.2 years, down from the 59.1 of its predecessor. 87 of the full and alternate members were new, and 209 (73%) of all Central Committee members were college educated. The Politburo, with 17 regulars and 1 alternate member, was also packed with younger supporters of reform. Although nine of the 20 previous members retired, former General Secretary Hu Yaobang along with Vice-Premiers Wan Li and Tian Jiyun retained their memberships. The Standing Committee saw the election Zhao Ziyang, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Hu Qili and Yao Yilin. Although most elders had relinquished their official positions in the party, their influence did not falter. Their willingness to retire was probably made with the understanding that their favorite choice, Li Peng, would be appointed to the Politburo Standing Committee as well as to the future premiership. Barely three weeks after the close of congress, Li was named acting premier, and later in the National People's Congress in March 1988, confirmed as premier. The 13th National Congress was notable because women were entirely absent from the highest levels of the party, leader such as Zhao Ziyang strongly opposed the participation of women in the political process.  The primary stage of socialism  In his speech, Zhao Ziyang stated that \\"Reform is the only process through which China can be revitalized. It is a process which is irreversible and which accords with the will of the people and the general trend of events.\\" Building socialism with Chinese features, Zhao announced, was an experiment that could not possibly have been foreseen by 19th-century European theorists. The central task of proclaiming market reforms was due to the fact of the widespread poverty and backwardness that existed throughout China. The Chinese leadership reconciled to the idea that market mechanisms and central planning were both \\"neutral means and methods that do not determine the basic economic system of a society\\". Hence an adoption of capitalist techniques and management skills in a mixed economy through multi-ownership system was permissible at that stage.  Political restructuring  China maintained her stance of a \\"socialist democracy\\", as it did not meant that China was to undergo changes that would make it a European democracy. It meant restructuring of the Communist Party of China so that it could better and more sufficiently be able to govern China, such as improvements in administration, simplification of bureaucracy and elimination of over-staffing.  Overall significance  The 13th Party Congress was remarkable in several ways. It launched China into accelerated economic development, ensuring a leadership succession as elder party members voluntarily resigned in favor of younger leaders, and fitting Marxism into \\"a new reality to fit reality\\" rather than bending \\"reality to theory\\". However concerns remains over several issues. First, the resignation of party elders did not mean that reformers could get along with reforms right away since these elders still held immense influence over the party. Secondly, Deng has arranged Zhao to be the First Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission without the assurance that he would succeed Deng as the leader of China. Third, accelerated economic development and greater opening for foreign influences would revive old questions of \\"spiritual pollution\\", \\"bourgeois liberalization,\\" and the perennial issue of \\"Chinese essence vs. foreign value.\\" Fourth, separation of party functions from the government and economic enterprises would affect the vested interests of millions. Lastly, the supremacy of the Four Cardinal Principles prohibited any rule other than the CPC and any freedom beyond what was permitted by the party. Overall, the Congress was a distinct success as it represented a consensus among disparate leaders to move the country forward economically but democracy, pluralism and human rights were issues were left unresolved.

A surrogate model (alternatively known as a metamodel, response surface or emulator) is a prediction of the output of an expensive computer code. This prediction is based on a small number of evaluations of the expensive computer code.  Introduction  Example of one-dimensional data interpolated by Kriging and GEK. The black line indicates the test-function, while the gray circles indicate 'observations', 'samples' or 'evaluations' of the test-function. The blue line is the Kriging mean, the shaded blue area illustrates the Kriging standard deviation. With GEK we can add the gradient information, illustrated in red, which increases the accuracy of the prediction. Adjoint solvers are now becoming available in a range of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, such as Fluent, OpenFOAM, SU2 and US3D. Originally developed for optimization, adjoint solvers are now finding more and more use in uncertainty quantification.  Linear speedup  An adjoint solver allows one to compute the gradient of the quantity of interest with respect to all design parameters at the cost of one additional solve. This, potentially, leads to a linear speedup: the computational cost of constructing an accurate surrogate decrease, and the resulting computational speedup s scales linearly with the number d of design parameters. The reasoning behind this linear speedup is straightforward. Assume we run N primal solves and N adjoint solves, at a total cost of 2N. This results in N+dN data; N values for the quantity of interest and d partial derivatives in each of the N gradients. Now assume that each partial derivative provides as much information for our surrogate as a single primal solve. Then, the total cost of getting the same amount of information from primal solves only is N+dN. The speedup is the ratio of these costs: :s = \\\\frac{N+dN}{2N} = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2}d. A linear speedup has been demonstrated for a fluid-structure interaction problem and for a transonic airfoil.  Noise  One issue with adjoint-based gradients in CFD is that they can be particularly noisy. When derived in a Bayesian framework, GEK allows one to incorporate not only the gradient information, but also the uncertainty in that gradient information.  Approach  When using GEK one takes the following steps: # Create a design of experiment (DoE): The DoE or 'sampling plan' is a list of different locations in the design space. The DoE indicates which combinations of parameters one will use to sample the computer simulation. With Kriging and GEK, a common choice is to use a Latin Hypercube Design (LHS) design with a 'maximin' criterion. The LHS-design is available in scripting codes like MATLAB or Python. # Make observations: For each sample in our DoE one runs the computer simulation to obtain the Quantity of Interest (QoI). # Construct the surrogate: One uses the GEK predictor equations to construct the surrogate conditional on the obtained observations. Once the surrogate has been constructed it can be used in different ways, for example for surrogate-based uncertainty quantification (UQ) or optimization.  Predictor equations  In a Bayesian framework, we use Bayes' Theorem to predict the Kriging mean and covariance conditional on the observations. When using GEK, the observations are usually the results of a number of computer simulations. GEK can be interpreted as a form of Gaussian process regression.  Kriging  Along the lines of, we are interested in the output X of our computer simulation, for which we assume the normal prior probability distribution: :X\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mu,P), with prior mean \\\\mu and prior covariance matrix P. The observations y have the normal likelihood: :Y\\\\mid x\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{N}(Hx,R), with H the observation matrix and R the observation error covariance matrix, which contains the observation uncertainties. After applying Bayes' Theorem we obtain a normally distributed posterior probability distribution, with Kriging mean: :\\\\operatorname E(X\\\\mid y) = \\\\mu + K(y-H\\\\mu), and Kriging covariance: :\\\\operatorname{cov}(X\\\\mid y) = (I-KH)P, where we have the gain matrix: :K = PH^T(R+HPH^T)^{-1}. In Kriging, the prior covariance matrix P is generated from a covariance function. One example of a covariance function is the Gaussian covariance: :P_{ij} = \\\\sigma^2 \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\sum_k\\\\frac{\\\\xi_{jk}-\\\\xi_{ik}^2}{2 \\\\theta_k^2}\\\\right), where we sum over the dimensions k and \\\\xi are the input parameters. The hyperparameters \\\\mu, \\\\sigma and \\\\theta can be estimated from a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE).  Indirect GEK  There are several ways of implementing GEK. The first method, indirect GEK, defines a small but finite stepsize h, and uses the gradient information to append synthetic data to the observations y, see for example. Indirect Kriging is sensitive to the choice of the step-size h and cannot include observation uncertainties.  Direct GEK (through prior covariance matrix)  Direct GEK is a form of co-Kriging, where we add the gradient information as co-variables. This can be done by modifying the prior covariance P or by modifying the observation matrix H; both approaches lead to the same GEK predictor. When we construct direct GEK through the prior covariance matrix, we append the partial derivatives to y, and modify the prior covariance matrix P such that it also contains the derivatives (and second derivatives) of the covariance function, see for example . The main advantages of direct GEK over indirect GEK are: 1) we do not have to choose a step-size, 2) we can include observation uncertainties for the gradients in R, and 3) it is less susceptible to poor conditioning of the gain matrix K.  Direct GEK (through observation matrix)  Another way of arriving at the same direct GEK predictor is to append the partial derivatives to the observations y and include partial derivative operators in the observation matrix H, see for example.  Gradient-enhanced kriging for high-dimensional problems (Indirect method)  Current gradient-enhanced kriging methods do not scale well with the number of sampling points due to the rapid growth in the size of the correlation matrix, where new information is added for each sampling point in each direction of the design space. Furthermore, they do not scale well with the number of independent variables due to the increase in the number of hyperparameters that needs to be estimated. To address this issue, a new gradient-enhanced surrogate model approach that drastically reduced the number of hyperparameters through the use of the partial-least squares method that maintains accuracy is developed. In addition, this method is able to control the size of the correlation matrix by adding only relevant points defined through the information provided by the partial-least squares method. For more details, see . This approach is implemented into the Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) in Python (https://github.com/SMTorg/SMT), and it runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. SMT is distributed under the New BSD license.  Example: Drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil  Transonic airfoil. Reference results for the drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil, based on a large number of CFD simulations. The horizontal and vertical axis show the deformation of the shape of the airfoil. Kriging surrogate model of the drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil. The gray dots indicate the configurations for which the CFD solver was run. GEK surrogate model of the drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil. The gray dots indicate the configurations for which the CFD solver was run, the arrows indicate the gradients. As an example, consider the flow over a transonic airfoil. The airfoil is operating at a Mach number of 0.8 and an angle of attack of 1.25 degrees. We assume that the shape of the airfoil is uncertain; the top and the bottom of the airfoil might have shifted up or down due to manufacturing tolerances. In other words, the shape of the airfoil that we are using might be slightly different from the airfoil that we designed. On the right we see the reference results for the drag coefficient of the airfoil, based on a large number of CFD simulations. Note that the lowest drag, which corresponds to 'optimal' performance, is close to the undeformed 'baseline' design of the airfoil at (0,0). After designing a sampling plan (indicated by the gray dots) and running the CFD solver at those sample locations, we obtain the Kriging surrogate model. The Kriging surrogate is close to the reference, but perhaps not as close as we would desire. In the last figure, we have improved the accuracy of this surrogate model by including the adjoint-based gradient information, indicated by the arrows, and applying GEK.

It crossed the Ottawa River via Chenail Island. It was named for George Perley, Canadian Member of Parliament representing the Argenteuil district in southern Quebec. He first advocated for a crossing at Hawkesbury in 1909. The bridge was known as the Hawkesbury‚ÄìGrenville Bridge, or less frequently the Grenville‚ÄìHawkesbury Bridge prior to its completion in 1931 when the name Perley was applied. It was replaced by the Long-Sault Bridge in 1998. Early history The towns began to request the bridge in 1908, with initial survey work done in 1910. The bridge was designed by 1914, however no agreement was reached between the national government and the two provinces on how the cost would be shared. The project was put aside due to World War I and not revived until 1923. By then, the design needed to be revised to meet contemporary construction standards. Redesign work was completed in 1924, but construction would wait a further six years. Bids for the fabrication of the bridge superstructure were not solicited until July 1930. It was completed in 1931, at a cost of approximately $500,000, opening to traffic on October 21\\\\. The steel was fabricated by the Canadian Bridge Company of Walkerville, Ontario and the general contractor was Farley & Grant. The bridge was in length (measured between abutments) and included 34 different spans, 27 of which were trestle spans over the shallower area on either end. The others were five longer deck truss spans set on piers in deeper water, one through truss which gave the maximum clearance over the navigation channel near the middle of the river, and one bowstring truss over the Carillon Canal. The roadway was wide and carried one traffic lane in each direction, with an additional sidewalk on one side. All piers were set on bedrock. Dedication A dedication ceremony was held on the day of opening, with remarks by Hugh Stewart, the Canadian Minister of Public Works and a ribbon cutting by the wife of the bridge's namesake, George Perley. The bridge was blessed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Ottawa. The mayors of Hawkesbury and Grenville both spoke. The ceremony was preceded by parades from each town to the center of the bridge, where a special pavilion and been constructed. Also present were Perley, √âlie-Oscar Bertrand MP of Prescott, and other government officials. Both Hawkesbury and Grenville declared the half-day starting at noon to be a holiday. Trans-Canada Highway In 1940, the proposed route of the Trans-Canada highway in eastern Ontario ran from Ottawa on Highway 17 to Hawkesbury and then across the bridge and on into Quebec. The highway was not formally enacted until 1949. Today, it traverses the area farther south on Highway 417 and crosses the river via the √éle aux Tourtes Bridge outside Montreal. Reconstruction Little was done to the bridge except routine maintenance such as painting until 1961, when a major modification occurred and the bridge was raised . This was necessary to maintain a navigational clearance of after the construction of the dam at the Carillon Generating Station, a hydroelectric power station that was built between 1959 and 1964 approximately downstream from the bridge. Upon completion, the dam raised the water level by over at the bridge. The six truss spans in the center of the bridge were jacked higher by the Dominion Bridge Company. In preparation, the bridge was restricted to one lane for two months. Then, on December 13, all traffic was halted for 19 hours when the bridge was raised and then reopened to traffic. The bridge lighting was upgraded in 1965 with 250-watt mercury lamps. Maintenance of other inter- province bridges is shared by the national government and the provinces, each paying one-third of the cost. However, since Quebec paid a large share of the original construction cost, it was not responsible for maintenance. Ontario paid 25% of the costs, while Canada paid the remainder. Deterioration The bridge was painted twice after the reconstruction, in 1963 and again in 1972‚Äì73. On March 4, 1973, a corner of one of the south trestle spans failed, dropping the roadway several inches. The bridge was quickly repaired and reopened to all traffic three days later. The failure led to an assessment of the safety of the bridge that began in 1973 by Public Works Canada, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and an Ottawa consulting engineer firm, M.M. Dillon Ltd. Underwater inspection determined the piers were in good condition. The above-water superstructure, made mostly from open hearth steel was found to have many areas of severe corrosion and metal fatigue, including bearings, connecting angles, floor beams (some had been reduced in size by 50%), steel decking, expansion joints, and railing. The study also looked at traffic and determined 11,000 to 12,000 vehicles crossed the bridge on average summer weekdays, 20% to 30% of which were trucks, including heavy logging trucks delivering timber from Quebec to a Hawkesbury paper mill, as well as various other kinds of heavy loads. It concluded that the bridge was carrying loads much in excess of is designed capacity. Work was performed at the time to strengthen the structure so that it would support loads. The work included various reinforcements and strengthening of the structure, including adding braces and replacing some rivets with high- strength bolts, and was considered a \\"short-term\\" solution. On October 22, 1974, signs were posted restricting loads to and a control station on the Quebec side enforced this weight limit. After three months the Quebec government stopped staffing the control station, leading an MP to question if the bridge would last another three to five years. One $280,000 repair was made in 1975. Other repairs were completed in 1978 and 1979. The Marshall Steel Company of Laval, Quebec was awarded one contract for over $740,000 to strengthen trusses on the bridge. Long-term upgrades were needed to achieve a load capacity of . One option considered was using the bridge for automobile traffic only and building a new bridge for heavy truck traffic. The other option was to upgrade the bridge to be able to carry heavy truck traffic on one lane and building a new bridge that would also have one lane for truck and another for cars. Total replacement was not considered because of the perceived value of the existing bridge. However, it was reported as early as 1974 that Public Works Canada felt a new bridge was considered necessary. At the time, an agreement for funding a new bridge could not be reached by the three involved governments. Replacement Corrosion in a section of the deck that had been rehabilitated in 1979 was observed in 1985. In 1986, agreement was reached by the Ottawa and Quebec provincial representatives and Don Boudria, MP for Glengarry‚ÄìPrescott‚ÄìRussell to support total replacement of the bridge, as had been sought by the Grenville and Hawkesbury municipal governments. Boudria said the bridge was in \\"a deplorable condition\\". The Perley bridge was demolished in 1999 after the replacement bridge, built to the west, was opened. Sections of the deck repaired in 1979 were cut out and transported to the laboratories of the Institute for Research in Construction (IRC) at the National Research Council (Canada), and the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Albany Research Center for further examination. At the IRC, corrosion of epoxy-coated-rebar was studied by half-cell potential, linear polarization, and concrete resistivity measurement. At the DOE, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray wavelength analysis were used, with results analyzed by the University of Waterloo. A study determined that epoxy-coated- rebar, which was expected to greatly extend the life of the bridge deck, in fact offered only 1‚Äì4 years more protection than uncoated rebar. Cultural The bridge has more closely joined Hawkesbury, with an 86% French-speaking population, and Grenville.

He wrote a series of weekly articles, La Science Amusante, or Amusing Science, that were collected in book form and have been translated and republished in more than 130 editions in several languages. The illustrations for his do-it- yourself scientific apparatuses have been described as surrealist collages, and were an inspiration for surrealist artists such as Max Ernst and Joseph Cornell.  Personal life  Arthur Good was born in Montivilliers, Seine- Maritime, France on 16 or 26 August 1853. He was the son of Protestant pastor Gustave Fr√©d√©ric Good (1823‚Äì1896) and Louise St√©phanie Monod (1827‚Äì1909). Good graduated from the √âcole centrale des arts et manufacture in Paris, where he studied engineering. He married Jeanne Valon (1857‚Äì1910) in Paris on 6 April 1881. They had four children.  La Science Amusante  L'assiette sur une aiguille (plate on a needle) Lustre en bulles de savon (soap-bubble chandelier) Under the pen name Tom Tit, Arthur Good wrote a series of weekly articles, La Science Amusante, or Amusing Science, for the French magazine L‚ÄôIllustration. Good presented a range of physical experiments, from \\"simple games meant to amuse the family\\" to experiments \\"of a truly scientific character\\". They introduce a range of physical and scientific principles including magnetism and surface tension. Good's articles include geometrical demonstrations, craft projects, and physics experiments which can be carried out with everyday household materials. In books such as La R√©cr√©ation En Famille he emphasized that scientific education could be a common activity and amusement for the entire family. He dedicated La Science Amusante to one of his children, saying \\"In dedicating this volume today, I would like it to be a souvenir for you of the happy moments we have spent together trying the experiments and constructing the apparatuses\\". Good created improvised scientific apparatuses like his Soap-bubble Chandelier using common items such as bottles, eggs, corks, candles, and soap. His constructions have an imaginative charm that has led to them being compared to surrealistic collages. Nonetheless, his drawings were seriously and carefully rendered by scientific engraver Louis Poyet (1846‚Äì1913) and his assistants. The original columns from La Science Amusante were collected and published in a three- volume series in France. Each volume contained 100 amusements. Beginning in 1889, they have been reprinted in over 130 editions. Collections of amusements were translated and published in English, Italian, and Spanish. In the United States they appeared as Magical Experiments, or Science in Play, and in England as Scientific Amusements. A selection has also been republished as 100 Amazing Magic Tricks. Good's books are considered to have laid the foundations for modern approaches to science education in their introduction of \\"kitchen science\\" and hands-on experiments for children.  Other publications  Good also published instructions for DIY entertainments in Pour Amuser Les Petits ou les joujoux qu‚Äôon peut faire soi-m√™me (To Amuse the Little Ones, or Do-It- Yourself Small Toys), La R√©cr√©ation En Famille (Family Recreations), Les Bons Jeudis (Fun Thursdays ‚Äì in Good's day in France there were no classes on Thursdays), and Joujoux en Papier (Paper Toys). From 1885 to 1888, he was the editor of a periodical, Le Chercheur, that featured new inventions. He also wrote for La Nature. In addition to his science education publications, Good published a set of Caricatures of famous Britons in London in 1913. He received a medal of honor from the National Society for the Development of Good (Soci√©t√© nationale d'encouragement au bien).  Surrealism  During the 1920s and 1930s, surrealist artists such as Max Ernst and Joseph Cornell were intrigued by the Tom Tit illustrations, and incorporated them into their own works.

The attack is facilitated by a lack of hardware protection for pin configuration and pin multiplexing configurations. The most significant target for pin control attack is a programmable logic controller (PLC). The application of pin control attack on PLCs is significant because I/O is the main mechanism through which PLCs interact with and control the outside world. PLC I/O like other embedded devices are controlled by a pin based approach. Pin control attack is an attack in which the attacker can tamper with the integrity and availability of PLC I/O by exploiting certain pin control operations and the lack of hardware interrupts associated with them. The family of the attack was first unveiled at Black Hat Europe 2016. The pin control attack uses I/O peripheral configuration settings of the PLC SoC to physically terminate the I/O module communication interface from the PLC. By targeting the PLC I/O configuration instead of PLC runtime or changing the logic program the attackers can avoid typical detection mechanisms exist in embedded systems.  Background  Classic attacks against PLCs rely on modifying the device's firmware, its configuration parameters, or the execution flow of running processes. These typical attacks trigger interrupts in the PLC's normal mode of operation, which the security software such as IDS picks up and alerts the human operator. Pin Control Attack targets the PLC's dynamic memory, where the device stores its I/O configuration.  Attack vectors  The researchers suggested at least two variant of the attack named as Pin Configuration Attack and Pin Multiplexing Attack. While these two attack vectors acting differently, their concept is similar and both physically terminate the I/O from software access without software noticing about it due to lack of hardware interrupts for I/O Multiplexing and I/O Configuration.  Pin multiplexing attack  Embedded SoCs usually employ hundreds of pins connected to the electrical circuit. Some of these pins have a single defined purpose. For example, some only provide electricity or a clock signal. Since different equipment vendors with diverse I/O requirements will use these SoCs, the SoC manufacturer produces its SoCs to use a certain physical pin for multiple mutually exclusive functionalities, depending on the application. The concept of redefining the functionality of the pin is called Pin Multiplexing and is one of the necessary specifications of the SoC design. Regarding the interaction of the Pin Multiplexing with OS, it is recommended by SoC vendors to only multiplex the pins during the startup since there is no interrupt for multiplexing. However, the user still can multiplex a pin at runtime and there is no limitation on that. The current design of Pin Multiplexing in hardware level raises security questions. For example, assume that an application uses a particular peripheral controller connected to a pin with a particular multiplexing setup. At one point another application (second application) changes the multiplexing setup of the pin used by the first application. Once the pin is multiplexed, the physical connection to the first peripheral controller gets disconnected. However, since there is no interrupt at the hardware level, the OS will assume that the first peripheral controller is still available. Thus, the OS will continue to carry out the write and read operations requested by the application without any error. The concept of changing the functionality of a pin connected to the I/O at the runtime is called Pin Multiplexing Attack.  Pin configuration attack  A PLC can receive and transmit various types of electrical and electronic signals. The input, which typically comes from sensors, and the output, which can be used to control motors, valves or relays, are linked to input and output pins on an integrated circuit known as a system on chip (SoC). The SoC‚Äôs pin controller can configure the modes of a pin (i.e. they are set to serve as input or output). The experts discovered that an attacker who has compromised the PLC can tamper with the input and output without being detected and without alerting the operators monitoring the process through a human-machine interface (HMI).  Stealthiness  Both Pin Configuration and Pin Multiplexing don‚Äôt trigger any alert or hardware interrupt. Therefore, during an active attack, the PLC runtime will interact with a virtual I/O memory while the attacker physically terminated the connection of the I/O with virtual memory. The state where I/O values in the software memory do not reflect the physical I/O memory is being called as I/O memory illusion.

This limestone karst cave came to scientific and public attention after the 1931 discovery of the Upper Palaeolithic Vogelherd figurines, attributed to paleo-humans of the Aurignacian culture. These miniature sculptures made of mammoth ivory rank among the oldest uncontested works of art of mankind. In 2017 the site became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura\\".  Location  The site is located on the edge of the valley of the river Lone near Stetten ob Lontal, part of Niederstotzingen in the eastern Swabian Jura, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, southern Germany. It is not publicly accessible, but since 2013 has been embedded in the Arch√§opark Vogelherd that includes a museum and a visitor center. The cave is located on a hill above the river Lone with a 180 degree view over the valley. The Y-shaped cave occupies about and had an initial height of three to four meters. There are three entrance holes. Two large, 2.5 to 3.5 meter high entrance holes are connected by an approximately long curved gallery - called the \\"Big Cave\\". The second gallery, the \\"Small Cave\\", is of the same length but very narrow, the entrance being too small to be used. A passage between the two caves is except for a tiny gap at the top completely filled with debris and sediment deposits.  Discovery and excavation  On 23 May 1931 amateur archeologist Hermann Mohn unearthed a number of flintstone flakes while examining a badger's den. He informed the University of T√ºbingen. Excavations in the cave were undertaken in the same year by paleo-historian Gustav Riek from T√ºbingen over the course of three months from 15 July until 1 October 1931. Human occupation of the site was documented, as sediments from the Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age yielded tools and artefacts. The excavation also yielded several figurines of 5 to 10 cm length carved from mammoth ivory, found in an Aurignacian layer (see below). They featured ornamentation like dots, lines and x-shaped markings. These seem to be not an attempt to depict actual surface features of the creature in question, but may well be of a ritual or even religious character. Riek's excavation completely cleared out all the sediments from inside the cave. More excavations at the cave began in the summer of 2005, conducted by the Institut f√ºr Ur- und Fr√ºhgeschichte of the University of T√ºbingen. The target was the waste material of Riek's dig, heaped in front of the cave entrance. With more modern methods and technology, a large number of findings were discovered. These included (on 22 June 2006) the mammoth figurine described below. Due to the large number of discoveries, the excavations went on much longer than expected. Until 2012, each year digging continued for five to nine weeks. A total of around 90% of the waste heap have been examined. The findings include a total of 217,000 stone artefacts of various sizes. There are also 479 kg of bones (plus 235 kg of burned bones), mostly from hunted animals. Among 28 kg of mammoth ivory are 326 pierced pendants/pieces of jewelry. 1,713 tools made from bone, antlers or ivory and 64 broken pieces of ivory were found, the later definitely part of some form of figurative art. An additional 112 fragments were likely part of figures. Various pieces of flutes (made from bird bones and ivory) were also found.  Stratigraphy  Riek defined nine cultural horizons. The oldest scattered objects - stone artifacts - date back to the Middle Paleolithic - older than 40,000 years, representing traces and remains of occasional occupation by late Neanderthals. Although hundreds of tools and artifacts made of stone, bone, ivory and antler are documented in all sediment layers beginning in the Eemian (ca. 130,000 years ago) to the top strata of the Bronze Age, human fossil discoveries are rare and most are attributed to the late Neolithic (ca. 5,000 years ago).  Middle Paleolithic  * Mousterian VII Layer Mousterian VII contained a hand axe shaped, broad fragment of yellow and white silex, a brown and grey silex tip which has been retouched on one side, a hollowed-out tip of grey-yellow silex; a total of three curved scrapers and two straight scrapers. Furthermore, an upper jaw fragment of a wild horse was found, of which five incisors have been preserved. Upper Paleolithic Excavation in 2012 Frequent and widespread occupation took place during the Upper Palaeolithic - between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago - the Aurignacian deposits offer the primary source of information, the Gravettian is not present. Organic objects, fireplaces and missile tips were found. * Aurignacian V In layer Aurignacian V two independent fireplaces were found, one in the main hall, the other near the south-western entrance. A total of 910 stone tools were recorded, distributed mainly in the vicinity of these fireplaces, the most common items being scrapers and gouges. Numerous bone and ivory artifacts were discovered, among the most common objects of organic material are missile tips. * Aurignacian IV Gustav Riek dubbed this layer \\"Upper Aurignacian\\". Large-scale occupation in several settlement phases is documented. According to Riek's excavation report 1,729 stone artifacts and 82 organic artifacts were discovered. Among them were some pieces which were decorated by serrations. Of further interest are missile heads that are actually less frequent in this strata. However, one of these has a split base, four others have a solid base, and three are only fragmentary preserved as one of these fragments received lateral notches and X-marks. * Magdalenian III Stone artifacts were discovered in layer Magdalenian III. Among the finds are four blade knives, three blades, a gouge, and two lateral flakes and a fragment of a reindeer antler with several cut marks and cut faces. * Magdalenian II Layer Magdalenian II was rich in stone artifacts. These include eleven blades of varied quality and execution. Other finds include a reindeer's antler with a cut face and cut marks at the fork as well as an ivory palette with finely carved grooves.  Vogelherd figurines  The Vogelherd figurines are some of the world‚Äôs oldest-known works of figurative art, artefacts \\"made from the ivory of woolly mammoths\\" and \\"finely carved and exquisitely detailed\\". The 1931 excavation yielded 11 figurines, found in the Aurignacian layers. Interpretations of the carvings have been made in the context of these animals' great importance for paleo-human survival and related hunting rituals and they may have served a purpose in pre-historic beliefs, cults and shamanistic practices. Wild horse * Sculpture of a horse Length: 4.8 cm (ca. 30,000 ‚Äì 29,000 years old) \\"Exceptionally accurately shaped, perfect in form and remarkably expressive. Due to the curved neck, it is usually thought to represent a stallion with an aggressive or imposing bearing. Only the head is completely preserved. Due to the flaking of external ivory layers, the width has been reduced and the legs have broken off. There are engraved symbols, including cross marks and angular signs, on the back of the neck, as well as on the back and the left chest.\\" Mammoth * Sculpture of a woolly mammoth Length: 3.7 cm (ca. 35,000 years old) The entirely intact woolly mammoth figurine displays skilfully detailed carvings. It is unique in its slim form, pointed tail, powerful legs and dynamically arched trunk. It is decorated with six short incisions, and the soles of the pachyderm's feet show a crosshatch pattern. In 2009, the figurine became the central exhibit of a large Landesausstellung. Lion's head * Sculpture of a cave lion Length: 5.6 cm (ca. 40,000 years old) Found in 1931 with an incomplete head and thought to be a relief. The missing piece was found during the excavations between 2005 and 2012 and were successfully reattached, thus confirming that the figurine is in fact a three-dimensional sculpture. It is decorated with approximately 30 finely incised crosses on its spine.  The faunal assemblage  Among the faunal fossils of the Aurignacian, sixteen mammalian and seven avian taxa are represented. Reindeer and horse represent the primary prey. Although nearly equal in number, mammoth was according to the excavation data not actively hunted, but collected from natural death sites. Large bovid, red deer, wild boar, bison and chamois are also documented, but seem to have been secondary game. Small numbers of birds such as goose, ptarmigan, black grouse, and capercaillie suggest only occasional exploitation. Moderate evidence of Middle Paleolithic presence of late Neanderthals suggests sporadic, non-frequent and seasonal occupation. Very few animal bones indicate regular intrusion of carnivores and bone dispersion by hyenas and wolves. UNESCO World Heritage Site In January 2016, the federal government of Germany applied for the status of World Heritage Site for two valleys with six caves named H√∂hlen der √§ltesten Eiszeitkunst (\\"Caves with the oldest Ice Age art\\"). The site would encompass areas in the Lonetal (valley of the Lone) and the Achtal (valley of the Ach) both in the southern Swabian Jura. The former includes the caves Hohlenstein-Stadel, Vogelherd and Bocksteinh√∂hle, the latter Geissenkl√∂sterle, Hohle Fels and Sirgenstein Cave. Each valley would contain a core area of around length, surrounded by a buffer zone of a least width. In the argument why these sites deserve recognition as a part of the universal human heritage, the area is described as the source of the currently oldest (non-stationary) works of human art in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines as well as the oldest musical instruments. Their creators lived, were inspired and worked in and around these caves. The caves also served as the repositories of the figurines which may have been used in a religious context. In addition, they were the venue where performers used the excavated musical instruments and where the social groups lived from which the artists sprang. The committee awarded the status of WHS in July 2017.

These kilns were much smaller than later examples, at some 5‚Äì12 metres long, and also sloped far less.Kerr, 348‚Äì350 The type had certainly developed by the Warring States period,Wood and by the Eastern Wu kingdom (220‚Äì280 CE), there were over 60 kilns at Shangyu. Thereafter it remained the main design used in southern China until the Ming dynasty. The pottery areas of south China are mostly hilly, whereas those on the plains of north China typically lack suitable slopes; here the mantou kiln type predominated.Vainker, 50‚Äì51; Rawson, 364‚Äì365 The Nanfeng Kiln in Guangdong province is several centuries old and still functioning.

From the Southern Song period (1127‚Äì1279), some kilns were built as a series of chambers, stepped as they ran up the slope,Wood and with connecting doors to allow access to both the kiln-workers during loading and unloading, and the heat during firing. There might be up to 12 chambers.Medley, 14; Wood Chambered kilns were usual for making Longquan celadon.Vainker, 222 The main fire chamber was at the bottom, but there might be additional \\"stoke holes\\" to allow adding extra fuel at intervals up the slope, as well as peep holes to allow sight of the interior. At the far, top, end there was a chimney, but given the up-draught of the slope, this did not need to be tall, and might be omitted altogether.Wood The size and shape of the kilns and chambers within varied considerably. Firing was begun at the bottom end and moved up the slope.Medley, 147‚Äì148; Vainker, 222 The fuel might be wood or (generally less often) coal, which affected the atmosphere of the firing; wood giving a reducing atmosphere and coal an oxidizing one.Vainker, 124 The weight of pottery produced was about the same as the weight of wood required.Eng, 18 Generally saggars were used,Medley, 148 at least in later periods. These were an innovation of Ding ware from the north in the Song dynasty.Vainker, 95 The kilns allowed large quantities of pottery to be fired at high temperatures, but the firing was not usually even across the length of the kiln, which often produced different effects on pieces at different levels. Very often the higher chambers produced the better pieces, as they heated up more slowly.Medley, 147‚Äì148 As one example, the wide range of colours seen in Chinese celadon wares such as Yue ware and Longquan celadon is largely explained by variations in firing conditions.Vainker, 72 Variations in the shades of white porcelains between and within the northern Ding ware and the southern Qingbai were also the result of the fuel used.Vainker, 95, 124 Some of the most advanced chambered kilns were built to fire Dehua porcelain, where precise control of high temperatures was essential.Wood The dragon kiln form was copied in Korea, from sometime between 100 and 300 CE, and much later in Japan in various types of climbing anagama kilns, and elsewhere in East Asia.Kerr, 350‚Äì351; Wood The large quantities fired were not unique to Asian pottery; the largest kilns making ancient Roman pottery, of a totally different form, could fire up to 40,000 pieces at a time.JP Hayes article from the Grove Dictionary of Art  Notes  References  * Eng, Clarence, Colours and Contrast: Ceramic Traditions in Chinese Architecture, 2014, BRILL, , Google books * Kerr, Rose, Needham, Joseph, Wood, Nigel, Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 12, Ceramic Technology, 2004, Cambridge University Press, , Google books * Medley, Margaret, The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics, 3rd edition, 1989, Phaidon, * Rawson, Jessica (ed.).

Introduced in Steve Miner's sequel Friday the 13th Part 2 in 1981, Ginny is an aspiring child psychologist who is hired as an assistant to Paul Holt at the Packanack Lodge, a site Paul plans to transform into a counselor training center which is located near the infamous Camp Crystal Lake. Ginny, who believes that the legend of Jason Voorhees is more than a myth, soon encounters the vengeful killer and realizes that she must delve into his psyche if she wants to survive. Originally in Friday the 13th Part III (1982), the storyline was supposed to focus on a post-traumatic Field who began learning self defense and returned to college after surviving her ordeal in the previous film. After finding Paul's corpse inside her dormitory, she prepares to track down Voorhees and face him in a final confrontation. However, this concept was abandoned when Steel declined to reprise her role. She also appears in the Friday the 13th expanded universe, appearing in the novelizations and merchandise based on the films. Some scholars regard Ginny as an example of the \\"final girl\\" archetype. Appearances=In film In Friday the 13th Part 2, Ginny is an aspiring child psychologist who is Paul Holt's girlfriend, she arrives at Crystal Lake late for training. At the campfire that night, Paul tells the camp counselors the legend of Jason Voorhees and the disappearance of Alice which occurred months after Jason allegedly witnessed his mother being beheaded, to scare the other counselors from entering Camp Crystal Lake. Later, Paul offers them a trip to the next town, and several counselors attend, including Ginny. At a bar, Ginny admits that she takes the legend of \\"Camp Blood\\" seriously. She feels sympathetic towards Jason Voorhees, because of his traumatic childhood and she believes the legend of him witnessing Alice beheading his mother. Meanwhile, Jason begins to murder all of the counselors that stayed at the camp. When Ginny and Paul return, she believes that something is wrong. Ginny is soon forced to fight for her life. After Jason knocks Paul out, Ginny becomes his new target. After evading Jason numerous times and fighting back, Ginny stumbles across Jason's shack in the woods, and finds a shrine for Pamela Voorhees. She puts on an old sweater, belonging to Pamela, in effort to convince Jason Voorhees that she is his mother. Jason believes her, and she manages to calm him down before he notices his mother's head behind Ginny. He then slices open Ginny's leg just as Paul comes in. As Jason prepares to kill Paul, Ginny comes up behind Jason and drives a machete into his shoulder. At the end of the film, Ginny is seen being carried away in a stretcher, crying out for Paul, whose fate is left unknown. Friday the 13th Part III picks up directly after the second film, with Ginny Field shown being pulled away on a stretcher during a news report detailing the ordeal she survived. Ginny appears in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984) through archive footage; this is currently the last Friday the 13th film that Ginny appears in. In literature Ginny makes her first literary appearance in the novelization of Friday the 13th Part 3 (1982), which states that she is in \\"serious condition\\" and is suffering from \\"severe hysterical shock\\" because of her battle with Jason Voorhees. She subsequently appears as the lead protagonist in Friday the 13th Part II: A Novel, a novelization of the 1981 film Friday the 13th Part 2, which was released seven years after the film premiered in February 1988. The novel was written by Simon Hawke and based on Ron Kurz's screenplay. The aftermath of her encounter with Jason is once again referenced in the novel Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs, which states that her claims of finding Jason's shack in the woods went ignored, due to the authorities doubting her sanity. In merchandise In 2014, Fright-Rags released a T-shirt titled \\"Ginny's Revenge\\", which prominently featuring Ginny in its design. It received a limited release with only 300 shirts being sold. The cost of the shirts were $27 with sizes ranging from S-5X, Girls S-2X. In 2017, Ginny was featured on the design of another Fright-Rags T-shirt entitled Victims and Survivors. In video games In the 2017 video game Friday the 13th: The Game, Ginny is referenced in the Virtual Cabin 2.0 mode. When viewing the statue of Jason's design from Friday the 13th Part 2, his biography states, \\"Only the aspiring child psychologist, Ginny Field, is able to outsmart and eventually \\"defeat\\" Jason. She puts on Pamela's sweater to trigger Jason, and then buries a machete deep into his shoulder...\\" She is also referenced in the biography for Jason's design from Friday the 13th Part III which states that Jason barely survived his encounter with Ginny. Development In an interview, Amy Steel discussed her audition for the film, stating: :\\"At the time of [making the film], it was before the genre really picked up so I didn‚Äôt give it a lot of credit or take it seriously. For me, it was just another audition because I had no idea what it would end up meaning after all this time. When I played Ginny, I was really young and different from a lot of the people working at the time so that came out in my character. I was naturally suspicious of cocky guys at that age, and you see a lot of that when I‚Äôm on screen with Paul (John Furey). I tried to put so much behind the actual words in the script just so she felt almost unreachable, to Paul and to audiences. I wanted her to have some power.\\" : While discussing the character, Steel described the parallels between herself and Ginny and praised the character's intelligence and strength, noting: :\\"I think I got lucky with the role of Ginny, on a couple of fronts. She's pretty much who I am. It wasn't really much of a stretch. We have the same energy, so you could say I was typecast. But the hard part is really owning who we are as women, all the strength, faith, and calm ... at the same time.\\" : She then said she liked the character because she wasn't a \\"total bimbo\\" and that she was \\"smart and confident and you knew she had something driving her.\\" Originally, Ginny was set to return as a main character in Part III but Amy Steel feared being typecast and officially decided to not return when her agent of the time convinced her to decline the offer. Her role in the film would have been similar to Laurie Strode's in Halloween II (1981). According to Kelly Konda, \\"Director Steve Miner and Martin Kitrosser, the script supervisor for Parts 1 and 2 and co-writer of Part 3, wanted Ginny to go to a mental institution as a result of her trauma after Part 2. Jason would eventually arrive to settle his vendetta against her, killing any guards, doctors, or patients that got in his way.\\" However, producers soon became skeptical of the idea and eventually abandoned it when Steel officially declined to return. When asked why she didn't reprise her role as the lead character in Part III, Steel confirmed her fear of being typecast and her subsequent regret of declining the offer to return, stating: :\\"When I finished filming Part 2, I was trashed. I was exhausted. But that‚Äôs not why I didn‚Äôt do Part 3. I wanted to be taken seriously as an actress. At the time there was still a stigma associated with horror movies. Jamie Lee Curtis changed that . . . but the roles were limited. It was mostly about screaming. I regret not doing the third film. It‚Äôs one of my biggest regrets.\\" She has also stated that her agents had recommended her to turn the film down in order to advance her career beyond the slasher-genre. Reception In The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film, Barry Keith Grant stated that, \\"Ginny temporarily adopts Mrs. Voorhees's authoritarian role to survive. Although circumstances necessitate this, she clearly uses her enemy's strategy to become a phallic mother herself. This posture really questions the positive image of the Final Girl.\\" He then called her \\"not victorious\\" when she called out for her boyfriend at the end of the film saying that it was done in a \\"non-independent manner\\". John Kenneth Muir references Ginny in Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1, saying \\"Amy Steel is introduced as Ginny, our final girl and heroine, and the only person who seems to have an inkling of the nearby danger. She's more resourceful than Alice and nearly upstages even Laurie Strode during the film's tense finale, wherein she brazenly dresses up as Jason's dead mother and starts barking orders at the confused serial killer.\\" In Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle, Richard Nowell said \\"The shift in characterization of the female leads was also trumpeted during Ginny's self-confident entrance (Amy Steel) in Friday the 13th Part II. Where the makers of its predecessor introduced Alice as she prepared cabins while dressed in denim jeans and a shapeless lumberjack shirt, the sequel's conventionally attractive lead is established immediately as combining masculine traits with feminine attributes. Ginny exits a battered VW bug in a flowing fuchsia skirt and a low-cut t-shirt.\\" In Horror and the Horror Film, Bruce F. Kawin states that \\"The heroine and survivor, Ginny (Amy Steel), is not a virgin, though she is having her period and may gain from that some blood power against Jason. Ginny is majoring in Child Psychology, which lets her deal with Jason (who, she deduces, has the mind of child fixated on the mother he saw killed because she loved him) when she pretends to be his mother. She survives partly because she takes children's emotions seriously.\\" In 2012, Complex ranked Ginny 16th on their list of The 25 Most Badass Horror Movie Heroines. Brendan Morrow on Bloody Disgusting writes that \\"Amy Steel beautifully portrays Ginny as an independent woman who is getting a bit sick of being looked down upon\\" and that :\\"Not only is Ginny not the dumb blonde archetype we might expect, but she‚Äôs actually studying to become a child psychologist. How often do we meet a slasher character whose academic pursuits are even a point of discussion and whose book smarts are exalted rather than mocked or used as an example of how boring they are?\\" Morrow also argues that Ginny is more than capable of standing up for herself without venturing into Mary Sue territory, and that imposturing Pamela Voorhees to stall Jason also proves her to be a reasonable and compassionate person. He also criticizes Ginny's successor Chris Higgins of Friday the 13th Part III to have no personality to speak of in comparison with Ginny. In 2016, Paste ranked Ginny 17th on their list of The 20 Best \\"Final Girls\\" in Horror Movie History, calling her \\"a realistic girl of her time period who, at the same time, has the guts and resolve to face off against Jason (sans hockey mask, which he didn‚Äôt get until the third film) and come out on top.\\" See also *Final girl *Laurie Strode *Nancy Thompson ReferencesExternal links * Ginny Field on IMDb * Ginny Field at Friday the 13th (wiki) * Ginny Field at Heroes (wiki) * Ginny Field at Horror Film (wiki) Category:Fictional sole survivors Category:Fictional feminist characters Category:Fictional psychologists Category:Final girls Category:Friday the 13th (franchise) characters Category:Film characters introduced in 1981 ","title":"Ginny (Friday the 13th)"},{"id":"52218846","text":"Adolf Franz Heep (July 24, 1902 ‚Äì April 3, 1978) was a German-Brazilian architect.

His signature work is Edif√≠cio It√°lia, once the tallest building in the city of S√£o Paulo at . It was designated a landmark building by the city of S√£o Paulo in 1992. Heep also worked as an educator at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in S√£o Paulo and later for the United Nations. Early career Adolf Heep was born in Fachbach, Rhineland- Palatinate on July 24, 1902. He studied architecture at the Kunstschule, Frankfurt am Main, which like the Bauhaus implemented reforms in the teaching of art and architecture. Heep was a pupil of Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer, with whom he later worked in Frankfurt between 1924 and 1928. He finished his education at √âcole Sp√©ciale d'Architecture in Paris. In this period Heep saw the construction of buildings in the neighborhoods of H√∂henblick and R√∂merstadt using industrialized construction methods such as prefabricated panels and standardized window frames, both of which became part of his later works. Heep moved to Paris in 1928 where he worked with Le Corbusier for four years. While in Paris, Heep developed vertical apartment buildings for middle- class residents in partnership with the Polish architect Jean Ginsberg (1905-1983). Career in S√£o Paulo Heep arrived in S√£o Paulo in 1947 as part of a wave of European architects who emigrated to Brazil. He was first employed by the Franco-Brazilian architect Jacques Pilon. He worked with Pilon on the headquarters of the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo which used modern elements such as brise-soleil. Heep became a naturalized citizen of Brazil in 1952. He worked briefly with Henrique Mindlin (1911 - 1971), and opened his own office two years later. Heep focused on vertical housing projects, producing two dozen residential buildings. His work ranged from luxury apartments in Higien√≥polis to small kitchenettes in the center of S√£o Paulo. His signature work, Edif√≠cio It√°lia, dates from this period. Heep considered the S√£o Domingos Church in Perdizes his finest work; construction on the church began in 1952 and continued for 14 years. Heep was noted for his \\"rigorous technical design in construction, specifications and finishes, and by careful planning.\\" Heep became an accredited architect in 1959 at the end of his residential construction period. He worked as a professor at the Mackenzie School of Architecture and Urbanism from 1958 and 1965. He then served as a member of the United Nations Architecture Council for Latin American countries on projects in Peru and Paraguay. He died in 1978 in Paris.

The church was completed in 1878, and it is the oldest Presbyterian church in Singapore. The church was founded to serve the Scottish community in Singapore, but now caters to a congregation of a widely different background and holds services in a number of different languages. History The church originated from the congregation of the Mission Chapel of Singapore which included members of the Scottish community of early Singapore. In 1822, its Scottish members held a meeting with the aim of setting up a local Presbyterian church, however, the first service was not held until 6 October 1856 with the arrival of Rev Thomas McKenzie Fraser to Singapore. The earliest service was held at the London Missionary Society's chapel on Bras Basah Road, later services were also held at the St Andrew's Church. In 1875, a piece of land on Orchard Road was allocated by the Governor of Singapore for the construction of the church, and the foundation stone for the church was laid by Colonel Anson on 1 August 1877. The building was completed in 1878 at a cost of $20,000. The building has been extended over the years. In 1921, the Tomlinson Hall was added as a side-extension, but this was later demolished in 2002. A Sunday School was added in 1953, and other parts of the church extended ‚Äì the church hall in 1954, and the sanctuary in 1975. The Dunman Hall was added in 1985. A branch of the church was established in Bukit Batok that became independent in 2013, and an independent church was also established in 2005 for its Chinese congregation, the Providence Presbyterian Church. Architecture Interior of the church The building is single storey structure with tiled pitched roofs, with a Palladian-styled facade facing Orchard Road. The dominant feature of the facade is the Serlian motif (also called a Palladian window) ‚Äì a central arched opening flanked by openings on either side with flat entablatures. The motif forms the porch which is supported by double Ionic columns, and a smaller version with single columns is repeated above the porch. The front facade has finials at the four corners of the tower, and it is topped by a cupola supported by columns. Pipe organ The church has one of the few working pipe organs in Singapore. The first organ was installed in 1861, and the current one is the third to be constructed in the church. This organ was built in 1962 by J. W. Walker & Sons based on the 1926 two-manual and pedal-tracker organ by William Hill & Sons/Norman and Beard. Its action was electrified in 1987. Services The church originally catered to the Scottish community in Singapore and services were conducted in English. Later services in other languages were also offered to members of different communities, with the first Mandarin Chinese service given on Easter Sunday 1968. Currently the church also offer services in Indonesian and German.

In terms of Feynman diagrams, the Luttinger‚ÄìWard functional is the sum of all closed, bold, two-particle irreducible diagrams, i.e., all diagrams without particles going in or out that do not fall apart if one removes two propagator lines. It is usually written as \\\\Phi[G] or \\\\Phi[G,U], where G is the Green's function and U is the bare interaction. The Luttinger‚ÄìWard functional has no direct physical meaning, but it is useful in proving conservation laws. The functional is closely related to the Baym‚ÄìKadanoff functional constructed independently by Gordon Baym and Leo Kadanoff in 1961. Some authors use the terms interchangeably; if a distinction is made, then the Baym‚ÄìKadanoff functional is identical to the two-particle irreducible effective action \\\\Gamma[G], which differs from the Luttinger‚ÄìWard functional by a trivial term. Construction Given a system characterized by the action S[c, \\\\bar c] in terms of Grassmann fields c_i, \\\\bar c_i, the partition function can be expressed as the path integral: : Z[J] = \\\\int \\\\mathrm D[c,\\\\bar c] \\\\exp!\\\\Big(-S[c, \\\\bar c] + \\\\sum_{ij} \\\\bar c_i J_{ij} c_j\\\\Big), where J is a binary source field. By expansion in the Dyson series, one finds that Z = Z[J=0] is the sum of all (possibly disconnected), closed Feynman diagrams. Z[J] in turn is the generating functional of the N-particle Green's function: : G_{i_1j_1\\\\ldots i_Nj_N} = - \\\\langle c_{i_1} \\\\bar c_{j_1} \\\\cdots c_{i_N} \\\\bar c_{j_N} \\\\rangle = \\\\frac {-1}{Z[0]} \\\\left. \\\\frac {\\\\delta^N Z[J]} {\\\\delta J_{j_1i_1}\\\\cdots \\\\delta J_{j_Ni_N} } \\\\right_{J=0} The linked-cluster theorem asserts that the effective action W = \\\\log Z is the sum of all closed, connected, bare diagrams. W[J] = \\\\log Z[J] in turn is the generating functional for the connected Green's function. As an example, the two particle connected Green's function reads: : G^\\\\mathrm{conn}_{ijkl} = - \\\\langle c_i \\\\bar c_j c_k \\\\bar c_l \\\\rangle \\\\+ \\\\langle c_i \\\\bar c_j \\\\rangle \\\\langle c_k \\\\bar c_l \\\\rangle \\\\- \\\\langle c_i \\\\bar c_l \\\\rangle \\\\langle c_k \\\\bar c_j \\\\rangle = -\\\\left. \\\\frac {\\\\delta^2 W[J]} {\\\\delta J_{ji}\\\\delta J_{lk} } \\\\right_{J=0} To pass to the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, one performs a Legendre transform of W[J] to a new binary source field. One chooses an, at this point arbitrary, convex G_{ij} as the source and obtains the 2PI functional, also known as Baym‚ÄìKadanoff functional: :\\\\Gamma[G] = \\\\Big[ -W[J] - \\\\sum_{ij} J_{ij} G_{ij} \\\\Big]_{J=J[G]} with G_{ij} = -\\\\frac {\\\\delta W[J]}{\\\\delta J_{ij}}. Unlike the connected case, one more step is required to obtain a generating functional from the two-particle irreducible effective action \\\\Gamma because of the presence of a non-interacting part. By subtracting it, one obtains the Luttinger‚ÄìWard functional: :\\\\Phi[G] = \\\\Gamma[G] - \\\\Gamma_0[G] = \\\\Gamma[G] - \\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\log(-G) - \\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\Sigma G) , where \\\\Sigma is the self-energy. Along the lines of the proof of the linked-cluster theorem, one can show that this is the generating functional for the two-particle irreducible propagators. Properties Diagrammatically, the Luttinger‚ÄìWard functional is the sum of all closed, bold, two-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams (also known as ‚Äúskeleton‚Äù diagrams): :File:Diagrammatic expansion of the Luttinger‚ÄìWard functional.png The diagrams are closed as they do not have any external legs, i.e., no particles going in or out of the diagram. They are ‚Äúbold‚Äù because they are formulated in terms of the interacting or bold propagator rather than the non-interacting one. They are two-particle irreducible since they do not become disconnected if we sever up to two fermionic lines. The Luttinger‚ÄìWard functional is related to the grand potential \\\\Omega of a system: : \\\\Omega = \\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\log(-G) + \\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\Sigma G) + \\\\Phi[G] \\\\Phi is a generating functional for irreducible vertex quantities: the first functional derivative with respect to G gives the self-energy, while the second derivative gives the partially two- particle irreducible four-point vertex: : \\\\Sigma_{ij} = \\\\frac {\\\\delta\\\\Phi} {\\\\delta G_{ij}}; \\\\Gamma_{ijkl} = \\\\frac {\\\\delta^2\\\\Phi} {\\\\delta G_{ij}\\\\delta G_{kl}} While the Luttinger‚ÄìWard functional exists, it can be shown to be not unique for Hubbard-like models. In particular, the irreducible vertex functions show a set of divergencies, which causes the self-energy to bifurcate into a causal and a non-causal (and thus unphysical) solution. However, by restricting the self-energy to causal solutions, one can restore uniqueness of the functional. Baym and Kadanoff showed that any diagrammatic truncation of the Luttinger‚ÄìWard functional fulfills a set of conservation laws. Approximations that are equivalent to such a truncation are therefore called conserving or \\\\Phi-derivable. Some examples: * The (fully self- consistent) GW approximation is equivalent to truncating \\\\Phi to so-called ring diagrams: \\\\Phi[G]\\\\approx GUG + GUGGUG + \\\\ldots (A ring diagram consists of polarisation bubbles connected by interaction lines). * Dynamical mean field theory is equivalent to taking only purely local diagrams into account: \\\\Phi[G_{ij},U_{ijkl}]\\\\approx \\\\Phi[G_{ii}, U_{iiii}], where i,j,k,l are lattice site indices.

Kodituwakku was born on 7 January 1941, the son of Benjamin and Brenda de Silva Kodituwakku. He received his primary school education at S. Thomas' College, Bandarawela, before attending St. Thomas' College, Matale. He also studied at St. Joseph's College, Colombo. He graduated from University of Peradeniya before proceeding to V O C College, Tuticorin Madras University to obtain his Bachelor of Commerce degree in April 1964 . Kodituwakku joined the police force as a probationary Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) on 1 November 1966. He served in Nugegoda, Anuradhapura, Colombo, Trincomalee, Chilaw, Negombo and Kalutara and as Assistant Director, Police Training College, Polonnaruwa, Kilinochchi and Kelaniya and at the Prime Minister's Security Division. On 1 January 1981 he was promoted to Senior Superintendent of Police but was subsequently forced to leave the service for political reasons in 1984. Following his resignation he worked as a security consultant. In 1994 he re- joined the service and on 1 October 1997 was promoted to Deputy Inspector General and Senior DIG on 2 August 1998. He was a Senior Deputy Inspector General (SDIG) Range One before he was appointed as the Inspector General of Police on 1 September 1998, succeeding Wickremasinghe Rajaguru following his retirement on 31 August 1998. Kodituwakku's appointment was controversial, in that he was selected over five other SDIGs, with greater seniority and higher qualifications. His selection, it is alleged, was influenced by the ruling People's Alliance party. Kodituwakku, whilst he was the Inspector General, initiated a programme to provide training to all police personnel on law, public relations and protection of human rights. He also established the Colombo Crime Division. When he turned sixty Kodituwakku lodged his retirement papers however President Chandrika Kumaratunga urged him to extend his service for an additional year, which he did. Kodituwakku died on 27 August 2002 at his official residence in Colombo. He is the only IGP to have died while in office and was due to retire on 15 September. He was married to Lakshmi Sushila Naomi n√©e de Alwis and they had one son, Ranmal, who also served in the police force as an Assistant Superintendent of Police. A week after his funeral thieves dug up his grave at the General Cemetery in Borella and stole his coffin.

The story was originally intended to be a part of a much longer series but after the follow-up series proposal was ignored by Marvel, Morrison incorporated much of the psychedelic super-spy material into his Vertigo title The Filth. It was Morrison's only solo Marvel Knights story.  Publication history  The story was first published in 2002 under the Marvel Knights imprint. It was then reprinted in Marvel Crossover #33 and again in 2011 in Fantastic Four: 1234.Fantastic Four: 1234 on the Grand Comics Database!Nick's World ... on the Grand Comics Database! In Italy, the story has been published in Spider-Man #388.  Plot  The story begins with Nick Fury and a female agent talking about his car needing a new tire. The page gets cut and a new figure is introduced, a man in a strange get up who explains who Nick Fury is and reveals that the scene is just a training exercise with a young spy named Chris Kong who is strapped into a machine which makes him experience moments out of Fury's life in an attempt to mimic him perfectly so that he can infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. and replace Fury. It is also revealed that the man is in the company of some alien-like creatures. The man tells Kong that it is not enough that he is a master of disguise but that he must truly become like Fury, think, act and feel like him since S.H.I.E.L.D. has telepaths superior to those they work with. The man also reveals that Kong has failed every mission so far in rather embarrassing ways, he lost at the roulette table, accidentally killed a cat instead of its megalomaniac owner and failed the most recent one which they just attempted. Kong tells the man that he seems to make small mistakes that lead to total disaster. The man then tells him that he clearly lacks some quality that Fury possesses, Kong agrees and says that he must begin his physical transformation into Fury and complies with having one of his eyes amputated. The man states that, now that Kong is wearing Fury's trademark eye-patch, maybe now he will bring more of his fire to the simulation. Kong answers that he feels a lot more like Fury and tells them to run the machine again. The page cuts back to the scene with the car, where suddenly a man in a parachute lands on Kong and the woman and they are dragged into the road, where they are run over by several cyclists. An upset Kong exclaims that this cannot be happening since he is Nick Fury and that would not ever happen to him. The man reappears and tells Kong that he is far from being Nick Fury and that he has failed yet again. The story ends with the reveal that Kong's superior is actually Nick Fury himself and some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents disassembling the set on which the story has taken place.  Reception  The story has been described as a cross and double-cross, Steranko-esque spy surrealness, and \\"James Bond meets cosmic 70's Kirby\\" story. Comic Book Resources called the story the 9th greatest Nick Fury story ever. They stated that the story \\"Both examines how difficult it is to be Nick Fury while also showing the bizarre lengths Nick Fury will go to protect his place in the world.\\" Brian Cronin has also stated that the story was a strong look at a theme Morrison later explored in the pages of Final Crisis ‚Äì the notion that there are certain people (here Nick Fury; in Final Crisis Batman) that you just cannot duplicate, because they are truly unique individuals. \\"It's an interesting (and humorous) ode to the coolness of Nick Fury.

It was recorded in 1962 at the studios of KZSU, a radio station at Stanford University. It was released by ATO Records on November 11, 2016. The Hart Valley Drifters were part of the American folk music revival of the 1960s. The band included Jerry Garcia (who three years later would co-found the rock band the Grateful Dead), Robert Hunter (who would write the lyrics to many Grateful Dead songs), and David Nelson (who, with John Dawson and Garcia, would co-found the country rock band the New Riders of the Purple Sage). Critical reception In American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz wrote, \\"The songs are mostly bluegrass standards from the catalogs of Ralph Stanley, Earl Scruggs and others played with youthful enthusiasm from the quintet. Garcia‚Äôs talent on banjo is displayed on \\"Roving Gambler\\", \\"Think of What You've Done\\", a caffeinated \\"Cripple Creek\\" and \\"Run Mountain\\", among others. He also takes lead vocals on most selections and while his signature approach was a ways off, he acquits himself admirably. There‚Äôs plenty of energy on display and the audio has held up remarkably well, especially considering the primitive college studio conditions it was recorded under.\\" In Relix, Jeff Tamarkin wrote, \\"Historical value aside, it's an exciting collection ‚Äî Garcia was already a remarkably facile player and nuanced vocalist. His lead vocal on \\"Pig in a Pen\\", a trad number that would become a staple of his short-lived bluegrass side-project Old and in the Way a decade-plus later, contained all of the warmth and command he would fine-tune with more experience. And the picking, too, is superb: \\"Cripple Creek\\", an instrumental breakdown, barely lasts a minute and a half, but both Garcia's banjo and the guitar-playing are equal to that of any major folk festival habitu√©s of the time.\\" On NPR, Felix Contreras said, \\"What you hear on Folk Time, besides pretty decent banjo playing, is the beginning of Garcia's quest to explore every aspect of what makes American music so rich.... [W]hat Garcia was really after ‚Äî as a musical explorer in the Dead and other projects ‚Äî was a seamless integration of this music, along with blues and jazz and folk, with just the right amount of psychedelic inspiration. With the rest of his Grateful Dead bandmates, he did exactly that ‚Äî and that makes these songs the roots of a cultural phenomenon that recently celebrated 50 enlightening years of redefining improvised music.\\" On Pitchfork, Jesse Jarnow wrote, \\"Picking up the banjo after being discharged from the Army in 1960, Garcia immersed himself in folk music for a half-decade, practicing obsessively, working as a music teacher, and playing in a series of bands around the Palo Alto area, including the Thunder Mountain Tub Thumpers, the Black Mountain Boys, and others. Like many other central '60s musicians who would eventually plug in and freak out, Garcia came of musical age during the great folk scare, finding post-War solace in ancient (and ancient-seeming) songs. Only a few years from dashing headlong into the neon-pulsing present tense of LSD, Garcia and others first dove deep into a mythic past that seemed to come alive in the grooves of old records and zoetrope-like flicker between banjo rolls.\\" On jambands.com, Kristopher Weiss said, \\"Keeping in mind that this set was never intended as anything other than a one-off college radio broadcast and certainly never envisioned as a commercial release ‚Äî particularly 54 years after the fact ‚Äî Folk Time is remarkably solid. And given that it provides Deadheads a chance to hear Garcia as he's never been heard before and regular music lovers a glimpse of the Grateful Dead's roots, it stands as a critically important missing link to the vaunted San Francisco sound, folk, bluegrass and the catchall known as Americana.\\" On Grateful Web, Dylan Muhlberg said, \\"In 1962, Garcia wasn't the prodigious artist he would blossom into just yet. He was a folkie, obsessed with getting out and picking guitar and banjo while refining his amicable tenor vocals.... The 54-year-old recording has been vividly restored, entirely blemish free.... Before Bob Dylan had blown up, before John Hartford and Sam Bush created newgrass music, before the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band bridged rock and bluegrass, there was the Hart Valley Drifters. They aspired to play like their favorite pickers of the 1940s and 1950s.\\" Track listing #Band introductions ‚Äì 1:13 #\\"Roving Gambler\\" (traditional) ‚Äì 3:46 #\\"Ground Speed\\" (Earl Scruggs) ‚Äì 1:29 #\\"Pig in a Pen\\" (Fiddlin' Arthur Smith, arranged by Jerry Garcia) ‚Äì 2:16 #\\"Standing in the Need of Prayer\\" (traditional) ‚Äì 2:10 #\\"Flint Hill Special\\" (Earl Scruggs) ‚Äì 2:00 #\\"Nine Pound Hammer\\" (traditional) ‚Äì 2:42 #\\"Handsome Molly\\" (G.

Georgia implements policies to alleviate the said environmental problems.  Major issues = Land and forest degradation  The Georgian Ministry of Environment Protection and Natural Resources Protection rates 35% of its agricultural land as being degraded and, as per the Ministry of Agriculture, 60% of agrarian land in Georgia is of low or middle production quality. Significant drivers of land degradation are overgrazing, unplanned urban sprawling, and deforestation. Soil erosion processes, although considered natural phenomena, are exacerbated by different kinds of unsustainable human activities. Some of these are unsustainable mining and construction (e.g. hydropower infrastructures like Shuakhevi Hydro Power Plant), uncontrolled logging, poorly regulated urbanization, industrial activities in riverbeds, and a lack of compliance with land use regulations and with environmental and hydrological standards. Due to the deterioration of land and the overlooked issues regarding the environment, flood control and determent of such periodical calamities caused by landslides and flash floods are imminent.  Air pollution  Deterioration of air quality is one of the many consequences of increased economic activity that comes with urbanization. In the case of Georgia, air pollution mainly comes from the transportation, industrial, and energy sectors. The major ambient air pollutants monitored in Georgia include particulate matter (total suspended particulates [TSP]), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO2, NO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). In Georgia the public transport system is not sufficiently developed (see Category:Public transport in Georgia). A significant proportion of the population uses private vehicles as the preferred mode of transport. The number of private vehicles has grown rapidly over the past decade and has almost doubled in the last five-year period. Traffic has increased followed by industrial sources. The country has seen a sharp rise in the number of old, dirty diesel vehicles on the road over the last decade and pollution testing is virtually non-existent. WHO and IEA provides a data that shows Georgia having the most deaths attributed to air pollution, compared to other countries. Until 2000, Georgia used leaded fuel in most of their transportation system. Soviet auto models can run on low octane gasoline; European models run superior around higher-octane gas. A way to increase a fuel's octane level is to add lead. Majority of road vehicles (total number of vehicles approx. 323614) in Georgia today both public and private is of 15‚Äì20 years old. Many older cars require leaded petrol because the lead lubricates and protects the soft valves. Georgia is importing increasing numbers of 2nd hand European cars with catalytic converters and it imports a lot of low octane gas, which is at times manipulated through the addition of lead, to obtain higher octane/leaded gasoline. This in turn affects the composition of exhaust emissions, making its concentrations high in lead and benzene concentrations. August 14, 2018  Water resources and pollution  Georgia has plentiful water assets. Among the aggregate water assets of /year (long haul normal) just 1.6 billion m3/year or around 2% are being preoccupied.https://www.worldometers.info/water/georgia-water/ Around 66% of the disconnected water is utilized for inundated horticulture, and the other third for city and mechanical employments. Significant issues that lead to water pollution are surface water contamination by squanders and unreasonable water utilization. Water contamination is associated with human movement, such as industrial waste, municipal waste, waste from health centers, and surfaces waste from agri-production. Waste management problems are a big contributor to pollution in the country of Georgia. For instance, according to the Minister of Environment Protection of Georgia, George Kachidze, high levels of ammonia and BOD3 are reported for most of the observed rivers and concentrations of heavy metals exceed permissible levels at certain locals on particular rivers. Areas along Georgia, around 310 kilometers of coastline, are starting to feel the effects of conduit waste water that is beginning from the development of more than 170 million people who live adjacent the various streams that energize the Black Sea. Black Sea Coast of Georgia = Black Sea = Located in the West of Georgia is the Black Sea. Zones along Georgia's just about 310 kilometers of coastline are beginning to feel the impacts of waterway waste water that is starting from the movement of more than 170 million individuals who live nearby the numerous streams that encourage the Black Sea. This could result in loss in biological species, extinction, and negative impacts on human health. In Georgia, similar to the case in numerous nations, low public mindfulness and comprehension of the effect that anthropogenic exercises have on the earth has been a center driver of its commitment to the contaminated waters of the Black Sea.  Waste management  The effect of waste and chemical clutter led to one of the most prominent environmental problems in Georgia. Environmental pollution caused by littering of hazardous wastes and landfill abuse puts the country into habitual danger. Moreover, accumulated litter and disorderly management of trash aggravate the current situation of their domain. There are 63 registered landfills, which occupy more than 300 ha of which 203 ha are active landfills (MENRP 2012). Most of these landfill sites operate without proper measure, supervision by the government, and proper integration of waste collection system. Currently, the standardized collection of household wastes is only executed in big cities and district centers, disregarding garbage collection in other places, which further impairs the waste management issue of their country. In some settlements, particularly in villages, residents tend to solve their waste problems by dumping wastes in nearby ravines, along the roads or onto riverbanks. Georgia's waste management problem results in different kinds of pollution and negatively affects the public's health. According to National Center for Disease Control, morbidity per 100,000 population from respiratory diseases has been on the rise.  Effects = Biodiversity loss  Georgia represents 1of 34 biodiversity hotspots identified by Conservation International as areas distinguished for having high levels of endemism whilst also being seriously threatened by habitat loss. The Caucasus eco-region, where Georgia is part of, is identified as having global significance by WWF due also to high levels of diversity and of specific evolutional processes and unique historical floral and faunal development. Numerous plant and creature species in Georgia are debilitated, including 29 mammals, 35 bird, 11 reptile, 2 amphibians, 14 fish and 56 woody plant species according to IUCN Red List of Georgian Endangered Species. An example is the extinction of the Goitered gazelle and the southern populace of wild goat. The panther, striped hyena, and red deer now exist just as detached populaces in protected area. Since the 1990s, the East Caucasian Tur populace has diminished by 20% and the West Caucasian populace by 50% and the quantity of sturgeon species operating at a profit Sea has diminished no less than 37%. The main threats for the biodiversity of Georgia are the degradation and loss of habitats and unsustainable use of biological resources, which are also the impacts of the various environmental issues discussed above. The United Nations Convention specifies that the principal causes of species habitat loss and degradation would be timber logging, water pollution, and intensive grazing.  Climate change  Agriculture is of central importance to Georgia, accounting for a large portion of employment, rural growth and livelihood, food security, and exports. However, the sector is highly sensitive to adverse changes in climate-related conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and frequency of extreme events (e.g. droughts, floods, storms) According to Sophiko Akhobadze, Deputy Executive Director of Rec Caucasus, a nongovernmental organization and one of the largest environmental groups in the Caucasus, the number of floods in Georgia has doubled during the last 10 years, and drought is continuing to increase. Furthermore, trends reported in the Second National Communication of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change show that average temperatures in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, increased by 0.7 ¬∞C over the past century and by 0.5 ¬∞C in Eastern Georgia, but that there was a slight cooling in Western Georgia. Precipitation has increased in the lowland areas of Georgia by about 10‚Äì15 percent and has decreased in mountain areas by 15‚Äì20%.  Policy and institutions = Ministry of Environment and Natural Resource Protection (MENRP)  MENRP is the main environmental policy maker in Georgia that manages and oversees ecological administration capacities. The service goes about as an advocate in the ecological enactment handle. The most difficult managerial elements of MENRP incorporate environmental permitting and supervision. * National Environment Agency (NEA) was set up in June 2008 and is responsible for issuing licenses for natural resource use, excluding licenses for oil extractions and exploitation. NEA is independent from the public governance bodies, which implements its activities independently, but is subject to control from the state * National Forestry Agency is authorized to oversee nearly two million hectares of forest and woodland in the country. The main objectives of the agency are to look after the forest and carry out reforestation activities, and utilize segments of biological diversity on the territory of the Georgian Forest Fund sustainably and economically.  National Environmental Action Plan 2 (NEAP 2)  Adopted in January 2012 by the Government of Georgia and Bruhland, this action plan sets long-term goals and short term targets that provides and implements respective activities to target environmental issues in the country. It focuses on eleven themes namely climate change, waste and chemical substances, nuclear radiation safety, natural and man-made disasters, water resources, air, biodiversity, land resources, forestry, mineral resources, and Black Sea.

It was released on May 12, 2014, under YMC Entertainment and distributed by KT Music. The record is the first release following the completion of his military service. Following a series of photo and video teasers, The Best Man and the lead single \\"Night and Day\\" were simultaneously released; the mini-album debuted and peaked at number four on the Gaon Album Chart. Wheesung promoted the record on music chart programs across television networks by performing the single, which earned him one music show win on MBC Music's Show Champion. Background Wheesung was subject to conscription in South Korea and enlisted for military service on November 7, 2011. As 2012 came to a close, it was reported that he became subject to an investigation for abusing propofol. The Chuncheon District Prosecutor\`s Office denied summoning Wheesung to investigate any substance abuse. Shortly before completing his service, Wheesung was hospitalized after sustaining spinal disc herniation and developing alopecia areata. In midst of his stay, he utilized his mobile phone without permission; he spent three days in military prison for breaching regulations. He completed his service and discharged on August 9, 2013. Music structure Musically, The Best Man is an R&B; record. It opens with \\"Best Man\\", a \\"rhythmical\\" track where he sings his desires as a man as opposed to a singer. \\"I Like the Song\\" begins with the tune of a \\"tranquil\\" piano. \\"Night and Day\\" is an R&B; and pop song accompanied by an electric guitar. \\"Lying Beside You\\" describes the \\"fluttering\\" feeling of loving a woman. Previously released two years prior, \\"A Masterpiece Called You\\" was remastered for inclusion on the mini-album; Wheesung creates a \\"romantic atmosphere\\" and utilizes a figure of speech to describe the \\"masterpiece\\" of loving a person. A breakup song, \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" details the feeling of loneliness. \\"I Need to Make Money\\" is a slow-tempo track where Wheesung reveals his concern of earning profit as a musician. Release and promotion On March 31, 2014, it was revealed that Wheesung was scheduled to release a mini-album in May. The release date announced was May 12, two years and five months since They Are Coming (2011). It was unclear if Wheesung would pursue a promotional cycle for The Best Man in light of the sinking of MV Sewol the previous month. A \\"night version\\" photo teaser for The Best Man was revealed on May 8. A \\"day version\\" was posted on the following day. The music video teaser for \\"Night and Day\\", which features cameos by Yura of Girl's Day and C.A.P of Teen Top, was uploaded on the next day. The mini- album and the music video for the lead single were simultaneously released on May 12. Wheesung began promoting \\"Night and Day\\" by performing the song on weekly music chart shows upon release. He first performed on MBC Music's Show Champion, the program's first episode to resume regular broadcasting following the Sewol incident. He followed up with a performance on Seoul Broadcasting System's (SBS) Inkigayo. The following week, Wheesung ranked first on Show Champion, which earned the single its first and only music show win. He continued performing the following days on Mnet's M Countdown and Arirang's Simply K-Pop. Critical reception Writing for online magazine IZM, Kim Ban- ya rated The Best Man three and a half stars out of five, complimenting \\"Night and Day\\" for its \\"grandeur\\" and \\"dramatic\\" rise in scale. Also rating the mini-album three stars out of five, Oh Lee of Rhythmer felt that Wheesung accomplished to \\"upgrade\\" himself, describing the album as a reflection of the singer due to the \\"personal sensitivity\\" of the lyrics. Jung Hae-wook of News Tomtato gave the musicality of the record a full five stars, while awarding it three for its appeal and experimentation. He named \\"I Need to Make Money\\" the best track on the record aside from the lead single. Commercial performance On the chart dated May 11‚Äì17, 2014, The Best Man debuted at number four on the Gaon Album Chart. By the end of the month, the mini-album sold 6,102 copies in South Korea.

A statement in the ninth article of the treaty prohibits the assessment of property tax on native lands until they are sold to non-native owners. Said article states: > The parties to this compact mutually agree to solicit the influence of the > Government of the United States to protect such of the lands of the Seneca > Indians, within the State of New York, as may from time to time remain in > their possession from all taxes, and assessments for roads, highways, or any > other purpose until such lands shall be sold and conveyed by the said > Indians, and the possession thereof shall have been relinquished by them. Two results have arisen from this treaty. The first is that the Seneca nation has refused to sell any land to non-Indians within its territory. One side effect of this is that the city of Salamanca, which is mostly on the Allegany Reservation but occupied by a large number of non-native residents, operates on a lease system in which any non-native property holder must sign a lease with the nation acknowledging the tribe's ownership of the land and, since the 1990s, also any improvements built upon that land. The second is that the Seneca Nation asserts that this treaty clause is not limited to taxes on land (property taxes), but to any and all taxes, including excise tax and sales tax, from any activity on the reservations; this interpretation forms the basis of the Senecas' convenience store industry, which has a built-in price advantage over non-native competitors due to the tribe's assertion that they do not have to pay excise tax. (The Senecas do not extend these advantages to non-native businesses or residents; any non-native leasing space on the reservation must still pay excise, sales and property tax to state, county, city and school authorities.)

It opened on May 2, 1911, and closed on October 30, 1973. Early history Firland was established in what is now the city of Shoreline, Washington under the original name of Henry Sanatorium. Horace Henry, a railroad magnate, was one of the leading founders of Firland. He donated 34 acres of land and $25,000 to build the sanatorium. In the spring of 1910, Seattle residents voted in favor of a $10,000 bond to aid in construction. A larger bond supporting the institute passed in 1912.McCredie, Scott. When Firland Was Operating At Peak Capacity, Tb Was A Major Killer Of American Adults. Patients Clung To The Hope That They Could Get Into A Sanitarium. But The Treatment Included ... Days Of Isolation, The Seattle Times, March 21, 1999, http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990321&slug;=2950573 When Firland opened, patients initially slept in open-air cottages. Three more buildings were added in 1913; the main administration offices operated in the Walter H. Henry Memorial Building, the Detweiler Building housed tubercular patients, and non-tubercular patients with other infectious diseases were housed in Jenner Hall. In 1920, the Koch and Nightingale buildings were erected to treat ambulant patients. In 1925, Josef House was added to treat children with tuberculosis or family members with tuberculosis. The medical director of Firland was Dr. Robert M. Stith from its inception until his death in 1943. He also directed a free public health clinic in downtown Seattle and was the authority on who was admitted to Firland. Those that could afford it were urged to admit themselves to private sanatoriums, like Laurel Beach or Riverton. To be admitted to Firland, patients had to have lived in Seattle for at least one year, and their chance at recovery needed to be reasonable. These criteria were enforced in order to rule out transients. Women with children were often prioritized over single individuals or those without children. If no one could care for the children at home, they were taken to Josef House for treatment or preventative care. The cost of care was paid for by the State of Washington and the Seattle Department of Health. 80% of Seattle's tuberculosis patients were cared for at home, not in sanatoriums. Nurses from the Health Department made house visits to care for these patients. Firland was self- sustaining, due to its own well, power plant, orchards and vegetable gardens on campus. It operated in its Shoreline location from 1911 until 1947, when it was relocated to a decommissioned Naval hospital at 15th Avenue Northeast and 150th Street in Seattle. The original Shoreline location is now occupied by the headquarters of Crista Ministries.  Treatment process = Rest and behavioral treatment  First and foremost, Firland prescribed rest for its tuberculosis patients. \\"Rest -- more rest -- and still more rest. Rest is the keynote. Rest for the body, rest for the mind. Rest from involuntary as well as voluntary activity forms the basis on which the cure is built\\". Character and willpower were emphasized in the recovery process. Upon admission to Firland, all patients entered the bedrest hospital. Patients were not permitted to read, write, speak, or cough. Coughing was prohibited because it was feared that it would start a coughing frenzy among other patients. Coughing was only permitted to produce a sputum sample for testing. Because fresh air was considered to be key in the treatment of tuberculosis, windows were kept open all year long. In addition to fresh air, nourishment was also extremely important, and hearty meals were provided for all patients.  Surgical intervention  Surgical intervention was used in some cases of tuberculosis. An artificial pneumothorax involved pumping air into the space between the lung and the ribcage. Thoracoplasty was prescribed for some patients; the removal of ribs so that the chest wall would compress around the lung. the ultimate goal of artificial pneumothorax and thoracoplasty was to render the lungs as still as possible.  Occupational therapy  Firland Sanatorium and Hog Farm, 1934 After a patient had completed their stay in the bed rest hospital, they were allowed \\"time up\\". Patients were able to get out of bed and assume a job in the hospital. In addition to giving them vocational training, this allowed Firland's doctors to observe the patients and monitor their recovery. The maximum time patients were allowed to be up was 8 hours. After this, they were expected to spend the other 16 hours of the day resting. Occupational therapy positions at Firland included delivering mail, tending the library, pushing wheelchairs, or cooking food in the dining hall. Patients also staffed the woodshop, print shop, domestic arts center, machine shop, beauty parlor, vegetable gardens, farm (raising eggs, poultry, and pork) and volunteer fire department, all on Firland's grounds. Patients at Firland also produced a magazine called Grit and Grin. According to HistoryLink, \\"its purpose was to educate and inform patients and to boost morale\\". The magazine listed birthdays, admissions, and discharges, as well as jokes and literary pieces.  Notable patients  Notable patients of Firland Sanatorium include: * Betty MacDonald * Hazel Wolf * Charlie France * William Cumming * Beatrice Roethke * Monica Sone Final years Firland's nursing staff dwindled to 1/3 of its previous size during World War II, as nurses left to help war efforts. The case finding program was eliminated due to a lack of funds and available staff. The occupational therapy program grew to include scale-model aircraft production, to be used as teaching tools for enemy planes. Other patients knit clothing for soldiers. In 1943 King County took over Firland's operations and, in 1947, moved the hospital to its new campus in a decommissioned Naval Hospital at 15th Avenue NE and 150th Street in Seattle. The number of beds increased to a total of 1350, allowing every person on the waitlist to be admitted at once. Three new antibiotic drugs were introduced to the cure for tuberculosis in 1947: Streptomycin, Para-amino Salicylic Acid, and isoniazid. Tuberculosis was quick to become antibiotic-resistant, so rest and nutrition remained on the treatment plan. The average stay at Firland had been cut in half by 1954, and mortality rates dropped from 31% in 1948 to 6% in 1954. National officials called Firland \\"one of the most outstanding sanatoria in the country\\". Patients at Firland began to behave with less docility than in the past due to the high recovery rates and changing social expectations after World War II. Ward rules were relaxed, such as the extreme separation of sexes. Patient needs were addressed by newly hired social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Total cure for tuberculosis was in sight, and doctors moved forward with eradicating the disease by identifying and treating every single case of tuberculosis, whether the patients liked it or not. In the 1950s, the presence of tuberculosis in alcoholics was especially problematic for the total eradication of the disease. Firland formed its own chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1950; however, alcoholic patients were forcibly isolated so that they did not leave the hospital before they were cured. Alcoholics were kept in Ward Six. It had windows with heavy screens and locked doors. There were concrete slabs with thin mattresses for beds, and were referred to as cells instead of rooms. By the mid-1950s, 10% of Firland's patients had been involuntarily detained, though Ward Six was used sparingly when it was first opened. Alcoholics were made to stay at Firland for one year, even if their sputum culture was negative. There was no formal process to ensure an alcoholic patient stayed in the sanatorium, though it fell in line with the Health Department's quarantine regulations. They had not previously been enforced due to a lack of available beds. Patients classified as \\"difficult\\" were also put in Ward Six to maintain order and punish those who broke rules. By 1957, Firland was investigated by the Washington chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1965, monthly hearings were held by District Court Judge Robert M. Elston to identify and address the needs of patients confined to Ward Six. When Washington state took over financial responsibility for Firland in 1971, one third of Firland patients were being forcibly quarantined. Firland's final day in operation was October 30, 1973. The tuberculosis epidemic in Washington state was winding down, and Firland patients were consolidated with Mountain View Hospital patients in Tacoma. Tuberculosis began to be treated with outpatient procedures instead of total relegation to a ward.

Together with the battles of Tampere and Vyborg, it was one of the three major urban battles of the Finnish Civil War. The Germans invaded Helsinki despite the opposition of Finnish White Army leader Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim who wanted to attack the capital city with his own troops after Tampere had fallen on 6 April. However, the Germans had their own interest in taking Helsinki as quickly as possible and then moving further east towards the Russian border. The city had been under Red control for 11 weeks since the beginning of the war. The German Baltic Sea Division landed in Finland on 3 April and entered the Helsinki area eight days later. In the city centre, the defending Reds did not have defensive lines or barricades but were fighting inside single buildings and blocks, which the Germans then had to take one by one. During the battle, life in Helsinki went on as usual. The shops and restaurants were open, the public transportation functioned and factories were running. Curious spectators were wandering so close that the Germans had to tell them to move back. The White supporters considered the Germans liberators and handed them flowers as well as tea, coffee and snacks to eat. Nearly 500 people were killed in the battle. The number includes about 400 Red Guard fighters who were killed in action or executed after capitulation, 54 Germans and 23 White Guard members. The number of executed Reds is unclear, but the it is estimated between 20 and 50. After the battle, from 4,000 to 6,000 Red Guard members or supporters were arrested.  The units  The 10,000-men-strong Baltic Sea Division attacked Helsinki with 6,000 men including two infantry regiments, one j√§ger battalion, an artillery battery and some supportive troops. The Imperial German Navy landed 400 Seebataillon marines to the Katajanokka district, where they entered the downtown and joined the Baltic Division. The Germans were supported by 2,000 Helsinki White Guard members, who had been active underground during the Red control of the city. However, the Whites did not have any important role as they joined the battle in its late stage. The Red Guard units defending Helsinki were mainly composed of inexperienced reserves. At the time, the main combat forces of the Helsinki Red Guard were fighting on the Tavastia Front. They were led by the bricklayer Edvard Nyqvist, who had served as the city's militia chief, and the industrial worker Fredrik Edvard Johansson because the Red Guard general staff, as well as the Red Government, had left Helsinki on 8 April and fled to the city of Vyborg in Eastern Finland. There were still some Red supporting Russian troops in town, but under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed between the Soviet Russia and the Central Powers, they did not take part in the battle.  Battle outside Helsinki  The Baltic Sea Division landed at Hanko, 120 kilometres west of Helsinki, on 3 April and started marching east. The first battle between German troops and the Finnish Reds was fought three days later in the town of Karis. The Germans lost nine men but took over this important railway junction, then closing Helsinki by the Coastal Railway and the Turku‚ÄìHelsinki highway. After minor skirmishes in Lohja and Kirkkonummi, the Germans finally entered foregrounds of the Krepost Sveaborg, a Russian-built system of fortifications around Helsinki, in the Lepp√§vaara village of Espoo, 10 kilometres west of Helsinki. The Battle of Lepp√§vaara was fought on 11 April. The Germans attacked the Red defensive posts, and managed to force them to flee. Red Guard's losses were 13 men while the Germans had only two men killed in action. As the Reds retreated, the Germans had an open road towards the suburbs of Helsinki. On the next morning, general R√ºdiger von der Goltz ordered a group of 500 men to attack Tikkurila, 16 kilometres north of Helsinki, in order to cut the Helsinki‚ÄìRiihim√§ki railway and close the way out of the city. The Germans fought against local Red Guard members who defended from their own houses and yards with some support of an armoured train. The Baltic Sea Division finally took the Tikkurila railway station at 5 PM and soon entered the Malmi railway station, 3 kilometres south of Tikkurila. The poorly equipped Reds had at least 25 men killed in Tikkurila, according to some sources even 100, but the Germans lost only two.  Attack to the city = Battle in the suburbs  The Baltic Sea Division entered the northern suburbs of Pikku Huopalahti and Meilahti in the early morning of 12 April. Troops marched towards the downtown via the Turku Highway, which today is known as Mannerheimintie, the main street of Helsinki. The first clashes were fought around 6 AM in the rocky hills of Tilkka, which the Germans took three hours later. The next defensive line was only a half kilometre ahead. As the Germans broke through the second line around 10 AM, the Reds attacked their left flank from the Pasila area. After two hours of fighting, the Germans pushed the Reds back and took the Pasila railway station, located three kilometres north of the Helsinki railway station. Now they were finally able to enter the city.  Battle in the city  A Red fighter waving a white flag At 1.30 PM the Germans reached the T√∂√∂l√∂ district. As the Reds managed to stop the invading troops, the German Colonel Hans von Tschirschky und B√∂gendorff formed two units. One unit continued the attack along the Mannerheimintie as the other one evaded through the Hietalahti district to the southern parts of the city. At the same time, a third squad was entering the city from Pasila along the railway. By the National Museum the Germans were hit by heavy fire around 4 PM. The shooting came from the Turku Garrison, which was located near the present-day Lasipalatsi building. Germans now had to evade the Turku Garrison from west along the street Fredrikinkatu of the Kamppi district. The garrison was later taken over by setting the building on fire. At 5.30 PM the Germans reached the Erottaja square where they took the Swedish Theatre by using capitulated Reds as human shields. Another known case where the Germans used human shield was later in the same evening as they marched over the Pitk√§silta bridge behind 300 capitulated Reds. According to a German officer, interviewed by a Finnish journalist, they had learnt the method from the British. At this time, there was also hard fighting at the Helsinki Railway Station as well as in the nearby Kluuvi district. A squad of German Navy Marines landed Katajanokka at 7 PM and soon entered the Kruununhaka district. On the next morning the Germans attacked the Red Guard headquarters at the Smolna building in Kaartinkaupunki area. The 400‚Äì500 Reds of the Smolna finally capitulated at 7 AM. The last fighting Reds were now at the northern worker districts of Kallio and Hakaniemi, where heavy artillery fire was aimed. Among other buildings, the Workers' House was hit and damaged severely. Finally at 2 PM, a white flag was raised on the tower of the Kallio Church and the battle was over.  After the conquest  After losing Helsinki, the Red Defense Command moved to Riihim√§ki (which also involved the Battle of Hyvink√§√§), where it was headed by painter and congressman Efraim Kronqvist. The Germans troops, on the other hand, attacked Helsinki north on April 15 and conquered Klaukkala four days later, continuing from there to H√§meenlinna. At the same time in Loviisa, the German Detachment Brandenstein proceeded from Eastern Uusimaa to Lahti where the Reds fled from the Helsinki region also ended up. Helsinki remained under German influence until the fall of Emperor William II and the end of the First World War. R√ºdiger von der Goltz was the official representative of the country in Finland, initially staying at Hotel K√§mp and then at Kes√§ranta.  Aftermath and commemoration  Captured Reds After the battle, 4,000‚Äì6,000 Red Guard supporters were arrested and transferred to the Helsinki Prison Camp in the Suomenlinna islands. Over the course of the battle, more than 10,000 Reds and their families fled the Helsinki area. Most of them were captured during the aftermath of the Battle of Lahti as tens of thousands of Red refugees fell into the hands of Germans and Whites. Contrary to the fate that befell the cities of Tampere and Vyborg, there were not mass executions in Helsinki. That was most likely because of the Germans who prevented Whites from killing their prisoners. However, in the summer of 1918, more than 1,400 Red prisoners died at the Helsinki Prison Camp as a result of executions, hunger and disease. The German commander, R√ºdiger von der Goltz, decided to have a victory parade on Sunday 14 April, a day after the battle was over. It was held at the Senate Square, where von der Goltz was hailed by the mayor Johannes von Haartman and the governor Bruno Jalander. During the parade, there was still some shooting around the city by single Red Guard gunmen. The German fleet was also fired upon by various Russian ships. Even the Admiral Hugo Meurer's boat had to turn back and, as a result, was unable to participate in the parade. The Germans and Finnish Whites who were killed in action were buried in the graveyard of the Helsinki Old Church. The German memorial was designed by the Finnish sculptors Gunnar Finne and J. S. Sir√©n and the White memorial by Elias Ilkka and Erik Bryggman. The Reds were laid to rest in the Malmi graveyard. Their memorial was placed in the El√§intarha park, but it was not unveiled until 1970. The monument is a work of the sculptor Taisto Martiskainen and includes verses of the poets Maiju Lassila, Elmer Diktonius and Elvi Sinervo  References  Helsinki Helsinki Helsinki Category:1910s in Helsinki Category:1918 in Finland Category:Conflicts in 1918 Category:April 1918 events Helsinki ","title":"Battle of Helsinki"},{"id":"52219619","text":"Penda is a feminine given name of Senegalese origin.

His name means \\"He who Created Himself,\\" or \\"Transformer.\\" He is attributed with the creation of Lake Champlain, Tuxis Island and Pond, Rock Dunder, and Samson Rock, among other landforms, including mountains and rivers. The legend states that he grew his arms and head from his body, but his legs grew slowly. He passed the time by forming valleys, meadows, and hills. After carving out and flooding Champlain, then known as Bitawb√°gw, Petoubouque or Petonbowk, meaning 'lake in between,' he followed a flock of migrating geese south along a glacier. He arrived in Madison, Connecticut, where he took a handful of earth and flung it to sea. The piece that landed in Long Island Sound became Tuxis Island, and another piece that fell out of his hand became Samson Rock. The hole, Tuxis Pond, was filled in the resulting splash. Odziozo then turned, stepping on the rock (It is assumed his legs were grown in by then), and went back to Vermont to get to his home, Rock Dunder, where, exhausted, he turned himself into a stone, so as to be permanently with his favorite creation. Odziozo is often said to have lived before animals evolved legs, and, as such, many of the landforms he created were caused by the dragging of his body by his long arms. Rock Dunder, in Shelburne, Vermont, is supposedly where his spirit and body are kept. The Madison section of the story is most likely a more recent legend. Odziozo has a boat race named after him in Lake Champlain. At least one expert thinks that the glacier mentioned in the legend was added in the 17th century. Name variants Odziozo has several name variants, including Wo-ja-ho-sen, Odzihozo, Odzih√≥zo, Bemee- geedzin-pobi-zeed, Odzeez, Odzihodo, and Ojihozo. He is often confused with Glooscap.

The premise, as in The Play That Goes Wrong, is that the actors and crews are members of the fictitious Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society presenting their production of the J.M. Barrie classic 1904 play Peter Pan, and ruin it through amateurism and personal rivalries.  Production history  The play made its premiere at the Pleasance Theatre in London in December 2013 before touring the UK in 2014. The production transferred to the West End in London at the Apollo Theatre for a Christmas season run in 2015, running from 4 December 2015 to 26 February 2016. It featured the original cast of The Play That Goes Wrong reprising their cast and crew characters from the original production, with the addition of Ellie Morris as Robert's niece Lucy, who is subjected to increasingly serious injuries over the course of the show. It returned to the Apollo Theatre the following year for another Christmas season run from 21 October 2016 to 29 January 2017, making it the third show running in the West End from the Mischief Theatre Company after The Play That Goes Wrong and The Comedy About A Bank Robbery. Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity benefited from royalties of the play, in accordance to the terms of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 which granted them a right to royalty in perpetuity from adaptations of the story of Peter Pan on stage, publication and film in the UK. It was announced in April 2019 that the show would embark on a UK Tour starting in October 2019 at The Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham before visiting Cardiff, Cambridge, Brighton, Salford and stopping in London at the Alexandra Palace for a Christmas run from 13 December 2019 till 5 January 2020.  Reception  Like The Play That Goes Wrong, Peter Pan Goes Wrong received positive reviews. WhatsOnStage.com gave it five out of five stars. The original West End run was nominated for the 2016 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy but lost to Nell Gwynn.

In some countries, voter registration is automatic, and is carried out by the government, so there is no need for organized efforts to register voters. In many many jurisdictions, the functions of electoral authorities includes endeavours to get as many people to register to vote as possible. In most jurisdictions, registration is a prerequisite to a person being able to vote at an election. A 2014 study indicated that voter registration drives increase the number of voters, but that the overall composition of the voting population, though expanded, otherwise is not noticeably impacted.David W. Nickerson, \\"Do Voter Registration Drives Increase Participation? For Whom and When?\\", The Journal of Politics 77, no. 1 (January 2015): 88-101. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, voter registration was introduced for all constituencies as a result of the Reform Act 1832, which took effect for the election of the same year. Since 1832, only those registered to vote can do so, and the government invariably runs nonpartisan get out the vote campaigns for each election to expand the franchise as much as possible. United States Barack Obama's presidential campaign, on Philadelphia's Benjamin Franklin Parkway. In the United States, such drives are often undertaken by a political campaign, political party, or other outside groups (partisan and non-partisan), that seeks to register persons who are eligible to vote but are not registered. In all U.S. states except North Dakota, registration is a prerequisite to a person being able to vote at federal, state or local elections, as well as to serve on juries and perform other civil duties. Sometimes these drives are undertaken for partisan purposes, and target specific demographic groups considered to be likely to vote for one candidate or other; on the other hand, such drives are sometimes undertaken by non-partisan groups and targeted more generally. Controversies In 2004, the Nu Mu Lambda chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity held a voter registration drive in DeKalb County, Georgia, from which Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Cox (Dem.) rejected all 63 voter registration applications on the basis that the fraternity did not follow correct procedures, including obtaining specific pre-clearance from the state to conduct their drive. Nu Mu Lambda filed Charles H. Wesley Education Foundation v. Cathy Cox (Wesley v. Cox)Charles H. Wesley Education Foundation v. Cathy Cox. on the basis that the Georgia's long-standing policy and practice of rejecting mail-in voter registration applications that were submitted in bundles, by persons other than registrars, deputy registrars, or \\"authorized persons\\", violated the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 by undermining voter registration drives. A senior U.S. District Judge upheld earlier federal court decisions in the case, which also found private entities have a right, under the federal law, to engage in organized voter registration activity in Georgia at times and locations of their choosing, without the presence or permission of state or local election officials.Cox Violated Voter Rights, Judge Declares In 2019, Tennessee lawmakers contemplated passing legislation to make it more difficult to carry out voter registration drives by limiting the time frame in which collected registrations had to be filed and requiring organizers to provide information about the drive to county officials in advance, with criminal penalties for violations of these provisions.

His work includes Ritual, Pod, Darling, Carnage Park, and Psychopaths.  Career  Keating interned at Blumhouse when he was a teenager. His feature directing debut, the horror film Ritual, was produced by Eric Fleischmann, a friend who was also a former intern there. His next two films, Pod, a science fiction-horror film, and Darling, a psychological horror film, were shot nine months apart; both premiered in 2015. Darling was produced by Glass Eye Pix, where Keating had also interned. For Carnage Park, a neo-Western horror film released in 2016, Fleischmann returned to produce. Describing Darling and Carnage Park, Charleston City Paper critic Kevin Young wrote that they show obvious influences from other horror films, but Keating's wide-ranging explorations of the various horror subgenres make him a promising director. Katie Rife of The A.V. Club wrote that although Carnage Park is fun, Keating needs to move beyond stylized homage to avoid the risk of being labeled an imitator. His next film, Psychopaths, completed principal photography in March 2016, and premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 20, 2017. Crooks, a heist film, began shooting in summer 2018.

Spaulding became involved in the Roosevelt administration, as the director of the \\"Negro Division\\" of the West Virginia Relief Administration. She held that position for four years. The West Virginia Relief Program worked to rehabilitate rural communities and aid those in rural areas economically and educationally. The West Virginia Relief Program also provided scholarships for five students studying at West Virginia State College to attend the Atlanta School of Social Work, and upon graduation, graduates were expected to \\"return to West Virginia to organize and maintain social welfare programs in African American communities.\\" In 1934, Spaulding was elected vice president of the Central Association of Colored Women's Clubs in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1951, she was the United States representative for the U.S. Council of Women at the Triennial International Council of Women. During that year, she also took part in the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. In 1952, she worked to campaign for Black votes for the Eisenhower election. She caught attention from the administration, as she worked hard to communicate to African American voters about the Republican civil rights platform. She was seen as very effective in gaining African American support throughout the entire United States. In 1952, Spaulding became the first African American female assistant secretary in the cabinet of a United States President. She became the assistant of Mrs. Oswald B.

Eisenhower. At the time of her appointment, she was \\"the highest paid African American employed by the federal government.\\" After nine months, she lost her position as Assistant Secretary. Allegedly, this was due to her refusal to support Jim Crow laws. Particularly, Spaulding was asked to sign and distribute a letter that rebuffed the charges that Oveta Hobby was delaying integration of schools on military bases. Spaulding refused, and went on to give anti-discrimination speeches, along with supporting the NAACP's position on an issue of a Houston hospital not recognizing African American doctors. She then moved to the War Claims Commission, a move that was charged by NAACP director Clarence Mitchell as a ploy to eventually fire her completely.

Peters asserts that communicating like angels is \\"impossible\\" but it is not just a tragic fact but also a blessed one. This book talks about the history of communication failure from different aspects like philosophy, politics, media technology and so forth. This book won the National Communication Association Award in 2000.  Themes  Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication studies communication failure. It contains five phrases of history of the idea of Communication, Plato's eros, The Bible's one-way dissemination, religious angel communication in Middle Ages, spiritual communication in modern philosophy, and the communication idea in modern communication theory. It also involves the subject machines, animals and aliens as horizons of incommunicability.  Book review  At the end of the Introduction \\"The Problem of Communication\\", Peters asserts that \\"dissemination\\" can be more charmingÔºö \\"The most beautiful thing about our contact with each other is its free dissemination, not its anguished communion. The ultimate futility of our attempts to \\"communicate\\" is not lamentable; it is a handsome condition. The notion of communication deserves to be liberated from its earnestness and spiritualism, its demand for precision and agreement, demands whose long history I attempt to illustrate in this book. The requirement of interpersonal mimesis can be despotic...The idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible.\\" In the first chapter, \\"Dialogue and Dissemination,\\" Peters compares two forms of communication: dialogue and dissemination and makes an argument that ‚Äúdialogue can be tyrannical and dissemination can be just‚Äù, which provides an interesting perspective of one- way communication: dissemination. And my study about dissemination of Chinese literature is based on the pressing industries, is all about book. Compared to radio, television, internet, books like newspaper, magazines and other pressing productions can be more like the media of one-way communication, since we can easily make instant interactions through radio, television, internet but as for books, due to the lack of interaction, the audiences may have more time and freedom to interpret meanings by themselves. To illustrate, we may use the theory of Encoding and Decoding by Stuart Hall, as shown right: thumb A programme can be encoded and decoded separately by different groups of people. In a dialogue or any other means of interaction, encoding and decoding can happen in turn or together frequently within a certain time between the two sides. And because of such strong interaction in it, say, the two sides have hugely different frameworks of knowledge, and then what will happen? Probably, they start to fight against each other... more emotion and non- rationality are filled in. Say, the two sides are more polite and open to the other‚Äôs opinions and maybe they have to force themselves to adjust their framework of knowledge and achieve a consistent but not perfectly accepted point at the end. As Peters said, dialogue can be tyrannical. More conflicts and disgraceful compromise may happen in a dialogue. Of course, in a one-way dissemination, say the dissemination of Chinese Contemporary literature books overseas, the process of encoding of Chinese writers is complete without too much distraction from the audiences overseas. The writers can fill their knowledge, feelings and thoughts in their books. And through the dissemination overseas, audiences in the far access the productions and decode the meanings by themselves with less distraction. Of course, the audiences could write book reviews or make direct connections to the authors, and at the same time, the authors could hold book launches or make a speech to make connections with the authors. But this kind of interaction afterwards can‚Äôt compete with the counterpart in instant dialogues in a phone call and chats in the social media, where encoding and decoding happen together at the same time. This kind of inspires me to reconsider the beauty of \\"dissemination\\"----one-way communication. But we should also realize that either in a dialogue or the dissemination, the failure always exists. Regardless of the tragedy, what we should also keep in mind is that ‚Äú the idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible.‚Äù  See also  John Durham Peters References John Durham Peters, 1999.

The victim in the case, 19 year-old Abby Honold, afterwards sought to establish federal funding for appropriate training of officials and first responders. A bill known as the Abby Honold Bill was first introduced to Congress by Senator Amy Klobuchar in 2017. It has not yet been enacted.https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s2266  History  The case was a highly mediatized case involving Daniel \\"Dan\\" York Drill-Mellum, a student at the University of Minnesota and fraternity member of Sigma Phi Epsilon. Drill-Mellum violently raped 19-year-old Abby Honold twice at his apartment in November 2014 after luring her from a Minnesota Golden Gophers tailgate. He left claw marks on her body, bit chunks of her breasts, and shoved his fist so far into her mouth that he tore open part of her tongue during the attack. After escaping, Honold immediately went to a hospital where a nurse described the injuries as some of the worst she'd ever seen. Drill- Mellum was arrested shortly after Honold reported his assault on her, but was released after his fraternity brothers secretly recorded a five-minute phone call with Honold. During the call, she stated twice that Drill-Mellum had raped her and detailed her injuries. But when Drill-Mellum's roommate asked her, \\"did you guys have consensual sex?‚Äù, he mumbled the words to make it sound like \\"actual sex.\\" Honold responded \\"yes\\" and police dropped the charges. On December 24, 2015, Drill-Mellum was arrested again when Kevin Randolph, a veteran of the University of Minnesota's police department, reviewed the recording and successfully re-opened the case. Drill-Mellum was tried for the rape of Honold and another victim he raped on Halloween 2014. The case attracted ongoing coverage in the media after Honold came forward and talked about how initially authorities did not press charges. On August 31, 2016, Drill-Mellum was sentenced to 74 months in prison following his guilty plea on two counts of rape. In November 2016, an episode of the Dr. Phil Show about the case was aired. And in April 2017, Investigation Discovery paired with deadline host Tamron Hall to air an episode about the case. After the trial, Honold contacted the office of Senator Al Franken to set up a meeting about a bill that would help law enforcement improve the reporting process for future victims. The bill seeks to establish federal funding for the purpose of training officers and first responders on the most effective techniques to use when interviewing sexual assault victims. Educating law enforcement officials and investigators on proper techniques is a key component of the legislation, which is tentatively named the Abby Honold Bill. In November 2017, after Franken was accused of sexual misconduct, Honold sought a new sponsor for the bill. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar's office promptly picked it up, and is working with Honold.

As a military leader he distinguished himself in many battles against the Spanish. Early life and career Datu Uto was born Anwarud-din Uto to Sultan Bangon Marajanun Sa Didagen and Tuan Bai Sa Buayan. During his father's reign as sultan Uto led a force of 500 men sent as assistance to the Spanish against Talayan rebels in 1864. This included the four guides who escorted the combined force headed by Colonel La Hoz, Governor of Cotabato. However, instead of helping the Spanish, he went against his father's orders and sided with the Talayan datu (ruler). Although inferior in numbers and equipment, the Spanish having the advantage of possessing artillery, they triumphed and chased the Spaniards as far as Taviran. It was during this battle that he lost his eye, earning himself the title \\"one-eyed man\\", but he became a recognized leader in Buayan as a result. Sultan Bayao, Bangon's brother, succeeded to the throne upon his father's death in 1872. Nevertheless, Uto succeeded as sultan three years later. Uto's ancestry=Sultan=Alliances Uto with his wife, Rajah Putri, in center. Uto ruled Buayan from the inland town of Zapakan. He married the daughter of Maguindanao's Sultan Qudratullah Untong, Rajah Putri Bai-labi. In 1874 he joined forces with Sultan Jamal ul-Azam, the Sultan of Sulu, to take the offensive against the Spanish. Evidently, Sulu needed the slave shipments Uto had been able to provide. In the same year he stated in a letter to the Governor of Mindanao, Colonel Carraga, that he has a large contingent to accompany him, which included at least 18 datus and 600 men. At the peak of his power he had as many as 5,000 slaves. In turn, the Spanish attacked Bakat, Buayan's major stronghold (cota or kuta), and occupied it. However, Uto was able to regain the stronghold and force the Spanish to sign a peace accord in May 1875. The leaders of the Pulangi river basin gravitated towards Uto's leadership, and this enabled them to keep the Spanish at bay. Included in the areas where Uto's influence grew were Talayan, Buluan, and Tumbao. The Spanish recognised his \\"ingenuity in manipulating friendships and debt relationships to suit his ends.\\" He solidified his alliances by friendship and marriage. For instance, he had a total of 60 wives. While keeping his administration small, mainly composed of a council, it was his personality which built a coalition with the neighboring leaders. His domain extended from Lake Buluan to Sarangani Bay. However, to conceal his true rank as sultan, Sultan Tambilawan (Sultan Bayao's son and Uto's cousin) was installed as the titular \\"Sultan of Buayan,\\" even though Tambilawan was Sultan of Kudarangan, a sultanate within Buayan. This caused Buayan to retain the title of datu, a strategy aimed to confuse the Spaniards as to who was the real ruler of Buayan. Continued warfare Peace did not last long. The new Governor-General of the Philippines, Jos√© Malcampo, 3rd Marquis of San Rafael, renewed the military campaigns in Mindanao. In 1876, the Spanish captured Jolo. The following year, the Spanish were able to convince the sultans of Cotabato and Tumbao to make an alliance against Buayan. Nevertheless, due to the signed peace accord, the Spanish did not dare to venture into Buayan itself. Due to this success, Malcampo was granted the victory titles of Count of Jolo and Viscount of Mindanao.Real decreto haciendo merced de T√≠tulo del Reino, con la denominaci√≥n de Conde de Jol√≥, Vizconde de Mindanao, al Contraalmirante de la Armada D. Jos√© Malcampo y Monje, Marqu√©s de San Rafael. Gaceta de Madrid no. 210, 29/07/1877, pg. 297.(BOE-A-1877-5842) On 20July 1878, Sultan Jamal ul-Azam signed a treaty recognizing Spanish sovereignty, but the Tausug made an issue of testing the limits of the treaty. By 1880 other sultanates began to emerge in the Pulangi River Basin. With this development, Uto made plans to defend the area against the Spanish. The Tausug and the Chinese began to supply him with arms in exchange for slaves. In particular, Buayan began to receive Enfield and Spencer rifles, as well as assorted pistols. The Spanish began to see in him the making of the next Muhammad Kudarat. Therefore in 1885 the succeeding Governor-General, Emilio Terrero y Perinat, launched yet another military offensive in Mindanao, personally leading the Spanish forces. This prompted Federico Roldan, Governor of Cotabato, to attack Buayan. In 1886, two Spanish corps under General Serina razed Bakat to make way for the construction of a new fort and a railway from Iligan to Lake Lanao. The project was abandoned as Uto's forces harassed the Spanish, gathering the metal used in construction to produce krises. Nevertheless, it was apparent that Uto would not dare to take the offensive. Attempting to break Buayan's defenses, the Spanish utilized artillery. While managing to destroy some strongholds, it was not enough to open up Uto's territory. Nevertheless, his followers began to fall to the Spanish offensive. Among them were Datu Kambing, Datu Kaliz, and the Sultan of Talayan.Sultan Tambilawan also pledged loyalty to the Spanish. On 10March 1887, Uto signed a peace treaty imposed by the Spanish. By 1888, his allies defected and his prestige was lost. Nevertheless, when the military campaigns of the Spanish ended, Uto remained unconquered. Later life and death Tomb of Datu Uto, c.1904 While he had lost most of the influence he possessed prior to 1888, Uto remained strong in local politics and tried to gain the title of sultan (a title he never used at the peak of his power). For instance, from 1888 to 1896, the Sultanate of Maguindanao had no sultan. While it is apparent that Uto wanted to be sultan of the two sultanates of Buayan and Maguindanao, he backed his brother-in-law, Datu Mamaku, to take the vacant position in Maguindanao. Meanwhile, the Spanish wanted to place as sultan a Sibugay datu allied to them. Sultan Mangigin succeeded as sultan in 1896. Despite the American occupation of the Philippines, Uto remained a powerful figure in the area until 1899. He had disappeared from the political scene by 1900, and Uto died two years later. Nevertheless, he was recorded as having met William Howard Taft, Governor- General of the Philippines from 1901 to 1903. His wife married Mangigin in 1906. His unofficial successors continued their resistance, this time against the Americans. Among his former companions who would resist American rule in Mindanao were Datu Ali and Datu Djimbangan. Another successor, Datu Piang, would prefer to cooperate with the Americans. In the process, he crowned himself Sultan of Mindanao, much to the dismay of Uto. Piang formerly served as a minister of Datu Uto.

Heng Yun association was founded by immigrants from Southern Fujian, China. While worked overseas to save money, some of them initiated to create entertainment to overcome their homesickness. Heng Yun association then became popular across Malaya. When Second Sino-Japanese War broke in 1937, Heng Yun participated in Fund Relief for China program initiated by Tan Kah Kee, but because Malaya is a neutral British colony, support to China was halted. Finally the group was disbanded. Some ex-member created new group called Yun Lu. The group's life was momentary. Some of the Yun Lu ex-member established new group in 1941 called Siong Leng Musical Association. However, when Japan occupied Singapore in 1942, all the activities were disrupted.

The David Collection. A three-quarter view which gives a powerful and lively impression of the sitter, despite lacking both Mughal precision, and very coherent modelling of the surfaces.Crill and Jariwala, 110 Deccani painting is the form of Indian miniature painting produced in the Deccan region of Central India, in the various Muslim capitals of the Deccan sultanates that emerged from the break-up of the Bahmani Sultanate by 1520. These were Bijapur, Golkonda, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, and Berar. The main period was between the late 16th century and the mid-17th, with something of a revival in the mid-18th century, by then centred on Hyderabad.Harle, 400; Craven, 216‚Äì217; Chakraverty, 69; Sardar The high quality of early miniatures suggests that there was already a local tradition, probably at least partly of murals, in which artists had trained. Compared to the early Mughal painting evolving at the same time to the north,Craven, 216 Deccan painting exceeds in \\"the brilliance of their colour, the sophistication and artistry of their composition, and a general air of decadent luxury\\".Harle, 400 Deccani painting was less interested in realism than the Mughals, instead pursuing \\"a more inward journey, with mystic and fantastic overtones\\".Kossak, 15 Other differences include painting faces, not very expertly modelled, in three-quarter view, rather than mostly in profile in the Mughal style, and \\"tall women with small heads\\" wearing saris. There are many royal portraits, and although they lack the precise likenesses of their Mughal equivalents, they often convey a vivid impression of their rather bulky subjects. Buildings are depicted as \\"totally flat screen-like panels\\".Harle, 400‚Äì403 (quoted); Craven 216‚Äì217 The paintings are relatively rare, and few are signed or dated, or indeed inscribed at all; very few names are known compared to the generally well-documented Mughal imperial workshops.Chakraverty, 70 The Muslim rulers of the Deccan, many of them Shia, had their own links with the Persianate world, rather than having to rely on those of the imperial Mughal court.Sardar; Chakraverty, 72; Deccan Style paintings In the same way, contacts through the large textile trade, and nearby Goa, led to some identifiable borrowings from European images, which perhaps had a more general stylistic influence as well. There also appear to have been Hindu artists who moved north to the Deccan after the sultans combined to heavily defeat the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, and sack the capital, Hampi.Harle, 403‚Äì405; Craven, 216‚Äì217; Chakraverty, 69 Early period, to 1600 The young Ibrahim Adil Shah II hawking, c. 1590, St. Petersburg.Michell and Zebrowski, 169 Some of the earliest surviving paintings are the twelve illustrations of a manuscript Tarif-i-Hussain Shahi, an epic- style poem on the life of Sultan Hussain Nizam Shah I of Ahmadnagar, leader of the Deccan alliance that defeated the Vijayanagara Empire. The manuscript was commissioned by his widow when she was acting as regent c. 1565‚Äì69, and is now in the Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Pune.Michell and Zebrowski, 145‚Äì147; Craven, 216; Chakraverty, 70 Six of the paintings, most unusually for India, show the queen prominently beside her husband, and another a traditional female-centred scene. Most of the portraits of the queen were scratched out or overpainted after her son Murtaza Nizam Shah I rebelled and imprisoned her in 1569.Michell and Zebrowski, 145‚Äì147 There are 400‚Äì800 illustrations in the Bijapur manuscript Nujum-ul-Ulum (Stars of Science), an astronomical and astrological encyclopaedia of 1570‚Äì71, in the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin.Sardar; [slamicart.museumwnf.org/database_item.php?id=object;EPM;ir;Mus21;40;en Chester Beatty page]; Michell and Zebrowski, 160‚Äì162 Ragamala paintings, sets illustrating (by evoking their moods) the various raga musical forms, appear to have been an innovation of the Deccan. There is a large dispersed group, probably originally forming several sets, of late sixteenth-century Ragamala paintings, which has been much discussed. They are similar in style, but by several different hands and with a considerable range of quality, with the best \\"among the most beautiful Indian paintings from any period\\". They were probably made for Hindu patrons, and may have been produced in a provincial centre well away from the capitals. There were a number of Hindu rajas in the northern Deccan, feudatories of the sultans.Michell and Zebrowski, 153‚Äì157, 154 quoted; Harle, 401‚Äì403 By about 1590 styles at the courts of Ahmadnagar and Bijapur had reached a brilliant maturity,Michell and Zebrowski, 151, 162‚Äì168; Harle, 400 The \\"decadent fancifulness\\" of the Lady with the Myna BirdHarle, 400 and the young Ibrahim Adil Shah II hawking,Michell and Zebrowski, 169 both illustrated here, are famous examples of Deccani distinctiveness.

Servants fan their masters or mistresses with cloths, rather than the chowris or peacock-feather fans seen elsewhere,Harle, 401 and swords usually have the straight Deccan form.Harle, 405 Elephants were very popular in both the life and art of the Deccani courts, and artists revelled in depicting them behaving badly during the periodic musth hormonal overloads affecting bull elephants.Michell and Zebrowski, 151 There was also a genre of drawings with some colour using marbling effects in the bodies of horses and elephants.Kossak, 68; Marbled elephant Apart from elephants, studies of animals or plants were less common in the Deccan than in Mughal painting, and when they occur they often have a less realistic style, with a \\"fanciful palette of intense colors\\".\\"Finch, Poppies, Dragonfly, and Bee\\", Brooklyn Museum Unusually for India, there was a significant imported population of Africans in the Deccan, a few of whom rose to high positions as soldiers, ministers or courtiers. Malik Ambar of Ahmadnagar and Ikhlas Khan of Bijapur were the most famous of these; a number of portraits survive of both, as well as others of unidentified figures.Crill and Jariwala, 110, 116; Harle, 403 One of the most important patrons of the style was Sultan Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur (d. 1627), himself a very accomplished painter, as well as a musician and poet. He died the same year as Jahangir, the last Mughal emperor to be an enthusiastic patron of painting other than imperial portraits.Michell and Zebrowski, 162‚Äì164; Craven, 217; Sardar; Crill and Jariwala, 110 The portrait from c. 1590 illustrated above, which comes from the same period as Akbar's artists at the Mughal court were developing the Mughal portrait style, shows a confident but very different style. The extreme close-up view was to remain most unusual in Indian portraiture, and it has been suggested it was directly influenced by European prints, especially those of Lucas Cranach the Elder, with which it shares a number of features.Crill and Jariwala, 110 File:Sultan Abdullah Qutub Shah Enthroned with Dancers and Attendants.jpgSultan Abdullah Qutub Shah of Golconda, enthroned with dancers and attendants, c. 1630 File:Anonymous - Radha and Krishna Embracing, Leaf from a Gita Govinda - 1962.241 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tiffRadha and Krishna Embracing, from a Gita Govinda, Aurangabad (?), c. 1650 File:Ikhlas Khan chief minister of Muhammad 'Adil Shah of Bijapur.jpgIkhlas Khan, chief minister of Mohammed Adil Shah, Sultan of Bijapur File:Finch, Poppies, Dragonfly, and Bee India (Deccan, Golconda).jpgFinch, Poppies, Dragonfly, and Bee, Deccan, c. 1650-1670, opaque watercolor and gold on paper, Brooklyn Museum. Influence Three rajas and attendants, 1700‚Äì20, rather large at 22x32.7 cm (8 11/16 x 12 7/8 in.) The Mughal court was aware of the Deccan style, and some Deccani paintings, especially from Bijapur, were included in albums compiled by Akbar and Jahangir. Some Mughal painters adopted a quasi-Deccani style in the early 17th century, perhaps following instructions from their patrons.Chakraverty, 70 Ibrahim Adil Shah II married his daughter, rather reluctantly, to Prince Daniyal Mirza, son of Akbar, and the wedding gifts included volumes of paintings.Chakraverty, 71 Several Rajput princes were generals in the Mughal armies fighting in the Deccan, leading to Deccan influences on early Rajput painting. In many cases Deccani painters probably migrated to the Rajput courts as their main patrons fell from power.Crill and Jariwala, 34; Chakraverty, 73; Harle, 395 Decline Deccani painting flourished in the late 16th and 17th centuries, but suffered as the Mughals gradually conquered the region, and had already largely adopted a sub-Mughal style by around 1650. Berar Sultanate was absorbed by Ahmadnagar by 1574, and Bidar Sultanate was taken over by Bijapur in 1619; their contributions to the style, whether before or after conquest, are rather uncertain. The city of Ahmadnagar itself was taken by the Mughals in 1600, after the death of the regent-princess Chand Bibi (often portrayed after her death), but part of the territory continued an embattled independence until 1636, with Paranda as the capital until 1610, then the new city later renamed as Aurangabad. The extinction in 1687 of the last two remaining sultanates of Bijapur and Golkonda, both ruled by the Qutb Shahi dynasty, was a decisive blow. Most of both royal collections were destroyed in the conquest, which deprived painters remaining in the area of models to study.Chakraverty, 73; Kossak, 68 A new \\"hybrid Rajasthani-Deccani school of painting\\" developed in Aurangabad, which became the Mughal capital of the Deccan. One dispersed ragamala set, and a Gita Govinda set in an identical style, were long regarded as Rajasthani until another manuscript in the style emerged, which was inscribed to record that it was painted in Aurangabad in 1650 for a patron from Mewar in Rajasthan; probably the painters were originally from there too.Michell and Zebrowski, 157‚Äì158 Mughal viceroys established a court at Hyderabad, but this did not become a centre for miniatures until the next century, by then in a less distinctive late Mughal or post-Mughal style. By now paintings were not just produced for a small court circle, and markets had developed for types including sets of Ragamala paintings, erotic subjects, and Hindu ones.Harle, 405‚Äì406 Copies or imitations of old works such as royal portraits continued to be produced well into the 19th century.Chakraverty, 73 File:Abul Hasan Qutb Shah.jpgAbul Hasan Qutb Shah, the last Sultan of Golconda, 1670s; he was then imprisoned for 13 years to his death in 1699.

In the summer 1839 Bj√∂rn Gunnlaugsson and pastor Sigu√∞ur Gunnarsson travelled along Vatnaj√∂kulsvegur.Helgi Bj√∂rnsson, The Glaciers of Iceland: A Historical, Cultural and Scientific Overview, Springer, 2016 page 508 the ancient highland trail was believed to cross the glacier river J√∂kuls√° √° Fj√∂llum Vatnaj√∂kulsvegur would start on the farm Br√∫ in J√∂kuldalur and go southwest through Laugarvalladalur and Vestridalur to Fagridalur and that would take 7‚Äì8 hours. Then it would cross the glacier river J√∂kuls√° √° Fj√∂llum, or go to Hvannalindir. P√©tur Brynj√≥lfsson (born 1794) rode on horseback from Br√∫ over Kverk√° and Kreppa, south of Hvannalindir and further along Vatnaj√∂kull over Skj√°lfandaflj√≥t to Ki√∞agil. He did not go through Vonarskar√∞ pass. Bj√∂rn Gunnlaugsson went this route in both 1838 and 1839 in order to find a new main route between the east and the south of Iceland; the first year he went north of Tungnafellsj√∂kull but the second year through the Vonarskar√∞ pass. In 1839 he went from the most northern part of Rang√°rvallas√Ωslu, Landsveit over Tungnaa√° and Kaldakv√≠sl to Illugaver by Sau√∞afell and then over the lava fields to Vonarskar√∞ and further east along the glacier to Hvannalindir and then to Br√∫. The stories about Vatnaj√∂kulsvegur interested the nature researcher I. C. Schythe who travelled the route on horseback in 1840 over Sprengisandur north Tungnafellsj√∂kull to Hvannalindir. It took 34 hours from Sprengisandur.Daniel Bruun,Vatnaj√∂kulsvegur\\" samt Unders√∏gelser ved VatnaJ√∂kulls Nord- og Vestrand, Geografisk Tidsskrift, Bind 28 (1925) -3 References Category:Iceland ","title":"Vatnaj√∂kulsvegur"},{"id":"52220886","text":"Fran√ßois Duhourcau (25 February 1883 ‚Äì 3 March 1951, Bayonne), graduated from the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in the infantry in 1905, was a 20th- century French novelist, essayist and historian, winner of the Grand prix du roman de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1925.

The water protector name, analysis and style of activism arose from Indigenous communities in North America, during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, that began in April, 2016, in North Dakota. Water protectors are distinguished from other forms of environmental activists by this philosophy and approach that is rooted in an Indigenous cultural perspective that sees water and the land as sacred. Some Water Protectors say that the reasons for protection of water are older, more holistic, and integrated into a larger cultural and spiritual whole than in most modern forms of environmental activism which may be more based in seeing water and other extractive resources as commodities. For example, water walker Josephine Mandamin of the Anishinaabe has said that water is associated with Mother Earth and spoke of the responsibility of grandmothers to lead other women in praying for and protecting the water. After a prophecy from an elder, Mandamin led water walks, to pray and raise awareness, from 2000 until her death in 2019. Her peaceful actions inspired many to become water protectors. Actions Water protectors have been involved in actions against construction of multiple pipelines, as well as other projects by the fossil fuel industries, and resource extraction activities such as fracking that can lead to the contamination of water. Actions have involved traditional direct actions like blockades on reserve lands and traditional territories to block corporations from engaging in resource extraction. Water and land protectors have also created resistance camps as a way to re-occupy and refuse to give away their traditional territories. Usually part of these encampments, when led by Indigenous people, is a strengthening of cultural ties and traditions, with inclusion of activities like language revitalization. The Dakota Access PipelineAlton Gas In May 2018 Mi'kmaq peoples in Nova Scotia blocked the Alton Gas company from extracting water from the Shubenacadie River for a natural gas project; the project was disrupting the natural balance between freshwater and seawater in the tidal region, and threatening the drinking water, fish and other water life of the region. Muskrat Falls Action has also been taken across Canada, including Muskrat Falls hydro dam project in Labrador. Trans Mountain Pipeline In Burnaby Mountain, thousands have staged demonstrations opposing the Trans Mountain pipeline. Wet'suwet'en resistance camps The Wet‚Äôsuwet‚Äôen peoples have ongoing of resistance camps, including Unist‚Äôot‚Äôen Camp and action against the construction of a Coastal GasLink pipeline and the heavily militarized RCMP, in Northern British Columbia. People Many water protectors are women. In many Native American and FNIM cultures, women are seen to have a strong connection to water, the moon, and the cycles of the tide as they are able to become pregnant and give birth. In Anishinaabe culture women perform ceremonies to honour water and water is considered to be alive and have a spirit. The water walks begun by Josephine Mandamin in the Great Lakes region continue to take place, and have spread worldwide, in an ongoing effort to raise visibility. Well-known water protectors include: Autumn Peltier (of the Wikwemikong First Nation); Peltier's aunt Josephine Mandamin, Marjorie Flowers, Inuk, Nunatsiavut, Labrador.

History  The band was founded as a student club by the members when they were undergraduate students at KAIST in 2006 and band activities continued even as they started their graduate studies. The name Noeazy is a combination of the word \\"noisy\\" and \\"not easy\\", stylized with a 'z' instead of an 's'. Noeazy started off playing cover songs of popular bands before producing their own music, playing in campus festivals and a variety of indie music festivals in South Korea. In 2008, two of their songs were included in the Daejeon Indie Pride Compilations album, an album designed to showcase local talent from the Daejeon area. Noeazy released their first EP, The Mirror, later that year in December. Their first album, Discrepancy, was released in 2010. Noeazy played in the Ssamzi Sound Festival where they received the Sumun Gosu award, which is awarded to talented up-and-coming bands. The band released a compilation album in collaboration with the Japanese band Gates of Hopeless in 2012 and followed it up with their second solo album in 2013, Land of Abomination. Music videos for the songs Genesis and Decay were created for the album's release. In 2015, Noeazy was invited to play in the 2015 Beyond the Ocean Tour in Seoul and Busan with other Korean rock and metal bands such as Messgram and End These Days. Noeazy's second EP, Bioshock, was released in December 2015.

He is the founding-director of the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL), which was founded in 1988 by a group of students who had been in his own words, the 'victims' of an alien education system foisted on Ladakh. He is also known for designing the SECMOL campus that runs on solar energy and uses no fossil fuels for cooking, lighting or heating. Wangchuk was instrumental in the launch of Operation New Hope in 1994, a collaboration of government, village communities and the civil society to bring reforms in the government school system. He invented the Ice Stupa technique that creates artificial glaciers, used for storing winter water in form of conical shaped ice heap.  Early life  Wangchuk was born in 1966 in Uleytokpo, near Alchi in the Leh district of Ladakh. He was not enrolled in a school until the age of 9, as there were not any schools in his village. His mother taught him all the basics in his own mother tongue until that age. His father Sonam Wangyal, a politician who later became the minister in state government, was stationed in Srinagar. At age 9, he was taken to Srinagar and enrolled in a school there. Since he looked different compared to the other students, he would get addressed in a language that he did not understand. Due to which his lack of responsiveness was mistaken for him being stupid. He recalls this period as the darkest part of his life. Unable to bear the treatment, in 1977 he escaped alone to Delhi where he pleaded his case to the school principal at Vishesh Kendriya Vidyalaya. Wangchuk completed his B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Srinagar (then REC Srinagar) in 1987. Due to differences with his father over the choice of engineering stream, he had to finance his own education. He also went for two years of higher studies in Earthen Architecture at Craterre School of Architecture in Grenoble, France in 2011.  Career  In 1988, after his graduation Wangchuk with his brother and five peers, started Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL). After experimenting with school reforms in government high school at Saspol, SECMOL launched Operation New Hope in collaboration with the government education department and the village population. From June 1993 until August 2005, Wangchuk also founded and worked as the editor of Ladakh's only print magazine Ladags Melong In 2001, he was appointed to be an advisor for the education in the Hill Council Government. In 2002, together with other NGO heads, he founded Ladakh Voluntary Network (LVN), a network of Ladakhi NGOs, and served in its Executive committee as the Secretary till 2005. He was appointed to the Drafting Committee of the Ladakh Hill Council Government‚Äôs Vision Document Ladakh 2025 and entrusted with the formulation of the policy on Education and Tourism in 2004. The document was formally launched by Dr. Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India in 2005. In 2005, Wangchuk was appointed as a member in the National Governing Council for Elementary Education in the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India. From 2007 to 2010, Wangchuk worked as an education advisor for MS, a Danish NGO working to support the Ministry of Education for education reforms. In late 2013, Wangchuk invented and built a prototype of the Ice Stupa which is an artificial glacier that stores the wasting stream waters during the winters in the form of giant ice cones or stupas, and releases the water during late spring as they start melting, which is the perfect time when the farmers need water. He was appointed to the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education in 2013. In 2014, he was appointed to the Expert panel for framing the J&K; State Education Policy and Vision Document. Since 2015, Sonam has started working on establishing Himalayan Institute of Alternatives. He is concerned about how most of the Universities, especially those in the mountains have become irrelevant to realities of life. In 2016, Wangchuk initiated a project called FarmStays Ladakh, which provides tourists to stay with local families of Ladakh, run by mothers and middle-aged women. The project was officially inaugurated by Chetsang Rinpoche on 18 June 2016.  Innovations = SECMOL campus SECMOL campus300px Wangchuk has been helping in designing and overseeing the construction of several passive solar mud buildings in mountain regions like Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim so that energy savings principles are implemented on a larger scale. Even in -30 Celsius winters, his solar-powered school, built with the rammed earth, keeps the students warm. Led by Wangchuk, SECMOL has won the International Terra Award for best building in July 2016 at the 12th World Congress on Earthen Architecture in Lyon, France.The rammed earth 'Big Building', located at SECMOL. The campus was built using simple, low-cost traditional techniques on principles of passive solar architecture. The building comprises a big solar-heated teaching hall, along with several rooms for the students and other classrooms.  Ice Stupa  In January 2014, Wangchuk started a project called the Ice Stupa. His aim was to find a solution to the water crisis being faced by the farmers of Ladakh in the critical planting months of April and May before the natural glacial melt waters start flowing. By the end of February in 2014, they had successfully built a two-storey prototype of an ice stupa which could store roughly 150,000 litres of winter stream water which nobody wanted at the time. In 2015, when Ladakh faced a crisis due to a landslide which blocked the Phugtal river in Zanskar and caused formation of 15 km long lake which became a huge threat for the downstream population, Wangchuk proposed to used a siphon technique to drain the lake and water jet erosion to safely cut the edges instead of blasting the lake as was being planned. However, his advice was ignored and blasting work was carried on. On 7 May 2015, the lake finally burst into flash flood which destroyed 12 bridges and many fields. In 2016, Wangchuk started applying the Ice Stupa technique for disaster mitigation at high altitude glacier lakes. He was invited by Government of Sikkim to apply siphon technique for another dangerous lake in their state. In September 2016, he led a three-week expedition to the Lhonak Glacial Lake in North-West Sikkim, which had been declared dangerous for the last few years. His team camped for two weeks at the lake, amidst rain and snow, installing the first phase of a siphoning system to drain the lake to a safer level until other measures were taken up. In late 2016, the idea started gaining traction from the authorities in the Swiss Alps. Wangchuk was invited by the president of Pontresina, a municipality in the Engadine valley, Switzerland to build Ice Stupas to add to their winter tourism attractions. In October 2016, Wangchuk and his team went to the Swiss Alps and started building the first Ice Stupa of Europe, together with the Swiss partners. In February 2018, a group of young local sculptors and artists from Ladakh built an actual 10-feet high ice stupa. The wondrous sculpture is made entirely of ice and it took them 25 days of hard work and dedication to complete the project. What makes it more special and challenging for the team was the extreme conditions under which they've worked. As the stupa was housed inside another giant ice tower (ice stupa artificial glacier), they have to work in very low temperature of at least -12 degrees Celsius.  Politics  In 2013, on repeated requests from students community of Ladakh, Wangchuk helped launch NLM ‚Äì the New Ladakh Movement ‚Äì a social campaign and Ladakh's version of Green Party with the aim of working for sustainable education, environment and economy. It also aimed at uniting all the political leaders of Ladakh under one banner for the growth and development of Ladakh. However, the idea was much ahead of its times and could not convert into electoral victory. Eventually, the members decided to make it into a non-political social movement.  Boycott of Chinese products  In May 2020, in response to the India-China border skirmishes, Sonam Wangchuk appealed to Indians to use \\"wallet power\\" and boycott Chinese products. This appeal was covered by major media houses and supported by various celebrities. Following the Galwan Valley clash on 15 June 2020, there were calls across India to boycott Chinese goods.  In popular culture  Wangchuk came into the spotlight in 2009, when his story inspired Aamir Khan's character Phunsukh Wangdu or Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Rancho) in the Rajkumar Hirani directed film 3 Idiots. He has been referred as \\"The real life Phunsukh Wangdu\\". However he says that he is not Phunsukh Wangdu.

He has been called the \\"father of Indian geology.\\" He made one of the firstBenjamin Heyne made a geological map in 1821. geological maps in India covering the Hyderabad region that he travelled through as the geologist of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. The map was submitted to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta on 8 August 1821 but no copy of it remains.  Biography  Voysey was the son of Baptist minister Henry Voysey (1753-?1829) and Ann Maria Annesley Ellison (d. 1836) and was born at Salisbury, Wiltshire. He was a brother of the architect Annesley Voysey (1793-1839). He is said to have studied medicine in London and Aberdeen. In his early years he was inspired to study geology by Professor Robert Jameson (1774-1854) and John MacCulloch (1773-1835), both of whom had been geologists with the Trigonometrical Surveys of Scotland. Voysey worked as a hospital assistant with the 59th Regiment of Foot from 12 May 1815 and may have taken part in the Waterloo campaign in the summer of 1815 as he makes a statement on the scenery at Oudgheer in the Deccan as being somewhat like that of the Isle de France with distinct layers visible. After the war, Voysey's battalion was disbanded and he was drafted with the 1st Battalion and made a voyage around the Cape to India where he stayed at the home of Tom Sheridan (1775-1817), son of R. B. Sheridan (1751-1816). Voysey is shown as having joined the 46th regiment of foot with effect from 29 July 1819 at Bengal but he appears to have been on half-pay and may have never joined. At Calcutta he became acquainted with Colonel William Lambton who ensured that Voysey joined the Trigonometrical Survey of India at Hyderabad, on 15 December 1818. The official geologist and surgeon-naturalist appointed in 1817 for the Trigonometrical Survey was John Ross but he did not show up. Voysey's association as surgeon with the trigonometrical survey did not allow him promotions and after the death of Lambton, he found himself financially compelled to resign. He left Ellichpur for Calcutta in January 1824 and fell sick on the 14th of April at Coliapal, west of Jehanabad. He continued on and was found dead from \\"jungle fever\\" by the bearers of his palanquin on the morning of April 19th at Sulkea ghat.  Geology and natural history  Voysey examined the mineral collection of Colin Mackenzie even before he joined Lambton's survey. Voysey was attached to the trigonometrical survey and travelled with the triangulations that proceeded from Madras through the Nizam's dominion towards the Deccan Trap region. He collected mineral samples along the route and maintained notes. He did not publish them but some of the extracts from his journals were published posthumously in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. These included notes on native steel manufacture and on Gond language. His ideas on geology were based on Werner, based on Neptunism, that rocks were formed under the oceans. He however decided that dykes or veins were produced by volcanic intrusion from below. He called laterite as \\"iron-clay\\". He observed amethystine quartz veins at Mulkapur but did not follow them into the jungle for fear of tigers. He used Secunderabad as a base and worked with George Everest during this part of the survey. In 1819 he and Everest returned to the region and during free time in the rainy season would indulge in rolling granite boulders down the hills. The trip however resulted in both suffering from malaria. Voysey's knowledge of French allowed him to interact with Alfred Duvaucel when he was in Calcutta. He was also in touch with French research and when Everest wanted to measure humidity, it was Voysey who suggested the wet and dry bulb thermometer approach invented by the French. In 1823 Voysey wrote in a letter that he was preparing a sketch of the geology of India based on his travels and observations made since 1819: \\"It may appear rather presumptuous in me to attempt a sketch of Indian geology after so short a residence, particularly when you recollect that Smith's map of English geology took him twenty years to complete. There is, however, this remarkable difference between the two countries, that in India, instead of twenty different formations, as in England, there are only four...\\" The geological map that Voysey finally submitted to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta on 8 August 1821 was lost and attempts were made to obtain a copy but has been untraced.Letter from Henry Torrens of the Asiatic Society 1842 In a letter to William Lambton, Voysey also pointed out the role of geology in surveying and was a forerunner to the work of Pratt: \\"In addition to the great advantage to Science and to the Arts from a knowledge of the Geological structure of the country obtained from Section maps and collections of Specimens, I conceive that a very important object of a Geological enquiry lies in determining the cause of these anomalies which sometimes occur in Trigonometrical operations and which can only be explained by supposing them to arise from concealing disturbing forces owing to difference in the specific gravity of the upper, lower or contiguous strata.\\" Voysey was also an observer of economic botany and was aware of the work of contemporaries like Benjamin Heyne. He noted during his travels, the crops cultivated and their soil associations. He recognized that the black soils of the Deccan were derived from the basaltic rocks of the region. He noted in the Hyderabad region that plants like Ottelia alismoides and Nelumbo nucifera were common in unused irrigation ponds. He also recorded the cultivation of safflower, castor apart from the use of palmyra palms and teak. Clements Markham, in his history of the Indian surveys, claimed that Voysey was the first officially posted geologist to work in India. This claim is incorrect as there was at least one other official posting, that of Alexander Laidlaw (d. 1836) who was posted as mineralogist and geologist in June 1817 under Captain Webb as part of a geodetic survey in Kumaon. Laidlaw however was dismissed from work and he produced no publication or report on his work. After Voysey's death, there was no immediate appointment of a naturalist-geologist as part of the Trigonometrical Survey and this was seen by some as a great loss.

It is situated about away from Ranna Junction along Ranna - Weeraketiya road. The temple has been formally recognised by the Government as an archaeological site in Sri Lanka. The designation was declared on 6 June 2008 under the government Gazette number 1553. History It is accepted that the Kasagala Raja Maha Vihara was constructed during the Anuradhapura era in the reign of King Kavan Tissa (205‚Äì161 BC). But it is also believed that the Vihara was begun with planting of one of 32 saplings of the sacred Sri Maha Bodhi (Dethispala Bodhi Tree) in this land with patronage of King Devanampiya Tissa (307‚Äì267 BC) in the third century B.C. According to the chronicles King Kavantissa (205‚Äì161 BC) has constructed several buildings there and later they were further renovated and expanded with adding new features by King Dappula I (661-664) and King Vijayabahu I (1055-1110 AD). During the reign of King Kirti Sri Rajasingha (1747 ‚Äì 1780 AD), a gilt Buddha image and temporalities were donated to the temple and had conducted a Dalada Perahera (a pageant) as a tribute to the Tooth Relic of Buddha. Name According to local folklore the name Kasagala (The yellow rock) has been derived as monks who lived there had dried their saffron colored robes on the slabs of natural rock where the temple is situated. It is said that these robes were seen as saffron colored rocks from far way and thus people had used to call the temple as Kasagala. Beside above folklore an inscription which belongs to 2 AD and related with the temple, refers that this temple was known as Kawagala Pabbatha in early periods. The Temple Ruins at the Vihara premises Currently two ancient Stupas can be seen in the Vihara premises. One of that which situated on the top of the rocky plateau is believed to be constructed by king Devanampiya tissa and is considered as the oldest Stupa in the Vihara. The other Stupa is situated nearby has been constructed by king Saddha Tissa (137-119 BC), brother of King Dutugamunu. Near to the upper rocky plateau Stupa, six stone inscriptions have been found. The information included in all six inscriptions appears to be on the style of granting liberty from slavery (Vaharala). The temple is adorned with paintings and sculptures belonging to Kandyan tradition, display unique artistic features of the maritime provinces. The paintings mainly show Southern and transition artistic styles, influenced with European Cultural traits and new art styles.

History  In 2005, members of North Dakota Farmers Union (NDFU) were interested in developing a restaurant where guests could have access to, and benefit from, food grown, raised, and harvested on American family farms. NDFU first started a restaurant called Agraria, which failed due to numerous factors. North Dakota Farmers Union soon partnered with restaurateurs, Dan Simons and Michael Vucurevich, and opened the first of their restaurants, Founding Farmers DC, in 2008.

All of the food prepared in Founding Farmers kitchens is made in-house daily, and all locations are part of the Certified Green Restaurant¬Æ association. All bread is baked at their in-house bakery, with approximately 118,000 loaves baked per year. Their most popular items include: cornbread, chicken and waffles, grilled cheese with tomato soup, and bacon lollies. In 2013, Founding Farmers published a cookbook with 100 of their menu items.

Together with the Glasgow Cathedral and oldest surviving house, Provand's Lordship, which are both near Glasgow's historical High Street, Barony Hall establishes its place as a city's heritage and a fine example of Gothic architecture. The Old Barony Church was built as a part of the Barony Parish in Glasgow by architect, James Adams. It opened in 1799 and served ceremonial and other congregational purposes. The replacement for the old building was designed by J.J. Burnet & J.A. Campbell and raised in 1889, and incorporated architectural artifacts from the old church and a number of other relics. The New Barony Church was acquired by the University of Strathclyde in 1986. It was restored to its former glory by 1989 and is now utilized as a ceremonial hall, as well as serving other university purposes, known as the Barony Hall. History The 1798 Barony Church, pictured in 1825 The Barony Church has existed for approximately 400 years, dating from before 1595 until 1985. Over that time it became one of the top parishes of the Church of Scotland. Among the notable ministers who have resided in the Barony Parish are Zachary Boyd (1625‚Äì1653), Norman McLeod (1851‚Äì1872) and John White (1911-1934). Barony Parish received its name from the Barony of Glasgow. The early Barony Church, which was established in a crypt was mentioned in Sir Walter Scott's Rob Roy. In the book, which was set in the early 18th century, the church was described as :\\"an extensive range of low-browed, dark, and twilight vaults, such as are used for sepulchres in other countries, and had long been dedicated to the same purpose in this, a portion of which was seated with pews and used as a church. The part of the vaults thus occupied, though capable of containing a congregation of many hundreds, bore a small proportion to the darker and more extensive caverns which yawned around what may be termed the inhabited space.\\" The conditions of the early church gradually worsened over time, until it was decided to be rebuilt in 1798 with the architect James Adam. The new design was met with praise, as well as criticism. Some considered it an architectural jewel, whilst others despised its looks and considered it borderline unappealing, even repulsive. One of the Church's own ministers, Dr. Norman McLeod, is reported to have advised Queen Victoria that it was \\"the ugliest Kirk in all Europe\\". With the opening of this new church, the old crypt was used as a burial ground until 1844. 280x280px However, not even the new building could solve some of the Barony Church's problems. The few roads leading to the church were little more than dirt tracks, making traveling to and from the church immensely difficult for many of the congregation, especially during winter. It also could not sustainably fulfill all the spiritual requirements of the congregation. This led to several Chapels of Ease being built throughout the Barony area, usually by the local people to provide, at the very least a provisionary solution to the problems of the Barony Kirk. Eventually, a replacement of the church was needed, in order to provide a solution to the problems. A site was acquired on the west side of Castle Street and a magnificent, red sandstone Gothic church, inspired by Girona Cathedral and Dunblane Cathedral, designed by J.J. Burnet & J.A. Campbell as a part of a competition, was finished in 1889. This new building incorporated architectural artifacts from the old church and a number of other relics. The new building was dedicated in a service on 27 April 1989. An article in the following day's Glasgow Herald made no direct comment on the building but focused on the sermon by John Caird, the Church of Scotland minister and Principal of the University of Glasgow, in which he \\"dealt with art in relation to worship, stating that it was weak and foolish to identify purity of worship with ruggedness and baseness of form\\". This new building provided a superb home for the congregation, which was eventually joined by that of St. Paul's & St. David's (Ramshorn) to form the Barony Ramshorn in 1982. However, the congregation did not last long. It was around this time that the Barony broke off into four different parishes: Shettleston (1847), Calton (1849), Maryhill (1850) and Springburn (1854). Church attendees decided to return to St. George's Tron, others to Dennistoun Blackfriars and many came back to the place where Barony originated from, Glasgow Cathedral. Some of the relics from the Barony Church were taken back to the cathedral, including the Communion Table, and a chapel was established in the cathedral's crypt. The church was in use for over 100 years and the last service was held on 6 October 1985. All the Castle Street buildings were acquired by Strathclyde University a year later, in 1986. The church was restored once again in 1989 by the University and is now used as a ceremonial hall known as Barony Hall. The development, designed by David Leslie Architects, cost ¬£3.4 million, with sums received through grants and hundreds of private donations.  Barony Hall today  Original inscription pillar: \\"The Barony Parish Church. Dedicated to the glory of god and his worship. 27 April A.D. 1889.\\" The war is also marked by a memorial to the dead ‚Äì a plaque bearing 125 names connected to the church at the side of the stage in the Great Hall. Below sits a solitary reminder of the unlamented 1799 building, its foundation stone, bearing the names of the ministers who served there during its 90-year life. An original inscription can be found on a pillar of Barony Church on the corner of the Rottenrow street and Castle street, dedicating the building to the glory and worship of God. The date stated on the pillar dates back to the first dedication service held in the rebuilt building, on 27 April 1989. A new inscription can be found under the original one, which was added after the acquirement of the Church by the University of Strathclyde, addressing the building as Barony Hall and as a part of the university campus. As befits such a momentous venue, the Barony houses one of Scotland's grandest organs, the Maurice Taylor Organ, which was installed in 2010. A Bach-style organ, the first of its kind to be commissioned in the UK, the instrument is designed for performances of Bach's music in their original form and has been used for numerous concerts and recitals since it took its place. The organ has forty-one speaking stops, three manuals, one pedal, three thousand pipes, and features mechanical key and stop action. The bellows feeding air can be blown by foot, authentic to the Baroque period, as well as electrically. The restoration work following Strathclyde's acquisition of the Barony earned high acclaim in architectural and design circles, winning many awards from Europa Nostra Award, the UK Civic Trust, Glasgow Civic Trust and the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland. The certificates for these awards are displayed in the corridor which connects the Great Hall to the cloakroom. These are displayed along with the thousands of degree certificates which have been distributed in the Barony over the past quarter of a century, serving as a testament to the building's significance for Strathclyde ‚Äì a place where tradition is continued and achievement recognized. Functions thumb After the Barony Church building was acquired by the University of Strathclyde in 1986, it came into use as the University's Barony Hall, hosting graduations, major exams, examinations, and functions. Aside from university purposes, the Barony Hall is one of the most renowned venues in the Glasgow city center. The hall hosts a variety of celebrations and formalities such as: *Weddings - The Great Hall and the Winter Gardens provide the perfect atmosphere and ideal setting for weddings. Located in the city center, it is easily reachable by public transport such as Buchanan bus station and Glasgow Queen Street railway station. *Graduation - The Barony Hall hosts every year's inauguration events and graduation ceremonies for the students of the University of Strathclyde. *Exhibitions *Meetings *Seminars *Concerts *Functions There are three more areas in the building - the Winter Gardens, the Bicentenary Hall, and the Sir Patrick Thomas Room. These can be used for many purposes such as registration, catering, and break-out areas. Main events taking place in the Barony Hall are exhibitions, weddings, dinners, dinners/dances and receptions. The Hall offers more than 250 square metres of space and can hold up to 500 people (theatre- style) on the flat floor area in the Great Hall or up to 600 when using the Balcony.

After World War II the Danish State confiscated the Kal√∏ Estate including Karlsladen as part of war compensation. Karlsladen is located on Djursland, which is a peninsula protruding from Jutland to the east into the Kattegat Sea. Karlsladen is located close to Kal√∏ Castle Ruin and the town R√∏nde in Syddjurs Municipality 30 kilometers north-east of Denmark's second largest city, Aarhus.  Restoration  A colonnade of heavy load bearing oak timber pillars and a visible upper oak-construction inside Karlsladen defines the architecture of the single inner room. As part of the restoration the elongated lofty building was cleared of the remnants of prior use, including the use of part of the barn as a pig stable for some years, and the division of part of it into a number of floors for storage of grain and sheaves. The result is that the original heavy timber construction all the way up to the thatched roof is visible today. During the restoration it was necessary to replace the first meter of the lower part of many of the load bearing oak pillars due to rot and wear. This was a task that demanded specialized carpentry, giving back the original strength to the construction without compromising the way it was built and looked in 1727.  Funding  Karsladen was converted to a visitors centre as part of a 40 million kroner (4.78 million ¬£) project, \\"Ferieoplevelser i Nationalpark Mols Bjerge\\" - Vacation Experience in Mols Bjerge National Park. The National Park was established in 2009 and covers 180 km¬≤. The funding included establishing another visitors centre in the National Park at √òvre Strandk√¶r and other new facilities in the park. These included 6 kayak campsites along the coast of southern Djursland, two horse trailer parking sites, a number of bicycle trails and signposts in the park plus park-folders. The project spanned 4 years. The 40 million kroner came from three public and semipublic sources. Arbejsmarkedets Feriefond provided two thirds of the funding. The state department, Naturstyrelsen, together with Syddjurs Municipality provided the remaining third.  Origin  The nearly 300 year old barn is built in Holstein style with timbered walls, a wide building, with a pitched and thatched roof. It has been said that the massive inner oak timber might originate from stranded ships in K√∏ge Bay on the east coast of the island Zealand, south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Others are of the opinion that the timber might have been reused from a barn that was part of Kal√∏ Castle. A barn supposedly located north of the existing Kal√∏ Caste Ruin on the Kal√∏ peninsula 3 kilometers from Karlsladen. Kal√∏ Castle was abandoned in 1660, but the barn by the castle might still have been there as late as in 1722, five years prior to completion of Karlsladen in the nearby hills.  Use  After restoration in 2013 it has been attempted to use Karlsladen for different kinds of events, but the building does not seem entirely suitable for many types of gatherings. For a large part the charm of the big room is based on the two visible and massive oak timber colonnades across the whole floor plane, but these hinder a free view through the room. There are no upper floors in the tall building, and this makes it nearly impossible to heat up the space, where winter temperatures on average hover around 0 degrees Celsius. Also the rectangular stable-shape might not be particularly functional for music and theatre events. Model of Kal√∏ Castle, showing how the castle might have looked in the Middle Ages. Today the castle is a ruin 3 kilometers from Karlsladen, often visited by tourists.

The title has been translated as Elephant-sport. It is a treatise in 263 stanzas divided into twelve chapters of varying length. In the treatise, the author's name has been mentioned as Nilakantha, but nothing more is known about the author. From the popularity of the text in the region now comprising the modern state of Kerala in India, it is thought that the author might have lived there. Also, nothing definite is known about the date of the work. Matanga Lila is a text about the Indian elephant science, which is a technical science dealing with the taming and training of elephants, and also the anatomy and zoological features of elephants. Franklin Edgerton, who published a translation of the text to English, has argued that the content of the text represents the codification of orally-transmitted traditions of practical knowledge. In support of this contention he noted that the \\"signature texts such as the Matanga-Lila\\" contain over 130 technical words, for which there are no clear Sanskrit etymologies. Outline of contents The book is divided into 12 chapters. The first chapter describes the mythic origin of elephants. It also contains a description of the various \`castes' of elephants. Chapter 2 describes favorable marks of elephants. This chapter also describes the different sounds produced by elephants. chapter 3 describes the unfavorable marks. They include the number of nails, presence of external testes, undesirable marks on the trunk, on the penis, on the tail and on other parts of the body. Chapter 4 deals with longevity of elephants and Chapter 5 describes the various stages in the life of an elephant and also gives names to various body parts of elephants. Chapter 6 deals with measurements of elephants. Chapter 7, consisting of only three stanzas, deals with prices of elephants. Chapter 8 is on marks of character. This chapter also contains a classification of elephants based on their varying sensitivity to stimuli. Chapter 9 deals with the state of mast and Chapter 10 with catching of elephants. Chapter 11, the longest in the whole work is titled \\"On keeping of elephants and their daily and seasonal regimen\\". The 12th and last chapter deals with the character and activities of elephant managers. Various commands including visual signs, oral, percussion, and prodding are given. There is a section describing how and when these commands are to be used so that the elephant will obey the mahout.

Haggis is used as a tool to bridge the gap between pseudocode and typical computer programming. Haggis is not based on any one language but a mixture that is intended to allow a pupil familiar with any of the many languages used in classrooms to easily understand the syntactic construct being used in an example. It has multiple programming paradigms of functional, imperative and object-oriented to suit this purpose. There are three separate language definitions, one for each level at which computing is assessed by the SQA; these are proper subsets of each other, so for example any program contained by the National 5 level language is also well-defined at Higher and Advanced Higher levels. Higher includes the definition of procedures and functions and the use of record types and files, while Advanced Higher includes object-orientation. Online Haggis interpreters have been developed to provide a way for examiners and teachers to check their programs are correctly defined and behave as expected. Overview In Scotland, school-level computing qualifications are awarded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. A decision was made for computing courses that a single choice of programming language for examination should not be mandated: this allows teachers to choose languages as appropriate to context. This however leaves the issue of how to examine programming, especially in the light of recent educational research which encourages the teaching of reading and understanding code as a core discipline, which should therefore be examined. Initially, a form of pseudocode language emerged among examiners, to avoid any such language dependency. However this led to the very undesirable situation that, while students are being taught about the importance of rigour of terms in a programming language, they can look back over previous years of examinations and see non-standard use of coding which varies from example to example. Haggis is the solution to this. Haggis is a formally-defined reference language, but its purpose is to examine programming, not to write programs. A further requirement is that it must not be a mandatory part of the curriculum, so students who have never previously seen the language should be able to read it. These aspects, along with an attempt to conform as far as possible with the evolved pseudocode style, directed the specification of the language. So, while Haggis is in fact a programming language (even although, in general, not all Haggis programs are executable), it is not intended as a language in which to write programs. These concepts are more fully explained in an academic paper.Quintin Cutts, Richard Connor, Greg Michaelson, and Peter Donaldson. 2014. Code or (not code): separating formal and natural language in CS education. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education (WiPSCE '14). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 20-28. DOI=https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2670757.2670780  History  Haggis was commissioned by the SQA in 2010 to provide a uniform syntax and form in which to present questions to pupils in assessments. Its present form was jointly developed by Quintin Cutts (University of Glasgow), Greg Michaelson (Heriot Watt University) and Richard Connor (University of Strathclyde). The aim of developing Haggis was to emphasise the core idea of ensuring pupils could view code and demonstrate their understanding of its behaviour, in order to develop their computational thinking and programming skills. Haggis was first introduced into the Computing Science examinations as part of the Scottish Government‚Äôs Curriculum for Excellence development programme in the 2013/2014 session in National 5, 2014/2015 for the new Higher courses and into the new Advanced Higher in the 2015/2016 session. Haggis was not introduced as a language to replace other languages already used in education, not was it intended that the language should be taught or used in the normal curriculum. However some teachers have adopted it as a rigorous pseudocode form to enhance teaching delivered in another language.  Features and philosophy =Core principles Haggis was designed with 8 core principles in mind *Not be based on any one extant programming language *Be adaptable to programming languages already taught in the Scottish Curriculum. *Provide enough complexity for Advanced Higher teaching whilst being appropriately useful for earlier teaching years. *Provide an instinctive element, e.g. variable types are self specified. *Be concise in use but open to interpretation of multiple ways to solve a problem. *Allow different constructs have different meanings when used in certain context. *Don‚Äôt visualise the non-useful elements such as Memory being allocated. Use within education It was designed to be both functional/sequential and object-oriented based in order to be simple and complex for National 5 / Higher students and Advanced Higher students simultaneously. Haggis was designed to allow pupils across Scotland to enhance the learning and understanding of computer programming through reading examples, and aid the step of converting from pseudocode to full programming. It was not created with the intention of asking pupils to write it in assessments but provide a uniform language in which to present code examples to students, ensuring that all pupils have a fair understanding and is not hindered by learning a different programming language different to the one exemplified in the assessment. Syntax An example of the Haggis programming language which prints all even numbers between 0 and 100. Syntax and structure in Haggis are very similar to other programming languages and can be easily learned. A more complex example of some Haggis code Reserved words *Reserved words are capitalised; this would be generally be considered ugly for a programming language, but makes the program structure clearer for a first-time reader of the language. Similarly, the language deliberately contains a great deal of syntactic redundancy. *\`DECLARE\`, \`FOR\`, \`WHILE\`, etc. Data types (types are normally determined by inference except where this is not possible) *Character (a single character type, from which Strings are composed) *Integer *Real (including integers) *Boolean (true or false) Structured types *Array: Sequence of same data types. *String: Array of Character. *Record: A labelled collection of values. *Object: as defined by Class descriptors. Arrays are included at National 5 level, Records at Higher, and Objects at Advanced Higher. Line numbers In some examples in examination papers line numbers are used to allow easy reference; this is not a part of the language however. Indentation Code within other structures should be indented so it can be properly identified by the compiler and to make it easier to read for the developer and for anyone else of who may be reading the code. Once again, this is not a part of the language definition. Comments Comments can be made using the ‚Äú\`#\`‚Äù character for every line of commented text, this can appear either at the beginning of a new line or after a piece of code. Large blocks of text can be specified using the ‚Äú\`<(COMMENT TEXT>\`‚Äù format, this is primarily implemented for educational use to provide larger context for students. Variable names Variable names should be written in lowercase or, if the name is complex, in lower camelCase. Camelcase is when a name is concatenated together to form one long word, however the first letter of each word (apart from the first) is capitalised. For example, variables could be called: *\`number\` *\`meaningfulName\` Initialisation Initialisation allows the declaration of a new variable. :\`DECLARE <variable‚Äôs name> INITIALLY <value>\` If the type cannot be determined from the initialising value, an optional type may be included, as for example :\`DECLARE myArray AS ARRAY OF INTEGER INITIALLY []\` Assignment Assignment allows the user to set values to variables. The syntax is as shown. :\`SET <variable‚Äôs name> TO <value>\` *If <value> is a string, it should be written within quotation marks, like this: \`SET phrase TO \\"maybe\\"\` *If <value> is an integer, it doesn‚Äôt need quotation marks, like this: \`SET number TO 23\` Input Input in Haggis is similar to pseudocode in that you state the data type of the input the program is receiving and also where the input is coming from, like so: :\`RECEIVE <variable that will store input> FROM <INPUT DEVICE>\` The optional typing for a declaration may also be used, for example :\`DECLARE number AS INTEGER INITIALLY FROM KEYBOARD\` Output Outputs in Haggis can be written similarly to inputs. :\`SEND TO \` For example: *\`SEND meaningfulName TO DISPLAY\` Arithmetic calculations \`SET\` is used to assign the result of calculation. For example: :\`SET number TO 32*6\` This is another form of assignment. Procedures / functions A procedure is a kind of sub-program within a program. It allows the sectioning of code to make it more readable and easier to work with. You must remember to end the procedure as shown below. \` PROCEDURE ( , ...) Haggis Commands END PROCEDURE \` Operations Haggis includes all the operations you would expect from a programming language to be able to carry out calculations and logical operations alike. For INTEGER and REAL data typed, the following operations are possible. *‚Äú-‚Äù is subtract *‚Äú+‚Äù is add *‚Äú*‚Äù is multiply *‚Äú/‚Äù is divide *‚Äú^‚Äù is exponent For \`INTEGER\` data types alone, the modulo is possible which is written as \`MOD\`. Comparison operators: *‚Äú=‚Äù is equals *‚Äú‚â†‚Äù is inequals *‚Äú<‚Äù is less than *‚Äú>‚Äù is greater than *‚Äú‚â§‚Äù is less than or equal *‚Äú>‚Äù is greater than or equal Logical operations: *‚ÄúAND‚Äù is Conjunction *‚ÄúOR‚Äù is Disjunction *‚ÄúNOT‚Äù is Negation Defining a class Defining a class in Haggis uses the syntax \`[CLASS ()]\`. There are various methods you can declare in Haggis such as: \` CONSTRUCTOR( [Data Type][Data Name], [Data Type][Data Name]...) The users' Haggis code will then go here. END CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION () RETURN The users' Haggis code will then go here. RETURN THIS END FUNCTION ‚ÄúTHIS‚Äù is used to reference the current object invoking the method. PROCEDURE () The users' Haggis code will then go here. END PROCEDURE \`  Application and uses  Haggis was originally implemented and then expected to be used in the following ways. The students would be taught how to code in a programming language that the teacher has selected. The students would then make plans in a pseudocode format in a higher level of language than the code itself. Once the students felt comfortable with writing pseudocode they would then be introduced to Haggis as it is the language used in exam texts. Haggis was implemented in this way because research has shown the ability to understand programs is essential to developing further programming skills. Courses run by the SQA (National 5 and Higher) both include outcomes that require students to have this ability. Because Haggis is so easy to understand and pick up, it has been used in exam texts. It is noted that students were and never will be asked to write any code in Haggis during an exam, they are only required to be able to read and understand it.  Problems  There have only ever been a very small number of problems with Haggis. None are to do with the language itself but more to do with the way students view it. The first is that students had no idea why they were being taught to write a completed computer program in two languages. The other is that they were mixing up the two languages that they had been taught and were often getting syntax wrong because they were being taught the two languages at the same time which was causing some minor confusion.  Observation  Haggis was observed by the creator and was found to be used in the following ways. Haggis was being used as a planning language for the computer programs that students were being asked to create. After students had been asked to refine their code through several planning stages, a final plan was made using Haggis. After this final plan is made, the Haggis code would then be transferred into a real programming language that is specified by the teacher. This method is effective in increasing students skills as mentioned earlier to give them as much preparation as possible for the exam for when they will see Haggis applied in a context.

It was designated as a Category A listed building in 1966. The building still stands there today despite it recently being abandoned due to structural weakness'. The building features stone work on the outside showing a lion's head, referencing the name ‚Äì \\"Lion Chambers\\", as well as the upper bodies of some Judges of the court, since the building was intended to house a few lawyers' offices. It was made using a somewhat experimental method of construction called the Hennebique System which involves a reinforced concrete as its main building material. the Hennebique System has however gone out of favour in modern times. Whether or not the building will be demolished or receive funding to be refurbished remains to be seen. History The Lion Chambers was originally designed by James Salmon and John Gaff Gillespie, who together formed the partnership known as Salmon, Son & Gillespie. The two were commissioned by William George Black who was a lawyer and writer based in Glasgow. Black was a well- established within the Glasgow Art Club, which included some well-known artists such as James Abbott McNeill Whistler.Cusack, Patricia. \\"Lion Chambers: A Glasgow Experiment.‚Äù Architectural History, vol. 28, 1985, pp. 198‚Äì211. www.jstor.org/stable/1568532. Because of this he integrated into has plans artist's studios that would be located in the top floors of the building. The Glasgow City Council was known to have somewhat of a soft spot for the innovative club in which Black was part of, so it is thought that this may have been of some help in getting the building approved for construction. The building was home to many lawyers and artists for most of the 20th century, until the main bulk of the building had to be evacuated in 1995 due to the decision that it was too dangerous to regularly use. The ground floor and basement were still used up until 2009 when it was decided that they too should be evacuated. The building remains there to this day with no clear indication of its future ‚Äì The sum needed to repair the building back to safe conditions is far too great for the multiple co-owners to afford, and no one else has showed enough interest to invest in it.Brebbia, C.A. & Hernandez, S.

Retrieved 8 November 2016 In April 1991, water-pooling, cracking and spalling affect the building due to its structural decay. The co-owners decide to pursue demolition, since the repairs are estimated at ¬£1‚Äì1.5 million. Four years later, The Scotsman reports that due to the danger of collapsing, all the occupants have been evacuated. Building Control has been assessed to the building. On 12 April 1995, The Independent reports that the owners of Lion Chambers have been served with a Dangerous Building Notice, after which they submit a demolition application. A month later, The Herald reports that for only 20 more years life of the building, the repairs cost at around ¬£1.5 million. A report by Glasgow Building Preservation Trust has been submitted to Glasgow City Council, proposing a longer term but expensive approach to repairs. On 29 August 1995 the permission to demolish has been refused, giving the owners 6 more months to deal with the Dangerous Building Notice, the press reports. They discuss with the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust about undertaking repairs, and also want to hear of other parties wishing to take on the building. In October 1997, Glasgow Building Preservation Trust reports that they want to develop a centre for young designers, including workshop and training spaces, called Centre for Product Resource Innovation and Design Enterprise (PRIDE). In 1999, ¬£5,000 has been granted for a feasibility study, as reported by The Annual Report of the Architectural Heritage Fund. The study says that re-using as dwellings and workshop space is viable.

This system involves mainly reinforced concrete offering an alternative to steel frames, making the building fireproof. The Hennebique system was designed to strengthen concrete to make it withstand forces which damage concrete the most and consists of using situ concrete (situ meaning 'cast in its place'). This allows the walls to be extremely thin with a thickness of 100mm to maximise the amount of space within the rooms and avoid the need to have exterior scaffolding.

However, the Hennebique system is not as popular in the UK as in the 1900s because of its many negative attributes, including the complexity of the framework and moulding in the manufacturing process. The brutalist architecture of the building allows the concrete to weather away easily, considerably in weather in the United Kingdom, which was one of the main reasons the Lion Chambers had to be abandoned. Additionally, the building doesn't provide the heat qualities required to meet today's standards. Damages Original design presented to the William George Black showed many weak points, including the lack of Thermal Insulation of the external walls and roof surfaces, causing condensation on the internal surfaces. Additionally, there was no external insulation against water penetration on the basement walls. This caused water to be able to penetrate the basement walls, which eventually led to the evacuation of the basement in 2009. In 2009, a feasibility study for the reparation of the Lion Chambers was instructed by Historic Scotland. The study advised there to be additional reparations to the building as further corrosion occurred due to the lack of activity in the building and the Glasgow City Council provided ¬£156,000 to replace materials used in the building with wire mesh due to concerns over debris falling from the building. Furthermore, around 25% of the windows have been boarded over due to safety reasons and the northern and eastern walls have been vandalised at ground levelSimpson, Shona http://www.buildingsatrisk.org.uk/details/897874.

Retrieved 8 November 2016 There have been other attempts by agencies to restore the Lion Chamber, such as Four Acres Charitable Trust and the Glasgow City Council, however, all attempts are yet to be successful. Despite the pursuit of finding a solution to Lion Chambers, Historic Scotland and Glasgow City Council are committed to finding a solution to save the building. However, in 2000 on 26 October the Scotsman reported that Glasgow City Council had approved funding of ¬£156,000 to be used to replace current scaffolding with a wire mesh, allowing for a further two years in which for them to create a funding package. Also in 2001 the Annual Report of the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland reported that ¬£22,958 had been awarded to aid costs with scaffolding. In 2002 the Annual Report of GBPT reported that the idea to raise wire mesh was still in talks and that if completed would mean that the Dangerous Buildings notice would be removed from the site. Due to two buses colliding with the scaffolding the scaffolding had to be rebuilt around the site. In 2004 the scaffolding began to be taken down, leaving the wire mesh still up. It was also reported by local planners that the building was available but not for leasing. In 2006 the GBPT back out of any arrangements with the building. By 2007 the lower floor of the building was only being used as an office supplies shop. Despite that windows were still boarded over and many of the walls had been vandalised with graffiti. In 2010 the last business unit located within the building moves out, leaving the building empty, this is supposedly because of the poor condition of the building. It is reported that Glasgow City Council offered the building to multiple owners for restoration at the price of only ¬£1, however no successful deal were made. Glasgow City Council and Historic Scotland are still strongly committed to finding a solution to save the building.

Anstalt J.F. Kaiser, Graz. The local communities as autonomous entities came into existence after the abolition of the landlords in 1850. ; Judendorf Stra√üengel Wallfahrtskirche church Maria Stra√üengel. Around 860, in one of the oldest documents of Austria, the churchhill of Stra√üengel is called \\"ad Strazinolun\\". Probably the name derives from the Slavic \\"straza\\", which could refer to a watchtower located here. On June 11, 1147 Margrave Otakar III dedicated the monastery Rein to several towns Rotz, Stra√üengel and Judendorf. These areas were managed by monks from the Rein abbey. Settlements with the label \\"Judendorf\\" are usually located along old trade routes crossing the Alps. In their neighborhood, the city and market foundations were established later. It is assumed that these Jewish villages are the settlements of Jewish merchants who were intensively involved in the merchandise trade in the early Middle Ages. After the abolition of the landlords, Judendorf, Stra√üengel, R√∂tz, Hundsdorf and Kugelberg were included in the market town of Gratwein, established in 1849. With the opening of the section M√ºrzzuschlag-Graz of the k.k. privileged Southern Railway on October 21, 1844, the Gratwein/Gratkorn Basin also joined the \\"industrial revolution\\". As a result, Jewish businesses settled in Judendorf, including a cement factory. The Judendorf and Stra√üengel people, however, owed their economic boom to the fact that the upper class of Graz had seized this area already in the year 1850. Especially based on economic activity was the development of a hotel (1889), a cold-water sanatorium (1894), and the \\"Styrian Park Sanatorium Dr. Feiler\\" (1901). At the time, as one of the most famous spa resorts of the monarchy, Judendorf-Stra√üengel finally obtained the separation from Gratwein, and in 1909 constituted itself as an independent local community. The upswing came to an abrupt end with the collapse of the monarchy and the associated loss of the economic backlands. The congregation would soon have sunk into insignificance, if the health insurance of the Austrian federal railway would not have taken over the former Feiler Park Sanatorium. After the Second World War, Judendorf-Stra√üengel developed more and more into a residential community, and in 1981, 86% of the workforce worked in the home-community. After the insurance company of Austria railways in 1989 abolished parts of its special hospital. Through intensive efforts, the tradition of Judendorf- Stra√üengel as a health resort and as a place of rest and recreation also continued. Consequently, in the first special department of the Psychiatric Hospital \\"Park Residence\\", a retirement home, and on the site of the last disused part, a modern rehabilitation center was built with a focus on neurology, orthopedics, oncology and children's rehabilitation. In 2009 the main square was completely redesigned around the former community center and inaugurated on the occasion of the 100th anniversary. ; Eisbach North of the village Rein was in the Neolithic Age (Neolithic) in Lasinja-Culture, a mining site for silex (siliceous rock as chert, quartz, etc.). From there, tools (hand axes, blades, scrapers, etc.) were won. Workpieces of this mining site were spread to a distance of away.Michael Brandl: Silexlagerst√§tten. pp. 43‚Äì47, 67‚Äì68, 87‚Äì93 and after.

It has smooth white and grey bark, sometimes rough and fibrous on the lower trunk, linear to narrow elliptic adult leaves, flower buds usually in grows of seven, white flowers and shortened spherical to barrel-shaped fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus halophila is a shrub or mallee that typically grows to a height of , sometime to , or a shrub up to tall, and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white and pale grey bark, sometimes with fibrous bark on the lower half of its stems. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are linear, long and wide. Adult leaves are linear to narrow elliptic, the same dull green colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, sometimes three, on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from January to May and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, shortened spherical or barrel-shaped fruit that is long and wide with the valves enclosed below rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus halophila was first formally described in 1980 by Denis and Maisie Carr from a specimen Maisie collected with Alex George near a small salt pan near Dalyup. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (halophila) is derived from ancient Greek word meaning \\"salt\\" with the ending -philus meaning \\"loving\\", referring to the habitat of this species. Distribution and habitat Salt lake mallee grows in sandy clay soils on flat areas in shrubland adjacent to salt lakes. It is only known from the catchment of the Dalyup River between Dalyup and Mount Ney near Esperance in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation status Eucalyptus halophila is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The plant is available commercially in seed form or as tubestock and is grown as an ornamental or low shelter plant. It is tolerant of frost, salt and drought and has a moderately fast growth rate.

History The team was founded in 1924 by Chuvash professional music composers and choral conductors F.P. Pavlov (1892‚Äì1931) and V.P. Vorobyov (1887‚Äì1954) as the Chuvash National Choir. Its leaders began to gather and process Chuvash folk songs, performing them for the public in Chuvashia and throughout Russia. The group followed an ethnographic interest in choir performances and a high performing culture. In the 1920s the choir toured in Moscow, Leningrad and Gorky. Chuvash State Choir was the winner of the All-Union Choir Olympiad peoples of the USSR. It was awarded the Prize of the All-Union Radiofestival and performed in the Kremlin. In 1994 he was awarded the title of \\"Academic\\". During these years, the repertoire of the Choir added classical and contemporary music, as well as the music of the peoples of the USSR. Ensemble In 1939 the Chuvash National Choir was renamed the Chuvash State Song and Dance Ensemble. In the late 1930s, ensembles of song and dance emerged across the country. The first artistic director was a young composer and conductor A.G. Orlov-Shuzm (1914‚Äì1996). Under his leadership the ensemble successfully performed in Moscow, music and dance of the RSFSR peoples. Later the ensemble was led by conductor Kazatchkov S.A. (1909‚Äì2005). The Ensemble performed in many countries. World War II The activity continued during World War II. The Ensemble stayed three-months at the Bryansk and Kalinin Fronts in the winter of 1943.

Circe. Galleria degli Uffizi Republic of Genoa was rich oligarchic republic, where the authorities were powerful bankers. In the Renaissance, Genoa was not developed into significant arts center, as it was for Florence, Ferrara, Rome, Rimini and Venice. But in the 17th century Genoa had an original school of painting, called Genoese School, which was to develop Flemish contacts (visits by Rubens and van Dyck). The best painter was Bernardo Strozzi, called il Cappuccino, of great importance also for Venice. Giovanni Castiglione, called Il Grecchetto, took up a genre already made famous by Sinibaldo Scorza with paintings of animals and still lifes under Flemish and Venetian influence. Domenico Fiasella and Gioacchino Assereto joined the Caravaggesque followers, while Valerio Castello was more eclectic. The decorators Domenico Piola and Gregorio de Ferrari worked in the churches and palaces of Genoa. In the first half of the 18th century Alessandro Magnasco dominated painting with his strange personality, his nervous technique and his exaggerated chiaroscuro; his expressionistic distortions created a fantastic world reminiscent of Salvator Rosa, Marco Ricci and Francesco Guardi.

He was sired by Speightstown, who also sired Hollywood Derby winner Seek Again and Belmont Derby winner Force the Pass, Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap, and Vosburgh Stakes winner Rock Fall, and Jockey Club Gold Cup Winner Haynesfield. His dam Without You Babe is by Lemon Drop Kid, winner of the Belmont Stakes and the Woodward Stakes, and who sired upset Kentucky Oaks winner Lemons Forever.  European career  In Europe Tamarkuz only ran in Weight for Age and handicap races. During this time he was raced irregularly. In three years he only ran six times with a total of three wins.  Dubai career  He began running at Meydan Racecourse in 2014 with a fifth-place finish. Just a start later he even failed to finish the race. The injury caused by the race forced him to take ten months off. He returned the following year to win four of five with wins in the Firebreak stakes and the Burj Nahaar, But the highlight was his nose victory over Sloane Avenue in the Godolphin Mile.  American career  After success in Dubai, Tamarkuz went to America in 2015. He began with a fourth-place finish in the Met Mile, then he was sixth in the Forego Stakes, and another fourth in the Kelso Handicap. He returned to run in America in 2016 and ran in the same 3 races as before. It started with a ninth in the Met Mile. In his next two races in the Forego and the Kelso, he was second. After that he entered the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. He went off at odds of 11-1 running against Champions such as, Breeders cup Spring winner Runhappy, and Santa Anita Derby winner Dortmund. At the start Tamarkuz was last. Quickly he moved up to seventh and than at three quarters of a mile Gun Runner took the lead and Tamarkuz was third. Then Tamarkuz then flew on by Dortmund and Gun Runner to get an 11-1 upset win in the race. Afterwards, he was retired to stand at stud as a sire at Shadwell Farm.

A physical cognitive city differs from conventional cities and smart cities in the fact that it is steadily learning through constant interaction with its citizens through advanced information and communications technologies (ICT) based ICT standards like IFGICT & ITU and that, based on this exchange of information, it becomes continuously more efficient, more sustainable and more resilient.D‚ÄôOnofrio, S., Portmann, E.(in print): Cognitive Computing in Smart Cities, Informatik Spektrum, ‚ÄúSpecial Issue Smart Cities‚Äù, Heidelberg, Deutschland: Springer, 2016.Mostashari, A, Arnold, F., Mansouri, M., Finger, M.: Cognitive Cities and Intelligent Urban Governance.

Springer International Publishing, 2016. A virtual cognitive city differs from social media platforms and project management platforms in that shared data is critical for the group's performance, and the community consists of members spanning diverse expertise, backgrounds, motivations, and geographies but with a common desire to solve large problems. The virtual cognitive city is steadily learning through constant metadata generated by activity in the user community.Exaptive, Inc.: \\"How to Cross-pollinate Ideas Productively to Nurture Innovation.\\" White paper, July 2018.  Definition  Cognitive cities are based on advanced ICTs which support the steady automation of daily urban processes. Additionally, learning processes are added to the underlying systems of the city which allow a system to learn from its past ‚Äì meaning, the past behavior of the user ‚Äì and to adapt to changes in the environment and thus to new requirements. The city learns by collecting data that has been provided by the citizens through the available ICT and by subsequently analyzing them. Both, citizens and the city, profit from this continuous interaction as well as from the ongoing learning process and they steadily develop themselves whereby also the collective intelligenceMalone, T.W., Bernstein, M.S.: Handbook of Collective Intelligence. MIT Press, Cambridge, 2015. within the city is increased.  Challenges  Just like smart cities, cognitive cities should facilitate the response to the economic, social, ecologic, cultural and political challenges of the urban development. The focus here lies especially on problems caused by increasing population growth, demographic transition, scarcity of resources, pollution of the environment, global warming and financial uncertainties. The most important component of all challenges of a city are the citizens themselves. Therefore, it is important to include every single inhabitant in the urban development process. This means, that by taking into account every single citizen (cf. citizen as sensors)Goodchild, M.F.: Citizens as Sensors: Web 2.0 and the volunteering of geographic infor-mation. GeoFocus (Editorial), 2007, Vol. 7, pp. 8-10. a city can further develop itself in such a way that it can fulfill the requirements of the citizens and stay attractive for current as well as potential citizens. Only a collaboration between the city and its citizens makes a successful urban development possible.  Interaction between citizen and city  Such a collaboration can take place through different paths: Question-answering- system: As a knowledge-based system, a question-answering-system is able to give answers to questions asked in natural language. Thus, an efficient dialogue between human and system should be enabled. On the basis of the collected data (cf. big data), the city is able to see which topics the citizens engage with.Portmann, E.: Cognitive Computing leads to the next level of answering questions on the Web.

Sanchez (Ed.), Fuzzy Logic and the Semantic Web, Elsevier, 2006, pp. 163-210. Internet of Things (IoT): The whole urban environment is equipped with sensors that make all recorded data available in the cloud (cloud computing). In this way, a permanent interaction between citizens and the technology that surrounds them is developed. The citizens thus become a part of the technological infrastructure of a city. The Web of Things uses web standards to overcome IoT-challenges.Guinard, D., Trifa, V., Wilde, E.: A resource oriented architecture for the web of things. In Internet of Things (IOT), IEEE, 2010, pp. 1-8. Cloud based social feedback, crowdsourcing and predictive analytics: Developments such as cloud based social feedback, crowdsourcing and predictive analytics allow the creation of cities which actively and independently learn to build a memory, to search and also to expand that memory when new information is added to the already existing. In this way, the city acquires the ability to recognize behavioral patterns and changes, maybe even to predict them and to react to them (possibly with new solution strategies).  The cognition of a city  The cognitive city pursues one main goal: improved information exchange for the development of knowledge, the so-called collective intelligence. Hereby not only individual experiences and perceptions are important but also the experiences and perceptions of others. In order to attain this goal, the city, among other things, applies cognitive computing.Siemens, G.: Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age. International Journal of Instructional Technology & Distance Learning, 2005.  Characteristics of cognitive computing  The theory of connectivism implies that humans do not only learn based on their own experiences but also based on the experiences of others. Thus, the knowledge base can be continually expanded. This theory emphasizes the importance of the interaction of humans and computer systems in a city as the constant interaction between city and its citizens increases their common existing knowledge. A further base for cognitive computing is computational thinking. The goal of computational thinking is to find solutions to complex problems (problem solving) within a city and to get an understanding of human behavior with the help of computer science. Computational thinking allows to operate on different levels of abstraction and to mechanize them through precise notation and models.Wing, J.M.: Computational Thinking. Communications of the ACM, 2006, Vol. 49, Nr. 3, pp. 33-35. The concept of the intelligence amplification loop, another important component of cognitive computing, implies that human and computer system continually learn from each other through interaction. A ‚Äúlearning loop‚Äù is developed in which the knowledge of human and system is continually expanded. Thus, the collective intelligence of a city is steadily increasing. The process of the intelligence amplification loop is characterized by the emergence which refers to the spontaneous formation of new and connected insights through interaction.Kaufmann, M., Portmann, E., Fathi, M.: A Concept of Semantics Extraction from Web Data by Induction of Fuzzy Ontologies. IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology, 2013, pp. 1-6.Portmann, E., Kaufmann, M., & Graf, C.: A Distributed, Semiotic-Inductive, and Human-Oriented Approach to Web-Scale Knowledge Retrieval. International Workshop on Web-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval, and Reasoning. Maui, Hawaii, USA, 2012. Most data which can be collected in a city and from its citizens are only available in natural language, which are thus imprecise. For most of today's computer systems it is difficult (or impossible) to directly process vague inputs. The processing and analysis of the existing data is absolutely necessary. For this reason, soft computing is applied. Contrary to traditional methods of calculation, soft computing techniques allow the inclusion of values which are described in natural language. This enables a nature-based precision of imprecise information which does justice to the perceptions of human beings. This is a necessary precondition for the application of cognitive computer systems and thus for cognitive cities.Zadeh, L.A.: Fuzzy Logic = Computing with Words.

Virtual cognitive cities  Virtual cognitive cities are goal-driven communities made up of members who gather in a digital medium to share knowledge, data, and tools. The virtual environment is used to facilitate collaboration among community members who -- outside of a shared mission -- are otherwise disparate in their expertise, backgrounds, motivations, geographies, and potentially other characteristics. Virtual environments support the identification of graph patterns among metadata created by interactions between the users and the digital medium, which can then be used to understand and improve community processes.Schechter, Aaron, et al.: \\"Step by step: Capturing the dynamics of work team process through relational event sequences.\\" Journal of Organizational Behavior, 2017, Special Issue, Nov 27, 2017.

Completed in 1899, it is the oldest Roman Catholic church in Surabaya and among the oldest churches in Surabaya. History=Catholicism in Surabaya The first Roman Catholic church in Surabaya was located at what is now the corner of Jalan Kepanjen and Jalan Kebonrojo. Before the construction of this church, Father Hendricus Waanders and Father Philippus Wedding were sent from the Netherlands as the pastor for the Indies; at first Waanders was stationed in Batavia while Wedding was stationed in Surabaya, after that Waanders was stationed in Surabaya while Wedding switched place to Batavia. Under Waanders, the Roman Catholic congregation in Surabaya grew considerably, resulting in a new plan to construct a larger church building. In 1822, the congregation was able to construct a new church building located in what is now the corner of Roomsche Kerkstraat (now Jalan Kepanjen) and Komedie weg (now Jalan Kebonrojo). A new church Construction of the present Church in Kepanjen was started when Pastor C.W.J. Wenneker bought a piece of land from the colonial government for 8,815 guilders in 1889 located to the north of the former church. A new church was required to replace the dilapidated older church and because of the growing congregation. Construction of the new Roman Catholic church was started on April 18, 1899 following the design of W. Westmaas. Construction was completed on August 5, 1900. It was consecrated as Onze Lieve Vrouw Geboorte Kerk in 1900 by the Archbishop of Batavia, Mgr Edmundus Luypen SJ. Building The Church was designed by W. Westmaas, among his previous project was the reconstruction of the Blenduk Church in 1894. During its construction, the pile foundation had to be adjusted to reach the depth of 16 meter because of the relatively unstable ground, compared with the initial planning of 4 meter deep pile foundation. 799 pillars was needed to establish the foundation, the pillars were made of galam wood from Kalimantan. The red bricks were imported from Europe. The columns and the original furniture were made of teak. The church suffered fire damage during the 1945 Battle of Surabaya. Some of the original bricks had to be replaced with new ones, resulting in uneven coloration.

Young plants have lance-shaped to narrow elliptical leaves that are dull bluish green, slightly paler on the lower side, long and wide on a petiole long. Adult leves are lance-shaped, sometimes curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum about half as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs in autumn and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, more or less cylindrical or barrel- shaped capsule long and wide with the valves below rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus hawkeri was first formally described in 2004 by Kevin Rule from a specimen collected on Mount Arapiles and the description was published in the journal Muelleria. The specific epithet honours the park ranger, Peter Hawker, for his contribution to the understanding of this species. Distribution and habitat This mallee is only known from the Mt. Arapiles area and nearby reserves where it grows in remnant woodland.

She had 27 books published. Her early work alternated between plots set in the Tudor period and the contemporary 1960s, some with flashbacks to the 1930s and 1940s. In later years she concentrated on Regency romance novels, and these formed by far the greater part of her output.  Biography  Dorothy Sheila Kinsman was born at 52 Cadogan Square within the sound of Bow Bells which made her a true Cockney. Her parents were Gerald Richard Vivian Kinsman and Dorothy (n√©e Whitaker). Aged four she travelled to South America where her father was Military Attache to Chile and Brazil. Apart from journeys home on leave she lived in Chile until she was nine. She worked for the Foreign Office and then at Kelvedon Hall, (the country home of Henry \\"Chips\\" Channon which had been temporarily converted into a convalescent home), and then for the Red Cross. In 1943 Sheila travelled on a troop ship to Algiers, and began three years of Red Cross work in North Africa, and Italy where she witnesses the eruption of Vesuvius (1944) as described to Raleigh Trevelyan in Shadow of Vesuvius. At around this time she met her husband Geoffrey Bishop, who, and ADMS was in charge of medical services in the area. On her way home in 1945 Sheila spent time in Rome and visited members of her mother's Whitaker family who had been more or less under house arrest during hostilities.Raleigh Trevelyan Princes Under the Volcano On her arrival in England her first port of call was St Mary's Hospital Paddington for an operation to save her failing eyesight. In 1947 Sheila married Geoffrey and began life in Shepton Mallet as a country doctor's wife, her daughter was born in 1948. In those days there were no health centres or doctor's receptionists. Long hours confined to the house manning the telephone led to the start of her writing career In the 1950s. In 1964, on her husband's retirement, they moved to 36 Belvedere, Bath. She was now registered blind. She joined the Jane Austen Society and NADFAS, became a guide at Number One Royal Crescent and volunteered for the Housebound Library Service. When Geoffrey died in 1987 (he was twenty one years her senior) She started going to Bristol University summer schools studying such topics as the Romantic Poets and archaeology. She left Bath in 2006 and moved to Cornwall for the last three years of her life. She had four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She died on 30 May 2009 and is buried at Penwith Woodland Burial ground near Penzance.  Themes and writing practice  Sheila's early work produced between 1958 and 1970 were Elizabethan and modern novels written more or less alternatively. After that, and because she was now living in Bath, she became fascinated by the Georgian period and most of her plots were set in the eighteenth century or Regency. All her novels were pure fiction but they related to places and or situations from her own life. The two exceptions to this were Penelope Devereux (1966) and The Favourite Sister (1967) the theme of these was the life and times of Robert Devereux Earl of Essex, Queen Elizabeth the First's favourite, from the viewpoint of his sister Penelope. She called her novels light entertainment though she disliked the label \\"Romance\\". She stated that her books, despite having a central love story, had a definite plot generally independent of the love interest, a tangle of relationships, something to be achieved and a mystery solved in the last chapter. She said the plots came very easily to her what she found slow and difficult was the writing, that is, choosing the actual words to use. Her first books were written by hand in exercise books and then typed out on her father's early 20th century Corona typewriter which had three rows of keys. Thereafter she had a larger machine. This situation continued until she could no longer read her own typescript at which point she \\"wrote\\" straight onto C90 cassette, copying this on to a second cassette on a twin track tape recorder making alterations along the way through the microphone. She typed out a copy of this (which she was unable to read) and passed this to a professional typist to make a fair copy for the publisher. A number of her earlier book jackets were illustrated by Val Biro.  Bibliography  * The Durable Fire (1958) * The House With Two Faces (1960) * The Second Husband.

The park was originally purchased by transportation industrialist, John Starin, in 1875 to serve as a summer resort for the wealthy in New York City. By the 1920s, with suburban growth rapidly increasing in Westchester County, the park was purchased by the Westchester County Parks Commission to provide recreational space for almost two million visitors a year in the early 1930s. Glen Island Park is eligible for the National Register of Historic places under Criterion A for its association to recreation and Criterion C for its architecture with its Colonial Revival Style buildings. The Glen Island Park‚Äôs landscape was designed by the notable early twentieth century New York City area landscape architect, Gilmore David Clarke. The mid-1920s design displays many features that survive today including a five span steel arch drawbridge to the mainland, a tree lined road terminating at a roundabout, parking lots, and a bath house separating the enlarged crescent shaped beach from a circular play field. The park‚Äôs circulation pattern prioritizes personal automobile transportation with the character and use of the park remaining consistent for over 80 years. Architecture The Glen Island Park Bath House, designed by Clinton F. Loyd in 1928 and completed in 1929, consists of a one-story, seven by three bay, U-shaped central block in the Colonial Revival Style with shingle cladding and two rectangular wing additions to the north and south. The steeply pitched, asphalt clad, hipped roof shelters the U-shaped main block. Double hung windows light the interior which houses administrative offices. An oversized cupola and three eyebrow windows rise above the roof structure and accent the buildings Colonial Revival aesthetic on the park side (west elevation). The beach side (east elevation) opens to an attractive courtyard which is created by the U-shaped building and an open roof structure, which is supported by columns. The north and south wings are sheltered by a contemporary mansard roof and clad in modern brick and polished concrete block veneer. These newer additions have a modern neo-colonial aesthetic that is complementary to the original central block, but differs from the building‚Äôs original 1928 design. These structures are support buildings that shelter the restrooms, showers, and changing stations for visitors of the park and bathing beach. The central block of the bath house is reminiscent of the original design seen in the 1928 architectural plans and in historic photographs. The minor changes include alterations to the original fenestration and the park side, vinyl window replacements, replacement of original columns with wider modern fiberglass columns, and the removal of an attractive balustrade on the beach side above the porch roof. The most impactful change, however, is the replacement of the building‚Äôs original restroom and shower wings. As originally constructed, these structures were lower and longer, with either a flat or open roof structure that created a theme of horizontality contrasting with and accenting the verticality of the main block‚Äôs Colonial Revival aesthetic. The original wings were constructed out of concrete in an Art Deco motif as a popular material and aesthetic of the time period. The most interesting original design element of the bath house building was the interplay between historical references and contemporary material elements that conversed with each other. That interplay was completely lost with the demolition of the original bath house wings.

Zegveld grew up on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee. After her law studies at the University of Utrecht she obtained a doctoral degree cum laude in 2000. She received several awards for her doctoral thesis Accountability of Armed Opposition Groups in International Law. In 2000, she was sworn in as a lawyer; and in 2005, she became a partner at Prakken d'Oliveira Human Rights Lawyers. At this law firm, Zegveld heads the International Law & Human Rights department, where her cases mainly focus on liability for violations of human rights and compensation for victims of war. Between 2006 and 2013, Zegveld was a professor at Leiden University, where she lectured on international humanitarian law, in particular on the rights of women and children during armed conflict. She has been professor of war reparations at the University of Amsterdam since the end of 2013. Liesbeth Zegveld is a member of the Dutch Human Rights Watch committee and former member of the Committee on Reparation for Victims of Armed Conflict within the International Law Association and a member of the Netherlands Society for International Law. Zegveld is well known for her work on the Srebrenica case, where she represented the relatives of two of the Bosnian victims of the Srebrenica massacre in 1995. Before the Dutch courts, Zegveld asserted that Dutchbat ‚Äì the Dutch battalion responsible for the protection of the Srebrenica enclave ‚Äì and the Dutch government knowingly exposed Muslims to the enemy. In 2013, the Dutch Supreme Court accepted the claim. In 2011, Zegveld represented nine widows in a case against the Dutch State for its involvement in the Rawagede massacre of 9 December 1947, during which their husbands were killed. Following a judgment by the Court of The Hague, the State decided to settle the matter, publicly apologising for its involvement and paying ‚Ç¨20.000 in compensation to every widow. In 2011 and 2013, Zegveld represented family members of victims of the Videla-regime in Argentina, who reported Jorge Zorreguieta (the father of Queen Maxima of the Netherlands) to the Public Prosecution Service for his role in the regime. Zegveld also represented the victims of chemical attacks during the Iraq-Iran war in the eighties in a case against Frans van Anraat, a Dutch businessman, who sold materials to produce chemical weapons to the Iraqi regime during the war. All victims were granted ‚Ç¨25.000 in damages. Another high-profile case was that of Azhar Sabah Jaloud, who was fatally shot at a Dutch checkpoint during the Iraq War in 2004. On behalf of the young man's father, Zegveld started a case against the Dutch State, which resulted in a successful complaint against The Netherlands before the European Court of Human Rights. On behalf of the Dutch trade union FNV (Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging) and a Bangladeshi migrant worker, Zegveld held the FIFA accountable for the mistreatment of migrant workers who prepare the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Zegveld is currently representing the families of the Moluccan train hijacking in 1977 at the Punt in a case against the Dutch Government.Molukse treinkapers zijn van dichtbij doodgeschoten (Volkskrant, 5 juni 2013) In July 2018, the Court of The Hague found that the Dutch State did not act unlawfully. An appeal in the case is pending. In 2018, Zegveld and her client persuaded Nederlandse Spoorwegen (the Dutch state-owned rail company) to pay compensation to survivors and relatives of those transported by trains to Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War.

His early influence was the works of Gustave Dor√©. While pursuing his studies, he was encouraged in the way of art by his mother, who found Gaston Rodriguez, an artist-engraver who from 1885 to 1887 taught and educated the young man's ability to see and transcribe only the essential. Andr√© Dauchez never abandoned this mode of expression, handling with dexterity the technique of etching. In 1887, his teacher allowed him to present his work after a painting by Eug√®ne Isabey at the Salon des Artistes fran√ßais. It was the first success for the young man of seventeen who received the encouragements of his peers. Between the years 1887 and 1893 Andr√© Dauchez continued working on etching and painting and further studied with Luc-Olivier Merson and at the Acad√©mie Julian.(fr) Site AJ records The influence that nourished the engraved works of Andr√© Dauchez was Rembrandt's work. Andr√© Dauchez had led a comprehensive study of the master and learned the art of light and the importance of values of white and black in a landscape rendering. He also studied Dutch landscape painter of the seventeenth century Jacob van Ruisdael, as well as some of his contemporaries and friends like Georges Gobo, Raoul Andr√© Ulmann, Albert Decaris, , Pierre-Louis Moreau.(fr) St√©phane Brugal -Brugal-antiquit√©s When his sister, Jeanne, married artist Lucien Simon, Dauchez was introduced to a circle of other artists like √âmile-Ren√© M√©nard, Edmond Aman-Jean, Charles Cottet, George Desvalli√®res, Maurice Denis and above all discovered coastal Brittany and Cornouaille, the bay of Douarnenez, Belle- √éle-en-Mer, B√©nodet, the river Odet and the charm of the area. Dauchez was seduced by the lines and force of the landscape. From then on, he will dedicate his work to transcribe the many faces of the Finist√®re' Cornwall which inspired his best pieces. Art critic Andr√© Chevrillon in Drogues et Peintures , Paris, 1940, describes the work of Andr√© Dauchez as an \\"expressive and faithful portrait of Brittany\\". From the end of 1893, and for over half a century Andr√© Dauchez will find an inexhaustible source of inspiration in the landscapes of the Cornish coast: heath, dunes, villages, fishermen, estuaries and coves lined with pine trees, edges of coastline and rivers, rocks at low tide, open landscapes are his favorite motifs. He was an outdoor painter who described the effects on his soul of trees, stones, water and light. Andr√© Dauchez' works often present a cluster of trees, a trail, or a body of water, while in the background fades the rest of the composition with contrasts of light and shadow giving intensity to his work in a composition in which one feels life vibrating, transcribing the different effects of shade, sun or wind that alter the appearance of a landscape. Dauchez' talent lies in landscape drawing allied to a subtle artistic sensibility.(fr) Dacier, √âmile in La Revue de l'art ancien et moderne , Paris 1923  Collections  * Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsayMistral/JocondeMistral Arcade * Chicago Art Institute Artic.edu * Smithsonian American Art Museum * Tokyo National Museum of Western ArtNational Museum of Western art * Finnish National Gallery (fi) kokoelmat.fng.fi * British Museum.

Weiner is considered to be one of the pioneers of contemporary Jewish genealogy through her work to open up archives and is described as a trail- blazing, highly respected guide and leading authority on archival holdings and resources in pre-war Belarus, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, and Ukraine.  Early life  Weiner was born in Los Angeles, California, to Edward and Helen Weiner. She grew up in Des Moines, Iowa. In 1960, Weiner graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa. She attended the University of Oklahoma and Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. In 1986, she received a B.A. in Historical Studies with a concentration in Modern Judaic History and Holocaust Studies from Empire State College, SUNY.  Career = Early career  After attending college, Weiner moved to Southern California and worked for the Orange County Sheriff's Department in Santa Ana, California. During this time, she also took courses in criminal justice at Orange Coast College. From 1969 to 1971, she was country singer Bobbie Gentry's assistant and road manager. She got the job by answering an advertisement in the newspaper. Weiner worked as a paralegal for various attorneys in Beverly Hills, California. Weiner was then licensed as a private investigator by the State of California, which she said helped her later in her ‚Äúnext life‚Äù as a genealogist. Weiner moved to Northern California and lived on a horse ranch and worked as a real estate agent. In 1984, Weiner moved to Albany, New York, where her mother was born and many family members still lived, while she finished her college degree.  Genealogy  Miriam Weiner makes photo copy of her grandmother's birth record located in the Priluki Town Hall, Ukraine, 1991 In 1985, with the recommendation of Rabbi Malcolm H. Stern, genealogist for the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Fellow of the American Society of Genealogists, Weiner became the first Jewish genealogist to be certified by the Board for Certification of Genealogists in Washington, D.C. As part of the ongoing certification process, the Board for Certification of Genealogists has required intensive review and continuing education, resulting in separate renewals (every 5 years) of Weiner's genealogical work over 30+ years. From 1986 to 1988, Weiner was executive director of the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors in New York City, which was founded by Benjamin Meed. Amongst her duties, Weiner helped develop the database of Holocaust survivors, now known as the Benjamin and Vladka Meed Registry of Holocaust Survivors, that is now housed at the United States Holocaust Memorial. From 1987 to 1996, Weiner was a syndicated columnist, writing the column \\"Roots and Branches\\", which was published in more than 100 Jewish newspapers and periodicals, both domestically and internationally. In 1988, inspired by reconnecting with her extended maternal family from Albany at a funeral, Weiner expanded the research of her family's roots with a renewed focus on Eastern Europe. This was before the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, when it was virtually impossible to obtain access to archives for genealogical purposes in that part of the world. In 1989, as a result of the genealogy research and outreach from Weiner's syndicated column, \\"Roots and Branches\\", the Polish National Tourist Office (PNTO) extended an invitation for Weiner to visit Poland for the purpose of meeting with the head archivists and also to make plans for subsequent Jewish tour groups to visit their ancestral towns in Poland. Weiner found that the perception that Jewish documents were completely destroyed during World War II by the occupation of Nazi and Soviet governments was untrue. Weiner gained permission from the head archivist in Poland to create a town-by-town index to surviving Jewish and civil documents in archives throughout Poland. She did this with the official cooperation of the Polish State Archives.  Routes to Roots  In 1990, Weiner founded the company, Routes to Roots, which offered archival research services to individuals throughout the world. Through Routes to Roots, Weiner organized customized tours to ancestral towns for individuals and groups interested in Poland and the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland. Weiner undertook these tours of ancestral towns at a time when there was little to no technology, and difficulties specific to Jewish genealogy included the lack of surnames until the late 1700s, the fluidity of surnames due to immigration and language, and the destruction of documents during The Holocaust. Through Routes to Roots, Weiner has conducted genealogical research in the archives of Poland and the former Soviet Union.  Routes to Roots Foundation  In 1994, Weiner founded the Routes to Roots Foundation, a nonprofit organization. The Routes to Roots Foundation hosts a website which includes a town-by-town index and inventory of surviving Jewish and civil documents held at archives and institutions in Eastern Europe, Israel and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. The website includes articles by archivists, historians and scholars; maps; document examples; name lists for about a dozen towns; as well as other reference material. Much of this information now available online was originally published in two books by the Routes to Roots Foundation, although the books include additional detailed content and images. As part of the activities of the Routes to Roots Foundation, Weiner donated copies of the books to the individual archives in Poland, Ukraine, and Moldova in appreciation of their assistance and as a way to improve the discoverability of their holdings relating to Jewish genealogical sources. Weiner also donated copies of the books to Jewish genealogical organizations. = Jewish Roots in Poland = In 1997, in official cooperation with the Polish State Archives (Naczelna Dyrekcja Archiw√≥w Pa≈Ñstwowych in Warsaw, Poland), Weiner authored and published the book, Jewish Roots in Poland. Eric Schucht, \\"Genealogy Rock Star Discusses Digging Up Jewish Roots,\\" Jewish Exponent (December 19, 2019). The book includes archival holdings of the Polish State Archives, the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, local town hall documents throughout Poland, Holocaust documents found in the archives of the death camps located in Auschwitz near Krak√≥w and Majdanek near Lublin. The book also features document examples, maps, antique postcards depicting towns and daily life, and modern-day photographs. There are individual town listings for localities with more than 10,000 Jews in 1939. = Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova = In 1999, in official cooperation with the Ukraine State Archives (Ukra√Ønskyi derzhavnyi arkhiv) and the Moldova National Archives (ArhivƒÉ Na≈£ionalƒÉ a Republicii Moldova), Weiner authored and published Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova. The book includes archival holdings of the Ukraine State Archives and its branch archives throughout the country and the Moldova National Archives in Chi»ôinƒÉu as well as local town hall documents throughout Ukraine and Moldova. The book also features document examples, maps, antique postcards depicting towns and daily life, and modern-day photographs. There are individual town listings for localities throughout both countries. = Belarus and Lithuania = The Routes to Roots Foundation website also includes articles by archivists and historians, maps and archive data from Belarus and Lithuania, presented in a similar format as Weiner's two books. Originally envisioned as a third book in the Jewish Roots series, this information is only found in this online format. = Archive Database = In 2002, an online Archive Database containing detailed information about archives listed in Weiner's books on Poland, Ukraine, and Moldova was published on the Routes to Roots Foundation website. The Archive Database was then supplemented with similar data from Belarus, Lithuania, and selected archives in Romania. The database continues to be updated by Weiner.  Additional work  Weiner is a former Advisory Board Member of the American Red Cross organization, Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and Information Center. Weiner lectures and gives workshops and has presented her research at Jewish genealogy organizations and events, both domestically and internationally.  Legacy  Weiner has been described as \\"the Indiana Jones of prewar Polish Jewry.\\" Weiner has discovered previously unknown archival holdings and then had this information translated and made available to the public via her books and website; in so doing, she has been described as ‚ÄúThe genealogist who lifted the archival iron curtain.‚Äù\\"Rabbi Malcom H. Stern Humanitarian Award: Miriam Weiner\\" in \\"Paul Milner receives David S. Vogels Jr. Award from FGS\\", Milner Genealogy September 4, 2020. Weiner was responsible for changing the perception that there were no Jewish ancestral documents available after The Holocaust. Because of her early travels to Eastern Europe, beginning in Poland in 1989 and Ukraine in 1990, and the time she spent in working in the archives there, Weiner was able to debunk the myth that existed at that time, an assumption that all Jewish documents were destroyed during the Holocaust. With her column ‚ÄúRoots and Branches‚Äù and along with her lecture schedule, she made this discovery available and accessible to Jews throughout the world. In addition to finding that documents had survived, Weiner organized the information, pre- internet, so that it was easier for genealogists researching their families to find information about archives, museums, and libraries with family documents. The original data in the archives needed to be translated, coded by document type and manually entered into an organized format. The result was the Archive Database created by Weiner, which then became available to the public in her two books and via the Routes to Roots Foundation website.  Donations of genealogical and archival material  Weiner has donated collected materials and organized research to various archives, institutions and organizations. The items include books, maps, town brochures, video cassettes, archive inventories, and document copies. * American Sephardi Federation * Association of Holocaust Organizations * Association of Jewish Libraries * Center for Jewish History's Ackman & Ziff Family Genealogy Institute * Center for Jewish History Collectionshttp://search.cjh.org:1701/primo- explore/search?query=any,contains,%22Miriam%20Weiner%22&tab;=default_tab&search;_scope=CJH_SCOPE&sortby;=rank&vid;=beta‚ü®=en_US&mode;=simple&fromRedirectFilter;=true * Central State Historical Archives of Ukraine in Kyiv * Chernivtsy Regional Welfare Fund in Chernivtsy, Ukraine * Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society * Jewish Genealogy Society of Greater Philadelphia * JewishGen donation of extensive materials underway * JewishGen Bessarabia SIG Group * JewishGen Belarus SIG Group * Jewish Historical Institute, Warsaw, Poland Grygier, Urszula (8-Jul-1998), Letter of Donation: Jewish Historical Institute (≈ªydowski Instytut Historyczny) * JRI-Poland * Judaica Foundation ‚Äì Center For Jewish Culture in Krak√≥w, Poland * Latvian State Historical Archives (Latvijas Valsts Vƒìstures Arhƒ´vs) in Riga, Latvia * Library of Congress * Lithuanian State Archives (Lietuvos Archyv≈≥ Departamentas) in Vilnius, Lithuania * Russian American Jewish Experience * St. Louis County Library * Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine in Kiev, Ukraine * Yeshiva University and Yeshiva University's Sephardic Reference Room * YIVO Institute for Jewish Research  Partnership agreements  In 2009, the Miriam Weiner Routes to Roots Foundation, Inc. and The Generations Network, Inc. aka Ancestry.com entered into a partnership agreement that granted Ancestry.com a semi-exclusive right and limited license to display the Archive Database and 1,200 images on the Ancestry.com website.

The mine was dug by the Tunnelling Companies of the Royal Engineers under a German machine-gun nest known as (appendix) in the front line, on the north side of the village of La Boisselle in the Somme . The mine was named after Y Sap, the British trench from which the gallery was driven. It was one of 19 mines on the British sector to be blown at the start of the battle. Y Sap mine was sprung at on 1 July 1916 and left a large crater. The explosion of the Y Sap mine failed to assist the British attack as the German eavesdroppers at the 28 listening station intercepted and passed on the British \\"good luck\\" message. The Germans removed machine-guns from the and at Zero Hour the machine-gunners caught the British infantry in crossfire. The 34th Division had the highest number of casualties of any of the divisions involved on 1 July. The crater of the Y Sap mine was filled in after World War I and is no longer visible. Background=1914 French and German military operations began on the Somme in September 1914. A German advance westwards towards Albert was stopped by the French at La Boisselle and attempts to resume mobile warfare in October failed. Both sides reduced their attacks to local operations or raids and began to fortify their remaining positions with underground works. On 18 December, the French captured the La Boisselle village cemetery at the west end of a German salient and established an advanced post only from the German front line. By 24 December, the French had forced the Germans back from the cemetery and the western area of La Boisselle but were stopped a short distance forward at , in front of German trenches protected by barbed wire. Once the location of a farm and a small number of buildings, became known as (Shell Farm) to the Germans, and later as the Glory Hole to the British. On Christmas Day 1914, French engineers sank the first mine shaft at La Boisselle. 1915 Fighting continued in no man's land at the west end of La Boisselle, where the opposing lines were apart, even during lulls along the rest of the Somme front. On the night of a German sapper inadvertently broke into French mine gallery, which he found to have been charged with explosives; a group of volunteers took 45 minutes to dismantle the charge and cut the firing cables. From April 1916, were sprung around , some loaded with of explosives. At the end of July 1915, fresh troops were observed moving into the French positions north of the Somme and on 1 August, they were identified at Thiepval Wood as British soldiers (\\"dressed in brown suits\\"). The British had formed the 178th and 179th Tunnelling companies in August, followed by the 185th and 252nd Tunnelling companies in October. Brigadier-General George Fowke the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, moved the 174th and 183rd Tunnelling Companies into the area but at first the British did not have enough miners to take over the large number of French shafts; the problem was temporarily solved when the French agreed to leave their engineers behind for several weeks. On 24 July, the 174th Tunnelling Company established headquarters at Bray, taking over some 66 shafts at Carnoy, Fricourt, Maricourt and La Boisselle. No man's land just south-west of La Boisselle was very narrow, at one point about wide, and had become pockmarked by many chalk craters. Elaborate precautions were taken to preserve secrecy, since no continuous front line trench ran through the area opposite the west end of La Boisselle and the British front line. The site was defended by posts near the mine shafts. The underground war continued with offensive mining to destroy opposing strong points and defensive mining to destroy tunnels, which were long. Around La Boisselle, the Germans dug defensive transverse tunnels about long, parallel to the front line. On 19 November 1915, the 179th Tunnelling Company commander, Captain Henry Hance, estimated that the Germans were away and ordered the mine chamber to be loaded with of explosives, which was completed by midnight on At the Germans blew the charge, filling the remaining British tunnels with carbon monoxide. The right and left tunnels collapsed; it was later found that the German explosion had detonated the British mine. Prelude=1916 At the start of the Battle of Albert (1‚Äì13 July), the name given by the British to the first two weeks of the Battle of the Somme, La Boisselle stood on the centre of the British attack. The tunnelling companies were to help the Allied preparations for the battle by placing 19 mines of various sizes under the German positions along the front line and by preparing a series of shallow Russian saps from the British front line into no man's land, which would be opened at Zero Hour to allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a much shorter distance. At La Boisselle, four mines were prepared by the Royal Engineers, two charges (No 2 straight and No 5 right) were planted at L'√Ælot at the end of galleries dug from Inch Street Trench by the 179th Tunnelling Company, intended to wreck German tunnels and create crater lips to block enfilade fire along no man's land. As the Germans in La Boisselle had fortified the cellars of ruined houses and the cratered ground made a direct infantry assault on the village impossible, two further mines, known as Y Sap, the British name for the German strongpoint and Lochnagar after the trench from which the gallery was dug, were planted to the north-east and the south-east of La Boisselle to assist the attack on either side of the German salient in the village. In January and February 1916, British raiding parties had discovered that the strongpoint (Y Sap to the British) was protected by a system of deep mines. Y Sap mine was dug underneath the strongpoint, which overlooked Mash Valley, just north of La Boisselle. The mine consisted of a gallery dug from the British front line, near where it crossed the road to a mine chamber under the . Because the Germans had built tunnels deep and transverse defensive galleries deep and parallel to the German front line, the gallery could not be dug in a straight line. The gallery was dug about into no man's land, then doglegged to the right for about another . About of ammonal was placed in the chamber under Y Sap (the ). To keep quiet, the tunnellers used bayonets with spliced handles and worked barefoot on a floor covered with sandbags. Flints were carefully prised out of the chalk and laid on the floor; if the bayonet was manipulated two-handed, an assistant caught the dislodged material. Spoil was placed in sandbags, passed hand-to-hand along a row of miners sitting on the floor and stored along the side of the tunnel, later to be used to tamp the charge. Lochnagar and Y Sap mines were overcharged to ensure that large rims were formed from the disturbed ground and communication tunnels were also dug for use immediately after the first attack. The mines were laid without interference by German miners but while the ammonal was being placed, German troops of the 9th Company, RIR 110 could hear the British miners but not where they were; German miners could be heard by the British miners below Lochnagar and above Y Sap mine. Captain Henry Hance, commander of the 179th Tunnelling Company, doubted the effect of the British destructive artillery bombardment and recommended blowing Y Sap mine two days early, to destroy the and prevent enfilade fire from it during the British attack. The crater could be occupied by the British infantry and used by the Royal Engineers to dig an advanced jumping-off trench for the British infantry, which would reduce the distance the British infantry would have to cross by over . Hance's superiors agreed that firing Y Sap mine early could help to neutralise enemy fire from the flanks around La Boisselle but the explosion would alert the Germans that a British attack was imminent and the suggestion was rejected. Battle=1 July The four mines at La Boisselle were detonated at on 1 July 1916, the first day on the Somme. Y Sap and Lochnagar mines were the largest mines ever detonated. The blast was the largest man-made sound in history and some reports said that it could be heard from London. The explosion of Y Sap mine left a large crater but failed to assist the British attack at Zero Hour as the Germans had detected the mine in time, evacuated the position and caught the British infantry in crossfire, particularly the troops of the 102nd (Tyneside Scottish) Brigade (Brigadier-General T. P. B. Tiernan), on the left flank of the 34th Division. The brigade suffered the worst losses of any brigade on the first day on the Somme, many of the casualties occurring behind the British front-line. Losses in the brigade on 1 July were so severe that on 6 July, the brigade was swapped with a brigade of the 37th Division. 2nd Lieutenant Cecil Lewis of 3 Squadron RFC, flying a Morane Parasol, watched from above Thiepval, almost away, Analysis The detonation of Y Sap and Lochnagar mines failed to neutralise the German defences in La Boisselle. The mines were expected to provide some protection against German machine-gun fire, by creating mounds around the crater rims and a smoke screen was to cover La Boisselle at zero hour but the wind blew it away from the village. Prior and Wilson criticised the bombardment plan for lifting the heavy artillery off the German front line at thirty minutes before the infantry advance, which meant that its fire for the rest of the day was ineffective. Field artillery and field howitzers were left to suppress the German defenders for the last thirty minutes but had little destructive power against field fortifications. The German eavesdroppers who warned of the attack, enabled the Germans to vacate the underground shelters near Y Sap in time and shoot down the infantry of the fourth brigade column. La Boisselle was meant to fall within twenty minutes but it was captured by the British and re-captured by the Germans several times before it finally fell on 4 July, the divisions III Corps having suffered more than the worst losses of the British divisions engaged on 1 July. The 19th Division was rushed forward in case of a German counter-attack on Albert. Post-war After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the inhabitants of La Boisselle returned and rebuilt their houses.

It was formerly home to a steel works and power station which were the area‚Äôs major employers; the sites are now occupied by a housing development and modern industrial estate respectively. Administratively, Westburn is within the Cambuslang East ward of the South Lanarkshire Council area and has a population of around 2,000. Location Due to its physical isolation from the main built-up areas of Cambuslang, Westburn has something of a rural village character as opposed to a neighbourhood in a medium-sized town. The River Clyde runs to the north of the village, opposite the Carmyle district of Glasgow ‚Äì the banks were previously connected by Westburn Viaduct, a disused rail bridge, but that has now been blocked off.Westburn (Carmyle) Viaduct, Forgotten Relics, 2017 To the south is the West Coast Main Line railway line with the district of Halfway beyond that. To the east, Westburn is separated from the neighbouring district of Newton by a small burn. To the west, a park and golf course form a boundary with the Circuit neighbourhood and the Cambuslang town centre. History=Ancient Estate The Westburn name has appeared on local maps for centuries, but initially this was a country house and a nearby farm closer to Cambuslang Main Street than the current village. The estate of Westburn existed from the late middle ages and was largely in the hands of minor nobility, members of the Clan Hamilton who latterly married into the Clan Dundas. The last Westburn House was built in 1685 but the later owners failed to maintain it well, and in the 1890s it was demolished and a golf course (Cambuslang Golf Club) was laid out in the grounds. Doocot from Westburn House estate at Cambuslang Golf Club An octagonal doocot from the 18th century in the middle of the course is the surviving feature of the old estate (and is a Category B listed building). The farm buildings to the east are presently an indoor go-kart racing circuit. Part of the estate which nowadays is housing was a football ground at the end of the 19th century; Westburn Park was home at various times to Cambuslang F.C., Cambuslang Hibernian and the surviving local club Cambuslang Rangers. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the area where modern Westburn is now situated was merely open ground with a small road running down towards Newton House on the other side of the burn. 19th Century A notable feature in the area was the local cemetery located on high ground, which still serves the Cambuslang population to this day and has been extended several times. It has records from 1889 although there are headstones on the site dating from the 1750s. This was also the location of Old Cambuslang or Cambuslangtown, the hamlet from which the town took its name as it became larger ‚Äì this settlement did not last beyond the 19th century. Westburn Cemetery A small colliery operated in Westburn from 1875 until 1905 and had a branch railway connecting it to the main lines. There was also a small tile works in the mid 19th century, and later some row cottages (for railway workers) and a public house were built near to Newton railway station and the Hallside Steelworks on the other side of the railway tracks. One of the oldest surviving buildings in the district housed a small cinema ('The Empire') for a time; it has long since been converted to use as a workshop. Steel Village Westburn was transformed with the arrival of its own steel works in 1921. The Redpath Brown & Co firm was established in 1802 in Edinburgh and had premises in Glasgow by 1905 but needed a bigger site and identified Westburn (on the road to Newton House) as the location for their new works. The business proved very successful, and a network of houses (around 160 dwellings, mainly cottage flats) was built alongside for the workers. A group of uncommon black 'Swedish timber' houses (64 dwellings) was also constructed on the south side of Westburn Road up to the railway lines;Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow (page 504), Elizabeth Williamson, Anne Riches, Malcolm Higgs, 1990, Call for South Lanarkshire Council to rethink insulation plan for iconic Westburn houses, Daily Record, 7 April 2017 (the same style can be seen within Lanarkshire including at High Blantyre and Birkenshaw, although many less distinctive examples are found in other parts of Scotland.Swedish Timber Framed House, British Iron & Steel Federation[Swedish Timber Houses (Glasgow City Archives, Department of Architectural and Civic Design, 1945)], The Glasgow Story Housing at Westfarm on the site of the steel works Redpath Brown & Co were acquired by ironmaking giant Bolckow, Vaughan which was the driving force in the growth of Middlesbrough but they soon ran into difficulties and was bought over by another firm from that area, Dorman Long; the Redpath Brown works at Westburn was well suited to their speciality of bridge building (including Sydney Harbour Bridge). After building landing craft duggin World War II, in 1967 the group became part of British Steel Corporation and was renamed Redpath Dorman Long Ltd, later Redpath Engineering Ltd. The residential portion of Westburn had expanded further ‚Äì comprising around 120 family homes - by the time the works ceased operations in 1990, with the resultant job losses leading to considerable financial hardship in the community. The fact that the other major employers in the local area, the larger Hallside Steelworks (1873-1979) and the Clydesmill Power Station (1903-1982) had also folded in the recent past did not help matters. The power station had been built on the river at an old mill weir (traces of which are still visible) and at one point had the largest generating capacity in Scotland. Westburn was also the scene of a tragedy in 1991 when the Newton rail accident occurred on the tracks right next to the village. The site of the steelworks is now a suburban housing estate ‚Äì Westfarm or Newton Grange (around 250 dwellings), built between 2004 and 2009. The old colliery was also converted to modern housing (Overton Grange, around 230 dwellings) with its streets named after local metalworking firms including Redpath, Arrol, Colville and Dalzell. Westburn Today Like many former industrial locations across Scotland, in the 21st century the people of Westburn are attempting to maintain and modernise their community in the face of economic challenges. The 2016 Scottish index of multiple deprivation results suggested those living in the older part of the district were still struggling in some ways after a generation of underemployment. The new affluent housing estates in the area (and in neighbouring Newton Farm) have been designed with homeowners commuting to work in central Glasgow or elsewhere in mind, due to the proximity of the M74 Motorway (5 minutes by car) and Newton station (10 minutes on foot). The secluded area around the footbridge to Newton was a congregating point for local youths for many years, with antisocial behaviour often resulting - this continued after the surrounding land was dug up and fenced off for housebuilding as part of the Newton Farm CGA project, and after public gatherings were banned during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland.Teenagers gathering on Cambuslang street to drink, take drugs and have sex, Daily Record, 7 April 2017Police officer hit by rocks as she tried to split up gathering, STV News, 25 April 2020 Amenities Westburn has good recreational provision; there is a children‚Äôs play area in the east of the village (on the site of the old row cottages), and this is also the location of the community centre where birthday parties, dance classes etc. can be booked. There are other play areas in the new housing estates, and a full-size grass football field at Peter Brownlee Park which is well used by children's teams. The Clyde Walkway runs alongside the river to the north of Westburn, although at that point it is simply a muddy track, and National Cycle Route 75 runs through the south side of the village offering a safe bicycle route towards Glasgow (it is less safe in the other direction towards Uddingston which joins busy country roads). The Scotkart facility is also an option, albeit this is an expensive hobby ‚Äì a popular informal alternative in the area is the riding of quad and motocross bikes through the nearby fields. Other amenities are somewhat lacking in the village. There are no schools or nurseries (there is a facility known as Westburn Nursery, but this is actually in the Circuit neighbourhood closer to Central Cambuslang);About Us, Westburn Nursery however a large nondenominational primary school and nursery in Newton opened in 2017. The local Catholic school, St Charles' Primary, is also in Newton. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service National Training Centre There are no local healthcare facilities, no places of worship and just one licensed grocer incorporating a post office by way of shops. Its location on the south side of the main road through the district (while most residents live on the north side) was also a concern in the community as children and the elderly put themselves at risk trying to cross against speeding vehicles ‚Äì the road had no pedestrian crossing or other traffic calming measures in place and the road became increasingly busier in recent years due to new housing in Newton and Drumsagard Village. After a concerted effort by local residents over several years, a pelican crossing was installed outside the grocer in mid-2019.Joy in Westburn as work starts on road crossing, Daily Record, 16 April 2019 The small public house from the 19th century survived in various hands until 2016 when it closed awaiting redevelopment, being converted into a fast food takeaway the following year. Another old pub still operates in Newton, but most facilities are located in central Cambuslang and Halfway. Commerce There is a modern industrial estate near Westburn at the site of the former power station.

He was the man who won the heart of Count P√°l Teleki for Scouting. While the Hungarian Sea Scouts were attending a Sea Scout rally in the summer of 1927 at Helsing√∏r, Denmark, G√©za Teleki was inclined on a cruise to ignore a reprimand from his Scoutmaster, Fritz M. de Moln√°r, for failure to carry out a small but necessary exercise of seamanship. Moln√°r tried to drive home his point by threatening to tell the boy's father on their return to Budapest, but G√©za replied, \\"Oh, Dad's not interested in Scouting.\\" This prompted Moln√°r to take up the subject of Scouting with Count P√°l Teleki, who became interested.
