Shows the course of the river highlighted on a topographic map. The river flows from its source at an unnamed lake to Hudson Bay at the village of Puvirnituq. Its watershed encompasses . The name of the river comes from the Inuktitut \\"smells like rotten meat.\\" The \\"Povungnituk River\\" crosses for 40.9 km from east to west the northern limit of the Pingualuit National Park which is characterized by the Pingualuit crater. This crater is located 16.7 km south of the \\"Puvirnituq River\\". The surface of the Puvirnituq River is generally frozen annually from October to June (sometimes until July). In the summer, a supply boat moves into the bay for about , to the village of Puvirnituq; barges are then used to connect the boat and the dock. Sometimes during the spring flood, ice jams form on the river. Sport fishing is popular at the foot of the first (about ), second (about ) and third (about ) falls from the confluence of this river and Hudson Bay.  Geography  The surrounding hydrographic slopes of the Puvirnituq River are: * north side: Qikirtaluup Kuunga River, Little Puvirnituq River; * east side: Ungava Bay; * south side: North River (Hudson Bay), Lac Guillaume-Delisle, P√©loquin Lake, Vachon River, Nantais Lake, Manarsulik Lake (formerly named \\"Lake Laflamme\\"), Pingualuit crater; * west side: Hudson Bay. 'Course of the river from the head' (segment of ) The \\"Puvirnituq River\\" originates from a small unnamed lake (elevation: ) of mountain located west of the watershed between the Ungava Bay watershed, Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait. This head lake (length: ; width: ) is surrounded by mountains of more than in altitude on the south side, on the north-west side and on the east side. This lake is located at northeast of Rinfret Lake which flows into the Deception River East (which is part of the Hudson Strait), north of Raglan Lake and west of the northern village of Kangiqsujuaq located on the west shore of Ungava Bay. From the mouth (located to the south) of the lake, the water flows into the \\"Puvirnituq River\\" which flows south through some lakes formed by the lake. flare of the river. From there, the river branches off to the west where it flows over to cross a river coming from the north. Then the river flows south on to the outlet of Lake Saint- Germain (coming from the south), the northern limit of Pingualuit National Park. The latter lake is located northeast of Manarsulik Lake (formerly Lacflamme Lake), which is the head lake of the Vachon River, a tributary of the Arnaud River. The latter flows north-east to spill over the western coast of Ungava Bay. The Pingualuit crater is located south of Manarsulik Lake at . From the outlet of Lake Saint-Germain, the \\"Puvirnituq River\\" flows westward ( to the outlet of lake Nantais. Then the river resumes its course on a last segment of , crossing Lake Natirnaaliup Tasinga and another lake until pouring on the northeast shore of Lake Lallemand. 'Course downstream of Lake Lallemand' (segment of ) The Puvirnituq River takes its headwaters from Lallemand Lake (length: in the north-south direction, width: ). This complex form of water has some dozens of islands, many peninsulas and bays. This lake receives on the northeastern side the waters of the Little Puvirnituq River. South of the lake, the mouth is a strait of long, crossing several bodies of water. The river flows south on crossing a body of water formed by the widening of the river. Then the river continues south ( to the north shore of Chamberlaine Lake, which flows westward on (including the strait that connects Chamberlaine Lake to the following body of water). Puvirnituq Bay is located on Hudson Bay; it has a secondary bay stretching over inland until the first which is formed by the Avarqutaak Islands. Going up these falls and the Kuukallak pass, one reaches the Puvirnituq lake which is crossed by the Puvirnituq river. The village of Puvirnituq is located on the north shore of the latter bay, facing Fat Island and Qikirtaaluk Island. The Formal River (coming from the South-East) flows to the south shore of this bay, ie from the entrance to the bay. The main tributaries of the Puvirnituq River are: * Little Puvirnituq River which flows almost straight to the southwest parallel to the upper part of the Puvirnituq River, to discharge on the north shore of the German Lake. The latter lake is the main body of water in the Puvirnituq River; * Decoumte River, coming from the southeast. While flowing to the southwest, the river flows through Papittukaaq Lake and Puvirnituq Lake before spilling over the eastern shore of Hudson Bay at the height of the village of Puvirnituq .  Toponymy  The term \\"Puvirnituq\\" is used to refer to the northern village, lake, river, small river, mountains and national park reserve.

Campaign Governing coalition members Fine Gael and Labour Party supported abolishing the Seanad citing a 20 million euros reduction in spending and fewer politicians, meanwhile Fianna F√°il opposed the proposal on the grounds that voters should \\"demand real reform\\". Democracy Matters opposed the measure citing it as a power grab; more specifically, they referenced the biggest majority for a government coalition ever. It also pointed to five reasons to vote no: real reform, accountability, revive the economy, defend the constitution of Ireland and protecting rights. Sinn F√©in also supported the motion. Taoiseach Enda Kenny said the abolition would result in a leaner, more effective and more accountable system of government. Due to representation for large number of religious minorities (Protestants) in the first few Senate sessions, it has been a voice of Northern Ireland in introducing their perspective to national government. At the time, there were a large number of Protestant representative for the Roman Catholic majority. As such former senators Seamus Mallon (former Social Democratic and Labour Party MLA), Maurice Hayes (former Northern Ireland Ombudsman) and John Robb opposed the measure of abolition. Robb said that the abolition could \\"exclude the possibility of northern input into southern politics. I think it is very important to sustain that link, and it will not be sustained at political level, except by party politics blowing across the so-called border;\\" Mallon added that representation of six-county Northern Ireland was \\"very valuable\\" but that it should be from a \\"broader base. If you're simply going to have input from people in the mainstream party politics then it defeats its own purpose. There has been a huge reluctance on unionists to take nominations to the senate, that's a fact of life.\\" Hayes added: It (the Seanad) might not have stopped a bill but it has certainly improved a lot of bills. [While it is] hard to defend the senate in its present form, [something is needed to] keep a curb [on government ministers]. The D√°il is dominated by whichever government is in power, and there's no check on them really at all.\\" He cited the dismissal of TD Lucinda Creighton from her ministerial post the same year for voting against party policy on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 as evidence of suppressing independent opinions by the whip system. As such, he also noted that as a senator he had voted against Bertie Ahern, even though Ahern nominated him. Mallon said similarly that he \\"didn't go to the senate to take up a party whip. John Robb and myself are very clear about this, we went there as independents, we spoke as independents and we voted as independents. [The Seanad offered] a new layer of both academic and technical and political expertise.

Flight Lieutenant Anthony Noel \\"Tony\\" Snell (19 March 1922 - 4 August 2013), was a British RAF pilot during the Second World War. He flew in the North African campaign in 1942 and was shot down during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. Initially captured by the Germans he escaped from a firing squad but was recaptured. He again escaped German captivity whilst in Italy and became one of the very few men to be awarded the DSO exclusively for escaping from the enemy. Second World War Snell was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in 1922 and attended Cheltenham College. In November 1940 he volunteered for the RAF and was shipped to the United States for pilot training under the \\"Arnold\\" Scheme. =North Africa= Snell returned to Britain during the summer of 1942 and joined No. 242 Squadron RAF flying Spitfires. In October 1942 his unit was transferred to North Africa to provide air cover for the Operation Torch landings. For the rest of 1942 and into early 1943, Snell's squadron provided air interception and ground attack sorties in support of the British First Army as it drove towards Tunis. =Sicily= After the capitulation of Axis forces in May 1943, 242 Squadron was reassigned to Malta to refit for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. On 10 July 1943, Snell was detailed to provide air cover over the Allied beachhead but was 'bounced' by German Messerschmitt 109 fighters. His Spitfire was hit and he crash landed in enemy territory. He initially ran into an Italian patrol and then a German one that fired at him. In his attempt to escape from the Germans he found he had hidden in a minefield. After slowly finding his way out of the minefield he was captured by the Germans near an airfield. Thinking Snell was a spy they intended to execute him. Snell made another run for it and managed to again escape but was wounded in the right shoulder. =Escape from captivity= Weakened by his wound Snell was recaptured but this time was able to prove he was an Allied pilot. Treated for his wounds he was later transferred to a military hospital in Lucca. After Italy surrendered in September 1943 the Germany Army took control of the prison camp, and directed that the prisoners be transferred by train to Germany. While other prisoners on the train distracted the guards Snell, along with Major Per Lewis, escaped through a small window. The following morning they found they were near Mantua. After a six-day walk they encountered members of the Italian resistance movement near the small village of Fabrico, who helped them hide in a safe house in Modena for almost two months. With help from the resistance the pair gradually made it to the Swiss border, and they returned to Britain in November 1944. Lewis was mentioned in despatches on 1 January 1945, and Snell was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, a rare example of the award given for escaping from the enemy. Snell spent time in hospital recuperating and later joined No. 504 Squadron RAF flying Gloster Meteor jet fighters. The squadron was assigned to Germany just after hostilities ceased and Snell remained August 1946 until discharged from the RAF a short while later. Post war Snell travelled through Africa and met his future wife Jackie in New York in 1964. They travelled together in the United States and Mexico. He worked as an actor in films and theatre, and also as a songwriter and entertainer throughout his life. He recorded the album An Englishman Abroad whilst in New York. Returning to the UK in 1966, Snell and Jackie moved to Ibiza where they ran a charter service on a catamaran they had sailed there. In 1970 he moved to the British Virgin Islands to run an unsuccessful boat charter company. His wife had opened a restaurant called The Last Resort which burnt down. Selling everything left in Ibiza the Snells rebuilt the restaurant into a success. Snell continued to provide entertainment to patrons up until his death. He wrote an account of his life in Spitfire Troubadour.

Ramos. It was aimed to modernize all branches of the AFP such as the Philippine Air Force, Philippine Navy and the Philippine Army. The law was intended to last for 15 years with an initial budget of 50 billion pesos for the first five years, but the funding was stopped due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. After the financial crisis, the funding for the AFP modernization was halted and later neglected by successive administrations until the law expired in 2010. On December 11, 2012, the Republic Act no. 7898 was amended by Republic Act No. 10349 also known as the revised AFP modernization act which extends the modernization program for another 15 years with an initial budget of 75 billion pesos for the first five years in order to continue modernizing all the branches of the AFP. The amended law was made under the leadership of President Benigno Aquino III. This new law is aimed at building a defense system capable of addressing the assessed threats, at a time when the Philippines is locked with a sea dispute with China in the contested Spratly Islands along with Taiwan and other southeast Asian nations like Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. The revised AFP modernization program is divided into three horizons. The first was implemented from 2013 to 2017, the second is from 2018 to 2022, while the third is from 2023 to 2028. On June 20, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte approved the Armed Forces modernization program's shopping list for Horizon 2. The list of projects will be implemented from 2018 to 2022, with a budget of about ‚Ç±300 billion, or about US$5.6 billion.

The Department of National Defense has begun negotiations with the Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) while it is waiting for Malaca√±ang's final approval of the sales agreement. It will be a government-to-government procurement that requires multi-year obligational authority from the Department of Budget and Management. After the confirmation of the sales agreement and the multi-year obligational authority from DBM, the formal negotiations can start and schedule the delivery of at least 4 fighter jets. The government is moving closer to acquiring 12 FA-50 fighter jets for the air force after the defense department's Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) approved the terms of reference for the project. Once the terms of reference are approved with finality, the defense department could begin negotiations with the aircraft supplier, the state-run Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI). The negotiations are hoped to be finished by August. The negotiations were completed on Feb. 21, 2014. The Department of National Defense Special Bids and Awards Committee approved the offer of Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) in a meeting that was held in Camp Aguinaldo. On Mar. 28, 2014, it was announced by the state arms procurement agency of South Korea that South Korea signed a US$420 million contract Friday to export 12 FA-50 fighter jets built by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to the Philippines under a government-to-government deal. * The Philippine Air Force has signed a contract for eight AW109 Power light twin helicopters.

On 18 December 2018, Philippines and Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding with the TAI for new 10 T129s for the PAF. However, due to the sanctions imposed by the US Government on Turkey, and the failure of the delivery of its engines from the UK and the US, the PAF decided to cancel the T129 helicopter acquisition and selected American made helicopters instead, with the Bell AH-1Z Viper, the Boeing AH-64 Apache, and the PZL Mielec S70i Attack Helicopter being offered by the US for the project.https://www.mintfo.com/news/paf-reportedly-selects- american-helicopter-for-attack-helicopter-project-after-re-evaluation/19835/ =Philippine Army= * The Philippine Army is expecting delivery of 114 M113A2 armored personnel carriers from the ex-US Army stocks, which are expected to arrive before the end of 2014.

It is situated some 30 km southeast of Prague, on the right bank of the eponymous S√°zava river, a right tributary of the Vltava. The town of S√°zava (Bene≈°ov District) grew around the monastery. The monastery is notable as having followed Slavonic liturgy in the 11th century. It was re-established under the Latin rite in 1097, until its destruction in 1421 due to the Hussite Wars. It was again re- established as part of the re-catholization of Bohemia under Habsburg rule in 1664, and finally dissolved in 1785. The extant buildings mostly date to the Baroque period, with 19th-century neo-Renaissance extensions, with some remaining structures in the Gothic style of the 13th to 14th centuries, notably the unfinished three-nave Gothic basilica. History The monastery is the site of the hermitage of Procopius of S√°zava (d. 1052), a Czech hermit (canonized in 1204 by Innocent III). Procopius attracted a community of hermits, which formed the basis of the Benedictine monastery established in 1032. It is one of the oldest monasteries founded in the Duchy of Bohemia, established some 40 years after B≈ôevnov Monastery. In 1056, duke Spytihnƒõv II had the monks expelled from the abbey. The monks found sanctuary in Hungary until 1061, when Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia had them returned to the abbey. Unusually for a Benedictine abbey, S√°zava was an important center of Slavic (rather than Latin) liturgy until 1096. The first stone church, consecrated to the Holy Cross, was built in 1070. The ruins of this church have been excavated and are visible in the garden north of the monastery building. In December 1096, the monks were expelled for the second time, by duke Bretislav II, marking the end of the Slavic rite in Bohemia. The Slavic Benedictines were replaced by Latin Benedictines from B≈ôevnov Monastery under abbot Dƒõdhard (d. 1133). In the 12th century, the Romanesque basilica and monastery buildings were completed. A 12th-century chronicle, De exordio Zazavensis monasterii, records the history of the monastery up to the year 1177. It also contains a continuation of Cosmas of Prague down to 1162. The monastery's founder Procopius was formally canonized in S√°zava, in the presence of Ottokar, the first king of Bohemia, on 4 July 1204. In the later 13th to 14th centuries, the Romanesque basilica was transformed into a Gothic one, intended as a monumental three-nave structure, which however remained unfinished. The monastery buildings were also rebuilt in the Gothic style. The Madonna of S√°zava is a notable 14th-century fresco in the capitular hall, unusually depicting Mary, mother of Jesus walking alongside a child Jesus aged about five years old. S√°zava was sacked by Hussite troops in 1421 and the monks were expelled, interrupting building activity. Over the following two centuries, the monastery had secular owners and fell into decay. In 1664, the monastery was again revived, bought by Seifert, abbot of the B≈ôevnov and Broumov monasteries. The dilapidated buildings were reconstructed in the Baroque style by architect V√≠t V√°clav Ka≈àka. A fire in 1746 damaged the Baroque buildings, which were restored under architect Kilian Ignatius Dientzenhofer in the late Baroque or Rococo style. The Rococo altar with a painting of the Assumption of Mary by Jan Petr Molitor and frescos of this period are extant. The monastery was finally closed down by decree of Emperor Joseph II in 1785. The monastery domain again fell to secular owners from 1809, first to Wilhelm Tiegel of Lindenkrone, who used the cloister as a chateau, while the basilica remained in operation as a parish church. The domain was sold to Johann Friedrich Neuberg in 1869, who commissioned reconstruction work in neo-Renaissance style. The domain and chateau were sold to Friedrich Schwarz in 1876. Part of the domain was sold to Benedictine monks from Emmaus Monastery in 1932, who intended to re-establish the monastery in S√°zava. Benedictine monk and priest Method Klement moved from Emmaus to S√°zava in 1940 and began preparatory work, but the plan was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent communist regime. The area was managed by the National Cultural Committee of Czechoslovakia from 1951. In 1962, the area became a National Cultural Heritage Site, managed by the National Heritage Institute. Archaeological excavations were carried out during the 1960s to 1990s by Ivan Borkovsk√Ω, Petr Sommer, and others. The exhibition \\"Old Slavic S√°zava\\" was opened in 1983. As part of the reprivatization following the establishment of the Czech Republic, the property was restored to Marie Hayessov√°, as heiress of the Schwarz family in 2003. She sold the property to the state in 2006. Under the 2013 act on church restitution, parts of the domain were returned to the Roman Catholic parish of ƒåern√© Budy (S√°zava) and parts to Emmaus Monastery. The National Heritage Institute remains in charge of restoration and conservation, focussing on the threatened pillars of the unfinished Gothic three-nave structure and on the restoration of the baroque frescos.  In Popular Culture  S√°zava Monastery and its Benedectine monks are featured in the computer game Kingdom Come: Deliverance, were it is called Sasau Monastery. \\"The Madonna of Sasau\\" is the name of a storyarc in the game.

The Astrarium had seven faces and 107 moving parts; it showed the positions of the sun, the moon and the five planets then known, as well as religious feast days. It was one of the first mechanical clocks to be built in Europe. The Tractatus astrarii Page from the Tractatus astrarii showing the dial of Venus; Padova, Biblioteca Capitolare, Ms. D.39: 12v Leonardo da Vinci, sketch of an astronomical clock showing the dial of Venus and the sun, Institut de France ms L: 92v Dondi documented the Astrarium in detail in the Tractatus astrarii, which is the earliest complete surviving description of its kind; the St Albans abbey clock designed by Richard of Wallingford predates it, but survives only as fragments (reconstructed by John North). In the introduction, Dondi writes that his machine was built in accordance with the 13th-century Theorica planetarum of Campano di Novara, and to demonstrate the validity of the descriptions of the motion of heavenly bodies of Aristotle and Avicenna. The Tractatus survives in twelve manuscript sources. The autograph in the Biblioteca Capitolare of Padova (MS. D39) and a copy of it, also in Padova, are certainly the work of Dondi. The other sources are rewritten versions of the autograph, to which Dondi's contribution is as yet unclear. The autograph manuscript was published in 1987 in a critical edition with colour facsimile and French translation by Poulle as the first volume of the Opera omnia of Jacopo and Giovanni Dondi. Description The astrarium was considered to be a marvel of its day. Giovanni Manzini of Pavia writes (in 1388) that it is a work \\"full of artifice, worked on and perfected by your hands and carved with a skill never attained by the expert hand of any craftsman. I conclude that there was never invented an artifice so excellent and marvelous and of such genius\\". Dondi writes that he obtained the idea of an astrarium from the Theorica Planetarum of Giovanni Campano da Novara, who describes the construction of the equatorium. The astrarium was primarily a clockwork equatorium with astrolabe and calendar dials, and indicators for the sun, moon, and planets. It provided a continuous display of the major elements of the solar system and of the legal, religious, and civil calendars of the day. Dondi's intention was that it would help people's understanding of astronomical and astrological concepts. (Astrology was then considered a subject worthy of study by the intellectual elite and was taken reasonably seriously.) The astrarium stood about 1 metre high, and consisted of a seven- sided brass or iron framework resting on 7 decorative paw-shaped feet. The lower section provided a 24-hour dial and a large calendar drum, showing the fixed feasts of the church, the movable feasts, and the position in the zodiac of the moon's ascending node. The upper section contained 7 dials, each about 30 cm in diameter, showing the positional data for the Primum Mobile, Venus, Mercury, the moon, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. Dondi constructed the clock, with its 107 gear wheels and pinions, entirely by hand. No screws were used, and every part was held together by over 300 tapering pins and wedges, with some parts being soldered. Most of the wheels have triangular shaped teeth, although some are blunt-nosed. In some cases, Dondi used near-elliptical wheels, in order to more accurately model the irregular motions of the planets (using the Ptolemaic epicycles rather than the ellipses as later worked out by Johannes Kepler). On some of these wheels, the teeth varied in size and spacing along the wheel's periphery. To indicate dimensions in his descriptions, Dondi used units such as the width of a goose quill, the thickness of a blade of a knife, or the breadth of a man's thumb. For data on the motion of the planets, he consulted the Alfonsine tables, compiled in about 1272. =The clock movement= Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia, Milan. The clock movement had a balance wheel regulated to beat at the rate of 2 seconds. Its simple wheel train turned a dial marked on the margin with a scale of 24 equal hours and 10-minute intervals. The dial rotated anticlockwise against a fixed pointer, showing mean time, and could be adjusted if necessary by intervals of 10 minutes of time by sliding out a pinion of 12 teeth that meshed with the 144 teeth of the main dial. On each side of the clock dial was a fixed plate or 'tabula orientii', graduated with months and days of the Julian calendar for the purpose of determining the times of the rising and setting of the mean sun for the latitude of Padova (about 45¬∞deg N). At the time the clock was made, the dates of the solstices were 13 June and 13 December (Old style or Julian Calendar). =The calendar wheel= The annual calendar wheel or drum in the lower section was about 40 cm across. This drove the calendar of movable feasts, and the dials above. Around the outside of the wheel was a broad band divided into 365 strips, each containing numbers that indicated the length of daylight, the dominical letter, the name of the saint for that day, and the day of the month. Alternate months were gilded and silvered, and the engraved letters filled alternately with red and blue enamel. Dondi didn't introduce any indications or allowances for leap year - he recommended stopping the clock for the entire day. =The Primum Mobile dial= Directly above the 24-hour dial is the dial of the Primum Mobile, so called because it reproduces the diurnal motion of the stars and the annual motion of the sun against the background of stars. It is basically an astrolabe drawn using a south polar projection, with a fixed tablet and a rete of special design that rotated once in a sidereal day. The rete was provided with 365 teeth, but was driven by a wheel with 61 teeth which made 6 turns in 24 hours. Thus the rete rotated once in 365/366 of a mean solar day, which equated 366 successive meridian transits of the vernal equinox with 365 similar transits of the sun. Dondi realised that his approximations didn't correspond with the exact length of the solar year, and recommended stopping the clock occasionally so that it could be adjusted. =Planetary dials= Each of the 'planetary' dials used complex clockwork to produce reasonably accurate models of the planets' motion. These agreed reasonably well both with Ptolemaic theory and with observations. For example, Dondi's dial for Mercury uses a number of intermediate wheels, including: a wheel with 146 teeth, two oval wheels with 24 irregularly shaped teeth that meshed together, a wheel with 63 internal (facing inwards) teeth that meshed with a 20 tooth pinion. The 63-tooth wheel made one rotation a year, non- uniformly because of the oval driving wheels, and made the main indicator wheel rotate through 63/20 √ó 12 signs of the zodiac each year. This is equivalent to 37 signs and 24¬∞, a good approximation to the value of 37 signs and 24¬∞ 43' 23\\" required by theory. Later history In 1381 Dondi presented his clock to Gian Galeazzo Visconti, duke of Milan, who installed it in the library of his castle in Pavia. It remained there until at least 1485. It may have been seen and drawn by Leonardo da Vinci. The fate of the clock is unknown. Because Dondi described most of the more complex components of his clock in his manuscripts in considerable detail, it has been possible for modern clockmakers to build convincing - if sometimes speculative - reconstructions. Seven such reconstructions were built by Peter Haward of Thwaites and Reed, London; examples of these can be found in the Smithsonian Institution and The Time Museum Illinois. There is also a reconstruction in the Mus√©e international d'horologerie in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, with the signature of Luigi Pippa. References Further reading * Henry C. King, John R.

The Auchenshuggle Bridge is the latest bridge to be built over the Clyde in the Auchenshuggle district of Glasgow, carrying the M74 motorway over the river and onto land which is part of Clydebridge Steelworks in Rutherglen, en route to the M8 junction near the heavily congested Kingston Bridge. History The Bridge was built as part of the northern extension of the M74, being the southern flank of the never completed Glasgow Inner Ring Road, although following a different route through the southside of the city. The aim of the motorway extension was to relieve the heavily congested northern section of the M8 through the city centre and over the Kingston Bridge by allowing through traffic to bypass the entire city centre section of the M8, via the M74. Construction The Auchenshuggle bridge is a dual three-lane motorway bridge that carries both carriageways of the M74 over the River Clyde, located west of Fullarton Road junction. The single-span bridge is supported at each end by reinforced concrete supports, and the bridge deck (superstructure) is made up of steel box girder beams with reinforced concrete cast in place over the beams. During construction of the bridge, engineers used the Europe's largest mobile crane to lift the superstructure into place.Auchenshuggle Bridge takes shape as M74 motors on, Urban Realm, 15 June 2010 The new bridge was completed and opened in 2011. Its construction incorporates a footbridge under the motorway on the north bank of the river which allows the Clyde Walkway and National Cycle Route 75 to continue, as well as an identical footbridge on the south bank which would also accommodate any similar pathways built in the future, as was mooted in 2015.

He was an illegitimate member of the Mortimer family, who were one of the leading noble houses of England and Ireland, and he helped to manage the Mortimer lands during the minority of the family heir, his nephew Roger, earl of March. Sir Thomas was also a close associate of the Lords Appellant, the powerful faction of nobles who opposed the administration of King Richard II. Sir Thomas took part in the Lords Appellants' rebellion in 1387 against the king, and fought at the Battle of Radcot Bridge, during which he killed Sir Thomas Molineux, one of the royal commanders. 10 years later, when the king took his revenge against the rebels, this act led to his conviction for treason. He fled for his life and died in exile. Background Thomas's father, Roger, 2nd Earl of March Thomas was an illegitimate son of Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March (1328‚Äì1360). He was described as an esquire in 1367, pointing to a birth date of around 1350. He seems to have been treated by his father and his brother very much as one of the family. Nothing is known of his mother. By 1380 he had acquired considerable military expertise, and had been knighted. When his legitimate brother Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1379, Thomas went with him to Ireland and acted as his Deputy, holding in his name a Great Council at Clonmel. Edmund was charged with the task of subduing the Gaelic clans in Ulster and Munster, but he had only limited success in this task. Lord Deputy of Ireland Edmund's sudden death in December 1381 left the Dublin Government in a quandary, since there were very few men willing or qualified to assume the office of Lord Lieutenant, at a time of exceptional political turbulence in Ireland. Richard Wyre, Bishop of Cloyne, proposed that Thomas Mortimer should be appointed Lord Lieutenant, both for his military experience and his ability to retain the loyalty of his brother's retinue. In the event King Richard II appointed Thomas's nephew, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, a child of seven, as Lord Lieutenant. The obvious absurdity of this choice was lessened to some extent by the appointment of Thomas as Lord Deputy and Lord Chief Justice. Return to England On the appointment of Sir Philip Courtenay as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in February 1383, Thomas returned to England. His nephew's wardship had been entrusted to a group of magnates which included Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, of whom Thomas was an intimate friend. It was probably Arundel who appointed Thomas to the position of steward of the Mortimer estates during Roger's minority, thus greatly enhancing his political standing. As Roger grew older he and his uncle became close, going hunting together and exchanging gifts of wine: Dunn suggests that Thomas was the closest Roger ever knew to a father. The Appellants Arundel was a key member of the group of nobles called the Lords Appellant, who had emerged as opponents of Richard II and the royal favourite Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland. Mortimer was closely associated with them and is known to have visited Arundel's house regularly during 1387, the critical year in the Appellants' rise to power. =The Battle of Radcot Bridge= In December 1387, at Radcot Bridge, the Appellants clashed with the royal army, headed by Robert de Vere and Sir Thomas Molineux, Constable of Chester Castle; de Vere was defeated and forced to flee the country. Mortimer himself killed Molineux, who was one of the few casualties of the fight. According to Thomas Walsingham, Molineux, who had attempted to flee, pleaded for his life, but Mortimer pulled off Molinuex's helmet and stabbed him in the head with a dagger. Robert de Vere fleeing after his defeat at the Battle of Radcot Bridge During the brief rule of the Appellants, Mortimer was in high favour. He was appointed Justiciar of Ireland, but Richard, despite his temporary loss of power, somehow managed to countermand the appointment (no doubt he feared to surrender control of Ireland entirely to his enemies) and it never took effect. Despite the King's mistrust of them, Thomas and his nephew Roger, with troops, accompanied him on his Irish expedition in 1394; and when Roger was reappointed Lord Lieutenant in 1396, Thomas went to Ireland with him. Downfall In 1397 the King moved to destroy the surviving Lords Appellant. Arundel, Mortimer's patron, was convicted of treason and executed. Mortimer was \\"appealed for\\" (i.e. charged with) treason, in that his killing of Molineux, the King's commander ten years earlier was deemed in law to be an attempt to murder the King himself. Mortimer was not permitted to stand trial, but ordered to surrender himself within three months. Unsurprisingly Mortimer instead chose to flee the country: the King accused Roger, probably with good reason, of conniving at his uncle's escape. Thomas was declared a traitor and his lands were forfeited to the Crown. He took refuge in Scotland where he probably died in 1399. Marriage He married Agnes de Poynings, daughter of Michael de Poynings, 1st Baron Poynings and his wife Joan Ruxley, and widow of William Bardolf, 4th Baron Bardolf. They had no children. She was described as a widow on 9 January 1403, indicating that Sir Thomas Mortimer was dead by then. She died the following summer. Character Although the details (if they were accurately reported) of his killing of Molineux show him in a rather sinister light, Mortimer had the respect and esteem of many who knew him, including his brother and his nephew. The chronicler Adam of Usk, who knew him personally, praised him as \\"a vigorous knight\\".

He was Professor of Aerodynamics at Cranfield University. He served as President of the Royal Aeronautical Society from 1987 to 1988 and Editor-in-Chief of its The Aeronautical Journal from 1996 to 2006. He pioneered the 'Gun Tunnel' that is widely used in aerospace engineering. Early life Stollery was born on 21 April 1930 in Sible Hedingham, Essex, England, to Edgar and Emma Stollery. He was educated at East Barnet Grammar School, North London from 1941 to 1948. He sat the School Certificate and the Higher School Certificate. He went on to study aeronautical engineering at Imperial College London. In 1951, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree and stayed to complete a Master in Science (MSc) in 1953. Career In 1952, he joined the Aerodynamics Department at De Havilland. However, he left the company in 1956 to return to academia. In 1956, he was appointed lecturer in aerodynamics in the Department of Aeronautics at his alma mater Imperial College London. He worked with Donald Campbell as a part of the design team on both the Bluebird car and boat projects. There was a need to develop new test facilities as flight speeds increased and so he developed the 'Gun Tunnel'.

She was married to publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell from 1945 until his death in 1991 when the family soon came under scrutiny for his business dealings, especially his responsibility for the Mirror Group pension scandal. Later in life, she was recognized for her work as a proponent of Interfaith dialogue and received several awards including an honorary fellowship from the Woolf Institute at Cambridge. Early life Maxwell was born Elisabeth Jenny Jeanne Meynard in La Grive, near Saint-Alban- de-Roche, France, to Louis \\"Paul\\" Meynard and Colombe (n√©e Petel) Meynard. Paul Meynard was a Protestant descendant of the Huguenot aristocracy and Colombe Meynard was a Roman Catholic (whose marriage to a Protestant resulted in her excommunication). Her father Paul owned a silk-weaving factory and was the mayor of the village.Elisabeth Maxwell, Expert on Holocaust, Dies at 92https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/maxwell-meynard- elisabeth-1921 She had one sibling, an older sister, Yvonne. Her parents sent her to England at age nine to attend the convent of Our Lady of Compassion at Acocks Green in Birmingham. In 1932, she returned to France. Meynard studied law at the Sorbonne.  Family  In September 1944, after the Liberation of Paris, she met Czechoslovakian-born British Army Captain Robert Maxwell, while working as an interpreter for the 'Welcome Committee', which introduced French people to allied officers; they married on 15 March 1945. She then worked as his secretary and assistant in London as he established his publishing empire. The Maxwells had nine children: Michael, Philip, Ann, Christine, Isabel, Karine, Ian, Kevin and Ghislaine. All of Maxwell's children were delivered by her sister Yvonne, a gynecologist, in Maisons-Laffitte, France. Two of the children died in childhood; daughter Karine died in 1957, at age three, from leukemia, and son Michael entered a coma following a car crash, in 1961, and died six years later without regaining consciousness. At first, the family lived on a budget, but later moved into a mansion at Broomfield, Esher. Starting in 1960, the family lived at Headington Hill Hall where the offices to Robert Maxwell's Pergamon Press were also located.  Education and career  In her forties, Maxwell worked in public relations for her husband's company and campaigned for him in the General Election of 1964. She then earned a BA degree in modern languages at St Hugh‚Äôs College, Oxford. In 1981, at age 60 Maxwell was awarded a PhD in French Literature from the University of Oxford for her thesis on The art of Letter Writing in France, 1789-1830.Martyin Childs \\"Betty Maxwell: Widow of media tycoon who became a respected Holocaust scholar\\", The Independent, 11 August 2013 Her thesis work focused on researching a Protestant circle in Lyons. Maxwell researched her husband's Jewish relatives who perished under Nazi rule, and discovered they amounted in total to over 300 of his immediate and extended family. In 1988, Maxwell organized a conference in both Oxford and London titled \\"Remembering for the Future\\". That same year, she received the Sir Sigmund Sternberg award for furthering Christian/Jewish relations. Maxwell authored a book on antisemitism titled Silence or Speaking Out, published in 1990 by Southampton University. Maxwell's husband, Robert, was found dead, floating in the waters of the Canary Islands near his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, in November 1991. Following his mysterious death, evidence emerged that Robert Maxwell had plundered his employees' pension funds from the Mirror Group. Her sons, Ian and Kevin, were arrested on fraud charges in June 1992 and later acquitted in January 1996. It is believed she knew nothing about the missing pension funds; she was left financially severely depleted after his death. Yehuda Bauer, a fellow Holocaust historian stated that after Robert Maxwell's death \\"Elisabeth lost her pension, all her property, and only her children continued to support her. She was a wonderful person, kind and supportive, quite contrary to her husband, whom she loved despite everything.\\" Following the pension scandal, Maxwell reportedly left the UK and spent time at her chateau in France. She returned to Britain after the Duke of Westminster \\"let her a four-bedroomed townhouse at a peppercorn rent\\". Maxwell's autobiography, entitled A Mind of My Own: My Life with Robert Maxwell, was published in November 1994. In a 1995 interview with The New York Times, she reflected on her marriage stating ‚ÄùThe worst years of my life were 1981 to 1991. I was at his beck and call with no kudos, nothing was right. What saved me was my work on the Holocaust.‚Äù In her seventies and early eighties, Maxwell traveled and lectured widely on Holocaust studies. Maxwell was an editor for the book Remembering for the Future: the Holocaust in an Age of Genocide, a comprehensive work including the contributions of nearly 200 scholars, published in 2001.\\"Holocaust expert Elisabeth Maxwell dies at 92\\", Times of Israel, 9 August 2013.

She was on the Executive Committee of the International Council of Christians and Jews and founded the International Conference on the Holocaust. Maxwell was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the Woolf Institute at Cambridge for her work to improved relations between Christians and Jews. She was further recognized with an Honorary Fellowship at Tel Aviv University, and the Anne Frank Institute‚Äôs Eternal Flame Award.

Biography He was born in Tournai to a noble family and travelled to Italy where he studied in Padua before returning north. From 1554-1557 he was librarian to Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle in Atrecht (Arras). He left Granvelle to study in Geneva under Calvin and Beza and in 1558 he became a reformer in Antwerp. He became a French-speaking pastor there in 1566. He had to flee the contra-reformers and travelled to Aken and on to Worms, and after receiving his doctorate in Geneva became a pastor in Metz and in 1562 he got his own church there. In 1564 he was invited to a secret conference by William the Silent to talk about a union of Protestant churches with Carolus Niellius, Fran√ßois Baudouin and Guy de Bres. Afterwards, he preached at the St. Walburgkerk in Antwerp and in 1566 oversaw the conversion (anabaptism) of Guy de Bres. He then wrote a protest from the Wallonian Synod against Catholicism for which he was banned and fled on 17 April 1567 to Metz, but fled again due to the edict of 4 April 1569 by the King of France that banned him from preaching and which caused his church to burn. He sought refuge in Heidelberg where he became a preacher again and was sent to the Wallonian Synod in Emden in 1570 where he pleaded for unity among the Huguenots and Wallonian refugees. From 1572-1575 he became a travelling minister in Vlissingen, Middelburg, and Veere. He had become chaplain to William the Silent and presided over his marriage on 15 July 1575 to Charlotte de Bourbon, in the Grote Kerk, Den Briel. On his request, he also was peacekeeper between Caspar Coolhaes and Pieter Cornelisz uyten Briel, whose arguments about the Protestant faith had reached a boiling point in 1578. After William the Silent was assassinated in 1584, Taffin followed mayor Marnix but fled north to Leiden where he presided over the Wallonian Synod from 18‚Äì20 September 1587. In 1588 he was called to Haarlem where he became pastor of the Waalse Kerk, Haarlem.Jean Taffin in 1585: de val van Antwerpen en de uittocht van Vlamingen en Brabanders, by Gustaaf Asaert on Google books From there he helped organize the various northern refugees of his church into Walloon Reformed church at Amsterdam, where he went to serve in 1590 and where he later died of the plague in 1602. Today, he is best known for his book Des marques des enfants de Dieu et des consolations dans leurs afflictions (The Marks of God's Children) (1585).

Unraced as a two-year-old, she won three times in England and twice in Italy in 1992. In the following year she was moved into the highest class and defeated the 1992 European Horse of the Year User Friendly in the Yorkshire Oaks before winning the Prix Foy in France. Only Royale won a second Yorkshire Oaks in 1994 and the Jockey Club Stakes as a six-year-old in 1995. She was also placed in the Nassau Stakes and the Coronation Cup and was unlucky in running when twice finishing just behind the leaders in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She was retired to stud at the end of 1995 and had limited success as a broodmare. Background Only Royale was a bay mare with no white markings bred by the County Wicklow-based Barronstown Stud. Her sire, Caerleon, won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup in 1983 and went on to become an \\"excellent\\" stallion, siring the winners of more than 700 races including Generous, Marienbard, Moonax and Warrsan. Her dam, Etoile de Paris won the Athasi Stakes as a three-year-old in 1980. As a descendant of the broodmare Miss France, Etoile de Paris came from the same branch of Thoroughbred Family 9-e which produced In The Wings, Dubawi, High-Rise and Virginia Waters. Only Royale was acquired by Giuseppe Sainaghi and sent into training with Luca Cumani at his Bedford Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1992: three-year-old season= Only Royale did not race as a two-year-old and made her debut in a maiden race over one mile at Musselburgh Racecourse on 30 May. She was made the 1/3 favourite and won by two and a half lengths from Indian Style. In June and July she carried top weight of 133 pounds in two ten furlong handicap races at Newbury Racecourse and won on both occasions. In September, the filly was sent to San Siro Racecourse in Milan where she won the Premio Mottalciata, beating two locally trained fillies over 2000 metres. Only Royale returned to England for a ten furlong handicap at Ascot Racecourse. She started 7/4 favourite, but sustained her first defeat as she finished second to Plan Ahead, to whom she was conceding 22 pounds. On her final appearance of the season, Only Royale was sent back to Italy for the Premio Giovanni Falck, a Listed race over 2,400 metres. Ridden by Frankie Dettori, she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew clear of her opponents to win by five lengths. =1993: four- year-old season= On her first appearance as a four-year-old, Only Royale contested a Listed race at Leicester Racecourse on 5 June.

In July she was moved up to Group race class for the first time, finishing second by a neck to River North in the Scottish Classic at Ayr Racecourse and second to Lyphard' Delta in the Nassau Stakes. On 18 August, Only Royale was one of eight fillies and mares to contest the Group One Yorkshire Oaks over one and a half miles at York Racecourse. She was ridden by Ray Cochrane and started at odds of 10/1 in a field which included User Friendly, Rainbow Lake (winner of the Lancashire Oaks) and Oakmead (third in the Oaks Stakes). Only Royale was restrained by Cochrane in the early stages before moving forward in the straight. She took the lead two furlongs from the finish and went clear of her opponents to win by three and a half lengths from Dancing Bloom. Three weeks after her win at York, Only Royale was sent to France for the Prix Foy, an important trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. taring the odds-on favourite, she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by a length from Modhish. On 3 October Only Royale started at odds of 19/1 in a field of twenty-three runners for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She appeared to be making good progress in the straight when she was badly hampered and despite running on again in the closing stages she finished fifth, two and a half lengths behind the winner Urban Sea. Two weeks later, Only Royale ended her season in Milan, where she finished a disappointing fourth behind Misil in the Gran Premio del Jockey Club. =1994: five-year-old season= Only Royale began her third season of racing by finishing eighth behind Alderbrook when 5/2 favourite for the Festival Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 19 May. In June she started a 20/1 outsider for a strong edition of the Coronation Cup at Epsom Downs Racecourse. She finished seventh behind Apple Tree in a field which included Urban Sea, Intrepidity, Monsun, White Muzzle and Environment Friend. After a break of two and a half months Only Royale attempted to become the first horse to win consecutive runnings of the Yorkshire Oaks. Ridden by Frankie Dettori she started at odds of 15/2 against a field which included Bolas (winner of the Irish Oaks), Hawajiss (Nassau Stakes) and Wandesta (Santa Ana Stakes). Only Royale was last of the seven runners in the early stages but moved to take the lead a furlong and half from the finish. She then accelerated clear of the field to win in \\"impressive\\" style by six lengths from Dancing Bloom. Her victory made her the first horse to win the race twice. In October, Only Royale contested her second Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in which she was ridden by Dettori and started at odds of 13/2. For the second year in succession, she failed to obtain a clear run in the straight and finished seventh, two and a half lengths behind the winner Carnegie. After her run in the Arc, Only Royale was sold for $1m to the Canadian businessman Frank Stronach. For her last race of the season, the mare was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs. She started a 27/1 outsider and finished fifth behind the French-trained three-year-old Tikkanen after a \\"bumpy trip\\". =1993: six-year-old season= The first race of Only Royale's final season saw her matched against Tikkanen at weight-for-age in the Group Two Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. The mare was held up by Dettori in the early stages by Dettori before overtaking the Breeders' Cup winner a furlong from the finish and winning by a neck. In June, Only Royale contested her second Coronation Cup in which he finished strongly but failed by a head to catch the French colt Sunshack. The unplaced horses included Tikkanen, Carnegie and Environment Friend. On her final appearance on 2 July, Only Royale finished third behind Carnegie and Luso in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, with Tikkanen and Sunshack in fourth and fifth. Stud record At the end of her racing career, Only Royale was sent to North America to become a broodmare at Stronach's stud. In 1996 Stronach sold her for $1.2 million. Her record has not been impressive, but she has produced two winners: *Sir Royal (bay gelding, foaled 2005, sired by Diesis) won a handicap race at Thirsk Racecourse in 2010. *Caster Sugar (bay mare, 2006 by Cozzene) won four handicap races in 2009.

It lies in the Diocese of Visby. History The earliest church on the site was a stave church, later replaced by a Romanesque stone church. Of these first churches nothing remains, except for some Romanesque reliefs incorporated in the southern wall of the present church, and the baptismal font, made by the master sculptor known through the notname as Byzantios. The presently visible church is a comparatively large Gothic building, dating from the middle of the 14th century. Only the tower is later, built during the 14th century. It was around 75 meters tall and the tallest tower in Gotland. But it was heavily damaged by a lightning strike in 1817. The upper part of the tower, including the roof lantern, therefore dates from 1820. The church is one of the largest churches on Gotland, which is probably because the large parish was at the time one of the richest on Gotland. It is however also possible that the unusual size of the church can be explained by that the church, like Lau Church, may have been used by Dominican friars to preach crusades against pagans in present-day Estonia and Latvia. No major alterations have been made to the church since. Archaeological investigations and a renovation was carried out in 1960 to 1961. Architecture Vamlingbo church rectory The church is a hall church of a type quite common on Gotland. The nave of the church is spacious and broad, divided into three parts by four sturdy pillars. The stone masons that built the church have alternated red and grey limestone in the pillars and other details, creating an unusually colourful interior. On its northern wall are a set of medieval muralss, depicting a scene in which the archangel Michael is weighing the soul of Emperor Henry. The picture dates from the middle of the 13th century and is considered to be one of the largest and most unusual murals on Gotland. It has been suggested that St. Michael was the patron saint of the church. Other, less dominating murals in the church depict pictures of saints and apostles, and purely decorative painting. Of furnishings, the aforementioned baptismal font is perhaps the most noteworthy. The altarpiece is from the 14th century and shows influences from western German art. =Rectory= Adjacent to the church is the former rectory. It is an unusually grand building, consisting in a small manor-like complex with four annexes and a large main house. The house, which is located on the site of an earlier, medieval rectory, dates from 1779 and show traces of a simple, vernacular form of Rococo.

The name came from miners in the area who were earning a penny a shift working there so it became known as \\"The Penny Pit\\". The pitch was planted in the 1950s. In the 1970s, Preston Lodge RFC and East Lothian District Council paid for a new pavilion and rugby pitch to be constructed. In 1992, with Pennypit Park in need of renovations, the Pennypit Community Trust was set up and raised ¬£500,000 for redevelopment. The redevelopment was completed in 1994. The ground has been used to host the Scotland Development XV rugby team and Rugby tens. Preston Lodge used to have their clubhouse at Pennypit Park following the sale of their old clubhouse at Rope Walk. In 2013, they moved their social space from Pennypit Park to Prestongrange Bowling Club after purchasing their clubhouse. In 2013, a Scottish Cup match between Preston Athletic and Queen's Park was abandoned by fans throwing smoke bombs. In 2016, the stadium was vandalised with graffiti on the stand and beer bottles thrown on the pitch.

Albert Bridge is a road bridge spanning the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland near to Glasgow Green. The bridge, opened in 1871, links the Saltmarket in the city centre with Crown Street on the southside, is category A listed, and named after Queen Victoria's consort, Prince Albert.  Previous Bridges  Albert Bridge is the fifth bridge to be built on the site in Glasgow. The first bridge on the site was built in 1794 and was known as Hutcheson Bridge but was destroyed by flooding in 1795. A timber footbridge replaced it in 1803, and in 1834 a masonry arch bridge was designed by Robert Stevenson, grandfather of Robert Louis Stevenson. Stevenson's bridge was demolished in 1868 and replaced with a temporary wooden bridge until 1871, when the current Albert Bridge was constructed. Construction Queen Victoria medallion, Albert Bridge After investigating the old bridge, the Bridge Trustees agreed to a total removal of the old bridge. A new more elegant and more convenient bridge would be substituted for it. A budget of ¬£39,000 was secured, and Bell & Miller Engineers from Glasgow were charged to make a design. A subsequent tender for building the bridge to their first specifications did not receive a bid lower than ¬£54,000. Therefore, Bell & Miller were ordered to make a new design. After making some changes to the structural features of the work, a new bid for ¬£48,000 came in. The contractors were Hanna, Donald & Wilson from Paisley, Scotland. Albert Bridge is founded on concrete piers and abutments filled with cast iron caissons, sunk some 86 ft below water level. Traditional masonry was rejected in favour of rivetted wrought iron elliptical arches, the largest of which spans 114 ft. The arch ribs are masked by cast iron spandrels adorned with the Royal coat of arms, the coat of arms of Prince Albert and those of various corporate bodies. The stone pillars supporting the parapet are decorated with medallions of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert by the Scottish sculptor George Edwin Ewing. The bridge carries the eastern arm of the A8 across the River Clyde. It is two way with 2 lanes and it is complemented by the Victoria Bridge on the other side of the railway bridge, which is one-way northbound. A¬£3.4 million refurbishment programme began in 2015 and was recognised by a visit from The Earl of Wessex on 13 October 2016.

He had been considered one of TTP's most effective and powerful leaders in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. He was ousted by Maulana Fazlullah for forming \\"dubious\\" organizations such as Junad-i-Hafza, Ahrar-ul-Hind and Jamaat-ul- Ahrar.http://www.dawn.com/news/1130446 It was reported in October 2017 that he had died in a drone strike carried out by United States in Paktia Province of Afghanistan. However, reports later emerged disputing his death. Reports of Khorasani's death were proven false when the United States added Khorasani to the U.S State Department's Rewards for Justice wanted list on March 7, 2018.https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/abdul_wali.html Personal life Omar Khalid was born in Qandaro, a village in Mohmand Agency, Pakistan. He was a journalist and a poet. Most of his poetry was religious or devotional as he mostly composed naats (poetry in praise of prophet Muhammad). He adopted the nom de guerre of Omar Khalid Khorasani in 2007. Khorasani studied at a local school and then at a madrassah in Karachi. Militant activity Omar was radicalised at an early age and joined Harkat ul-Ansar, one of the militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir. When the U.S invaded Afghanistan in 2001, Khorasani set up an office of Harkat in Mohmand Agency, where he recruited fighters for ‚Äòjihad‚Äô against the American forces. Omar gained prominence, after vowing to avenge the Lal Masjid operation, and seized the shrine of a famous anti-colonialist fighter in the village of Ghazi Abad during the summer of 2007 and renaming it Lal Masjid (Red Mosque) =Joining TTP= In December 2007 when TTP was formed, Omar was named ameer of the groups franchise in Mohmand agency.

It is a flagship brand of the company and is manufactured at their Bangalore facility. In Khoday Distilleries Limited vs. The Scotch Whisky Association and Others, Peter Warren, an employee of Khoday, told the Supreme Court of India that the brand name Peter Scot was made up using his father's first name, \\"Peter\\", and his nationality, \\"Scot\\". Another factor in choosing the name was due to the British explorer, Captain Scott, and his son Peter Scott. Although the name \\"Scott\\" is spelt with two t's, it is phonetically the same as the word Scot. The brand's main competitors are Pernod Ricard's Blenders Pride and United Spirits Limited's Royal Challenge. History Khoday India Limited (KIL) began producing Peter Scot whisky in May 1968, and registered the trademark in 1974. In 1986, the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) moved the Assistant Registrar Trademarks for cancellation of the Peter Scot trademark. The SWA claimed that the name was deceptively similar to 'Scotch', which allegedly lead consumers to believe that the product had a Scottish connection. The Registrar ordered the deletion of the Peter Scot trademark in 1989. However, the decision was reversed several times, until a single-judge bench of the Madras High Court, followed by an identical order from the Division bench of the same Court ruled in favour of the SWA. The Court ruled that \\"the adoption of a name which indicates the geographical region even when the goods had no connection with that place, was itself dishonest\\". KIL appealed the 12 October 2007 high court order in the Supreme Court, arguing that SWA had knowledge about registration of the trademark as early as September 1974, but had waited for more than 12 years to move the Registrar. On 27 May 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of KIL, allowing it to keep the Peter Scot trademark. In its judgment, the Supreme Court considered the tests applied by courts in England, Australia and the United States regarding the deceptive similarity of goods. The Court also referred to a passage in Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names and ruled that, \\"the goods are expensive and not of a kind usually selected without deliberation and the customers are generally educated persons which are all matters to be considered\\". It also held that \\"where the class of buyers is educated and rich, the test to be applied is different where the product would be purchased by the villagers, the illiterate and the poor\\". The Court reached the conclusion that the trademark concerned a class of buyers who were expected to know the value of money, the quality and content of Scotch whisky and the difference in the process of manufacture, the place of manufacture and their origin. The judgement also stated that \\"the Trademark Registrar as well as the high court failed to apply the consumer's knowledge test to the issue and hence arrived at a wrong conclusion\\". The SWA described the Supreme Court verdict as \\"inexplicable\\". The SWA petition seeking a review of the judgment was dismissed by the Supreme Court in February 2009.

Taxonomy specimen in the Australian Museum German naturalist Ernst Friedrich Germar described the cherrynose in 1834 as Cicada angularis, reporting its type locality incorrectly as Sierra Leone. Swedish entomologist Carl St√•l named the genus Macrotristria in 1870, though this was misspelt as Macrotristia and Macrotistria in some later publications. The cherrynose is the type species of the genus. The cherrynose gets its common name from a red structure that resembles a nose, yet is in fact a structure containing muscles that help the cicada suck xylem from trees with its proboscis. An alternate common name is whiskey drinker. Description The cherrynose is a medium- to large cicada, the male and female similar in appearance. The head and thorax are black (or red-brown in North and Central Queensland) with orange markings. The postclypeus is red. The underparts are brown to blackish. They have an array of cuticular nanostructures on the transparent panes of their wings - conical protuberances with a spacing and height of about 200 nm, tipped with a spherical cap with a radius of curviture of around 25-45 nm. These act as anti-wetting and anti-reflective surfaces. The call has a trilling sound and is made in the day and at sunset. Distribution and habitat The adult cherrynose is found on the upper branches and trunks of tall eucalypts in sclerophyll forests, and is becoming rare in the Sydney region. They have also been recorded from sheoaks, apples (Angophora), native cypress (Callitris) and Tamarix aphylla.

It operated from 1936 until 1956. The North Woods Hiawatha was the first new route to adopt the Hiawatha brand.  History  The Milwaukee Road's new flagship streamliner Hiawatha, which began running in 1935, made a stop in New Lisbon to permit connections with local trains heading north to Minocqua. This service competed directly with the Chicago and Northwestern Railway's own new streamliner, the 400, which stopped in Adams. Demand was such that on several June Saturdays the Milwaukee Road operated an additional train (\\"section\\") directly from Chicago to Minocqua via New Lisbon. In June 1936 the Milwaukee Road introduced a new train between New Lisbon and Star Lake, Wisconsin, which it dubbed Hiawatha - North Woods Section. The train was pulled by a rebuilt Class G 4-6-0 steam locomotive, which had been shrouded to mimic the appearance of the faster Class As which pulled the Hiawatha. The route required 5 hours and 10 minutes to complete, owing to numerous online stops and a maximum track speed of . The train carried coaches, a lounge, and a dining car. This was the first use of the Hiawatha branding outside the Chicago-Twin Cities service. In the fall of 1936 the Milwaukee Road dropped the Hiawatha branding and cut the train back from Star Lake to Minocqua. The Milwaukee Road relaunched the service in April 1937, adding a \\"Beaver Tail\\" parlor car displaced from the original Hiawatha and new coaches. The train was named the Hiawatha - North Woods Service. Beginning a pattern which lasted until 1943, service was extended to Star Lake in June and then cut back to Minocqua in the fall. In the summer of 1939 the Milwaukee Road began operating the train directly from Chicago again, departing 10 minutes ahead of the Afternoon Hiawatha. Through operation ended in the fall, only to return on the summer weekends in 1940. This pattern of operation continued, with minor variations, for the rest of the train's operation. In the summer of 1951 the Milwaukee Road changed the train's name again, to North Woods Hiawatha. It continued to operate through from Chicago on summer weekends only. On April 29, 1956, the railroad cut the train back to Wausau, Wisconsin, with coaches only. It dropped the Hiawatha name at the same time. The truncated service ended altogether in 1970.

It was founded in 1853 at Inanda, a settlement just over north of Durban, by Daniel and Lucy Lindley, an American missionary couple. History On 20 November 1834 Daniel and Lucy Virginia (born Allen) Lindley married and they were sent by the American Board of Missions to South Africa. When they arrived in Cape Town they still had to cover. Their journey took a year by ox cart to get to Matabeleland. However, their plans were thwarted by the fighting that was taking place between the descendants of Dutch colonists (also called the Boers) and the Matebele. They successfully ministered to the Boers but they did not find success with native Africans until they set up the mission at Inanda. In 1869 they realised that the Adams School was successfully creating educated African men but they had no prospect of finding an educated \\"good wife\\". They said \\"who are they going to marry? ‚Äì these naked girls\\".Dumisani Zondi - Educationist from Inanda, ulwazi.org, accessed 15 August 2013 The couple thought this was a problem and decided to found a school for nineteen young girls who would board at Inanda. The cost of this was borne by the American Missionary Board. The headteacher, Mary Kelly Edwards, was brought from Ohio and she was to serve the school for nearly sixty years. Rev. James Dube When the Lindley family left South Africa in April 1873 they left one of their daughters who went on teach at the school. The Lindleys left the mission that they had established in the hands of the Reverend James Dube. Dube was the son of one of the first Christian converts at the mission. Dube was to die in 1877 but not before he had fathered John Dube who was to found a newspaper, Ohlange High School and take a leading role in creating the African National Congress. Lindley left Inanda having created what would become Inanda Seminary School, the Seminary, a church and several schools based in native huts. 1891 teaching staff - Miss Phelps, Mrs Edwards, Miss Price and Miss Dixon and Mary Pixley in front The school was able to avoid the full force of the Bantu Education Act. This act required schools that were not teaching white students to create a curriculum that was inline with the governments (low) ambitions for its black population. The school was allowed to operate outside the act which was denied to nearby Adams College. In 1956 Adams College had the choice of delivering unambitious education or selling its building and closing. The College chose to close. Racial discrimination did not just happen outside the school. In the 1960s the black teachers were paid less than white teachers and there were separate places for them to sleep and eat. It was acknowledged as a problem but the funds were not made available to solve the problem. The living condition was solved on a school holiday when the black canteen was removed. In the 1960s and 70s the school would receive 1500 applications from prospective students and these were whittled down to 90, based on a selection principle that involved recommendations, special exams, previous work and interview. The students nearly all came from families who could afford the fees but the school always funded a small number of students to ensure that it did not become devoted to \\"money snobbery\\". In the 1970s the government again put the school under pressure. This time they refused to renew the visas for non-South African staff, removing their right of residence in the country. The school was then managed by the United Congregational Church of Southern Africa but the government's decision resulted in the loss of some dedicated members of staff. This move when combined with the diminishing charitable donations from abroad put the school on the brink of closure. The school was saved initially by the intervention of its own alumni who took the school back into private ownership.

Background Born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Grant was a lifelong resident of nearby Wheatland, the only son of three children born to Duncan Paul Grant (1881-1975) and the former Mary Coquella (n√©e Greenlee; 1897-1982) on the then third-generation Grant Ranch in the Richeau Hills. Duncan Grant was a son of Robert Grant (1847-1921) and the former Margaret Mitchell (1844-1928). This part of Platte County was a near wilderness when the first Grants arrived. Early in the 20th century, Duncan and a brother had engaged in the hunting of wolves from the Nebraska line to as far west as Medicine Bow, Wyoming. They found that the predators usually traveled in packs of six or eight, but they had seen ferocious packs with twenty-two wolves, which aim at yearling colts and calves for easy prey. Biography As a child, Robert Mills Grant rode his horse, Snowball, to school on the nearby CMD Ranch on Richeau Creek. He later attended a school constructed on the Grant Ranch but completed high school in 1944 in Wheatland. With his parents, he ran a cow/calf operation on the then third-generation ranch. Established in 1884, the Grant Ranch is among the oldest continuous grazing operations in Wyoming. Young Grant trailed cattle to Chugwater, loaded the livestock on the railroad, and rode with the herd east to the Union Stockyards in Omaha, Nebraska. He competed in calf and steer roping. After his marriage to the former Betty Lou Nation (1923-1971), Grant established their ranch residence by moving a bank building from Slater in Platte County to the family property and then renovating the structure into a house. He was a gold card member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. For sixteen years, he served on the Platte County Fair Board and for most of that time spearheaded a PRCA-approved rodeo along with the annual county fair.The 2013 Platte County Fair and Rodeo was held from July 26 to August 3. The fairgrounds are located at 59 Antelope Gap Road in Wheatland. In 1976, Grant lost his first race for a seat in the state House of Representatives to Democrat Douglas K. Bryant of Wheatland but was elected in 1982. He served five two-year terms in the House and bowed out in 1992 when Platte County was reduced to a single seat in the lower legislative chamber. Particularly known for issues related to livestock branding, Grant was chairman of the House Brand and Theft Committee and once declared, \\"Brand law in Wyoming is the best in the West.\\" For sixty years, Grant was a member of the influential Wyoming Stock Growers Association. Prior to 1980, Grant became a major shareholder in the First State Bank in Wheatland. He was affiliated with Moose International. For much of his life, Grant slept in the same bed at his ranch that his Scottish grandfather Robert Grant had brought to Wyoming in the 19th century across the Atlantic Ocean and then through the Midwestern prairie. Over the years Grant witnessed the strength of the Wyoming wind and saw it hurl gravel off ridges and into a friend's face like shrapnel. Ronald Lehr, representative of the trade association, the American Wind Energy Association, has described the Wyoming wind as \\"the best wind in North America, we think.\\" As wind energy developers came calling early in the 21st century, Grant worked to form associations with his neighbors to make themselves financially viable in leasing their lands at the best price for the harnessing of the available wind energy. Death and legacy Grant died of a brief illness at Cheyenne Regional Medical Center. Memorial services were held at the Wheatland 4-H Building. Grant was cremated; he is listed in the burials at Wheatland Cemetery. He was preceded in death by his wives, Betty Grant and Sue Anna McLean Conrad Grant, grandson Quent Juschka, and two sisters, Helen Wilson (1924-2011) and Verda Mae Dey (1919-1997), with whom he was reared on the Grant Ranch. Sue Grant had owned and operated the Plains Motel in Wheatland, obtained a college degree later in life, and died of cancer in 1987. Grant was survived by a daughter, Susan Grant Juschka of Glendo in Platte County; two sons, Mike (Becky) Grant of Wheatland and Matt (Susie) Grant of Casper, Wyoming; three stepchildren, David Conrad of Las Vegas, Nevada, Tommie Anne Benigni of Fort Collins, Colorado, and Mary Conrad McPhillips of Sheridan, Wyoming; ten grandchildren, and three great- grandchildren. The Robert Grant Reservoir near Ferguson Corner in Platte County is named in his honor. The Grant Ranch remains a pasture for grazing leaseholders. It was listed in 1995 on the National Register of Historic Places.

Diplomatic ties between these two countries of the Middle East have long been strained by the major events in the region. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria deteriorated further following the Syrian Civil War and Saudi Arabia's numerous calls for Bashar al-Assad to be removed from power. Saudi Arabia cut off relations with Syria after they decided to close its embassy in Damascus and expel the Syrian ambassador in 2012. Factors affecting relations Sonoko Sunayama, a Middle East expert, argues that although economic concerns and balance of power are important, concerns about identity and ideology play the most significant role in the two countries' relations. Ian Black of the Guardian, on the other hand, states that Saudi foreign policy in general mostly focuses on business involving financial incentives and low-profile initiatives, which continued towards Syria until King Abdullah's high-profile condemnation of the Assad government in 2011. Both countries share Arab nationalist and Islamic identities. However, a significant element of their identity and government, namely secular versus conservative pattern, is completely different in that Syria has a secular government and life-style, while Saudi Arabia a conservative regime and world view. History The relations between two countries have been turbulent since their establishment as modern states. =1940s through 1960s= A Syrian mission was opened in Saudi Arabia in 1941, when Syria was still under the control of the French Mandate. King Abdulaziz reportedly supported the independence of Syria and Lebanon from both the Hashemite dynasty and the French mandate. The King met Shukri Al Quwatli, the first president of independent Syria, on 17 February 1945 in Al Fayyum, Egypt. Both countries were founding members of the Arab League which was established in March 1945. Saudi Arabia supported the coup in Syria by Adib Shishakli in December 1950. Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia and Syria were in rival camps in the 1950s and 1960s, largely because of the policies of Egypt's leader Gamal Nasser and the Cold War. Syria supported Nasser's policies and was the major Arab ally of the USSR, while Saudi Arabia was among the opponents of Nasser's policies and was close to the United States. After the Baath party came to power in Syria in 1963, Syria‚Äôs diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia again became tense. A left-wing faction of the Baath Party, called the neo-Baath, led by Salah Jadid took over the government on 23 February 1966, and declared war against monarchist nations, including Saudi Arabia. On 3 May 1966, King Faisal cancelled all trade agreements with Syria. =1970s and 1980s= At the end of November 1970, Syria‚Äôs neo-Baath leaders were toppled and removed, and Hafez Assad became ruler of Syria. Diplomatic negotiations between the two countries were opened and renewed. With the death of Nasser in 1972 relations improved further. Three months before the joint attacks by Egyptian and Syrian forces on Israeli forces in the Sinai and the Golan Heights, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Syrian President Hafez Assad visited King Faisal in Riyadh in August 1973. In turn, King Faisal visited Damascus in 1974 and persuaded then US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to include Syria as a key participant in any Arab-Israeli negotiations. King Khalid, successor of King Faisal, stated in 1975 that Saudi Arabia supported the Syrian role in the Lebanese civil war. Hafez Assad participated in the Riyadh summit held in 1976. Syria's alliance with the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War again strained relations at the beginning of the 1980s. Syria‚Äôs Assad paid a visit to Riyadh on 22 December 1981. When King Fahd became the ruler of Saudi Arabia in 1982 he developed a special bond with Assad that continued throughout his reign. In October 1989, both countries actively supported the Taif agreement that reestablished Lebanon's political system and ended the Lebanon civil war. =1990s= The relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria were positive in the 1990s. Following the invasion of Kuwait by then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in August 1990, Syria took part in the US-led international coalition that was established to defend Saudi Arabia and liberate Kuwait. =2000s= Four months after Bashar Assad succeeded his father as Syrian president, he visited Saudi Arabia in October 2000 and met King Fahd. It was his second state visit, after Egypt. The assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, an ally of Saudi Arabia, in Beirut on 14 February 2005 adversely affected relations. The Israel-Lebanon war in 2006 further damaged relations since Syria overtly supported Hezbollah, which had been blamed for starting the war. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria began to become strained in August 2008 when Saudi Arabian ambassador was called back to Riyadh and then withdrawn in protest over Syrian forces' crackdown on anti-government demonstrators. In addition, King Abdullah boycotted the Arab League's summit held in Damascus in 2008. In a start of rapprochement between the two countries, Saudi Arabia appointed an ambassador to Syria, Abdullah Al Eifan, on 25 August 2009. Bashar Assad visited Riyadh in September 2009, and in October, King Abdullah visited Assad in Damascus. Syria appointed a new ambassador, Mehdi Dakhlallah, to Saudi Arabia the same month, restoring diplomatic relations. By January 2010, Assad had visited Saudi Arabia three times. =2010s and Syrian Civil War= The Syrian Civil War, that began in 2011, damaged relations between the two countries, due to Saudi Arabia sending weapons to the opposition forces, while Iran sent arms to the Syrian government and allied forces. Saudi King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to condemn the Assad government in August 2011 \\"due to its method to deal with the anti-government\\" demonstrations.\\" As a result of these events, Saudi Arabia withdrew its delegation from the Arab League's peacekeeping mission in Syria on 22 January 2012 and closed its embassy in Damascus in February and expelled the Syrian ambassador. In August 2017, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, informed the Syrian opposition at a summit in Riyadh that Saudi Arabia was disengaging with them. In March 2018, Mohammad bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, said in an interview that \\"Bashar [al-Assad] is staying, but I believe that Bashar‚Äôs interests is not to let the Iranians do whatever they want to do.\\" This was interpreted as a break from the previous Saudi insistence that Assad leave office. However, he also stated his opposition to withdrawal of U.S. Special Operations forces from eastern Syria, which is under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) rather than the Assad government. A few weeks later, al-Jubeir indicated the country was open towards deploying its own troops in eastern Syria. Saudi Arabia has provided support for the SDF, and has met in May 2018 with SDF officials to expand military ties. On 26 August 2018, Lebanese MP Nawwaf Moussawi claimed that Assad rejected an offer by Prince Mohammad for Saudi Arabia to provide reconstruction aid in exchange for Syria cutting its ties with Iran and Hezbollah. On 29 August 2018, al-Jubeir stated at a joint press conference with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov that Saudi Arabia would work with Russia in bringing about a political solution to the Syrian Civil War. His remarks were welcomed by Syrian foreign minister Walid Muallem, who praised \\"the new language used to determine Saudi Arabia‚Äôs position\\". In November 2018, it was reported that Saudi Arabia and Syria were negotiating a political reconciliation, with the United Arab Emirates as an intermediary. The talks included potential future cooperation against the Muslim Brotherhood in the region. In January 2019, the Saudi foreign ministry denied a report that it would be immediately reopening its embassy in Damascus, following decisions by the UAE and Bahrain to reopen respective embassies there. In February 2019, it was reported that Russia was launching a focused lobbying effort on Saudi Arabia and three other Arab countries to support the readmission of Syria to the Arab League, and that Saudi Arabia was seeking assurances that Russia would reduce Iranian political influence in Syria as a prerequisite for doing so. Since February 2019, Syrian state media has ceased criticism of Saudi Arabia, focusing instead on Qatar and Turkey as threats, while Saudi foreign minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud has avoided criticizing Syria in his speeches since his appointment in October 2019. In 2019, Saudi Arabia reportedly asked the WWE to remove Sami Zayn from the Super ShowDown event that took place in Saudi Arabia due to his Syrian ethnicity. Economic ties One of the early economic relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria was in 1950 when a trade agreement was signed and Saudi Arabia provided Syria with financial support. It followed other trade agreements, but all of them were cancelled by King Faisal on 3 May 1966 due to hostile attitude of the neo- Baath government in Syria towards Saudi Arabia. On 4 April 1972, the two countries signed another trade and economic agreement. It allowed free imports and exports of local products between two countries without customs fees for agricultural products, livestock and natural resources. Following the Syrian support for the coalition in the war against the invasion of Kuwait, Syria was provided with nearly $2.2-2.6 billion in aid by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In February 1991, a joint committee was formed by Saudi Arabia and Syria, and it fostered economic cooperation between the countries. In 1997, Syrian exports to Saudi Arabia included mostly livestock, fruits, vegetables, textiles and furniture of which overall cost was over 602 million Riyals. Major items exported by Saudi Arabia to Syria were crude oil and its by products, plant oil and dates, and the 1997 cost of them was nearly 262 million Riyals. In addition, Saudi Arabia had private investments in Syria with a cost of US$700 million in the same year. The number of joint projects was around 50. Syria and Saudi Arabia signed an accord on 20 February 2001 to set up a free trade area. In December 2001, the two countries and Jordan signed a memorandum of understanding concerning the construction of a railway link to be used by all three for commercial purposes. Later both countries joined the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA). In parallel to tense diplomatic relations in 2008, both countries began to put taxes on each other's products, but, taxes were ended in 2009. Unofficial figure for the 2007 annual Saudi investment in Syria was $750m and it increased to $1 billion in 2009. On 6 and 7 March 2010 Saudi- Syrian Business Forum and the 11th Session of the Syrian-Saudi Joint Committee were held in Damascus. Five cooperation agreements were signed during the events.

Legislator of constituency has recently adopted the village under Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana ( SAGY) to lift up the standard of physical and social life of people.  History  Motras has a quaint story of origin, carefully preserved by the locals. It said It was founded 600 year ago mid 14th century by three person Mr. Mota ji. He was Gujar (chuwan). Mr. Jugul Kishor purohit. He was Brahman (shikwal) and third person dholi samaj. Supposedly these were the first settler families. Mr. Mota ji was the oldest person. And he was also called judjmaan in local language. So this village named Motras. It has a population of about 3500 persons living in around 587 households according to 2001. It has many different cast people lives. It has Gurjars, Brahmans, Rajputs, Dholis, Jains, kumhars, Nayak, Dhobis, Bhils, Balais and some ragars, chamars, harijans.  Geography  Motras is located at It has an average elevation of 467 metres (1532 feet). Motras is one of the villages in Asind Mandal in Bhilwara District in Rajasthan State. Motras is located 18.8 km from its Mandal Main Town Asind. Motras is 70 km from its District Main City Bhilwara and 39 km from Beawar. It is 181 km from its State Main City Jaipur. Nearby villages are Sangramgarh (2.6 km), Akarsada (4.3 km), Patan (4.5 km), Rampura (5.2 km), Ojiyana (6.1 km). Transport Motras has poor road connectivity and still lacks public transport. However some of private buses and autos, etc. ply to connect the village and nearby towns like Asind, Ojiyana, Antali, and Ramgarh. Similarly one bus connects Beawar and Bhilwara regularly (one in the morning and one in the evening, arriving at 7 am and 7 pm respectively ) is the only fair and scheduled way of transport. Achievement Village Motras has done well in Gov't of India's SWACHH Bharat Mission - GRAMIN. The Gram Panchayat of Motras is the first \\"declared and verified\\" open defecation-free village in the entire Bhilwara district, thus all the sleuths of administration of district has visited the village thrice and commenced a vigilance session to create awareness about hygiene and sanitation among villagers. In these sessions villagers were taught about different types of waste products and their method of disposal. Sleuths exhorted to villagers to keep this similar momentum for further several rural sanitation programme and thanked villagers for taking participation in this expedition. Pilgrim place Motras is Famous for Pabu ji Mahraj temple. Pabuji is a folk-deity of Rajasthan in India. He lived in the 14th century in Rajasthan. He was one of four children of Dhadal Rathore of village Kolu, two boys (Buro and Pabuji) and two girls (Sona and Pema). The historical Pabuji was a mediaeval Rajput prince; he is now widely worshipped as a deity by Rabari herdsmen and others throughout the Rajasthan countryside; and he is served by Nayak priests. Pabuji lived in the remote desert village of Kolu, and in that village are to be found the only well-known conventional temples to him‚Äîtwo small temples within a single compound, where puja (worship) is offered to the deity. Small shrines, commemorative stones etc. abound, but, outside Kolu itself, the absence of actual temples is conspicuous. There are two reasons for it: first, Pabuji has yet to achieve sufficient prestige as a god to warrant the construction of pieces of architecture; and, second, many of his worshippers‚Äîin particular, many Rabaris‚Äîare semi-nomadic, and are thus not in a position regularly to visit a temple in a fixed spot.

After studying theology in Paris for the diocese of Basel in 1940, he was ordained a priest and worked for several years as a pastor in Lucerne. In 1942 Haag attained his PhD at the University of Fribourg. From 1948 to 1960 he taught Old Testament studies at the Theological Faculty of Lucerne, and from 1960 to 1980 he held the chair of Old Testament at the Catholic Theological Faculty at the University of T√ºbingen. Haag in particular as biblical scholars and exegete known, among other things, he published a well-known Bible dictionary. In his 1969 book on Farewell to the devil : from the Christian dealing with evil, he is noted for being the first Catholic theologian in the modern era to deny the existence of the devil, and to deny it as constitutive of the Christian faith, claiming it to be merely linked to a cultural frame inherited from both Judaism and paganism, a position which was criticized by then Cardinal Ratzinger.Theological foundations, p. 72. He also criticized dogmas of the church doctrine, such as original sin, apostolic succession, homosexuality, celibacy of the clergy and the ban on the ordination of women. In his last years he emerged as a critic of the institutional church. In 1981, he signed an open letter to Swiss newspapers contending that a wrong had been done to Hans K√ºng in 1979, when a Vatican decree stripped the church's recognition of K√ºng as a Catholic theologian due to his denial of papal infallibility.

Portrait shot of Budhindranath Delihial Bhattacharya, published sometime between 1930 and 1940. Budhindranath Delihial Bhattacharya (1865 - 1945) also known as Budhi Babu, Budhindra Nath Bhattacharya, is renowned for his work The Pronouncing Anglo Assamese Dictionaries, which was first published in 1931. He was also a tea planter of The Crown of England, which later came under the Governments of Assam & West Bengal. Early life and education His father's name was Dharmadutta Bhattacharya and his mother's name was Aai Keteki Devi, of Nowgong, Assam. Budhindranath left a volume of literary works as a dramatist, author, editor and lexicographer. Budhindranath went to the Government High School, Nagaon, under the patronage of Rai Bahadur Gunabhiram Baruah. He was a talented student. In 1885, he passed the entrance examination and was admitted to the General Assembly Institution, now called City College, Kolkata City College, where he earned a degree in fine arts. In Jaipur, he met Rai Bahadur Radhakanta Handique, Satyanath Bora and other prominent personalities of pre- independent India who later became his close companions. Despite his talent, he had to leave his college education due to his family's financial situation. Early professional life and King Edward VIIth's coronation On 28 July 1888, after arriving at Jorhaat, Budhindranath started living in a small cottage at the J. B. Road (Babu Ali). He began working as a school teacher at the Jorhaat Government High School while staying at the cottage. Later, he visited Dhaka, Shillong and a few other places, after which, in 1893, he joined the Jorhat Court as the Criminal Peskar. A few years later, he was promoted to the position of head clerk on 17 November 1911, at the Office of the Deputy Commissioner in Jorhat. In 1894, he was given a piece of land by the then Sattradhikar (head monk) of the Garmur Sattra, near Malow Ali. He built a humble abode there and completed the construction process by 1897. In 1890, he married Rukmini (Golapi), daughter of Gadadhar Sarmah Borthakur of the Matigarung family. The couple had five sons and three daughters, who were saved by Kapindranath Bhattacharya, the sole survivor of Budhindranath's family. Budhindranath visited England in 1902, as Raibahadur Jaggannath Baruah's secretary for Edward VII's coronation. His travelogue, Bilaat Jaatra, provides exciting glimpses of Britain and pre-independent India, especially Assam, at the beginning of the 20th century, before the start of the First World War. Later professional life and the publication of the Pronouncing Anglo Assamese Dictionary After his retirement in 1920, Budhindranath set up a small tea garden at Golaghat Dighalihula, and started as an independent business person. A year later, in 1924, he was appointed valuer at the Golaghat Municipality Office. During this period, he was assigned as a Government translator to the East Bengal & Assam Governments. His contributions to the cause of Assamese culture and literature during this period were given recognition. In addition to being one of the founding members of the iconic Jorhat Theatre, he cared deeply about his country and Assamese literature in pre-independent India. He was also a member of the Society for the Progress of the Assamese Language. Under this, he contributed actively for the betterment of Assamese culture and society. Bhattacharya died at the age of 80.

It draws its story mainly from the Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus and from William Mitford's History of Greece. Byron wrote the play during his stay in Ravenna, and dedicated it to Goethe. It has had an extensive influence on European culture, inspiring a painting by Delacroix and musical works by Berlioz, Liszt and Ravel, among others.  Synopsis  = Act 1 = In a soliloquy Salemenes deplores the life of slothful luxury led by his brother-in-law Sardanapalus, king of Assyria. The king enters, and Salemenes reproaches him with his lack of ambition for military glory and his unfaithfulness to his queen, Salemenes' sister. He warns him of possible rebellion by treacherous courtiers. Sardanapalus answers by extolling the virtues of mild and merciful rule and condemning bloodshed, but is finally persuaded to give Salemenes his signet so that he can arrest the rebel leaders. Salemenes leaves, and Sardanapalus reflects, > Till now, no drop from an Assyrian vein Hath flow'd for me, nor hath the > smallest coin Of Nineveh's vast treasures e'er been lavish'd On objects > which could cost her sons a tear: If then they hate me, 'tis because I hate > not: If they rebel, 'tis because I oppress not.Act 1, sc. 2, line 408. The Greek slave-girl Myrrha, Sardanapalus' favourite, enters; when Sardanapalus proposes to spend the evening banqueting by the Euphrates she persuades him not to go, fearing some danger there. = Act 2 = The Chaldean astrologer Beleses predicts the downfall of Sardanapalus, then meets the satrap Arbaces and plots the king's murder with him. Salemenes enters and tries forcibly to arrest both men, but Sardanapalus arrives unexpectedly and, not wanting to believe that Beleses and Arbaces could be traitors, breaks up the struggle. Salemenes and the king leave, and Arbaces, shamed by the king's clemency, momentarily abandons his regicidal intentions. A messenger arrives from the king, telling the two satraps to return to their respective provinces without their troops. Beleses believes this to be the prelude to a death sentence. Arbaces agrees: > Why, what other Interpretation should it bear? it is The very policy of > orient monarchs ‚Äì Pardon and poison ‚Äì favours and a sword ‚Äì A distant > voyage, and an eternal sleep [‚Ä¶] How many satraps have I seen set out In his > sire's day for mighty vice-royalties, Whose tombs are on their path! I know > not how, But they all sicken'd by the way, it was So long and heavy.Act 2, > sc. 1, line 428 They leave, resolving to defend themselves by rebellion. Sardanapalus and Salemenes enter, and it becomes clear that Sardanapalus is now persuaded of the plotters' guilt, but still does not repent of sparing them. Myrrha joins the king and urges him to execute Beleses and Arbaces, but he, as ever, rejects the shedding of blood. = Act 3 = The king is banqueting when news reaches him that the two satraps have refused to leave the city and have led their troops in rebellion. Sardanapalus arms himself and, after admiring his newly martial appearance in a mirror, goes to join Salemenes and his soldiers, now the only ones loyal to him. Myrrha, left behind, hears reports that a battle is in progress, and is going badly for the king. Sardanapalus and Salemenes return, closely followed by the rebels, but they beat the attack off and congratulate themselves on a victory. Sardanapalus admits to being slightly wounded. = Act 4 = Sardanapalus awakes from a troubled sleep and tells Myrrha that he has had a nightmare of banqueting with his dead ancestors, the kings of Assyria. Salemenes now brings in his sister, Zarina, Sardanapalus' long-estranged wife, and these two are left alone together. Zarina proposes to take their children abroad for safety, and makes it clear that she still loves him. As they talk the king gradually becomes reconciled to his wife. She faints at the prospect of parting, and is carried out. Myrrha enters, and the king, initially embarrassed by her presence, falls under her spell again. > I thought to have made mine inoffensive rule An era of sweet peace 'midst > bloody annals, A green spot amidst desert centuries, On which the future > would turn back and smile, And cultivate, or sigh when it could not Recall > Sardanapalus' golden reign. I thought to have made my realm a paradise, And > every moon an epoch of new pleasures. I took the rabble's shouts for love ‚Äì > the breath Of friends for truth ‚Äì the lips of woman for My only guerdon ‚Äì so > they are, my Myrrha: [He kisses her] Kiss me. Now let them take my realm and > life! They shall have both, but never thee!Act 4, sc. 1, line 511. Salemenes enters, and the king orders an immediate attack on the rebels. = Act 5 = As Myrrha waits in the palace, conversing with one of the courtiers, a wounded Salemenes is brought in, a javelin protruding from his side. He draws out the javelin and dies of the consequent blood-loss. Sardanapalus, who has also returned, desponds about his prospects in the unfolding battle. Then he is told that the Euphrates, being in violent flood, has torn down part of the city wall, leaving no defence against the enemy except the river itself, which must presently recede. A herald arrives and offers Arbaces' terms: Sardanapalus' life if he will surrender. The king refuses these terms, but asks for a truce of one hour. He uses this interval to have a pyre erected under his throne, and bids his last faithful officer save himself by fleeing. Sardanapalus and Myrrha say their last farewells to each other and to the world, then he climbs to the top of the pyre, and she throws a torch into it and joins him.  Composition and publication  Sardanapalus was written while the author was living in Ravenna with his lover, Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, and is sometimes seen as portraying the Countess and Byron himself in the characters of Myrrha and Sardanapalus. At the beginning of 1821 he turned to this story, which he had known since he was twelve years old, and began researching the details. On 14 January he wrote the first lines, and on 14 February completed the first act. On 31 May he was able to send the completed play to his usual publisher, John Murray, with the comment that it was \\"expressly written not for the theatre\\". Setting out his principle that drama should be based on hard fact he commented on Sardanapalus and The Two Foscari that > My object has been to dramatize like the Greeks (a modest phrase!) striking > passages of history, as they did of history & mythology. You will find all > this very unlike Shakespeare; and so much the better in one sense, for I > look upon him to be the worst of models, though the most extraordinary of > writers. Murray published Sardanapalus on 19 December 1821 in the same volume with The Two Foscari and Cain. Byron's intended dedication of the play to Goethe was omitted, but it did finally appear in the edition of 1829.  Sources  In a prefatory note to Sardanapalus Byron acknowledged the Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus (a work he had known since he was 12) as the major source of the plot, while exercising his right to alter the facts of history so as to maintain the dramatic unities, but it is known that he also used William Mitford's History of Greece. The passage in which Sardanapalus calls for a mirror to admire his own appearance in armour was, on Byron's own evidence, suggested by Juvenal Satires, Bk. 2, lines 99‚Äì103. The character of Myrrha does not appear in any historical account of Sardanapalus, but the critic Ernest Hartley Coleridge noted a resemblance to Aspasia in Plutarch's life of Artaxerxes, and claimed that her name was probably inspired by Alfieri's tragedy Mirra, which Byron had seen in Bologna in 1819. He also suggested that the style of Sardanapalus was influenced by Seneca the Younger, whose tragedies Byron certainly mentions browsing through just before he began work on it.  Performance history  Byron intended his play as a closet piece, writing that it was \\"expressly written not for the theatre\\". His wishes were respected during his own lifetime, but in January 1834 a French translation, or rather imitation, was played in Brussels. Later in 1834 the original tragedy was performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with Macready taking the title role. It was said that Byron had wanted Charlotte Mardyn to play the role of Myrrha as she had been Byron's lover. Macready was not keen to cast her and Ellen Tree played Myrrha. Almost twenty years later Charles Kean played Sardanapalus at the Princess's Theatre, London, with Ellen Tree (by then Mrs. Ellen Kean) again appearing as Myrrha. In 1877 the actor-manager Charles Calvert played Sardanapalus in his own adaptation of the play, and this adaptation was also staged at Booth's Theatre in New York.  Legacy  La Mort de Sardanapale (Delacroix, 1827‚Äì28) Byron's Sardanapalus was one of the literary sources‚Äìothers include Diodorus Siculus and the Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus‚Äìof Eug√®ne Delacroix' major historical painting La Mort de Sardanapale, completed between November 1827 and January 1828. It depicts the Assyrian king preparing for death surrounded by concubines, rather than in the company of Myrrha alone as Byron would have it. Thereafter the death of Sardanapalus became a favourite subject for composers, especially in France. In 1830 competitors for the Paris Conservatoire's Prix de Rome were given J.-F. Gail's La Mort de Sardanapale, a text based on Byron's play and Delacroix' painting, to set as a cantata. Hector Berlioz, in his fourth attempt on the prize, took the first prize. In the mid-1840s Franz Liszt conceived the idea of writing an opera based on Sardanapalus, and procured an Italian libretto to that purpose, but he did not actually begin writing until 1849, and seems to have given the project up during 1852. Though his opera was never finished, 111 pages of sketches for it still survive in Weimar's Liszt Museum. Several other Sardanapale operas based on Byron's play were completed by the composers Victorin de Jonci√®res, Alphonse Duvernoy, Giulio Alary, and the Baronne de Maistre, and one was projected by the young Ildebrando Pizzetti. In 1901 the Prix de Rome committee selected Fernand Beissier's Myrrha, a pale imitation of Sardanapalus, as the text to be set. The prize was won by Andr√© Caplet on this occasion, but Maurice Ravel's entry is the only one of the 1901 entries to remain in the repertoire.

JSONiq is an open specification published under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license. It is based on the XQuery language, with which it shares the same core expressions and operations on atomic types. JSONiq comes in two syntactical flavors, which both support JSON and XML natively. # The JSONiq syntax (a superset of JSON) extended with XML support through a compatible subset of XQuery. # The XQuery syntax (native XML support) extended with JSON support through a compatible subset (the JSONiq extension to XQuery) of the above JSONiq syntax. Features JSONiq primarily provides means to extract and transform data from JSON documents or any data source that can be viewed as JSON (e.g. relational databases or web services). The major expression for performing such operations is the SQL-like ‚ÄúFLWOR expression‚Äù that comes from XQuery. A FLWOR expression is constructed from the five clauses after which it is named: FOR, LET, WHERE, ORDER BY, RETURN. However, it also supports clauses for doing grouping and windowing. The language also provides syntax for constructing new JSON documents where either the field names and values are known in advance or can be computed dynamically. The JSONiq language (not the extension to XQuery) is a superset of JSON. That is, each JSON document is a valid JSONiq program. Additionally, the language also supports a navigational syntax for extracting field names and values out of JSON objects as well as values out of JSON arrays. Navigation is resilient in the absence of values, or if values are heterogeneous, in that it silently ignores unforeseen values without raising errors. All constructs are defined as expressions within the language and can be arbitrarily nested. JSONiq does not include features for updating JSON or XML documents, it does not have full text search capabilities, and has no statements. All of these features are under active development for a subsequent version of the language. JSONiq is a programming language that can express arbitrary JSON to JSON or XML to XML transformations. It also allows for transformations between JSON and XML. All such transformations have the following features: #Logical/physical data independence #Declarative #High level #Side-effect free #Strongly typed =Data model= The language is based on the JSONiq Data Model (JDM) which is an extension of the XQuery and XPath Data Model (XDM). The JDM uses a tree-structured model of the information content of a JSON or XML document. It contains JSON objects, JSON arrays, all kinds of XML nodes, as well as atomic values such as integers, strings, or boolean all being defined in XML Schema. JDM forms the basis for a set- oriented language, in that instances of the data model are sequences (a singleton value is considered to be a sequence of length one). The items in a sequence can be JSON objects, JSON arrays, XML nodes, or atomic values. Examples The sample JSONiq code below computes the area code and the number of all people older than 20 from a collection of JSON person objects (see the JSON article for an example object). for $p in collection(\\"persons\\") where $p.age gt 20 let $home := $p.phoneNumber[][$$.type eq \\"home\\"].number group by $area := substring-before($home, \\" \\") return { \\"area code\\" : $area, \\"count\\" : count($p) } All JSONiq constructs are expressions and can also be contained in the body of a function. declare function local:adults() { for $p in collection(\\"persons\\") where $p.age gt 20 return $p }; The next query transforms parts of each person object into an XML element using the XQuery syntax (JSONiq extension to XQuery). for $p in collection(\\"persons\\") return {$p(\\"firstName\\")} {$p(\\"lastName\\")} {$p(\\"age\\")} Applications Below are a few examples of how and where JSONiq can be used: #Extracting information out of a database to use in a web service. #Generating summary reports on data stored in a JSON document store. #Selecting and transforming JSON data to XHTML to be published on the Web. #Correlating data from various sources and formats (e.g. JSON document store, XML database, relational database, and web service) and offer it in a web service. #Transforming collections of JSON objects into a different schema. Comparison of the two syntactic flavors There are two syntaxes of JSONiq, which users can use on whether they are focusing on JSON or XML. Both syntaxes use the same data model and are very similar up to a few exceptions. =JSONiq syntax= The pure JSONiq syntax is a superset of JSON. It is not strictly speaking a superset of XQuery even though all its expressions and semantics are available. The following aspects of the JSONiq syntax are not XQuery conformant: #No names containing dots. #No . for the context item ($$ has to be used instead). #No single-quoted literals. #JSON, backslash-based escaping in string literals. #No axis step allowed at the beginning of a relative path expression. =XQuery syntax with JSONiq extension= The JSONiq extension to XQuery is a superset of XQuery but not a superset of JSON. It is fully conformant and backwards compatible with XQuery 3.0 candidate recommendation. The following aspects of JSONiq are not supported in the XQuery syntax. #No dot-based object lookup ($object(‚Äúkey‚Äù) instead). #No $$ for the context item. #XML, ampersand-based escaping of string literals. #Object keys must be quoted #No true/false/null literals #Built-in atomic types must be prefixed with xs:. #Non-atomic types must be followed by parentheses. #The empty-sequence() must be written as such. #No array lookup and no [] array unboxing.

It is a remake of the Kannada film Govindaya Namaha, also directed by Wadeyar. It was produced by Sirisha and Sridhar under the Ramalakshmi Cine Creations banner. The film has four heroines, Sakshi Chowdhary, Simran Kaur Mundi, Rachel and Anupriya Goenka. Achu scored the music, and two tunes from the Kannada film - including the \\"Pyarge Aagbittaite\\" - were used in the Telugu version. The shooting was wrapped up in a single extensive schedule and the post-production work was simultaneously in progress. Reportedly Potugadu was going to be the biggest movie in terms of budget in Manoj's career. The film released on 14 September 2013 and was declared an 'above average' at the box office. Plot Govinda Naama Sastry (Manoj Manchu) is a young man who decides to commit suicide. He goes to a lonely spot and decides to have one last drink. At about the same time, Venkata Rathnam (Posani Krishna Murali) also comes to the same spot to commit suicide. The two sit down for a chat to find out more about their respective life stories. While Venkata Rathnam decides to die as his lover ditched him, Govinda has four love stories to narrate. First up is his romantic track with Vaidehi (Simran Kaur Mundi), the daughter of a rich Brahmin. After a brief courtship, the love story fails because Vaidehi's father is against the alliance. Govinda moves on in life and this is where the second love story begins. He falls in love with Mumtaz (Sakshi Choudhary) and romance blossoms between them. However, Govinda throws away everything in a drunken stupor, where he makes some derogatory comments about Mumtaz. Venkata Rathnam gets furious and tries to bash Govinda. Govinda vomits blood admitting that he had poison mixed in the drink. Venkata Rathnam takes him to a hospital and gets him treated by a doctor. Mumtaz is working there as a nurse which is not known to either Govinda or Venkata Rathnam. Mumtaz hides behind a wall and starts listening to Govinda's story. Next up is a love story with a foreigner named Stacy (Rachel) who is engaged to his boss. In order to steal her ring costing 500,000 rupees he separates the couple but he ditches her after he comes to know that she threw the ring into a river out of frustration. The last and final love story involves Mary (Anupriya Goenka). For the first time in his life, Govinda experiences true love. He fully reforms himself and leads a normal life. The shocking truth about Mary is that she runs a brothel and trafficks girls. Upon hearing this from the police, Govinda is heartbroken. On hiring Govinda for a job, Mary tells him that her task is upbringing talented girls from towns and his job is to transport them to her house. In the present, Govinda is informed by the police regarding this and after pleading strongly, police accept Govinda's favor in helping them in releasing the girls. The girls, all of them transported by Govinda, are in a container and after much bloodshed Govinda rescues all of them. Dejected and heartbroken by the betrayal and the sins he committed he decides to die. Govinda and Venkata Rathnam go out of the hospital and watch Vaidehi being taken to a room for her delivery and his boss along with his parents. Govinda tells two truths to Venkata Rathnam before suicide. One is that he left Vaidehi as he was aware that if they eloped, her parents would commit suicide. The other is that he separated his boss and Stacy as his boss would desert his parents after his marriage with her which didn't happen because of him. Mumtaz stops Govinda as Govinda confesses to Venkata Rathnam that Mumtaz was the only girl who showered unconditional love on him and he just left her in a drunken state. The pair reconciles and a frustrated Venkata Rathnam leaves the hospital with the hope of gaining love. He accidentally comes across a beautiful girl who accepts his proposal.

Go watch it for some light fun and good laughs.\\" 123Telugu.com rated the film 3/5 and stated, \\"'Potugadu' has a very entertaining and racy first half. But it is let down by a loud and clich√©d second half. You can safely watch the film once, for the crackling performances from Manoj and Posani as well as for some great songs.\\" Oneindia rated the film 3/5 and stated, \\"Potugadu is a wonderful comedy entertainer, which has best performances, rich production and interesting script. Manoj and Pavan are sure to get a big break from this film. It is a mass entertainer. Don't miss it to watch this weekend.\\" Great Andhra gave the film 2.5/5 and said the film \\"progresses at a brisk pace and ends in two hours. That is a huge plus for the movie. Otherwise, one would have had to suffer Manoj‚Äôs excesses for a longer time and that would have negatively impacted the film. Those who can tolerate 'loud comedy' and bear Manoj‚Äôs over action, can watch Potugadu once. Given that it‚Äôs a low budget flick with double meaning dialogues and good music, it might end up being a safe film at the box office. It is what one can term as an 'ok' movie. Surely, you won‚Äôt miss anything in case you decide to skip watching it! Watch it at your own risk!\\" Telugu Mirchi rated the film 2.25/5 and stated, \\"The ratings and analysis of the above reviews do not reflect the opinion of the audience. It is merely the reviewer‚Äôs perception and has no connection with the box office collections whatsoever.\\" Rediff.com gave the film 2/5 and stated, \\"The film may appeal to those who enjoy double entendres and crude entertainment. Others can happily give it a miss.\\" Deccan Chronicle rated the film 1.5/5 and called it a waste of time. Box office The film opened with 45% - 60% occupancy on the first day and collected 68.8 million. It surpassed the collection of the previous blockbuster film Manoj in just two days of its release. The film on its first weekend collected 220 million at the box office. Despite political issues, the film had a strong collection in its first week, 350 million at the box office. The film became the biggest hit ever in Manoj's career.

During his short life he painted a number of notable works, and is credited with introducing Impressionism to the United States with a show in Boston in 1890. He died in 1899, reported as death by gas poisoning, and is interred in Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston. His works remain in a number of American museums and private collections.  Life & Work  Breck was born off Hong Kong at sea in 1860, the son of a US Naval Officer. Returning to the United States, he grew up in Newton, Massachusetts, where he attended the Governor‚Äôs Academyhttp://governorsacademyarchives.blogspot.com/2011/04/john-leslie-breck- impressionist-painter.html for a year before matriculating from St. Mark's Schoolhttp://www.stmarksschool.org/news/detail/index.aspx?pageaction=ViewSinglePublic&LinkID;=2708&ModuleID;=275 in 1877. Following his graduation, the young artist studied painting at the Royal Munich Academy. Breck returned to Boston in 1882 and spent the next part of his career painting in New England. In 1886, John Leslie Breck returned to Europe to study in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian. While at school, Breck established many connections that would impact his artistic style. He studied under Gustave Boulanger and Jules-Joseph Lefebvre, and also met a handful of fellow American artists studying abroad. In 1887 Breck, along with fellow American artists Willard Metcalf and Theodore Robinson, traveled to Giverny, France, home of the impressionist master Claude Monet, where he was befriended by Claude Monet. Breck introduced impressionism to the United States in 1890. Breck by then had already absorbed both the formal aspects of Dutch Mastery. At Giverny he learned and adopted the impressionist style and techniques of Claude Monet. Despite some success exhibiting in the Salon in 1888 and 1889, Breck left Paris after breaking with Monet‚Äôs stepdaughter, Blanche Hosch√©d√©- Monet.  Legacy  Upon his return to Boston in 1890 he exhibited at the St. Botolph Club in 1890. At that show, and with his remaining paintings of the period, one can note that the atmospheric perspective and vibrant colors of his landscapes of Massachusetts, Giverny, and Venice demonstrate not only his great talent as a landscape artist but his integration into the great artistic movement of impressionism.http://www.questroyalfineart.com/artist/john-leslie- breck#.UgfE0xai1So He died in 1899. There is a notable 1891 portrait of Breck in France by his friend James Carroll Beckwith on permanent exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, in Washington, D.C. http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/horo_004.shtm The John Leslie Breck fund, a legacy of the artist's estate, at St. Marks School of Southborough continues to support the fine arts there.

His initial works were shown in a collective exhibition in Hindenburg in 1919. = At the Bauhaus and in Breslau = In 1920 he began his studies with the preliminary course of Johannes Itten at the Bauhaus in Weimar. He was also taught by Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky during his studies. Due to the turbulent political situation in the border area of Poland and German Silesia, he left Weimar, and in 1921 went to study at the National Academy of Fine and Applied Arts in Breslau (today: Wroclaw). He was a master student of Otto Mueller and Oskar Moll. He was a member of the artist group Die Br√ºcke (The Bridge). From 1925 Bartoschek worked as an artist in Breslau and had solo exhibitions and participated also in collective exhibitions. He shared a studio with Alexander Camaro. In 1930 he married Elsa Bartoschek and moved in 1937 permanently to Berlin. = Berlin = His studio in Berlin was near the Tiergarten. For commercial and political reasons he made popular impressionist and naturalist paintings of the landscape of Brandenburg, which were sold through the galleries of Sarcander and Kallide, at the Friedrichstrasse, in large quantities. As he was afraid to be arrested by the Nazis producing \\"degenerate art\\", his real artistic work was presented in a very small circle, and only a few of these modernist paintings and drawings were sold. In 1939 he bought a small lot in the countryside near Schorfheide and built a weekend home to work more undisturbed. In 1942 his Berlin studio and much of his work was destroyed by bombs, and he moved temporarily to Schorfheide. In 1945 he escaped from the Russians, with only a few personal items, to the western part of Germany. Works by Bartoschek, hidden in a bunker in Berlin, were destroyed in the battle of Berlin. = Western Germany after 1945 = Emil Bartoschek became part of the artist association Hagenring in Hagen. In 1949 he separated from his first wife, and he married his former student Hildegard Grunert, who taught ceramics and decorative painting in Cologne. Bartoschek's later work turned back to the modern painting and produced a large quantity of impressionistic, abstract, expressionist and surrealist oil paintings, drawings, watercolors, tempera paintings, charcoal, chalk and graphite drawings. In 1969, Emil Bartoschek died shortly before his 70th birthday.  Works  With his pictures which he painted to conceal his abstract work in large numbers, plus the destruction of his main works and his extensive and wide-ranging later works, today give a distorted picture of the work of the Bauhaus artist Bartoschek. Works of his can be found in the Museum Haus Schlesien (Deutsches Kultur- and Bildungszentrum e. V., in Heisterbacherrott, Museum of the City of Lennestadt) as well as in private collections. The Haus Schlesien in 1986 displayed an exhibition with works of Bartoschek.

He was Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Timergazin was the eighth and last child of a poor peasant family, and as a youth he was a shepherd and farmer. At age 14, he was sent to the Argayashsky District boarding school. In 1930 Timergazin entered the University of Kazan, graduating from its Faculty of Geology in 1935. In 1935 there was the scientific group of laboratories created in Ufa for decision of appearing problems (structure and bedding conditions of oil and gas containing rocks, choosing of reconnaissance directions and so on). There were geo-chemical, oil, bitumen laboratories, producers‚Äô geology department in its structure. Here the prominent specialists of oil-refining industry began their scientific work, such as A.A.Trofimuk, K.R.Timergazin, A.J.Vissarionova, V.A.Balaev, A.F.Shamov, M.F.Mikrjukov, P.S.Porfirjev and others.[ GAS FIELDS AND GAS PROCESSING IN BASHKORTOSTAN http://www.ogbus.com/eng/authors/Siraeva/gasfields.pdf ] Two years later, he began working as a geologist in the laboratory of experimental-industrial geology and petrography of the Central Research Laboratory. From 1937 to 1941, Timergazin headed the Central Research Laboratory of the Geological Study Association of the Soviet oil ministry. In 1941 Timergazin joined the Red Army, commanding an artillery platoon on the Transbaikal front in Mongolia before his transfer to a two-year military law academy in Ashgabat. From 1943 to 1945, he served in the 397th Infantry Division of the 1st Belorussian Front. Timergazin participated in the liberation of Belarus, the Baltic states, Poland, East Germany, the occupation of Berlin and the meeting with Allied troops at the Elbe, receiving orders and medals for his service. He spent an additional year of military service in Germany from 1945 to 1946. In 1946-1947 Timergazin directed the Central Research Laboratory Association, the basis of the Ufa Petroleum Research Institute (UfNII). From 1947 to 1950, he headed the Laboratory of Lithology and Geochemistry at UfNII. In 1949 Timergazin defended his thesis, \\"The terrigenous rocks of the Devonian- Bavlinsky Tuimazinsky oil region.\\" In 1950-1951, he was head of the Geological Department of UfNII before directing the Mining and Geology Institute of the BASSR until 1953 and heading the Laboratory of Petroleum Geology, Mining and Geological Institute (now the Institute of Geology, Ufa Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences). In 1958, Timergazin became a Doctor of Geological and Mineralogical Sciences; his dissertation was \\"Pre-Devonian Formation of Western Bashkiria and Its Oil and Gas Prospects\\". From 1959 to 1963, he was Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of the BASSR. In 1960 Timergazin became a professor, and in 1963 a Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR. On 4 April that year, he died of nephritis. Achievements Timergazin was one of the first to describe the lithology of the western slope of the southern Ural Mountains, conducting a comprehensive study of Permian coal and rock and Devonian sediments in the Tuymazinsky District.

This analysis, like Bustin's testimony, concluded that \\"The only conclusion possible is that the assays were detecting contaminating DNA.

It was originally designed to serve sawmills in Bobcaygeon, running southward to the Ontario and Quebec Railway at Burketon, near Pontypool. Passenger service for weekender trips to the beaches on Sturgeon Lake was a major service later in the line's life. The line was one of the last major independent lines to be built in Ontario, starting construction in 1901 and completing in 1904. It operated only for a short time before being leased to the Canadian Pacific Railway for a period of 99 years. Plans to continue construction northward to connect to the Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway never materialized. The line was abandoned in sections, south of Lindsay in 1932 and north of there in 1961. Today a portion of the line outside Bobcaygeon is used as a local road, and a short section is a nature trail, but the majority has been returned to farmland. History =Formation= Thomas Need's saw and grist mill had been operating on Bobcaygeon Island since 1832, and to service the mills the first lock of what would become the Trent-Severn Waterway was installed in 1833. In 1846 this was joined by the first mill of the Boyd Lumber Company, who ran the Trent Valley Navigation Company to haul cargo on the Kawartha Lakes as far as Lindsay. Here they could connect with the Midland Railway of Canada for shipment south. However, the lakes and rivers froze solid in the winter, limiting their markets to the summer. Boyd pressed for a rail link to Lindsay, but failed to gain support. In 1881 the long-delayed plans for the Ontario and Quebec Railway (O&Q;) through Peterborough were picked up by Canadian Pacific Railway. This line was much closer to Lindsay, and ran directly into Toronto. A new line from Bobcaygeon to Lindsay and then to the O&Q; would cut the distance to Toronto considerably. The extended Port Whitby and Port Perry Railway along the western side of the Lake Scugog was almost ideal, but had no connection with the O&Q; and was notorious for poor reliability.Paul Arculus, \\"The Last Train Leaves Port Perry\\", Focus on Scugog, May 2009, pp. 38‚Äì39 A route along the east side of the river to Pontypool was chosen. The Lindsay, Bobcaygeon & Pontypool Railway was incorporated in March 1890 by businessmen in the Bobcaygeon and Kawartha area, notably William (Willie) Thornton Cust Boyd and Sam Hughes. However, efforts to gain funding from various levels of government failed, and the charter remained dormant. =Construction= Renewed interest by those willing to provide financial support took place near the end of the decade. Surveys of the route began in June 1900, and some grading took place that year and the next. However very little progress had been by 1903, when the CPR agreed to lease the line. Track laying began in May 1904 and reached Lindsay in June. Here a dispute with the Grand Trunk over rights-of-way broke out and construction stalled until this was addressed. The solution was to run the LP&B; under the GTR lines as they crossed the Scugog River. Construction on the connection to the O&Q; quickly revealed that the area around Pontypool would be too difficult, so the connection was moved west to Burketon. Construction continued and the first train reached Bobcaygeon on 28 July 1904. Minor additional construction continued until August. Initial plans called for a connection to the Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway somewhere between Kinmount and Irondale, an extension of about 20 miles to the existing 38.7 miles of track. However, no work in the extension was ever carried out. By this time the rush to service Haliburton and Hastings meant the area was well served by other railways. =Abandonment= The southern section of the LB&P; between Lindsay and the O&Q; was made redundant with the completion of the Georgian Bay and Seaboard Railway (GB&S;) in 1912. The GB&S; had considered using the LB&P; line out of Lindsay when their original plans to connect to Peterborough were scuttled. In keeping with the original goal of providing a shortcut to the east, backtracking along the LB&P; did not make sense, and a new connection to the O&Q; was made near Bethany, originally known as Bethany Station, but later renamed Dranoel. The LB&P; and GB&S; shared the line through Lindsay and the downtown station. With both the lines operated by CPR and connecting to the O&Q; only miles apart, it was not long before one of the lines would be closed. This fell to the LB&P;, whose last passenger train operated along this route on 10 December 1932. The opening of the Fourth (current) Welland Canal reduced the need for a rail link from Georgian Bay to Montreal, and the CPR closed the section of the GB&S; between Lindsay and Orillia in September 1937. They reorganized the remaining Bobcaygeon-Lindsay-Bethany route as the Bobcaygeon Subdivision. The upper section of the LB&P; between Lindsay and Bobcaygeon was abandoned on 15 June 1961, and some of the route was later re-used for a local road. The final section of the Bobcaygeon Sub, the original GB&S; south of Lindsay, was abandoned on 25 November 1987. The small section within Lindsay, shared by the LB&P; and GB&S;, was used briefly until 1990. =Current use= The section leading out of Bobcaygeon, including the two bridges over the Bobcaygeon River and Emily Creek, was purchased by the Village of Bobcaygeon on 27 February 1963. This was used to provide access to Sturgeon Lake, and forms today's Kawartha Lakes Road 24. The bridge in Bobcaygeon was widened to two lanes in 1973. Road 24 ends at Ontario Highway 36 just north of the town of Dunsford, with a short section south of 36 used as Dunsford's Community Centre Road. Between Dunsford and Heights Road, a distance of 7 km, is the only portion of the line being used as a trail, the Dunsford Nature Trail. The LB&P; closed before rail trails became popular, and most of the route has been abandoned. A few other portions of the route are used as access roads or private driveways, but the majority now lies on active farmland. The only surviving station is the \\"Swiss Cottage\\" style Dunsford Station, now used as a cottage. Services Passenger service was offered with two daily round-trip trains between Bobcaygeon and Burketon Station, with a third mixed service train between Lindsay and Burketon. A Peterboro Lake Simcoe Navigation Co. steamer left Bobcaygeon for Stony Lake straight after the noon train arrived. The Bobcaygeon Special was a special weekend service that left Toronto Union Station at 1 pm on Saturday and returned via the CPR's North Toronto railway station on Sunday evening. This allowed downtown workers to leave for the country after working half a day on Saturday, and then return at a point closer to their homes the next day. After the construction of the GB&S;, additional service was also offered from Peterborough to Lindsay and then on to Bobcaygeon, but then returning along Burketon to North Toronto. After the closure of the southern section of the LB&P;, services ran from Peterborough to Lindsay and Bobcaygeon, with connections both ways to and from Toronto at Dranoel. Passengers services along the entire route ended on 26 October 1957. The Bobcaygeon station was demolished in 1961. Lindsay station was briefly used as a museum, but was itself demolished in 1964. Route The LB&P; ran almost due north from Burketon Station to a point near Williams Point where it turned north-northeast to round Lake Scugog. It turned north again outside O'Donnell Landing for the short remaining run into Lindsay. It entered the town on the east side of Scugog River, following it as it bent to the west, where it was joined by the Midland's line from Port Hope. The LB&P; built a new station on Caroline Street near the corner of Queen St. to provide passenger service. After running north past the station in Lindsay, the line turned east to leave the town, then northeast towards Bobcaygeon. This area of land is relatively flat, and the line is almost perfectly straight. At Emily Creek, just south of Sturgeon Lake, the line turned northward to run along the southern shore of the lake. A large trestle bridge carried the line across the mouth of the Creek. The line then runs roughly west-northwest for the short remaining distance to Bobcaygeon, crossing the Bobcaygeon River near Minns Avenue, and then ending at William's Street. The swing bridge at Bobcaygeon limited weights to smaller locomotives, including D-4 class 4-6-0.

Causes of rebellion Since the mid-16th century, the Bashkirs were vassals of the Tsardom of Russia. The main reason for the rebellion was the fear of losing patrimonial rights to lands received under the terms of accession to Russia as a result of the Russian expansion. The Bashkirs were also unhappy with the arbitrariness of the Ufa governor and complained about increasing taxes and abuse by officials during collections. Place of the uprising Distribution of the uprising in the territory of the middle reaches of the river Iset, Miass in the east to the middle reaches of the Kama River in the west, from the river Yaik (now the Urals) in the south to the river Chusovoi in the north. Fighting The uprising began in the summer of 1662 in the Urals. Bashkirs led by Sarah Mergena, Uraslanbek Bakkin and other leaders attacked Kataysky jail, Dalmatia Nev'yansky, monasteries Aramilsky, Irbitskoi, Belosludskuyu, Murzinskoe and other Settlements and managed to capture some of them. To fight the rebels, the royal government sent a large military force. Near the lake Irtyash they held a major battle. Another area of struggle was North Bashkortostan, where the rebels took the town of Kungur, Stepanovski jail, Vozdvizhenski and destroyed Russian villages, monasteries and towns along the river Sylva. The Uprising spread as the Nogai and Kazan Darugha road. The rebels, led by Gaura Akbulatov and Ulekeya Krivoy besieged the city of Ufa, Menzelinsk and other strongholds, villages and countryside. Against the Nogai and Kazan, the Bashkir government sent a large force led by Kazan warlord Prince Fyodor Volkonsky . Arriving in the city of Ufa, he sent death squads against the insurgents, and at the same time appealed to the Bashkirs to cease fighting. In autumn 1662 the majority of the Bashkirs agreed to the talks, which ended without result.article in Bashkortostan: a brief encyclopedia In the spring of 1663, the renewed uprising spread throughout the territory of Badzhgard. After deciding to continue the fight, the rebels tried to find allies. The Bashkir Siberian Darugha strengthen old ties with non-Russian peoples of the Trans-Urals. In addition, they established contact with the prince Kuciuk, great-grandson of Kuchum as well. At the time of the uprising, descendants of the last Siberian Khan Kuchum lived in south-east. Having lost the Siberian Khanate to Russia in 1598, the House of Siberia was looking for an opportunity to organize anti-Russian actions. Consequently, the uprising in Bashkiria from their point of view, was very welcome. On the move in 1662, they did not participate. But, since the winter of this year, one of them ‚Äî the Siberian prince Kucuk ‚Äî is among the Bashkirs Siberian Darugha. Kucuk appeared in the camp of the rebels after the death of their top leader Sarah Mergen in early 1663. We know that the princes of Siberia, including Kucuk, did not represent a major force in the military sense. The rebels were trying, apparently, to use the Prince as a figure around which they could unite the mass of non- Russian Trans-Urals. It is no accident they were negotiating in parallel with the Kalmyks to get more help. Trans-Ural rebels operating in the river basins Iset, Neiva, Irbit attacked forts, settlements, monasteries, established on Bashkir lands. The rebel Nogai and Kazan horsemen are still operating in the central and western region, near Ufa and the Trans-Kama fortresses. The residents of these roads were also looking for allies. They have established relationships with the Kalmyk taishas Daichin s and Ayuka. Bashkirs supported Mansi (Voguls), and Kungurskye Siberian Tatars, Mari, Kalmyks. The tsarist government once again offered the Bashkirs to negotiate. Rebels Nogai resumed talks with the commander of Ufa in autumn 1663. Their ambassadors Dinmukhamet Yulaev and Aktai Dosmuhametov in early 1664 went to Moscow and in February returned to grant charters, in which the king has granted the Nogai Bashkirs. The Bashkir Kazan Darugha began negotiations with the commander of Ufa in the summer of 1664. In autumn 1664 the Siberia Bashkirs also resumed talks with the tsarist authorities. Their ambassadors visited Tobolsk and entered into an agreement with the governor. Results of the insurrection The tsarist government, unable to defeat the rebels, was forced to meet their basic requirements. Ufa governor's Stolnik Andrei Volkonsky was prematurely removed from office, and replaced, at the request of the Bashkirs, by F.I. Somov. More significant was a concession to the government on the land issue: the patrimonial right to land of the Bashkirs was officially confirmed. The new governor was ordered to consider petitions by Bashkirs against land grab by Russian migrants and to meet their demands. The government also promised to end the abuses by tribute collectors as well.

Founding Ore wagons, San Juan Mountains The initial newspaper was started by Otto Mears, who arrived in Saguache (pronounced ) in 1867. The site had been long known to Native Americans and Spanish shepherds, but the discovery of gold and silver in the nearby mountains ‚Äì the Sangre de Cristo Range to the east and the San Juan Mountains to the west ‚Äì brought a flood of new settlers to the area. Mears recognized the need for a reliable source of food and other essentials, and he constructed a threshing machine and a grist mill for threshing and grinding wheat to make flour for Saguache and the surrounding mining camps. Soon Saguache became a booming supply town, and in 1874 Mears published its first newspaper, The Saguache Chronicle, to attract new pioneers to the area. Following several name changes, the paper took its present name, The Saguache Crescent. Present day Linotype machine Publisher Dean Coombs is the paper's entire staff. The Saguache Crescent was purchased by the Coombs family in 1917, and it has been in the family for three generations. It still uses a 1921 linotype machine to set the print, and a 1921 printing press. It features a decorative masthead, no photos, sells for 35 cents a copy, and publishes \\"all the good news fit to print\\"; Coombs refuses to print bad news. He says that his mother set that policy and it is non-negotiable. The only task that Coombs does not handle himself is that of reporter, Saguache residents bring the news to him: \\"If you bring it, and it's not just absolute insanity, and you want to sign your name to it, then I'll generally print it\\" he says. Coombs must function as repairman as well; as old machines come up for sale he buys them to keep on hand for spare parts. Saguache is the Saguache County seat and the Crescent is the official newspaper of record for Saguache County. With only about 550 residents, the paper does not generate much income from commercial advertising; Coombs says that income from the county's paid legal notices is all that keeps the paper afloat. Future prospects Downtown Saguache, Colorado The television program CBS News Sunday Morning featured a visit to The Saguache Crescent in February 2014, and at that time Coombs said that the Crescent was the only newspaper in the US, and perhaps even the world, still using linotype. In 2013, newspaper historian Michael S. Sweeney, a professor in the E. W. Scripps School of Journalism, also said that he knew of no other newspaper using linotype. Coombs says that he is not training anyone to take over the paper, so his retirement will be the end of an era.

As various papal bulls condemned Freemasonry the Spanish Inquisition did their best to close lodges and demonise Freemasons, therefore the success of Freemasonry from year to year depended on the sympathy or antipathy of the ruling regime. Nevertheless, lodges and even Grand Lodges were formed, and even thrived during more liberal periods. When Francisco Franco consolidated power in 1939, all Freemasonry was banned. In 1979, four years after Franco's death, bans on Freemasonry were declared unconstitutional, and several Grand Lodges and Orients now flourish in Spain.  History  = Early Lodges = Portrait of the Count of Aranda by Francisco Jover y Casanova On 15 February 1728, a Lodge named La Matritense or Las Tres Flores de Lys, probably after the name of the hotel in which it met, was formed on the Via San Bernardo in Madrid. It met in the apartments of a Past Grand Master of England, the Duke of Wharton, with Charles de Labelye as Master. This lodge was granted a Warrant by the Grand Lodge of England on 29 March 1729, the Lodge being placed on the Roll as No.50.The history and the persecutions of Spanish Freemasonry - Martin I.McGregor, Grand Lecturer, Freemasons New Zealand - hosted on Pietre Stones Review of Freemasonry web site.La Matritense No 7, Historia (Parte 2), accessed 5 September 2014 In the same year, 1728, the Lodge of St. John of Jerusalem was constituted at Gibraltar and later placed on the Roll of the Grand Lodge of England as No.51. In 1731, Captain James Cummerford, then serving with the British Army in Gibraltar, was appointed Provincial Grand Master for Andalusia, by which was meant Gibraltar and adjacent places. Gibraltar had been, since 1713, under British control and this Provincial Grand Lodge of Andalusia went on to form lodges throughout southern Spain. Initially, the membership of Masonic Lodges in Spain consisted of expatriates from Britain and France, but it was not long before Spaniards began to join. In spite of this, for most of the eighteenth century no organized and stable masonry arose in Spain. The few lodges that were founded had a brief and precarious life because the Spanish Inquisition were quick to prosecute, enforcing the papal bulls and the decree of Fernando VI on 2 July 1751 banning Freemasonry. For example, the military lodge founded in Barcelona in 1748 that had begun in Nice was denounced to the Inquisition just two years later and closed down. It was reorganized in 1776, but again the Inquisition stamped it out and arrested all its leaders.Pere S√°nchez Ferr√©, La ma√ßoneria a Catalunya (in Catalan), L'Aven√ß 76, 1984, pp. 53-61. In 1767, a Grand Lodge of Spain (Gran Logia Espanola) was formed, and Spanish Freemasonry declared itself independent from England. The first Grand Master was the Count of Aranda, Prime Minister of Charles III. In 1780, the name of this body was changed to the Gran Oriente Espanola, and it adopted the French system. It is known that many of the ministers of Charles III were Freemasons along with an impressive list of prominent Spanish nobles and high officials. In 1800, under the direction of the successor of Aranda, the Count of Montijo, the Grand Orient had 400 lodges.Jos√© Mar√≠a Arribas Macho, Masoner√≠a, Enciclopedia de Historia de Espa√±a. V. Diccionario tem√°tico, ed Miguel Artola, Alianza Editorial, Madrid, 1991, p785  Condemnation and persecution  As Freemasonry grew in Spain, it aroused the suspicions and hostility of both the Church and the secular authorities. On 28 April 1738, Pope Clement issued In eminenti apostolatus, condemning Freemasonry and forbidding Catholics from joining. In Spain, the encyclical received the royal exequatur and the Inquisitor-general published an edict dated 11 October 1738, claiming exclusive jurisdiction on the matter and called for denunciations within six days under pain of excommunication and a fine of 200 ducats. In 1752, a year after the promulgation of the Royal Decree which outlawed Freemasonry, Franciscan Father Jos√© Torrubia published A Guard against Freemasons (Centinela contra francmasones), a collection of anti-Masonic foreign texts. Freemasonry was anathema to Spanish Catholicism, and became associated with terms such as \\"heresy\\", \\"Jewish\\", \\"atheist\\", \\"Jansenist\\" and \\"Manichaean\\". The frequent use of these words to refer to the Masons explains why it was not until 1843 that the term Freemasonry appeared in the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy as \\"secret association, in which several symbols taken from the masonry, such as squares, levels, etc are used.\\"Augustine Martinez de las Heras, Diccionario pol√≠tico y social del siglo XIX espa√±ol, Madrid, 2003, p440-441, Masonry = Reign of Ferdinand VII (1808-1833) = With the invasion of the Napoleonic troops in 1808 lodges appeared which were instruments of Napoleonic policy. Barcelona had six, one of which was significantly called \\"Faithful Friends of Napoleon\\", and were mainly composed of military Frenchmen. This kind of Bonapartist Freemasonry disappeared when French troops left the country in 1813 As well as lodges supporting the \\"French\\" monarchy of Joseph Bonaparte in Spain, there were also \\"Patriot\\" Lodges which did not recognize the abdication of Bayonne and therefore still regarded Ferdinand VII as their rightful king. Anti-Masonic newspapers arose such as the Sun of C√°diz (1812-1813) which stated that, \\"A pernicious caste of men has spread all over Spain , who want nothing more than the subversion of the state and suppression of religion\\". Another myth arose concerning the Mason's nocturnal activities. An article published in 1812 contains the warning, \\"People of Malaga, flee these predatory evening wolves.\\" The 18th century antimasonic diatribe continued unchanged. Portrait of Juan Van Halen, anonymous work of 1853, Museo Naval de Madrid. After the 1814 restoration of absolute monarchy by Ferdinand, persecution of Freemasonry by the Spanish Inquisition reached its peak.The new Grand Inquisitor, Bishop Mier y Campillo, one of whose obsessions was Freemasonry, issued two edicts in early 1815 following the directives of the Holy See. Mier accused Masons of plotting \\"not only against thrones, but greatly against religion'\\" and encouraged people to betray them, guaranteeing anonymity. The confiscation of the property of Freemasons was also included. There were many complaints, some false, and confessions, which led to the closure of lodges. Foreign Masons were expelled from Spain and the Spaniards were forced to undergo spiritual exercises. However, there were Masons who did not receive such lenient treatment. Such was the case of the liberal military officer Juan Van Halen. In 1817 he was tortured for two days after being arrested by the Inquisition. Van Halen's own account of the experience, narrated ten years later, is examined in P√≠o Baroja's book Juan van Halen, the adventurous official (Juan van Halen, el oficial aventurero) Emilio La Parra L√≥pez &, Mar√≠a √Ångeles Casado, La Inquisici√≥n en Espa√±a. Agon√≠a y abolici√≥n, Los Libros de la Catarata, 2013, pp. 146‚Äì147 The lists of suspected Masons then made (many kept by the king) were a useful tool in the hands of powerful politicians to get rid of opponents, many of whom may not have been Freemasons, according to Emilio La Parra and Maria Angeles Casado. Freemasonry reappears in the Liberal Triennium, and develops a political role. It was repressed again during the Ominous Decade. In 1824 Fernando VII enacted a Royal Charter prohibiting \\"In the domains of Spain and the Indies, all congregations of Freemasons, rebels (Sp:communeros) and other secret sects.\\" The height to which the anti-Masonic paranoia could rise is illustrated by \\"Notions about Freemasonry\\" a little book published in 1828 that states; = Reign of Isabel II (1833-1868) = In 1834 the regency of Mar√≠a Cristina de Borb√≥n decreed an amnesty for Freemasons but maintained the ban on Freemasonry. Shortly after this the National Grand Orient of Spain was founded in Lisbon and in 1839 the Sovereign Departmental Chapter in Barcelona, dependent on the Grand Orient. During this period Freemasonry remained hidden, which did not prevent it from gaining momentum during the Progressivist biennium (1854-1856), especially in Cuba, where some Masonic lodges participated in the independence movement, as had happened when the American colonies were emancipated from Spain between 1810 and 1825 = Six years of Democracy (1868-1874) = Provisional Government of 1869 From left: Laureano Figuerola, Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla, Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta, Juan Prim, Francisco Serrano y Dominguez, Juan Bautista Topete, Adelardo L√≥pez de Ayala, Juan Alvarez Lorenzana and Antonio Romero Ortiz. Zorilla, Sagasta and Prim are Freemasons. Freemasonry expanded during the Six years of Democracy. Although lodges proliferated, taking advantage of the freedom proclaimed by the revolution of 1868, conflicts arose between the two allegiances, the National Grand Orient of Spain and the Grand Orient of Spain. The latter was more democratic and counted Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla as Grand Master. One of the most prominent politicians of his day, he was prime minister in 1872-1873 during the reign of Amadeo I. In 1876 he replaced Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta, another prominent politician of the time and one of the pillars, along with Canovas del Castillo, of the Bourbon Restoration in Spain. That same year, 1876 a Senator, the Marquis de Seoane emerged to lead the conservative National Grand Orient of Spain. During this period Masons could come forward and express their views publicly. The May 1, 1871 the \\"Official Bulletin of the Grand Orient of Spain\\" began to publish, and the following year Masonic Pocket Dictionary of Pertusa was published. In the latter work it was said that Freemasonry was an association of free men of good character, which has the sole and exclusive purpose of social betterment of mankind. According to Pere S√°nchez, \\"This was a masonry with a very thinly veiled political vocation in which not a few characters used its structure and their influence to climb to power and prestige within it, which (it is fair to say) met no opposition if the politician in question would favour their interests. It is no exaggeration to say that some of them would complete the 33 degrees (of the Scottish Rite) in three days and many others, who held important positions, hardly knew anything about the Freemasonry and did not attend rituals. Progressive ideology and bourgeois membership was then the prototype of Latin Freemasonry, which had quite different characteristics from Anglo Freemasonry, such as militant anticlericalism or supporting certain political revolutions. This Freemasonry, typical of Latin Europe, espoused positivism and universal suffrage in the second half of the nineteenth century, and some of these obediences even removed from their statutes the obligation to recognize the existence of the Great Architect of the Universe (God). Anti-masonry also flourished during this period. Some expressed their dismay that \\"a charitable, moral institution of civilizing character\\" had to be \\"veiled in mystery\\" and concluded: = Bourbon Restoration (1875-1902) = Detail of the tomb of Figueroa (1878) family in La Almudena Cemetery, Madrid The \\"golden age\\" of Spanish Freemasonry which began in the \\"Six years\\" lasted through the Bourbon Restoration. For example, in Barcelona where there were more than forty active lodges in 1890, various Masonic journals were published which raised money for charitable funds to would relieve the families of deceased Freemasons, helping in case of illness and providing a medical assistance. Founded in 1889 the Grand Orient of Spain, chaired by Miguel Morayta. In Catalonia hegemony was shared with Symbolic Grand Lodge of the Balearic Catalan Region, which supported Catalan nationalism. Created three years previously this was the first mainland obedience not to force its members to recognise the existence of the Great Architect of the Universe. During these years anti-Masonry also expanded, stimulated by the Catholic Church. In 1884 Leo XIII publishes the encyclical Humanum genus, which again condemns Freemasonry and views it as it one of the main enemies of the Church. According to Pere S√°nchez, \\"the reasons for such a forceful attack were of different types. At one level, Freemasonry had spiritually disavowed Catholicism, seeming to be a surrogate religion, without dogmas, which would replace Catholicism. If that were not enough to ensure enmity, it called for concordats, secular education, public cemeteries, abolition of regular clergy and Jesuits, political liberty, etc. For Freemasonry anticlericalism became one of the basic pillars of its engagement in politics and society.\\" An example of this anti-Masonic campaign is a work published in 1899 by the Valencian fundamentalist Manuel Polo y Peyrol√≥n, in which he said the following about Freemasonry: . The paradox of the attack of the Catholic Church and Catholic fundamentalists on Freemasonry was that it was reinforced in his belief that \\"in the world two great forces vie for supremacy. On one side we the Jesuits, authentic representatives of past, present and future tyrannies. On other side Freemasonry, the undisputed cradle of freedom and human charity\\" according to an article published in the Bulletin of the Spanish Grand Orient in 1907. This climate of increasing antimasonry explains why, when the Cuban and Philippine insurrections occurred in 1896, Masonry was accused of collaborating with the independence movement, and the police closed the Madrid headquarters of the Grand Orient of Spain and the National Grand Orient of Spain, confiscating all their documentation and arresting some leaders. This political pressure, alongside internal reasons, explains the crisis that Freemasonry faced at the turn of the century, after which it never regained the \\"golden age\\" of the late nineteenth century. For example, in 1920 the number of lodges in Barcelona did not exceed a dozen. = Constitutional Monarchy of Alfonso XIII and dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1902-1930) = Masonic Mausoleum of the Viscounts of Llanteno, Madrid (built in 1910). Masonry was no stranger to the political conflicts that existed in Spain in the early decades of the twentieth century. Perhaps the greatest impact on the organization was the \\"regional matter\\" in which two conceptions of the Spanish State, the centralist and federalist faced each another. Thus the Grand Orient of Spain defended a central Madrid-based model while the Symbolic Grand Lodge Balearic Regional Catalano favoured federalism, which led them to operate throughout Spain from 1921 under the new name of the Spanish Grand Lodge, threatening the hegemony which the Spanish Grand Orient had enjoyed. It attempted to follow the model of the United States, so set out to create an independent Grand Lodge in each region of the Iberian peninsula, including Portugal. Two years later, at the request of their Catalan lodges, the Grand Orient acquired a similar structure. The organization in Catalonia, for example, was renamed Grand Lodge of Northeast Spain. On the other hand, in the first third of the twentieth century, lodges ceased to be exclusively middle class, incorporating a very few working class members. The pioneers were some Catalan anarchists who, since the late nineteenth had been infiltrating Masonic societies. Some leaders of the Federaci√≥n de Trabajadores de la Regi√≥n Espa√±ol, amongst whom Anselmo Lorenzo figured prominently maintained intense activity from 1883 in Sons of Labour lodbge in Barcelona. Lorenzo then became Master and Orator in Loyalty lodge. However, after the triumph of the October Revolution 1917 in Russia, the 1921 Third International under the Bolsheviks banned associated parties from belonging to Freemasonry, as a \\"bourgeois institution\\". That same year the Catalan lodges Loyalty (which, the following year admitted Llu√≠s Companys) and Phoenix, part of the Grand Orient, published a booklet endorsed by Manuel Portela Valladares condemning the Third International. The repressive policy of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera regarding Freemasonry has been described as arbitrary and inconsistent. For example, while Freemasons in Madrid held a National Assembly in May 1927, many Catalan lodges were closed and some of their members imprisoned. During that time the Grand Orient remained dominant with over a hundred lodges, although the Grand Lodge had over fifty. = Second Spanish Republic (1931-1936) = The proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic opened a new chapter in the history of Spanish Freemasonry. The subsequent Francoist propaganda would discount the Republic, arguing that it was the work of Freemasons. It is true that in there were a significant number of deputies in the constituent assembly who were members of a Masonic lodge, but they did not constitute a majority. Ferrer Benimeli calculates 183 of a total of 458 deputies were Masons, mainly in leftist Republican parties. In Republican Left of Catalonia, 10 out of 26 deputies were Masons, in Republican Action 19 out of 28, in the Radical-Socialist Party 34 out of 54, in various federal factions, 48 out of 89 and from the Spanish Socialist Workers Party 44 out of 119. In the Provisional Government of the Second Spanish Republic six of the eleven ministers were Masons. However, these data, according to Pere S√°nchez, \\"can not show that Masons formed a bloc of uniform policy or practice. Spanish Freemasonry can not therefore be considered as a pressure group in which individual behavior became subject to unified goals. Clearly there was a strong political tendency, but this was never party political but followed more general principles, which were framed within the democratic ideals of social justice, by no means unique to Freemasonry\\". = Civil War and Francoist Spain (1936-1975) = Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, one of the few Masonic temples that was not demolished in Francoist Spain. During the Spanish Civil War Freemasons were persecuted in the rebel zone, and after the war all lodges were closed down. In 1940 Franco enacted the Law for the Suppression of Freemasonry and Communism, which became the legal instrument to pursue repression. The Special Tribunal for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism functioned until 1963, when it was replaced by the Public Order Court, created under the same law. During the immediate post-Civil War crackdown, an estimated 10,000 Spaniards were shot for simply being Freemasons Pepe Rodr√≠guez Masoner√≠a al descubierto (Del mito a la realidad 1100-2006), Temas de Hoy, 2006 In Francoist Spain Spanish Freemasonry only existed in exile. The grand master of the Grand Orient of Spain was Antonio Villar Masso, who along with other Spanish exiles such as Joan Bertran Deu had been taken in by the Grand Orient of France. In an interview published in European space (espacios europeos) Villar Masso said: Many centers and temples of Masonry were destroyed throughout the country.El √∫ltimo templo mas√≥nico de Espa√±a In 1936, in the first decree against Freemasonry dictated by Franco, the Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (the largest Masonic center of Spain until that moment)El templo mas√≥nico, bien de inter√©s cultural was closed, desecrated and seized by the Spanish Falange. However unlike what happened in the rest of the country this temple was never destroyed. = Democratic Transition (1975-1982) = Following the adoption of the 1978 Constitution, Freemasonry was legalized in Spain on 19 May 1979 by a decision of Court of Administrative Litigation of the High Court which overturned a decision of the Directorate General of Internal Policies on 7 February that year which had outlawed the Grand Orient of Spain. The stated reason for the annulment was that \\"the Directorate General of Internal Policy, in outlawing Spanish Regular Craft Masonry, exceeded the limited statutory power that the Constitution gives government authority...which precludes the performance of a trial of real and alleged hidden intentions in promoting their creation\\". The High Court based its judgment on the freedom of association recognized and protected by the Constitution. El Pais, Legalizada la masoner√≠a espa√±ola, May 20, 1979, accessed 29 November 2013  Contemporary Spanish Freemasonry  The current picture of Masonic organizations in Spain is that of a plurality of different interpretations of Masonic regularity, with the result that one may find there many different types of lodges: liberal, conservative, traditional, secular, deistic, esoteric, regional, national, international, as well as male, female and mixed. In 1979 the Spanish Federation of Le Droit Humain continued the work interrupted in 1938 but continued in exile. Le Droit Humain is the first and oldest mixed Masonic Order and now spans over fifty countries. The Symbolic Grand Lodge of Spain (founded in 1980) also has mixed lodges and is part of the CLIPSAS alliance. The male only Grand Lodge of Spain was founded 1982, and has the recognition of United Grand Lodge of England (as well as most Grand Lodges in the United States) and has the highest number of lodges in contemporary Spain. Seal of the Ist and IVth Provinces of the Knights Beneficent of the Holy City, corresponding to the old crowns of Aragon and Castile There is also the Feminine Grand Orient of Spain and the Feminine Grand Lodge of Spain, with other regional implementations of women's Masonry, such as the Grand Lodge of the Canary Islands, the Grand Lodge of Catalonia and the Grand Orient of Catalonia. In 2003 the Hispanic Grand Priory was founded, an obedience open only to Christians, and practicing the Rectified Scottish Rite. International Masonic organizations such as the Grand Orient of France have a presence in Spain. There are also Masonic Lodges of other organizations such as the Grand Lodge of France or the Traditional and Symbolic Grand Lodge among others. Seal of the Grand Orient of Iberia Similarly, in 2001, the Grand Orient of Iberia, a liberal obedience which, like the Symbolic Grand Lodge of Spain, welcomes male, female and mixed lodges and works mostly in the French Rite both in the Iberian peninsula and in Mexico and France. In 2010 it had thirteen lodges, with one in Mexico City and two in Paris. In 2007, the Iberian United Grand Lodge, an obedience which observed traditional regularity but not recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England emerged. In 2011 the Grand Lodge of Spain (the largest Masonic group in Spain, whose members comprise 3,000 of the 3,600 Masons estimated to live in the country, most of them Spanish, with some British and French) published the first Masonic Barometer, a snapshot of who they are and what they care about as members of this group. According to the abstract published by the daily El Pais, \\"the result is that they are believers (32% declare themselves Christian, without pointing specifically to any denomination, another 11.6% Roman Catholic), with strong, but varied political convictions (28% declare themselves liberal, 16.3% social democratic, 15.6% conservative), and consider the biggest problem facing Spain at the moment is \\"the crisis of values.\\" So apart from Christians and Catholics, there are also, to a much lesser extent (less than 5% each), Protestants, Anglicans, Jews and Buddhists. But undoubtedly the largest category comprises those who declare themselves simply \\"spiritual without affiliation to any religion\\" (35%). The Barometer explains that there are no atheist Masons (compared to 8.8% of the general public) citing the essence of Freemasonry, which has its essential foundation in the Faith in a Higher PowerJ.A.

The area is bordered to the east by Greenlees Road (opposite the entrance to Cambuslang Public Park), to the south by Western Road, to the west by Langlea Road (at Cathkin High School), and to the north by Grenville Drive. Originally the ground was owned by the Lahore family of Whitlawburn Farm in the western part and the other families who owned Holmhills Farm and Greenlees Farm to the east. These lands were used for grazing Guernsey cattle and growing barley until the mid-1960s when John Lahore sold his property to the then Lanark County Council (now South Lanarkshire Council) and moved to Montrose. Shortly afterwards the remaining two farmers also sold up so that, by the end of the 1960s, all the lands comprising the current park were owned by the local authority - most of the territory was converted into housing at Whitlawburn. In 2016 the park was highlighted as one of the best locations in the region for a \\"beautiful walk to enjoy the changing season\\".Five beautiful walks to enjoy the changing season in South Lanarkshire (Daily Record, 2016) In 2017, decorative seating - which had been installed in the park by the local community group to allow children to explore a pond - was ruined by vandals within a week.

Constructed in the middle of the nineteenth century for a local medical official, it was for many years the home of one of the city's prominent lawyers. The house's prominent location at the city's edge and its distinctive architecture have made it a local landmark, and it has been designated a historic site. Building history The Doan House was constructed in 1840 as the home of James Wilson,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999. who with his wife Eleanor was the superintendent of the Clinton County Infirmary from 1836 until 1840.Brown, Albert J., ed. History of Clinton County Ohio: Its People, Industries, and Institutions. Indianapolis: Bowen, 1915. In 1869, the property was purchased by Azariah Doan, a prominent Wilmington lawyer and Civil War veteran. During the time that the Doans owned the house, they modernized it by adding numerous Italianate features to the original Federal-style components. For much of its history, the Doan House was a prominent travellers' landmark, as it was the city's easternmost house and the first or last portion of the city to be reached by those travelling into or out of the city's eastern side. Azariah Doan Azariah Doan was born at Wilmington in 1824 and distinguished himself in childhood as a diligent student. At the age of twenty-two, he was admitted to the bar, and he split the following fifteen years between private practice and service as a deputy clerk and prosecutor for Clinton County. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, he volunteered for military service and was appointed an officer of the 79th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, of which he was the colonel during the final year of the war. Upon the conclusion of the war, Doan returned to his native city, where within months he ran successfully as a Republican for the Ohio Senate; following two years of service in Columbus, he returned home and practiced law privately until election as a common pleas court judge in 1875. In private life, Doan was married for seven years to the former Amanda Stratton, who died of cholera, and later for many years to the former Martha Taylor, who bore him six children. Despite his military service, Doan was a leader in a local Monthly Meeting of Friends; he was also a Mason and a post commander for the Grand Army of the Republic. He died in 1911. Architecture Built on a stone foundation, the Doan House features stuccoed walls and an asbestos roof., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2013-08-11. Built according to a design by James Wilson, its earliest resident, the house is built in the Federal style. Later modifications included the construction of a thoroughly Italianate front porch and the installation of a circular dormer window. Today, the latter feature is the house's most distinctive element; it is Wilmington's only residence with a circular dormer window. Wilmington is not the only city in the region in which such features are rare; a circular dormer window tops the facade of the Barney Kelley House in Washington Court House to the northeast, making it that city's only residence with such a window. Recognition In 1979, the Doan House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historic architecture and its place as the home of Judge Doan. It was the city's third building to be listed on the National Register; the Rombach Place near downtown was listed on the same day, and College Hall on the Wilmington College campus preceded both buildings by six years.

It was originally built with Commonwealth resources during the American Revolution in 1776 with ten guns.Roberts, p. 393 Rebuilt in 1808 under the federal second system of fortifications, it could accommodate 40 men and had six guns and a magazine. The fort's exact location, especially in the Revolution, is uncertain. The fort appears in the Secretary of War's reports for 1808 and 1811; thus it was a federal fort at that time.Wade, pp. 141, 236, 242, 248 In 1808 the entry is: \\"At the entrance of the inner harbor of New Bedford, two miles below the town, a small enclosed work has been erected of stone, brick, and sod. It commands the entrance into the harbor for a mile and a half in a direct line...\\". In 1811 the entry is: \\"At Eldridge Point, which commands the entrance of the harbor; an enclosed work of masonry, mounting six heavy guns...\\". The \\"two miles below the town\\" implies the fort was at or near Clark's Point, later the site of Fort Rodman. Another possibility is the area of Fairhaven known as Poverty Point or Oxford Point, part of which was once owned by the Eldredge family, although this is north of the harbor entrance. Fairhaven was part of New Bedford until 1812. A list of fort commanders shows that the Eldridge Point fort was commanded by Captain James Thomas of the Dragoons in 1810‚Äì1811, followed by 1st Lt. Henry Whiting, also of the Dragoons, in 1811‚Äì1812. By the time Fort Rodman was built in the 1850s, the fort no longer existed.

The earliest section was built about 1802, and expanded first in circa 1834 and then in the 1850s by Col. Robert Preston, who received the land surrounding Solitude from his father, Virginia Governor James Patton Preston. Dating back over 200 years, Solitude is the oldest building on the Virginia Tech Blacksburg campus.https://www.vt.edu/about/buildings/Solitude.html It is a two-story, \\"L\\"-shaped, five bay, log and frame dwelling with a hipped roof. Mid 19th century modifications gave the farmhouse a Greek Revival look. Also on the property are the contributing stone spring house with log superstructure and an outbuilding built in about 1844 and renamed in 2019 by the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors as the Fraction Family House at Solitude. This new name recognizes its usage as a dwelling for the largest enslaved population living on the site and symbolically recognizes all enslaved at Solitude. In 1872, the 250 acre Solitude farm became the part of the central campus of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, serving primarily as the college's farm. The farm house, after the death of its owner, Robert Taylor Preston, in the following decade, served as a college infirmary from 1882 to 1886. It, as well as the Fraction Family House, was then used as faculty housing for the next 60 years. In the 1940s it briefly was a clubhouse for returning World War II veterans who lived in a trailer park surrounding the building while attending Virginia Polytechnic Institute. At that time, dances regularly were held in Solitude's two front parlors. In the 1960s and 1970s, Solitude was used by the Hokie Club in addition to housing faculty in two apartments. Academic programs started using the building in 1974. For some time, Solitude housed a human nutrition and food laboratory and interior design studios and offices. Its last occupant was the Appalachian Studies Program, which has returned following the restoration of the building. Also located in the building is the Henry H. Wiss Center for Theory and History of Art and Architecture. Solitude had been vacant for many years prior to a $1 million restoration that began in July 2010 and lasted half-a-year. Much of the project was funded by the Mary Morton Parsons Foundation of Richmond, Va.https://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2011/03/033011-development- solitudeopening.html The house is situated in a landscaped park adjacent to the central campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. and Accompanying photo It was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in 1988 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. After Solitude's listing on NRHP, decade-long research and archaeology commenced to further study the main house, property, and overall site to extrapolate further historical information and evaluate what would be needed to restore the house and outbuildings. These efforts culminated in a 2000 Master's thesis by Michael Pulice, a then-Master's of Science candidate in Virginia Tech's Architecture Department, now the chief architectural historian for the Western Regional office (Salem, VA) of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. Pulice concluded in his thesis that the remaining log outbuilding, long believed to be either a doctor's office or kitchen, is a surviving slave cabin and servants quarters..

Although primarily a studio session and touring drummer, Hoh exhibited a degree of originality and showmanship that set him apart and several of his contributions have been singled out for acknowledgment by music critics. Often uncredited and unknown to audiences, he played the drums on several well-known rock songs and albums, including those by Donovan and the Monkees. He also performed at the seminal 1967 Monterey Pop Festival as a member of the Mamas and the Papas touring band. In 1968, he participated in the recording of Super Session, the highly successful 1968 Mike Bloomfield/Al Kooper/Stephen Stills collaboration album. However, his flurry of activity came to an end by the early 1970s and he remained out of the public eye until his death in 2015. Early career Hoh was born and raised in Forest Park, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago. While a teenager, he played with several local bands and met area musicians Michael Bloomfield and Barry Goldberg. After Hoh relocated to Los Angeles in 1964, he became known on the club circuit and drummed for the Joel Scott Hill groups the Strangers and the Invaders. Hill recorded several singles and the Strangers were an opening act for the 1964 T.A.M.I. Show, headlined by the Rolling Stones and James Brown. However, they did not appear in the concert film and it is unknown if Hoh recorded with Hill. In September 1965, Hoh joined members of the Modern Folk Quartet as the group was venturing into electric folk rock. Jerry Yester, Cyrus Faryar, Henry \\"Tad\\" Diltz, and Chip Douglas made up the quartet and each became involved in various aspects of the music industry and Hoh's career. The group was renamed the Modern Folk Quintet (usually shortened to MFQ), and Phil Spector decided to become their producer. Despite a lot of time spent with Spector in rehearsals and recording at Gold Star Studios, only one song came out of their association, \\"This Could Be the Night\\". To the group's dismay, it was not issued as a single, but was used as the theme to The Big T.N.T. Show, the 1966 follow-up concert film to the T.A.M.I. Show. In March 1966, MFQ recorded a single for Dunhill Records, produced by Spector associate Jack Nitzsche. The song \\"Night Time Girl\\", written by Al Kooper and Irwin Levine, reached number 122 on Billboard magazine's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles on April 16, 1966. A second Dunhill MFQ single, the double A-side \\"Don't You Wonder\\" backed with \\"I Had a Dream Last Night\\", was released in 1968, but Hoh's participation is unknown. The MFQ were a fixture on the Los Angeles club scene and opened for such groups as the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Donovan, the Byrds, Mamas and the Papas, and the Velvet Underground. They undertook a college tour across the U.S., however, a breakthrough eluded them and they disbanded by July 1966. In 1966, Hoh contributed drums to Scottish singer Donovan's third album, Sunshine Superman. The album was recorded at the CBS studios in Hollywood and included songs such as \\"Season of the Witch\\", \\"Fat Angel\\", and \\"The Trip\\" (the title track was previously recorded in London with a different drummer). Hoh accompanied Donovan during area engagements with ex-MFQ member Cyrus Faryar on electric violin. Donovan's experiences at the Trip club were recounted in \\"The Trip\\" and Hoh's \\"fine drumming\\" was noted in a review of the song. Sunshine Superman became Donovan's most popular record and reached number eleven in the Billboard 200 album chart. 1967 In 1967, Eddie Hoh's recording and touring activities accelerated. In March 1967, he performed with the Byrds' former singer-songwriter Gene Clark. Clark, who had recorded a country-influenced album with the Gosdin Brothers, was continuing to develop his country rock sound. With Hoh, guitarist Clarence White, and bassist John York (who both joined the Byrds in 1968), the group appeared at several engagements, including at the Whisky a Go Go and the Golden Bear. However, according to York, Clark was largely indifferent to audiences and the group did not last long: Country rock biographer John Einarson writes that Gene Clark's band with Hoh, White, and York never recorded, while a White website indicates that around the same time, they recorded Clark's aborted Columbia single, \\"The French Girl\\"/\\"Only Colombe\\" (eventually released on Clark's 1991 Echoes album). Around the same time, Hoh recorded with a studio group named the Giant Sunflower, which included future record producer Val Garay. Their first single, \\"February Sunshine\\", was released by two record companies simultaneously in April 1967: Take 6 Records and Ode Records, where it was the first record issued by producer Lou Adler's new record label. Ode won out and \\"February Sunshine\\" debuted at number 106 on Billboard's June 3, 1967, extended pop chart. Promoted as a flower power/sunshine pop record, it was followed in October by the second Giant Sunflower single \\"What's So Good About Goodbye\\". Without a touring band, a Los Angeles folk-rock group, the Rose Garden (without Hoh), sometimes performed as the \\"Giant Sunflower\\" and later recorded \\"February Sunshine\\" and two unrecorded Gene Clark compositions for their debut album. Hoh became a part of the Mamas and the Papas touring group and on June 18, 1967, they appeared as the final act at the Monterey Pop Festival (singer John Philips was one of the event's organizers). Although several songs were filmed, only \\"California Dreamin'\\" and \\"Got a Feelin'\\" made the final cut of the Monterey Pop concert film. The complete Mamas and the Papas set was released on an album in 1970 and additional film footage was included in The Complete Monterey Pop Festival DVD set in 2002. A review of the album described Hoh's drumming as \\"first rate\\".Rolling Stone 1970. During the extended instrumental introduction to their first song, Eddie Hoh plays an improvised drum part; at the conclusion of their set, Hoh and studio drummer Hal Blaine play in tandem as the singers leave the stage. While touring with the group, Hoh took part in after-hours club jams. Another touring musician recalled Also in June, Hoh recorded the Goodbye and Hello album with experimental folk singer-songwriter Tim Buckley. The album was produced by former MFQ member Jerry Yester, which critic Matthew Greenwald called \\"a revolutionary album that was a quantum leap for both Tim Buckley and the audience\\". Greenwald singled out \\"Once I Was\\" and \\"Pleasant Street\\" as \\"tracks [that] are easily among the finest example of Buckley's psychedelic/folk vision\\". Rough outtake material from the album session was released in 1999 on Buckley's Works in Progress. Eddie Hoh also became the Monkees' studio drummer (following Hal Blaine) and played on many of their songs. From their beginning in 1966, producers used a variety of session musicians to record the Monkees' material, including Blaine and several others from the Wrecking Crew. It is unclear which, if any, of the songs on their first three albums include Hoh. However, starting with their fourth album, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. (with ex-MFQ member Chip Douglas now as their producer), Hoh has been identified as the drummer on many Monkees' songs released in 1967 and 1968. Among his contributions are \\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\\", the jazz-influenced \\"Goin' Down\\", \\"Daydream Believer\\", the second studio version recording of \\"Words\\", \\"Zor and Zam\\", and \\"Star Collector\\", which ends with extended improvised drumming. 1968 Super Session back cover with Eddie Hoh near upper-right corner. In 1968, singer/organist Al Kooper, who was working for Columbia Records after he left Blood, Sweat & Tears, put together a recording session with former Paul Butterfield Blues Band/Electric Flag guitarist Mike Bloomfield. According to Kooper, Bloomfield chose Hoh as the drummer. When Bloomfield was unable to finish the session, Kooper called guitarist Stephen Stills, who was between gigs with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills & Nash. Upon hearing that Hoh was the drummer, Stills readily agreed, describing Hoh as \\"an old friend of mine\\". The resulting album, titled Super Session, became an unlikely hit. The first half of the album features mostly electric blues-style instrumentals with Bloomfield, while the second with Stills is rock oriented with vocals. Hoh and bassist Harvey Brooks are the rhythm section for the whole album (Barry Goldberg contributes electric piano to one song). All of the Super Session participants had performed at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival ‚Äì Hoh with the Mamas and the Papas, Kooper as a solo act, Stills with Buffalo Springfield, and Bloomfield, Brooks, and Goldberg with the Electric Flag. One of the songs with Stills is an eleven-minute version of \\"Season of the Witch\\", which Hoh had originally recorded with Donovan in 1966. It became a staple of late-sixties \\"underground\\" FM radio and a review of the song noted Hoh's \\"flawless drumming which laid down as solid a groove as Stills and Kooper could have ever hoped for\\". Another Kooper/Stills song is a rendition of Willie Cobbs' blues classic \\"You Don't Love Me\\". Hoh's drum part is prominent with the heavy use of flanging (a sound processing effect) on the track. Super Session reached number eleven in the album chart and became one of Columbia's best-selling albums of the late 1960s. It was also the best-selling album of both Bloomfield's and Kooper's careers and Stills' first gold record. Although Hoh had already played drums on several well-known songs, he was relatively unknown to audiences. However, with Super Session he acquired a higher public profile, with his name and photograph given equal prominence on the back album cover. In addition to Super Session, Hoh participated in several album recording sessions for blues-oriented musicians from Chicago, including singer/harmonica player Charlie Musselwhite, guitarist Harvey Mandel, and keyboard player Barry Goldberg. The three had recorded the Stand Back! Here Comes Charley Musselwhite's Southside Band album in 1967. With Hoh and new backing musicians, Musselwhite recorded his second album, Stone Blues. Hoh also contributed drums to the mostly instrumental fusion 1968 album by Mandel, Cristo Redentor, featuring another staple of late-sixties FM radio, \\"Wade in the Water\\". As part of the Barry Goldberg Reunion, he was the drummer for There's No Hole in My Soul. Other recordings with Mandel and Goldberg included Mighty Graham Bond, the Goldberg-produced album by the English blues-band leader/organist Graham Bond. Eddie Hoh also contributed to singer/organist Lee Michaels' debut album Carnival of Life (both he and Michaels earlier played with Joel Scott Hill). When Michaels' album was released, the personnel listing seemed to indicate that Hoh had only recorded one of the songs, \\"My Friends\\". However, in an album review, Greenwald described \\"excellent performances by Michaels and especially drummer Eddie Hoh\\". Later, Michaels and Hoh recorded four demos with Richie Furay, Jim Messina, and Rusty Young after their final recordings for Buffalo Springfield. With a new lineup, they became the country rock group Poco, but the material from the demo sessions has not been released. Hoh is also credited with the drums for Kim Fowley's Outrageous album. 1969 During 1969, Hoh continued to record and perform with Barry Goldberg (Two Jews Blues, Barry Goldberg & Friends, and Recorded Live Barry Goldberg & Friends) and Harvey Mandel (Righteous). Critic Eugene Chadbourne commented in a review of Barry Goldberg & Friends: In April, he performed with Mandel at a Mercury Records-sponsored festival called the Flying Bear Medicine Show, portions of which were released on an album by the same name. Also performing at the festival was Tongue and Groove, described as \\"something of an offshoot of the legendary, but little recorded, early San Francisco hippie group the Charlatans\\". Hoh contributed drums to their only album, the self-titled Tongue & Groove. He also drummed on What That Is, the 1969 album by rhythm and blues performer Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Hoh joined Judy Henske and Jerry Yester for the songs \\"Horses on a Stick\\" and \\"Charity\\", which were included on Farewell Aldebaran, the duo's 1969 folk/psychedelic album. Goldberg and Hoh participated in a demo session with ex-Sweetheart of the Rodeo-Byrds Gram Parsons, who was looking to form a new country rock group. The session yielded a remake of Parsons' earlier song \\"Do You Know How It Feels\\". When Parsons later hooked up with other musicians to form the Flying Burrito Brothers, he invited Hoh to become their drummer. He played on their early recording sessions, but by then had started to develop a substance abuse problem. According to the group's Chris Hillman, \\"Eddie would come to the sessions and fall off of the drum stool he would be so out of it\\". Only \\"Sin City\\" and the demo song with Parsons (with later overdubs) were used for the group's debut album, The Gilded Palace of Sin. Jon Corneal, who was brought in to drum on several of the album's songs, recalled \\"As I understand it they gave Eddie Hoh an equal share of the cash advance [from the record company] and then he split. He ended up with my money\\". Corneal's account was echoed by Parsons. Later years Some time after a last album with Harvey Mandel (Games Guitars Play, released in 1970), Eddie Hoh apparently stopped recording and performing. In a 2002 quote about the Mamas and the Papas, Denny Doherty believed Hoh had died. A 2006 biography in Great Rock Drummers of the Sixties concluded he \\"reportedly has been out of the music business for some time, down on his luck\\". Hoh was out of the public eye for the remainder of his life. He died in a nursing home in Westmont, Illinois, on November 7, 2015, aged 71, from undisclosed causes. Discography Since most of Hoh's recordings were as a session drummer, his credits are sometimes unclear or nonexistent. Albums with some tracks known to have been recorded without Hoh are marked with an asterisk (*). He appears on several compilation and career retrospective albums by artists with whom he worked. * \\"This Could Be the Night\\" (The Big T.N.T.

Like most of the BCATP airfields, the station at Jarvis was located in a sparsely populated rural area close to rail lines and highways. Like the other Bombing and Gunnery Schools, a body of water was nearby, in this case Lake Erie, which provided space for bombing and gunnery ranges. In 1934 American Airlines built an emergency landing strip six kilometres southeast of Jarvis. This airstrip included a beacon light, radio range, and radio operator.

The first six aircraft, Fairey Battles, flew in on 9 August 1940, and just ten days later the school opened with a class of 39 air observer trainees. Initial construction continued until early 1941. Aircrew trades and training paths Five different aircrew trades were trained at No. 1 B&GS.; The original trades in 1940 were Air Observer, Air Gunner, and Wireless Air Gunner. By 1942 Commonwealth aircraft, their missions, and their crews had changed, and so did the trades. The Air Bomber and Navigator \\"B\\" (Bomb Aimer) trades were introduced in the summer of 1942. Most trades required access to both bombing and gunnery training, but the time spent in each section of the school varied depending on the trade. Air Gunners advanced from basic training at a Manning Depot to a 12-week gunnery course at Bombing and Gunnery School. After basic training Wireless Air Gunners went to Wireless School for 28 weeks and then came to Bombing and Gunnery School for a 4-week gunnery course. Air Gunners and Wireless Air Gunners were sent to Operational Training Units after their gunnery course. Air Observers, Air Bombers, and Navigator-Bomb Aimers spent 8 weeks at bombing and gunnery school before moving on to Air Navigation School. Instruction Armourers loading practice bombs at Jarvis in July 1941 The same pattern of instruction was used for both bombing and gunnery skills: ground-based classroom and simulator training followed by aerial exercises. The amount of time spent in the air was low, especially between 1940 and 1942. During this early period air observers received 20 hours of aerial practice, and air gunners only 7 hours. Bombing students learned how to use and maintain bombsights, direct the aircraft pilot during the bomb run (\\"right steady steady left left\\"), release the bombs, and record the results. Trainees dropped 5.2 kg practice bombs from Fairey Battles, Avro Ansons, or Bristol Bolingbrokes. Gunnery students learned how to load, aim, fire, and clean Commonwealth .303 machine guns. They started by hand firing live ammunition on the 25 year range and moved on to firing the ground-based aircraft gun turret at Hoover's Point. The final step was air-to-ground and air-to-air firing from Fairey Battles at ground targets or airborne drogues towed by Lysanders. Equipment for gunnery training included: *Vickers Gas Operated (G.O.) machine gun *Browning .303 machine gun *Boulton Paul gun turret *Frazer-Nash gun turret *Gun camera *.303 Commonwealth ammunition Corporal checking ammunition at Jarvis in July 1941 In November 1941 night aerial instruction was introduced and on some occasions aerial training took place 24 hours per day. By 1943 bombing and gunnery courses had been lengthened. Air Bomber trainee LAC Edmon Ryerse spent 36 hours in the air in 1943 during which time he dropped 86 practice bombs and fired 1,600 rounds of .303 ammunition from a Bolingbroke. Bombing and gunnery trainees were required to master other skills as well. For example, to meet the standard for the Aircraft Recognition skill they had to learn to visually identify 72 different types of aircraft. The airmen and airwomen of 1 B&GS; Free people from many lands volunteered under the Air Training Plan. A large number of American volunteers served as staff pilots at the school. Staff pilots flew a target tow aircraft, or flew a bomber for trainee gunners and bomb aimers. In January 1941, 55 of the 70 staff pilots at Jarvis were Americans. On 19 May 1942, 23 American staff pilots and 11 other American airmen stationed at Jarvis resigned from the RCAF and left to join the United States Army Air Corps. The first trainees at Jarvis were Canadians, followed by Australians, British, Newfoundlanders, New Zealanders, Norwegians, and Poles in early 1941. In 1942 a Belgian trainee graduated. Women were admitted to the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1941 as members of the Women's Division - the WDs. The first WDs, 70 in number, arrived at Jarvis on 27 April 1942, and within six months airwomen were serving in many areas of the station including the control tower, the bomb plotting office, the kitchens, and the stores. Airwomen were not permitted to serve as aircrew. A key member of the famous \\"Dambusters\\" (No. 617 Squadron RAF) trained at Jarvis: RCAF navigator, Harlo ‚ÄúTerry‚Äù Taerum. In May 1943, in Operation Chastise, commonly known as the \\"Dambusters Raid,\\" he successfully navigated the lead Avro Lancaster bomber (piloted by Guy Gibson), at night and at very low level, to its target, a German power dam. Raised on a farm near Milo, Alberta, he was killed on a later raid in September 1943.Dave Birrell, \\"My Son 'A First Class Man' - Honouring Terry Taerum\\" (Originally published in the Spring 2003 Edition of Airforce Magazine), reproduced at website of Bomber Command Museum, Nanton http://www.bombercommandmuseum.ca/taerum2.html Facilities The school's facilities included an airfield and camp, marine units at Port Dover and the mouth of Nanticoke Creek, and a 29 kilometer long bombing and gunnery range over Lake Erie. Individual bombing targets were located along the shoreline at Evans' Point, Peacock Point, Port Ryerse, and Turkey Point and there was a land target 6 kilometers north of Hagersville. Observation towers, quadrant huts, secondary control towers, and motor transport sections were associated with these targets. A gunnery range featuring a gun turret mounted on rails was installed on leased property at Hoover's Point. The airfield, marine units, and bombing and gunnery ranges were connected by a private telephone network.  \\"Taken on Strength\\"  When a person joined the staff at Jarvis or a piece of equipment was delivered an entry was made in the station's records. The person or equipment had been officially taken on strength. By 31 December 1940, 70 officers, 556 airmen, 97 trainees, 18 attachments, and 115 civilians, a total of 856 people, were on strength at Jarvis. Two years later 93 officers, 977 airmen, 244 trainees, 14 others and 121 civilians, a total of 1,449 people, were on the books. The station was home to a fleet of 99 aircraft: 35 Ansons, 34 Bolingbrokes, 19 Lysanders, 9 Battles, 1 Yale and 1 Harvard. At the peak of training activity in December 1943 1,857 men and women, including 147 civilians, were on strength at Jarvis.

He landed at Jarvis and organized a work party to put out the fire. Williams was awarded the George Medal for his actions. Other airmen in this party were Sgt. R. Picard, L. Mayhew, Leading Aircraftman P.H. Gibson and (RAF) J. Turnstall. Picard received the British Empire Medal. The train consisted of tank cars filled with gasoline, some of which had already exploded when the airmen arrived on the scene.  Postwar  By 1947 the Crown Assets Disposal Corporation had scrapped the airplanes, dismantled the hangars and other buildings and sold them off, and cleared the site. For eight years it was leased to local farmers and then sold to Russell and Larry Hare, whose farm adjoined the airfield. In 1955 the site was turned into an automobile race track called Harewood Acres by the British Empire Motor Club of Toronto. Other uses were made until the property was sold in 1974 to Texaco Canada and turned into the Nanticoke Oil Refinery, which started producing oil products on 17 November 1978. In 2014 the refinery remains in operation as an Imperial Oil facility. On 21 August 1993, Imperial Oil and 412 Wing of the Royal Canadian Air Force Association erected a historical plaque dedicated to the personnel who served at the station, with the reverse side of the plaque memorializing the thirty-eight Commonwealth airmen and one civilian who died while serving at No. 1 B&GS.; A further memorial, in stone, to those who died serving at Jarvis is located at RCAF Station Dunnville, where there is a museum dedicated to the BCATP.

Biography The Rehberger family emigrated from Austria to Chicago in 1923. At age 14, Rehberger began studying at the Art Institute of Chicago on a scholarship that continued for three years. While still a teenager, he was also on scholarship at The Art Instruction Schools, Minneapolis. After declining two college scholarships, he worked as a graphic designer and illustrator to help support his family during the Depression. From 1929 to 1931, he was Art Director at Reuben H. Donnelly Corporation in Chicago, publishers of telephone directories. During World War II, the Wartime Committee of the Society of Typographic Artists commissioned Rehberger to paint two murals for the interior of Chicago's Union Station (1942). He moved to New York City in 1943 and soon enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces. While in the service, Rehberger was assigned to the Illustrations and Format Branch where he created visual training aids. After the war, Rehberger's illustrations appeared in the national advertising campaigns of Celanese Chemicals, Philip Morris and Sheraton Hotels; were featured in major newspaper and magazines such as Chicago Daily Tribune, The New York Times, and Esquire; and in various Christian publications. In order to focus on painting, in 1969 Rehberger ceased commercial work. From 1972 to 1993 he taught drawing, anatomy, and composition at the Art Students League of New York. Emphasizing the importance of education, he said: . . .\\"worthwhile art is never achieved by mere accident.\\" Described as a \\"volcanic expressionist\\" and a painter of \\"chromatic fury\\", Gustav Rehberger worked in oil, gouache, pencil and pen to create artwork where \\"every stroke was charged with a continuous flow of activity; whirling, driving--a blaze of tempests, turbulence, exciting commotion when one would expect the subject to leap off the paper or canvas.\\" He also became interested in performance art. Evolving out of his classroom drawing demonstrations, Rehberger's performances ‚Äì the act of painting and drawing before a live audience ‚Äì soon moved to formal performance spaces that were accompanied by recorded music. Throughout his career, Rehberger participated in numerous group shows and was the recipient of many awards and prizes. He also had a number of solo exhibitions, among them shows at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Society of Illustrators in New York. Gustav Rehberger died in New York City on July 22, 1995.

The Lungotevere is dedicated to the Marshal of Italy Armando Diaz, Chief of Staff during World War I and Minister of Defence in the first fascist cabinet; it was established as per Governor resolution on March 8, 1937. The Lungotevere lies in the area of the Foro Italico (formerly Foro Mussolini) and hosts the Foresteria Nord, an edifice designed by Costantino Costantini and built in 1933 in line with the Foresteria Sud; they were both conceived during the realisation of the Foro Italico; the two buildings served as guest quarters.

His career cut short by injuries, he embarked on a political career, holding offices as a commissioner of the navy and was a Member of Parliament. St Lo entered on a naval career, and after service in the Mediterranean on several ships, rose to the rank of captain with his own commands. Controversy occasionally followed his career, such as an investigation on murder charges while a lieutenant. He supported the Glorious Revolution in 1688, claiming to have had an important part in its success. His active seagoing career came to an end after 1689, when his ship was captured by French warship and St Lo was wounded. After time in France as a prisoner of war, he returned to England and took up various political positions, while writing about his observations and thoughts on naval administration. Holding administrative posts, and serving as commissioner for some of the dockyards, he was also an extra commissioner for the navy. As commissioner at Plymouth he had an important role in supporting the construction of the first Eddystone Lighthouse, but when he sent the project's guardship away, the crew and the architect, Henry Winstanley, were promptly captured by a French privateer. Though the men were eventually released, perhaps by the personal intervention of Louis XIV of France, St Lo was reprimanded. St Lo entered parliamentary politics in 1701, sitting for the constituency of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. He supported the Tory interest, until his defeat in 1705. He continued his administrative career until the accession of King George I in 1716, and was left unemployed in the subsequent redistribution of posts. He died two years later. Family and early life St Lo was born on 19 April 1655, the fourth son of John St Lo of Little Fontmel, Dorset. His mother was Margaret, n√©e Fawconer, the daughter of William Fawconer of Salisbury. George's grandfather was Edward St Lo, of Knighton, Wiltshire. George's family gave him important political connections, as he descended on his father's side from the Hyde family. His great-grandmother Elizabeth was the granddaughter of Laurence Hyde, of Hatch, Wiltshire, who was the grandfather of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. St Lo's parentage brought him the important patronage of Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester, which aided his rise through the navy. He was a third cousin of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne, which also was a factor in his later actions in support of the Orangist cause. St Lo entered the navy and after a period of service, was appointed as lieutenant of on 16 January 1678, serving in the Mediterranean in operations against the Barbary States. The commander in the Mediterranean, Admiral Arthur Herbert, moved St Lo into the 46-gun under Captain Sir George Rooke, but while serving on her in May 1681, he found himself accused, with another officer, of having committed a murder in Tangier. The matter was investigated, with St Lo acquitted in September 1682. His career does not appear to have suffered unduly by the accusation, as he was promoted to captain on 11 April 1682, and given command of the 50-gun . St Lo remained with Dartmouth for the next six years, recommissioning her in March 1685. He went out to the West Indies in 1686, and while there clashed with the acting governor of the Leeward Islands, Sir James Russell. Russell had been profiting from the widespread piracy going on in the Caribbean waters, causing St Lo to criticize this as an abuse of his authority. His next command was the 46-gun , which he took over on 30 August 1688. The Portsmouth was attached to the fleet under Admiral George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth, based in the River Medway during the events of the Glorious Revolution. Legge failed to intercept the fleet bringing William of Orange to Britain, with St Lo later declaring himself an avowed supporter of the new regime. He wrote that he > was so true a friend to the Revolution ... that (at the peril of his life) > he brought the Prince of Orange‚Äôs Declaration into the fleet then in the > Downes ... notwithstanding it had been declared that whoever brought the > same should be tried for sedition. After this the officers of the fleet came > to a resolution not to fight the Dutch and subscriptions were taken to that > purpose which were carried to the Prince of Orange. Later career =French capture and pamphlets= St Lo's support for the Orangists secured his career, and he remained in command of Portsmouth after the revolution. He was present at the Battle of Bantry Bay on 1 May 1689, but while in the English Channel in August 1689, Portsmouth was attacked by the 58-gun French ship Marquis, and was captured. St Lo was severely injured in the seven-hour-long engagement, and was taken prisoner. The French took him to Brest, and then to Nantes, as a prisoner of war. St Lo spent the next two years a prisoner, a period he later claimed cost him ¬£500 in expenses. He was paid ¬£100 from the royal bounty, and his wife made a petition for him to be exchanged on 11 January 1691. His time spent in Brest and Nantes was put to good use in observing the French naval system, and in 1693 he published the pamphlet England's Safety, or a Bridle to the French King,A rare edition at public auction at Bonhams in 2008 sold for ¬£1,080 based on his observations. Impressed by the speed of French naval preparations, he wrote that > \\"while [I] was at Brest, I was astonished by the expedition used by the > French in manning and fitting out their ships, which, till then, I thought > could be done no where sooner than in England, where we have ten times the > shipping, and consequently ten times more seamen than they have in France. > But there I saw twenty sail of ships, of about sixty guns each, got ready in > twenty days time: they were brought in, and the men discharged; and upon an > order from Paris they were careened, keeled up, rigged, victualled, manned, > and out again in the said time, with the greatest ease imaginable. I > likewise saw one ship, of one hundred guns, had all her guns taken out there > in four or five hours time, which I never saw done in England in twenty-four > hours, and this with great ease and less hazard.\\" St Lo was back in England by September 1692, as in this month he presented to the Privy Council proposals for raising 20,000 seamen for the navy without having to resort to impressment. St Lo proposed that merchants be required to register their ships. For every 50 tuns, the merchant should provide one seaman for the navy, or else be liable to pay a ¬£5 volunteering bounty. He followed this up with second pamphlet, published in 1694, England's Interest, or, A Discipline for Seamen, in which he further propounded his views on the manning of the navy. =Administrative posts= St Lo's wounds sustained in the battle appear to have put an end to his service at sea. He was offered the post of governor of New York, but declined in January 1693 on the grounds of the \\"indisposition occasioned by his wound\\". Instead on 8 January 1693 he was appointed a commissioner of prizes. The appointment was short-lived, he relinquished it on 23 January, and on 24 June 1693 he was appointed to sit on the Navy Board as an extra commissioner of the navy. His posting here was delayed for two months though as an investigation was taking place into alleged abuses during his time as a prize commissioner, for which he was eventually acquitted. The first Eddystone Lighthouse, designed by Henry Winstanley, and under construction during St Lo's time as commissioner at Plymouth An appointment as resident-commissioner at Plymouth followed in 1695, and in 1697 he received orders to assist in the building of the first Eddystone Lighthouse, to the design drawn up by Henry Winstanley. St Lo was required to provide protection for the workers on the exposed rock, and he assigned the 26-gun to this task. In June however he took the Terrible from her duties to join the fleet, and failed to provide a replacement. A French privateer happened upon the undefended rock, and promptly took the workers, and Winstanley, captive, and transported them to France. Word of Winstanley's capture is supposed to have reached King Louis XIV, who ordered his release with the comment \\"France is at war with England, not with humanity.\\" St Lo received a sharp reprimand from the Navy Board for this turn of events, for having neglected their orders to him. Despite these events he sent various proposals to the House of Lords on the subject of improving naval administration. He submitted a paper to the committee on a shipbuilding bill in April 1694, and gave evidence concerning naval maladministration in March 1695. Commenting on the difficulties of preventing smuggling in England's Caribbean possessions, he wrote \\"Most of Our Islands, but especially Antegua and St. Christopher have so many bays & places where they may put on board Sugars, yet it is impossible for ye Custom house Officers (tho ever so careful) to prevent\\". St Lo suggested that \\"two or three Small vessels [with] good sailors [should be sent] to cruise up & down, [and] examine all Sloops & Boates passing to & fro.\\" Parliamentary career St Lo's interest in politics began prior to 1698, when he stood as a candidate for the constituency of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. He was defeated that year, and again when he stood at the January 1701 election. He was successful however in the November 1701 election, where he went on to represent Tory interests. He approved the motion on 26 February 1702, vindicating the impeachments of King William's Whig ministers, and on 13 February 1703 opposed the Lords' amendments to the bill for enlarging the time for taking the oath of abjuration. St Lo was listed as a placeman in 1705, and on being defeated at the election that year, retired from parliamentary politics. Later administrative duties St Lo had been appointed an equerry to Prince George of Denmark by 1700, a post he held until c. 1704, and in 1703 moved from Plymouth to Chatham, still serving as a resident commissioner. While at Chatham he took an interest in dry docks and designed a prototype entrance caisson for the yard. Keenly interested in efficiency, he was outspoken in his desire for reform, leading to a description of him as \\"one of the most forceful if not to say irregular, of the outstation commissioners\\". He was at times combative with his superiors, being reprimanded by the Navy Board on 4 October 1699 for expressing himself \\"in such a manner as inferior officers ought not to do towards their superiors\\". Another reprimand came after his move from Plymouth to Chatham, for taking with him both the new dockyard yacht, , and items of official correspondence. His assertive nature was further illustrated in an incident when he confronted striking dockyard workers at Chatham with a drawn sword, and chased them from the yard. While living at Chatham he ordered the dockyard's commissioner's house to be rebuilt. St Lo was commissioner at Chatham until the post was abolished on 21 October 1712, on the justification of \\"for easing the public charge\\". Instead he was appointed commander-in-chief of all ships in the Medway and at the Nore. The accession of King George I in 1714 caused him to be superseded, and on 16 November that year he ceased to be on the Navy Board as well. He entered retirement and saw no further service or employment. Family and legacy St Lo married Elizabeth Cheffinch, the daughter of Amphilis Cheffinch of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, on 26 March 1682. They had one son, John, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary. George St Lo died in retirement at Northfleet on 20 September 1718. His will, dated 4 October 1716, was proved on 8 October 1718, and he was buried in Northfleet. His nephew, Edward St. Lo, followed his uncle in a naval career, rising to the rank of rear-admiral, before succumbing to disease during the War of the Austrian Succession. Notes a. A slight disagreement exists between Laughton's biography in the Dictionary of National Biography, and Watson's in The History of Parliament. Watson writes that St Lo was not promoted to captain until 1688, although his summary of achievements in the same source notes that he was a captain in 1682. b. Laughton writes that this took place in 1690. Watson writes August 1689. J. J. Colledge's Ships of the Royal Navy confirms that Portsmouth was taken in August 1689, and subsequently blew up. c. Watson mentions only one daughter and one son. Laughton names two daughters, plus his son John, but goes on to speculate that Edward St Lo appears to have been another son, who was not mentioned in the will. Watson instead notes that Edward was George's nephew.

The game was co-developed by Rovio Entertainment and Exient Entertainment, and was released on November 15, 2013. The game was compatible with Hasbro Telepods that will allow the player to summon a specific kart. The game's tracks are located on the 3D-rendered Piggy Island. The game also featured upgradable karts and unique powers for each character. As of October 2015, Go! has been downloaded over 100 million times and team multiplayer was added. In 2018 Angry Birds Go! stopped receiving major updates from Rovio. As of December 2019, the game has been removed from the App Store, silently being discontinued. Gameplay In Angry Birds Go!, players can choose how they want to move their kart. If players choose \\"tilt\\", they must the tilt the device into the direction they want the kart to move into. If players choose \\"touch\\", players must then tap on either the left or right part of the screen to move the kart to the left or right respectively. To start the race, they must pull the kart back from a large slingshot, then release when the \\"GO!\\" text appears. If players release it early, all other opponents will also launch early, but the player's kart will spin, slowing it down. Players can collect coins while racing. Players can also use a character's special power, depending on the bird or pig they selected to race. But instead of collecting it on the track, they charge up, and be reusable in a race for three gems. The races, however, has no laps whatsoever and when finished with the race one energy unit, originally shown as cupcakes, is lost and is slowly regained with time. When players are not racing, they may use the collected coins to upgrade their kart. This feature is essential on progressing for certain race types may only be repeated if a kart's CC or \\"Cake Capacity\\" is high enough, which can be increased by upgrading. Players can also change characters when not racing, for each character has their own unique special power, that can greatly help players on certain race types, and most importantly if the chosen racer is out of energy. Gems are an in-game currency that is either purchased with real money or slowly gained by competing races. This may be used to buy additional karts. The July 2015 update added Formula One driver Ayrton Senna to the character roster, he is similar to Chuck and is playable permanently. The update also came with a way to earn Senna's racing helmet in-game by placing in 41 races with Senna; this is the number of races won during Senna's career.Angry Birds GO Ayrton Senna Update Out Now! July 2, 2015 In June 2016, the game was overhauled to version 2.0. Players can race (or visit an ad every few hours) to earn tickets, which can be redeemed to open treasure chests containing coins, gems, and parts. The parts can be used to upgrade karts. Energy was still used to initiate races, and it recharges with time, watching ads, and/or spending gems. =Race types= There are different types of racing for each of the courses: * Race is a downhill race against up to seven other opponents. * Time Boom is a solo challenge where you have to reach the finish before the timer runs out, while also avoiding obstacles. * Fruit Splat is either solo or against up to two other racers where you have to hit a set number of fruits. After the fruit meter is emptied, the fruits change to coins. On the Sub Zero course, it is called \\"Ice Splat\\", where the fruits are replaced by ice cream sandwiches and related sweet treats. * Versus is against another racer with Easy, Medium and Hard option to choose for vary of difficulty or coins earned when won. * Champion Chase is a head-to-head race against a new racer; after three wins you will unlock the racer. (version 1.0 only) * Slalom (only in Sub Zero and Weekly Tournament) is a race type involves driving through gates in a certain amount of time. Every time you miss a gate, a portion of time is taken off the clock and 5 TNT crates drop in front of your kart. (version 1.0 only) In version 1.0, for Race, Time Boom and Fruit Splat races, these can only be played for five rounds with increase in difficulty until all five rounds each are completed, and then players can complete challenges. Each race type except \\"Versus\\" has a CC (Cake Capacity, earned from getting upgrades) requirement before you can enter that race type each time. In addition, there is a Jenga mode unlocked either by entering a code from the Angry Birds Jenga toy or with an in-app purchase; this has the racer going down a ramp to smash into blocks and pigs. In version 2.0, Race, Time Boom, and Fruit Splat are the main types of racing. Versus is available against Boss characters. Development On 12 June 2013, developer Rovio Entertainment posted a teaser trailer website showing the Red Bird speeding into the distance after a \\"Ready, Set, Go\\" countdown. The teaser fueled speculation by journalists and fans that the game would be either a racing game or an endless running game. Rovio decided the kart racing was a good fit due to supply and demand - there were calls on various forums for a mobile karting game.From kart to finish the making of Angry Birds Go. Angry Birds Go! was one of the first apps released simultaneously on the four major smartphone platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10. This app supports Rovio accounts so players can sync progress between different devices on the same operating system. In version 2.0, the game was completely redesigned with a new chapter structure. Races can be replayed although rewards for each challenge are given only once. Daily challenges and tournaments involving a selection of active online players trying to accumulate points in a limited time enable players to win tickets, which can be redeemed for upgrade parts, coins, and gems. Coins can also be used to buy upgrade parts. =Telepods= Telepods are figures created by Hasbro that was first used for Angry Birds Star Wars II. It allows you to summon a specific kart, but not the specific racer shown on the toy. The summoned kart works in any track, but not all the karts can be played in every track. If a kart of a locked course is summoned, it will unlock the course, but the only playable race type is the \\"Versus\\" mode of the first track. When using Telepods, to summon the specific kart it is necessary to scan the QR code each time after the app is fully closed. =Multiplayer= Rovio announced on December 13, 2013 that the multiplayer feature will be included in the upcoming Spring 2014 update. After the release of the May 2014 update, multiplayer was partially featured as a \\"Weekly Tournament\\", where the player tries to compete in five events against the player's Facebook friends, similar to Angry Birds Friends. In the July 2014 update, multiplayer was further added within the game. According to Rovio, this is part one of the update. The online multiplayer is asynchronous, thus players are not competing with each other at the same time. However, Rovio hints that part two of their update may contain synchronous online racing. In the November 2014 update, multiplayer features team racing with 3 other racers at the same time, and night racing is an option. In early 2015 update, local multiplayer where players can race each other if they are all using the same Wi-Fi network. Then somehow in 2017, the same year that Rovio closed down production, the tournament will no longer work. Reception The game has received mixed reviews, with a Metacritic score of 60/100 based on 24 reviews. The Guardian liked the gameplay and was not overly bothered by the in-app purchases. Tech2 did not like the energy system, which only allows you to play five races with a bird, after which they are locked unless you wait or unlock with crystals (which are slowly earned in-game or with an in-app purchase) and did not like the vehicle upgrade process using in-game currency that is slowly earned by racing or with an in-app purchase for coins.

Infection results in lesions and the degradation of each layer of shell, resulting in secondary bacterial infections and potentially death.  Discovery and spread  Epizootic Shell Disease (ESD) was first identified in Long Island Sound in the 1990s. ESD then spread into the Southern New England Lobster fishery, infecting up to 40% of the lobster population. Widespread ESD has generally failed to spread to northern portions of the Gulf of Maine and Nova Scotia. While ESD spread throughout Long Island Sounds, the fishery's annual lobster catch fell from 3.7 million pounds in 1998 to just 142,000 pounds in 2011  Population level impacts  Moderate to severe levels of infection have been shown to cut survival rates of adult lobsters by as much as a third and found to have infected up to 85% of egg barring females in Long Island Sound - 16X higher than the population average. ESD in egg bearing females could be a major contributor to the rapid decline of lobster populations in Southern New England. The prevalence of ESD in this segment of the population could severely limit reproduction, exacerbating declines in population wide survival rates. This level of infection could be due to females not being able to molt while ovigerous. This prevents them from losing their diseased shell and producing a new healthy shell.  Effects of climate change  One theory for the southern containment of Epizootic Shell Disease is that warm ocean bottom temperature could be one of the main enabling conditions for ESD. In 2016, after multiple warmer than average summers, infection rates jumped from <1% to 1.25% in coastal Maine. Further, in 2017, a team of researchers and students from Bowdoin College‚Äôs research station on Kent Island in the Bay of Fundy reported a mass low tide stranding of Jonah Crabs, Cancer borealis, infected with a shell disease resembling ESD. This was a first of its kind observation in the Bay of Fundy and the other cold waters off of Nova Scotia. = Warming ocean temperatures = The Northwest Atlantic is warming at a faster rate than 99% of the ocean. Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) in the region are expected to increase by 2.3-4.3‚ÑÉ by 2100. This level of warming could result in an increase in the number of days the lobster population experiences heat related stresses (considered above 20‚ÑÉ) which could add to a possible spread of ESD at rates previously observed in Southern New England and Long Island Sound. A strong correlation has been found between increased temperature and increased rate of disease progression (total change in diseased area). 18¬∞C saw an average overall disease progression 2.8X greater than the 6¬∞C and an average daily progression 2.5X greater. With these rates, it was estimated that progression from initial infection to a moderate level of infection would take just 94 days at 18¬∞C, compared to 232 days at 6¬∞C. = Ocean acidification = Exposure to elevated levels of dissolved CO2, resulting in a lower pH, has been shown to significantly reduce growth rates of American Lobsters. This has potentially significant implications for the commercial fishery that is priced by the pound. As time exposed to lower pH increased, so did the chances of a lobsters developing shell disease possibly because the physiological stress of low pH could inhibit the immune response of the lobsters. Lobsters have also shown an increase in intermolt time with lower pH, suggesting the resulting decreased calcification could also predispose the lobsters to shell disease infection.

Background Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup are from Hampstead, London. They were volunteering at a local school in Zanzibar. Prior incidents In November 2012, Sheik Fadhil Soraga was the victim of an acid attack. In February, a Roman Catholic priest was shot to death and a church was burned down. In the past, another priest was shot and wounded and other churches were also burned. According to a close friend of the two, a Muslim woman struck Ms. Trup in the face for singing in public during Ramadan. Acid attack The two were nearing the end of their one-month volunteer teaching when the attack happened. The attack happened at 7:15 pm on 7 August 2013. The two women were walking on the street on their way to dinner when their attackers approached and threw sulphuric acid on them. Both women suffered burns to their face, hands, and chest. One woman suffered lesser injuries because she was walking on the side of the curb away from the attackers, so was doused with less liquid. Aftermath After being treated at a local hospital, the two returned to London to be treated by specialists. Gee lost an ear and faces further multiple operations, but has expressed determination to overcome the attack and a desire for justice. Five men were questioned by the police as of August 9, 2013. As of August 13, 2013, no arrests have been made for committing the acid attack and the motive for the attack is unknown. Police have arrested Sheikh Issa Ponda Issa after he ran from the police. He was wanted for a possible connection to the acid attack. Mr Ponda had previously been convicted of inciting religious hatred. A reward of 10 million Tanzanian shillings has been offered for information leading to the capture of the attackers.

In 1794 a fort at Gloucester was funded as part of the federal first system of U.S. fortifications. The selectmen of Gloucester requested that Fort Anne be rebuilt as the new fort. The fort was built at the direction of Stephen Rochefontaine, a former French military engineer and Revolutionary War veteran working in the United States as a civilian; the next year he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel and commander of the Corps of Artillerists and Engineers.Wade, pp. 15-16Wade, p. 221 Assisting him was Major John Lillie, a former artillery officer with the Continental Army and possibly the fort's namesake.Heitman, p. 350Pierce, p. 23 The goal was to mount eight seacoast guns with a separate citadel, but as no federal funds were appropriated after 1795, it is not clear how much was accomplished. It was popularly called Fort Lillie until 1814 but never assigned an official name except Fort at Gloucester by the US Army.Fort at Gloucester at FortWiki.com =19th century= The fort was probably upgraded in 1807 under the second system of U.S. fortifications, as it appears in the secretary of war's fortifications report dated December 1808. It is briefly mentioned as \\"the old fort of stone, in front of this place... has been repaired\\".Wade, p. 235 The report for December 1811 states \\"At the head of the harbor, an enclosed battery, mounting seven guns, covered by a blockhouse\\".Wade, p. 242 In 1814, during the War of 1812, the fort was renamed Fort Defiance. The fort went into caretaker status after that war, but the caretaker was later removed. The fort was burned by vandals in 1833, and rebuilt in 1851. Watch House Point, an 1860 painting of the fort by Fitz Henry Lane, shows the fort with stone-faced walls topped by earth. It was garrisoned during the Civil War and possibly rearmed.Lesch, Scott B., Big guns over Gloucester in the Civil War (blog) Abandoned after that war, the land remained a federal reservation into the 1920s; it is unclear when the fort was demolished.

Becker (born September 3, 1932) is an American academic and educator. She is a scholar of the musical and religious cultures of South and Southeast Asia, the Islamic world and the Americas. Her work combines linguistic, musical, anthropological, and empirical perspectives. As an ethnomusicologist and Southeast Asianist, she is noted for her study of musics in South and Southeast Asia, including Javanese gamelan, Burmese harp, music and trance, music and emotion, neuroscience, and a theoretical rapprochement of empirical and qualitative methods. Becker teaches at the University of Michigan.Terry E. Miller, \\"Becker, Judith O.\\" in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001). In 2000, Becker was named the Glenn McGeoch Collegiate Professor of Musicology at the University of Michigan, and she was named professor emerita of music in 2008. From 1993 to 1997, she was a Senior Fellow of the Michigan Society of Fellows. Scholarly work and contributions Becker completed a bachelor's degree in music at the University of Michigan before completing the doctorate there in 1972. Her early work was based on in-depth ethnography and on-site research of the Burmese harp (sang gauk) and Javanese gamelan; however, her later work challenged in-depth ethnography as the dominant research method in ethnomusicology, specifically by investigating the relationship between esoteric texts of Tantrism and Sufism with musical thinking and more recently through explorations of the intersections of neuroscience, music, and emotion.Interview with Judith Becker by R. Anderson Sutton, Newsletter of the Society for Ethnomusicology, vol. 47, no. 2 (March 2013), http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ethnomusicology.org/resource/resmgr/newsletters/semnl47-2.pdf (accessed January 2014). These studies, which were informed by ethnography as well as other research methods, were the basis for Becker's books Gamelan Stories (1993) and Deep Listeners (2004). From 1968 to 2002, Becker was director of the University of Michigan Javanese gamelan ensemble (Kyai Telaga Madu), and with Alton L. Becker directed many performances of wayang and klenengang in Ann Arbor and Indonesia. Becker's latest work, bringing perspectives from empirical studies of the brain and perception to the study of musical perception and emotion, focused on \\"trying to create bridges, between the two disciplines, and different ways of understanding musical experience.\\" She has been a distinguished lecturer in ethnomusicology at conferences and symposia, and in 2003 was selected as the Charles Seeger lecturer for which she delivered an address titled \\"Trancers and Deep Listeners.\\" Becker received the Alan Merriam Prize from the Society for Ethnomusicology in 2005 for her book, Deep Listeners: Music, Emotion, and Trancing. She was named an Honorary Member of the Society for Ethnomusicology in 2010.

Contents The article establishes that the territorial legislature must be bicameral, and composed by the Senate as the upper house and the House of Representatives as the lower house. It also established the composition of each house, and that Puerto Rico must be divided into senatorial and representative districts for the purpose of elections. The article also established a board that must revise the districts after each decennial census so that they remain practicable, and divided upon the basis of population and means of communication. It also established how the number of members of each house must increase when a political party obtains more than two thirds of the seats in one or both houses. This was done in order to reduce the likelihood of one party having absolute control over constitutional amendments, as these require at least two thirds of the vote of each house in order to be enacted. Article Four was also very loose regarding the rules overseeing each house, establishing that each house must be the sole judge of the election, returns and qualifications of its members, that each house must choose its own officers, and that each house must adopt rules for its own proceedings appropriate to legislative bodies. This, in essence, gives broad powers to each house on how to structure itself and which procedures it must follow. It, however, established the posts of President of the Senate and Speaker of the House without any other specifics besides the title of the posts although interpretatively the article meant them to be the presiding officers of their respective house. The article also established that the sessions of each house must be open, what constitutes quorum, and where should they meet, namely in the Capitol of Puerto Rico. It also granted parliamentary immunity to its members. Article Four also established the parliamentary procedure to enact bills, namely that they must be printed, read, referred to a commission and returned therefrom with a written report, approved by the majority of which each house is composed, and signed by the governor in order to become law. The article also established the exclusive powers of each house, as well as establishing the post of Comptroller.

The Eastern Point fort, never formally named, was sited to be able to engage any enemy approaching from seaward. It was built near the end of the peninsula forming the eastern side of Gloucester's harbor, on the \\"high land of the farm of Thomas Niles\\". Construction was supervised by Major Charles E. Blunt. Eastern Point was the only Civil War fort on the north shore of Massachusetts Bay not on the site of a previous fortification. The fort was an earthwork that could accommodate seven guns, with three magazines and a bombproof shelter, along with a barracks and hospital outside the fort. However, an armament report dated January 31, 1865 shows ten guns were on hand, including three 32-pounder rifled guns, four 32-pounder smoothbore guns, and three 24-pounder rifled guns. An author has examined a period photograph and determined that the 24-pounders could have been in the bombproof, which was sited for landward defense with embrasures suitable for cannon. Eastern Point was garrisoned by the 2nd and 11th Unattached Companies of Massachusetts militia in 1864.Higginson, pp. 318, 321 The fort was abandoned in 1867 and the buildings demolished at some point, though the earthworks remain.

The proposal usually suggests that the basic income be unconditional. Global basic income is part of the wider discussion on basic income, which typically implemented or proposed at the national level. Pilot schemes are also run at city/region levels. History While a national basic income has been discussed for much of the 20th century, the idea of a global basic income is much younger. Interest in the idea was raised by the Dutch artist Pieter Kooistra's in the 1970s, he developed the \\"Uno\\" plan. From the 1980s, more people have started to think seriously about the proposals. Different suggestions on design and financing have been presented, among them monetary reform and \\"cap and dividend\\". The Global Basic Income Foundation, founded in 2000, brings together research and debate on the idea. In 2016, the World Basic Income organisation was founded in the UK. It carried out research on the feasibility of a global basic income, building on the ideas from the previous decades. Its primary aim is to promote the idea of distributing $10/month to all the world's population thereby eradicating extreme poverty. It is focused on researching revenue streams emanating from the commons, such as taxes and fees on air, land and sea, as well as noting other potential revenue streams in a redistribution context. Events Conferences have been organized by the Basic Income Earth Network and of USBIG. The World Basic Income organisation held its first conference in February 2017 including speakers from the Global Income Foundation, BIEN, Share the World's Resources, CapGlobalCarbon, Hillel Steiner, Jonathan Bartley, John Merry, Manchester Migrant Solidarity, Max Harris and Belgian NGO \\"Eight\\".

The Institute's goal is to advance innovative oceanographic research and discovery through technological advancement, collaborative research, outreach and education, and open sharing of information. SOI supports oceanographic research by providing collaborators with free ship time aboard their research vessel Falkor and expert technical shipboard support. Collaborating researchers and institutions utilizing Falkor commit to openly share and communicate the outcomes of their research, including raw observations and data. Research proposals are reviewed through a peer-reviewed process and assessed based on their potential for technological innovation, oceanographic research, and overall impact. Since its inception in 2009, SOI has supported over 60 expeditions all around the globe. Research Vessels The Schmidt Ocean Institute has operated two research vessels, R/V Lone Ranger and R/V Falkor . The Lone Ranger, a 255-foot former ocean tug, was donated to the Institute by Peter B. Lewis in 2009 and was operated by the Institute to support research in Bermuda and the Bahamas. In 2012 the Schmidt Ocean Institute completed the retrofit of a former German Fisheries vessel into a state-of-the-art oceanographic research vessel. The newly retrofitted vessel was renamed R/V Falkor after the luckdragon from The Neverending Story. R/V Falkor became fully operational for scientific use in 2013 following a year of sea trials. Since then, Falkor has hosted numerous international science teams and institutes, successfully supporting oceanographic research. In 2015, R/V Falkor became the first oceanographic research vessel with a high-performance computing system expanding data storage and processing capabilities. Expeditions and Notable Discoveries  Schmidt Ocean Institute research is focused on oceanographic exploration, seafloor mapping, and marine technology innovation. Researchers aboard R/V Falkor have discovered many new species , as well as new seafloor features and environments utilizing the ships onboard mapping technologies and ROV SuBastian. Notable accomplishments include the discovery of the world‚Äôs deepest known living fish, among several new species in the Mariana Trench. In March of 2020, ROV SuBastian recorded footage of a Siphonophore off the coast of Australia that is likely the longest animal on Earth. R/V Falkor‚Äôs advanced multibeam mapping capabilities enabled the discovery of 14 new underwater features and mapped over one million square kilometers of the seafloor. Important discoveries have been made in hydrothermal vent and cold seep environments. During the Microbial Mysteries expedition, researchers discovered large venting mineral towers that reach up to 23 meters in height featuring volcanic flanges that create the illusion of looking at a mirror when observing the superheated hydrothermal fluids beneath them. Expeditions on R/V Falkor have more than doubled the number of known hydrothermal vent sites in the Mariana Back-arc region and discovered a recently-erupted underwater lava field. In 2016, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with scientific instruments completed the first-ever successful mission launched from a ship without the help of a launching system. Schmidt Ocean Institute testified before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Environment Subcommittee in 2019 to discuss ocean exploration including how it benefits society and is important to assess changes in ocean conditions.  Outreach  Schmidt Ocean Institute engages in a number of outreach and education activities in order to promote the research conducted aboard the ship. Some of Schmidt Ocean Institute's outreach activities include public ship tours, ship-to-shore connections, art exhibits, weekly blog posts, and social media updates. In addition, all ROV dives are live-streamed for public viewing . = Artist-at-Sea and Student Opportunities = SOI provides opportunities for artists and student oceanographers to take part in research expeditions through Student Opportunities and Artist-at-Sea programs. Artist-at-Sea participants collaborate with the science team to create pieces inspired by oceanographic research. Pieces from the Artist-at- Sea program have been displayed around the world in a traveling exhibit. The Student Opportunities program provides undergraduate and graduate students a chance to take part in seagoing scientific research.

The word aethalometer is derived from the Classical Greek verb ‚Äòaethaloun‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòto blacken with soot‚Äô. Principle of operation The gas stream (frequently ambient air) passes through a filter material which traps the suspended particulates, creating a deposit of increasing density. A light beam projected through the deposit is attenuated by those particles which are absorbing (‚Äòblack‚Äô) rather than scattering (‚Äòwhite‚Äô). Measurements are made at successive regular time intervals. The increase in attenuation from one measurement to the next is proportional to the increase in the density of optically absorbing material on the filter: which, in turn, is proportional to the concentration of the material in the sampled air stream. The sample is collected as a spot on a roll of filter tape. When the density of the deposit spot reaches a pre-set limit, the tape advances to a fresh spot and the measurements continue. Measurement of the sample gas flow rate and knowledge of the instrument‚Äôs optical and mechanical characteristics permit a calculation of the average concentration of absorbing particles in the gas stream during the sampling period. Aethalometers may operate on timebase periods as rapid as 1 second, providing quasi-real-time data. Comparison of aethalometer data with other physical and chemical analyses allows the output to be expressed as a concentration of black carbon. History The Aethalometer principle is based upon the continuous filter-tape sampler developed in the 1950s for the measurement of coefficient of haze. This instrument drew the sample air stream through a filter tape spot for a fixed time duration (usually 1 or 2 hours). The tape was advanced and its gray coloration measured optically by either transmittance or reflectance. However, the data units were arbitrary, and were not interpreted in terms of a mass concentration of a defined material in the air stream until retrospective studies linked the ‚ÄòCOH unit‚Äô to quantitative analyses of atmospheric trace constituents. Close up of an aethalometer control panel Work in the 1970s at Tihomir Novakov's lab at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory established the quantitative relationship between the optical attenuation of a deposit of particles on a fibrous filter, and the carbon content of that deposit. Improvements in optical and electronic technology permitted the measurement of very small increases in attenuation, such as would occur during the passage of typical ambient air through a filter on a 5- or 10-minute timebase. The development of personal computers and analog-digital interfaces permitted the real-time calculation of data, and mathematical conversion of the signals to a concentration of black carbon expressed in units of nanograms or micrograms of Black Carbon per cubic meter of air. The first-ever Aethalometer was developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory by Anthony D. A. Hansen (who would later found Magee Scientific), Hal Rosen and Tihomir Novakov, and was utilised in an EPA visibility study at Houston in September 1980, with the first real-time data chart of black carbon concentrations in ambient air published in 1981. The instrument was first flown on board a NOAA research aircraft in the Arctic in 1984, and coupled with previous ground-level work showed that the Arctic haze contains a strong component of soot. The aethalometer was commercialized in 1986 and an improved version patented in 1988.Hansen, Anthony D. (1990) \\"Aethalometer\\" Its earliest uses were in geophysical research at remote locations, using black carbon as a tracer of the long-range transport of air pollution from industrialized source areas to remote receptor regions. In the 1990s, increasing concerns about the health effects of diesel exhaust particulatesSolomon, G. M. et al. (2001) No Breathing in the Aisles ‚Äì Diesel Exhaust inside School Buses, NRDC. led to increasing need for measurements using the blackness of the carbon content as an indicator. In the 2000s, increasing interest in the role that optically absorbing particles play in climate change led to expanded measurement programs in both developed and developing countries. The effect of these particles is believed to contribute to the accelerated melting of the ArcticQuinn, P. K. et al. (2011) The Impact of Black Carbon on Arctic Climate, Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme and the thawing of glaciers in the Himalayas. A comprehensive summary of black carbon (including a review of aethalometer data) was submitted to the U.S. Congress by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2012.Report to Congress on Black Carbon, USEPAEPA-R450/R-12-001 (2012) The Aethalometer has been developed into rack-mounted instruments for use in stationary air quality monitoring installations; transportable instruments which are often used at off-grid locations, operating from batteries or photovoltaic panels in order to make measurements at remote locations; and hand-held portable versions for measurements of personal exposure to combustion emissions. Technical background and aethalometer use The interior of an aethalometer =Aethalometer uses= The main uses of aethalometers relate to air quality measurements, with the data being used for studies of the impact of air pollution on public health; climate change; and visibility. Other uses include measurements of the emission of black carbon from combustion sources such as vehicles; industrial processes; and biomass burning, both in wild fires and in domestic and industrial settings. =Technical validation= The aethalometer model AE-31 was tested by the Environmental Technology Verification Program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and a validation report was issued in 2001.Environmental Technology Verification Report, Aethalometer Particulate Carbon Monitor, Battelle Laboratories, August 2001. The Aethalometer Model AE-33 was tested under the same program in 2013, report pending. =Analysis at multiple optical wavelengths: angstrom exponent= The pollutant species black carbon appears gray or black due to the absorption of electromagnetic energy by partially mobile electrons in the graphitic microstructure of the black carbon particles. This absorption is purely ‚Äòresistive‚Äô and displays no resonant bands: consequently, the material appears gray rather than colored. The attenuation of light transmitted through a deposit of these particles increases linearly with the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation, i.e. inversely with respect to wavelength. Aethalometer measurements of optical attenuation on a filter deposit will increase at shorter wavelengths as Œª(-Œ±) where the parameter Œ± (the Angstrom exponent) has the value Œ± = 1 for ‚Äògray‚Äô or ‚Äòblack‚Äô materials. However, other species may be co-mingled with the black carbon particles. Aromatic organic compounds associated with tobacco smoke and biomass smoke from wood-burning are known to have increased optical absorption at shorter wavelengths in the yellow, blue and near-ultraviolet portions of the spectrum. Aethalometers are now constructed to perform their optical analyses simultaneously at multiple wavelengths, typically spanning the range from 370 nm (near-ultraviolet) to 950 nm (near-infrared). In the absence of aromatic components, the aethalometer data for black carbon concentration is identical at all wavelengths, after factoring in the standard Œª‚àí1 response for ‚Äòresistive‚Äô gray materials. The angstrom exponent of the attenuation for these materials is 1. If aromatic components are present, they will contribute increased absorption at shorter wavelengths. The aethalometer data will increase at shorter wavelengths, and the apparent angstrom exponent will increase. Measurements of pure biomass smoke may show data represented by an angstrom exponent as large as 2. Due to different artifacts, the angstrom exponent measured by aethalometers might be biased but comparison with other techniques have found that the aethalometer model AE-31 provides fair absorption angstrom exponent results. Many areas of the world are impacted by emissions both from high- temperature fossil fuel combustion, such as diesel exhaust, which has a gray or black color and is characterized by an angstrom exponent of 1; together with emissions from biomass burning such as wood smoke, which is characterized by a larger value of angstrom exponent. These two sources of pollution may have different geographic origins and temporal patterns, but maybe co-mingled at the point of measurement. Real-time aethalometer measurements at multiple wavelengths are claimed to separate these different contributions and can apportion the total impact to different categories of sources. This analysis is an essential input to the design of effective and acceptable public policy and regulation. The accuracy, and even the ability, of the Aethalometer to differentiate smoke sources is disputed =Aethalometer measurements at diverse locations= The aethalometer measurement principle is based upon air filtration, optics, and electronics. It does not require any physical or chemical support infrastructure such as high vacuum, high temperature, or specialized reagents or gases. Its only consumable is a filter which needs to be replaced every one or two days in portable models, but larger units have a roll of filtration tape which usually lasts from months to years. Consequently, the instrument is rugged, miniaturizable and may be deployed in research projects at remote locations, or at sites with minimal local support. Examples include: * measurements at South Pole Station, the location at which the cleanest air has been measured with an aethalometer, showing black carbon concentrations on the order of 30 picograms per cubic meter in winter; * measurements in urban locations in China and Bangladesh, at which the concentrations of black carbon can often exceed 100 micrograms per cubic meter; * measurements at rural locations in Africa, with installations operating from solar photovoltaic panels and registering high concentrations of black carbon due to agricultural burning; * measurements at high-altitude installations in both the Indian Himalayas and Tibet at heights exceeding 5000 meters, operating from solar photovoltaic panels and registering the impact of combustion emissions from adjacent densely populated lowland areas; * measurements on board commercial aircraft flights using a hand-held aethalometer, in which the in-cabin presence of black carbon is derived from the external concentrations in the stratosphere: in which manner, it is possible to map the dispersion of black carbon on a global scale at 10 km. altitude without the need for extremely expensive dedicated research aircraft; * measurements taken from automobiles, trains, light aircraft and tethered balloons, from which the real-time data may be converted to horizontal and vertical mapping; * measurements at a station in the midst of the Taklimakan Desert of Central Asia, a location almost as remote and inhospitable as the South Pole. * measurements taken with a micro-aethalometer while cycling in traffic Bangalore, India. * measurements combined with heart rate and minute ventilation sensors to study inhalation exposure.

Web. 11 Aug. 2013 Many of Wainwright's biographical details remain unclear. According to Robert J. Alexander, Wainwright was imprisoned in the United States for a period. After his release, he joined the Canadian Army and fought at the battlefront in France during the First World War. According to Alexander's account, he travelled across Europe, Africa and the Orient, returning to Honduras in 1924. According to biographer Rina Villars, Wainwright spent much of his youth years in Manchester living with his aunt and uncle. In 1916 he joined the British Corps of Royal Engineers for a short period. He travelled a lot, working as a sailor and in other professions. After returning to Central America, he set up a business in El Salvador selling fire extinguishers and Smith Corona typewriters. During these years he travelled extensively throughout the region. He fathered a son, William, in Barbados. Communist organizer In 1928 he became a member of the Communist Party in El Salvador. In the same year, he was expelled from El Salvador for political reasons. After his return to Honduras he began to organize workers at the United Fruit Company plantations in northern Honduras through the Federaci√≥n Sindical Hondure√±a (Honduran Trade Union Federation).O'Brien, Thomas F.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999. p. 99 An article in a Guatemalan newspaper labelled him as one of the foremost communist agitators in Central America, accusing him of seeking to establish a Soviet federation in the region. Apart from politics, he also set up a business in San Pedro Sula, selling tobacco, sweets and soft drinks. Jail and escape Following a violent strike movement in Honduras in 1930 he was jailed, but managed to escape to Guatemala.Barahona, Marvin. Memorias de un comunista: Rigoberto Padilla Rush.

George III. The story in the novel was an allegory for the internment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War, and was inspired by George Takei's experiences during that period. It had originally been pitched as an episode to Deep Space Nine, but was subsequently turned into a novel. Plot Quark is about to make an extraordinary deal, when he finds himself in the middle of a diplomatic crisis. Grand Nagus Zek is refusing to sell one of the lost Orbs of the Prophets back to Bajor. In response, the Bajoran government cuts off all diplomatic ties with the Ferengi and outlaws all Ferengi businesses within its borders. Quark first loses his bar, and then is subsequently imprisoned. But he finds himself to be the only one who can prevent a war between his people and Bajor. Development history After Eric A. Stillwell and David R. George III successfully pitched to Star Trek: Voyager for the episode \\"Prime Factors\\", Stillwell and actor Armin Shimerman pitched ideas to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Although they were unsuccessful, when Stillwell and George were asked for stories for Star Trek comic books they went through a series of pitches they had previous proposed for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and found a premise that Stillwell had based on George Takei's experiences of Japanese American internment during the Second World War. Shimerman suggested that a novel could be made of the idea but Stillwell was not interested and so Shimerman and George approached Pocket Books with the idea. The majority of the book was written by George, who said that Shimerman simply agreed with most of what he wrote. The two worked together on plotting out the story, which was intended to be a deliberate allegory for the Japanese Americans internment. The title was a reference to the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition, with the 34th rule stating \\"War is good for business\\". After work was completed on The 34th Rule, George talked with another DS9 actor, Andrew Robinson, about a potential book project. This went on to become A Stitch in Time.

Early life and career Mamoun was born in Cairo, Egypt in 1894 to a father who was a leading member of the 'ulema (\\"religious scholars\\") and the imam of the Fath Mosque in the Abdin Palace. Growing up, Mamoun was influenced by both Arabic and French culture and studied at al-Azhar University. He graduated from the Qadi School (qadi as a religious judge) in 1918.Skovgaard-Peterson, p. 193 He subsequently began his career as a judge in Egypt's sharia courts, where he performed well. He was transferred to the Sudan where he served as Head Judge in 1941. as a result of his vociferous condemnations of British imperialism in the Sudan, however, he was transferred back to Cairo to serve as President of the Lower Courts until 1952 when he became President of the Higher Sharia Court. That same year, a group of army officers deposed the monarchy of King Farouk and began a process of ending British colonial influence in Egypt.

President Gamal Abdel Nasser is standing to Mamoun's left and future president Anwar Sadat to his right Mamoun was appointed Grand Mufti of Egypt on 28 February 1955 by the Egyptian government, succeeding Ahmed Ibrahim Mughith. His appointment coincided with the state's abolition of the sharia courts and the nationalization of the country's awqaf (\\"religious trusts\\"), thus making Mamoun one of the main scholars consulted for religious matters. On 19 June 1960 he left the post and was succeeded by Ahmed Muhammad Abdel Haridi. As Grand Mufti Mamoun had issued 11,992 fatawa (\\"religious edicts\\"), an average of 2,398 annually, the most ever issued by any Egyptian grand mufti.Skovgaard-Peterson, p. 194. In 1961, during the period of union with Syria (February 1958-September 1961), he was appointed by the Ministry of Awqaf to preside over a council of scholars to compose and edit the Encyclopedia of Islamic Fiqh, the largest compilation and organization fiqh in the 20th century. The process of completing took decades, long after Mamoun's death, but Mamoun personally contributed a significant amount of material to the encyclopedia. In July 1964 President Gamal Abdel Nasser appointed Mamoun Grand Imam of al-Azhar. As Grand Imam, in August, Mamoun declared in a fatwa that contraception was not in contradiction to Islamic law, provided the mechanism was legitimate and the conditions necessitated it. He made the edict within the context of concerns regarding overpopulation, which he deemed a threat to humanity.Atighetchi, p. 72. He refused to issue a fatwa describing socialism as a doctrine of Islam, stating religion was neutral of individual ideologies, although it could be permissive or not permissive of certain ideological principles or methods.Abdel-Fattah, Moataz-Bellah. What kind of grand imam is he? . Al-Ahram Weekly. 2010-04-10. Retrieved on 2013-08-11. Mamoun's health took a downturn and he resigned from al-Azhar in 1969. He died in 1973.

It serves as the first single from his third studio album Breathe Again. It is a pop and R&B; midtempo ballad, with a chorus that heavily samples the 1985 hit \\"Broken Wings\\" by Mr. Mister. The single failed to chart on the Canadian Hot 100. Background and inspiration The song was inspired by Fernandes' increasing fame and the pressures he faced due to it, which led to his breakup with his former fianc√©e. In an interview with Samaritanmag.com, Fernandes explained the song's message: \\"With this new single, and much of my new record, I really wanted to show people that celebrity life isn‚Äôt all about glamour and money and cars. It can ruin someone‚Äôs life. When you are in a position like I am, things are given to you very easily, like going to clubs where they give you alcohol and women are hanging out. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in these things. I got used to it and took advantage of situations.\\" With regards to the song's sample of \\"Broken Wings\\", Fernandes revealed: \\"I was in the studio and I had a bunch of producers playing me some records. They actually played me the \\"Fly Again\\" song but the chorus was already there. I was like, ‚ÄòI know this song‚Äô and they were like, ‚ÄòYeah it‚Äôs Mr. Mister.‚Äô So I just said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm taking it.‚Äô It was one of those things you hear and just know is a definite hit. So I wrote the rest of it and that‚Äôs what came out of it.\\" Music video The song's music video was directed by Marc Andre Debruyne and released on March 23, 2013. It features Fernandes and his love interest having severe relationship troubles, while their private lives are being exposed to the paparazzi. Later, Fernandes becomes aggressive towards the paparazzi. The video was inspired by Fernandes' own struggles with fame's pressure on his friends and relationships. Filming took place in Chicago, Illinois.

Monetta, (born 1942) served as the Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering (Research and Advanced Technology) from 1991 to 1993, acting as the de facto Chief Technology Officer for the United States Department of Defense. He had previously held the position of Director, Office of New Production Reactors, at the United States Department of Energy from 1989‚Äì1991, in addition to serving as the Technical Director and the Senior Executive at the Naval Ordnance Station, Indian Head, Maryland from 1986‚Äì1989. Dr. Monetta serves as the science and technology member of the Board of Hudson Technologies, Inc, The Center for Security Policy, The PAM Institute and the Nevada Test Site Historical Foundation. Throughout his career, he has been an early proponent advocating for development of alternative mobility fuels. Dr. Monetta worked extensively in operations pioneering new energy technology. He was responsible for designing and building the new U.S. Tritium Production Reactors, which would have been the only and largest nuclear reactors to be built in the United States in the past three decades and the single largest construction project in the federal government at the time. An article in the Journal of Business and Behavioral Sciences credits Dr. Monetta with instituting a management style that ‚Äúhelped create a positive, competitive environment for sponsoring and encouraging innovation‚Äù to ‚Äújump-start tritium production while securing the future of American reactor design.‚Äù Dr. Monetta's experience in the nuclear field was also applied to the Natural Gas industry, as his management concepts were instituted at the [Gas Research Institute] (GRI). A 1993 article shows that using this methodology, the GRI's Research and Development arm saw a ‚Äúsuccess rate of at least twice the [industry] norms‚Äù which allowed ‚Äúincreased gas availability at lower prices.‚Äù The R&D; undertaken by GRI ‚Äúled the way to a family of high-efficiency furnaces‚Äù as well as innovations in ‚Äúdevelopment of technology to allow recovery of unconventional gas.‚Äù Dr. Monetta's demonstrated commitment to innovation and development of alternative fuels has continued into the realm of hydrogen technology. In 2004, he delivered a presentation at the SMART TechTrends Conference where he summarized the US approach to Hydrogen technology and urged swift action: > ‚ÄúThe problem for the U.S. is that waiting 25 years is not an option because > the United States consumes more energy than any other country in the > world‚Ä¶‚ÄúHydrogen represents an instant opportunity for capital expansion, > growth, wealth accumulation and individual energy independence, security and > prosperity.‚Äù He recommended several policy changes to help grow the Hydrogen industry, suggesting that legislators: > ‚ÄúProvide short term items in the Department of Energy budget against a mid > and long term R&D; program plan. R&D; is a critical element in the > progression to the next level economy. The promise of the Hydrogen future > rests in the ability of creative inventors to finagle meager dollars for > advanced concepts, materials, storage and fuel.‚Äù He championed an initiative to ‚Äúchange out the entire U.S. government fleet‚Äù from fossil fuel to hydrogen vehicles. He encouraged promoting ‚Äúthe ‚Äúpersonal perk‚Äù exemption from HOV restrictions for Hydrogen fuel vehicles‚Äù, which the Commonwealth of Virginia did in 2006, and again by extending the law in 2011. Lastly, Dr. Monetta implored legislators to establish ‚Äúa 50% tax credit for anything Hydrogen (production, storage, transportation, consumption), allowing Hydrogen to be special and competitive with gasoline.‚Äù Dr. Monetta received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Manhattan College, a M.S. in Engineering Administration (Operations research) from the George Washington University, and a Doctorate in Public Administration (R&D; Management) from the University of Southern California.

Gordon (born 1948) is an American pediatrician, lecturer, and author. He is well-known within the anti-vaccine movement for his promotion of vaccine hesitancy. He is also a long-time advocate of breastfeeding; he became a member of the International Health Advisory Council of the La Leche League in 2005. Gordon's patients have included Eliza Jane Scovill and the son of the actress and anti-vaccine activist Jenny McCarthy. Views on vaccination Gordon claims that, to an individual child, the risks of vaccination often outweigh its benefits. Therefore, he stopped following the recommended vaccine schedule for his patients in 1980, although he still administers vaccinations to some children on a case-by-case basis. Gordon has cited the debunked connection between vaccines and autism among the alleged risks to children that prevent him from routinely administering vaccinations. He has signed hundreds of personal-belief exemptions to school vaccine requirements. In a 2015 interview with Ben Tracy of CBS News, Gordon was asked about the risk of contagion should someone with measles walk into his office, given that most of his patients delay or avoid the measles vaccine. Gordon responded: \\"You just said it, they'd get measles. Not meningitis, not the plague, not Ebola, they'd get measles. Measles is almost an always a benign childhood illness.\\" However, Dr. Deborah Lehman at Cedars Sinai Medical Center says: \\"People don't remember children staying in dark rooms because they have measles and the light hurts their eyes and developing brain swelling and serious developmental problems, we've given people a false sense of security and it's situations like this, outbreaks like this [Disneyland measles outbreak] that really remind us of the importance of these diseases and really the benefit of vaccine.\\"  Selected works  Gordon is the author and co-author of several books and a DVD, including: * Brighter Baby (1999) * Listening to Your Baby: A New Approach to Parenting Your Newborn (2002) * Good Nights: The Happy Parents' Guide to the Family Bed, and a Peaceful Night's Sleep!

Uplift Humanity India is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and runs its programs in Mumbai, Gujarat, and Hyderabad. It was founded by Anish Patel in 2010 as a project to connect American students to at-risk youth in India. Programs =Rehabilitation Initiative= Uplift Humanity India works with Indian-American teachers in the United States to write its curriculum used for teaching children in India. The latest curriculum, titled \\"A Look To The Future,\\" features lessons in life skills, self-esteem, honesty, and other values that have helped the juveniles secure steady jobs and futures. The organization also uses an older version of the curriculum titled \\"One Step Forward\\" in some of its locations. Students who previously committed minor crimes and participated in Uplift Humanity India's programs have gone on to earn steady incomes. Starting in 2012, family planning and women's rights were added to the curriculum. Each summer, Uplift Humanity India sends large groups of high school and college students selected from across the United States to one of its programs in India. Once there, the students learn the specifics of the curriculum and start teaching in small groups in observation homes for about one month. Lessons are not conducted in a lecture format - rather, teaching is done in a participative manner that emphasizes role playing, games, and video-based lessons. Beginning in 2011 at the Bal Gokulam facility in Vadodara, the rehabilitation initiative has since expanded to juvenile centers in New Delhi, Indore and Hyderabad. 315x315px =Uplift Continuation Program= In August 2013, Uplift Humanity India announced the launch of its Uplift Continuation Program beginning in October, which will provide continuing educational support to the children in the observation homes throughout the year. This effectively extends the program so that juveniles and orphans can receive training even when the American students are not visiting in the summer. These programs involve more technology training and vocational skills training that to help the children find a career in the future. =Other Programs= Uplift Humanity India's Books Behind Bars program has donated more than 1000 books to jails in Newark, New Jersey and observation homes in India. The organization sponsors book donation drives in New Jersey each year to support this effort. Uplift Humanity India has also donated several computer systems to the observation homes along with school supplies to supplement its curriculum. Every year, as part of its summer program, the organization also offers educational scholarships to the top-performing students. These scholarships are used for continuing education and to help the children pursue job or career training. To date, the scholarships have totaled 1.5 lakh Rupees. Recognition 318x318px Uplift Humanity India has received awards and recognition from Lions Club International and the New Jersey State Assembly for its efforts. Most recently, it has been honored by Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, who has supported Uplift Humanity India's rehabilitation programs. In 2014, Uplift Humanity signed on actor Sunkrish Bala as its official brand ambassador.

The main topics of his works were the hills of C√≥rdoba, the Pampas plains, the mountains of Tandil, the coast of Quilmes, the ravines of San Isidro beside the R√≠o de la Plata, and Piriapolis in Uruguay. He moved for a period to the C√≥rdoba hills, painting in the open air, and on returning to Buenos Aires staged exhibitions at which he successfully sold all his works. He studied art at the Asociaci√≥n de Est√≠mulo de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts Association), and made several trips to study art in the Argentine interior, Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay.  Biography  Malinverno and daughters Malinverno was born in Buenos Aires on 20 April 1890. He studied at the Fine Arts Association with teachers Reynaldo Giudici, Ernesto de la C√°rcova and Eduardo S√≠vori. In 1910 at the age of 20, he submitted a work at the Centennial International Exhibition. Exhibitions devoted to his own work were held at the Sal√≥n Castellani in Rosario in 1919 and 1921, and at the National Commission of Fine Arts in 1921. The next year he won the Silver Medal in the National Exhibition of Decorative Art, and made his first journey to the mountains of C√≥rdoba, including their scenery in his work. He held another individual exhibition at the Cultural Association of Bahia Blanca in the hall of the Municipal Palace in December. In 1923 he took part in the sixth Sal√≥n de Oto√±o exhibition in Rosario. Awards included Gold Medal at the Centenary Exhibition in Tandil (1923), Bronze Medal at the Community Exhibition (1924), and the Est√≠mulo del Sal√≥n Nacional prize (1927). Later individual exhibitions were mounted at the Friends of Art Association in Buenos Aires in 1928, and at the Witcomb Hall in Buenos Aires in 1930.Galeria Witcomb, \\"Memorias de una galer√≠a de arte: Archivo Witcomb, 1896-1971\\". p. 134. Fundaci√≥n Espigas, 2000. He died in Buenos Aires on 21 June 1936.\\"Memorabilia: Acontecimientos, Nacimientos y Fallecimientos importantes de la historia dia a dia\\". p. 151. Kreactiva Editorial. A large posthumous exhibition was mounted the following year at the M√ºller Gallery, organized by a committee of homage chaired by his favorite disciple, actor and painter Enrique Mui√±o. More recently his work has featured repeatedly in exhibitions at the Alvear de Zurbar√°n Collection in Buenos Aires: individual exhibitions in 1986, 1991, 1994 and 1998, and as part of collective exhibitions in 1982 and 1997.

According to Mattathias Schwartz, former Editor and Publisher, the newspaper had a printed circulation of 10,000, 1,200 of which were sent to subscribers. In \\"A Note to the Reader\\" in issue one, the Editors expressed a cynical yet hopeful view of urban culture in Philadelphia that would set the tone for the paper's 21 issue run: \\"For now, let us say that we are dissatisfied with modern life. We sense the germs of discovery, enlightenment and revolution lying dormant within us, the same germs that inferred the secret of the lightning bolt and cast off the yoke of empire. We want to create a frame where things are better, be that a chair, a photograph, a canvas, a song, or a newspaper.\\" The paper had multiple mottos: \\"A General Interest Miscellaneous Newspaper\\" and \\"the Periodic Journal of Urban Particulars\\" were printed above the masthead. \\"Nostre manes sunt infantes,\\" \\"It's all here & It's all true,\\" \\"Too big to read on the subway,\\" and \\"Beholden to No One\\" were printed beside the masthead. Style and design The Independent was set apart from other Philadelphia newspapers not only by its writing but by its layout and design. At 22 inches by 17 inches, The Independent was very large, even by broadsheet standards. In a compact, antiquated style, the front page would often have between 10-20 articles, far above the average. Each section of the newspaper had illustrated page headers, with titles such as \\"Industry News,\\" \\"Metronaut\\" and \\"The Bureau of Puzzles & Games\\" created by cartoonist Jacob Weinstein, who also created the layout for issues six through 21. The work of various cartoonists and illustrators were featured throughout the paper including Gary Panter, Ben Katchor. =Writing style= Much of The Independent‚Äôs writing style was an exaggeration of modern newspaper style, more in line with 19th-century or early-20th-century style similar to that of The New York Times.:Image:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg Front page articles often had three headlines, and extreme examples of alliteration were not uncommon. In issue twenty, of winter 2004, after President George W. Bush was reelected, the second headline after \\"God Help Us\\" read, \\"Reverend Rove's Red Rubes Rock Rickety Republic / Righteous Rabble Ratifies Rogue Ruler's Reign.\\" Allen Crawford (\\"Lord Whimsy\\"), a writer and editor for the paper, stated that his own \\"unapologetically pompous and florid\\" writing style found a regular place in the paper. Distribution Issues cost $1 inside of Philadelphia and $2 elsewhere. Distributed in various retail locations as well as in wildly painted newspaper boxes throughout downtown Philadelphia. The Independent was sold in at least 60 stores and restaurants in Philadelphia including the Weavers Way (co-op), Wooden Shoe Books, and Reading Terminal Market. Outside of the city, the paper was sold at locations in Doylestown, New Hope, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Brooklyn, Chicago, and Portland. Dissolution In issue 21, released in March 2005, the Editors announced a temporary but possibly permanent hiatus: \\"We may start up again one day, and if we do, we promise our second volume will be even better than our first. But the first volume may turn out to be it for the Independent, in which case we ask only that you keep a place for us, in your desk or on your shelf.\\" On March 19, 2006, former Editor and Publisher Mattathias Schwartz used The Pigeon, The Independent's \\"eMailing List\\" to inform former readers of the Crier, a new publication based out of New York City, partly edited by Christine Smallwood, a former staff writer for the Independent.

However, the more general Pfister's theorem (1965) shows that if the z_i are rational functions of one set of variables, hence has a denominator, then it is possible for all n = 2^m.Pfister's Theorem on Sums of Squares, Keith Conrad, http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/linmultialg/pfister.pdf There are also non-bilinear versions of Euler's four-square and Degen's eight-square identities.

The case involved a warrantless raid by law enforcement on an illegal distillery, before which law enforcement had had sufficient time to obtain warrants but had chosen not to. After the raid, evidence was seized. In a majority opinion authored by Justice Frank Murphy, the Court ruled that this seizure had been a violation of the Fourth Amendment: > It is a cardinal rule that, in seizing goods and articles, law enforcement > agents must secure and use search warrants whenever reasonably practicable. > This rule rests upon the desirability of having magistrates rather than > police officers determine when searches and seizures are permissible and > what limitations should be placed upon such activities.

In 2008, she founded the interior and exterior design house, Valdasigns, and currently holds the position of director of the business.  Biography  Valda Berzins was born in East Melbourne, Victoria on the 26th of January (Australia Day), to Latvian parents who migrated to Australia in their efforts to escape communism. Berzins‚Äô parents originally arrived at Port Melbourne by ship during the post-war immigration boom and were transferred to the Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in the north east of Victoria. Prior to his arrival in Australia, Berzins‚Äô father pursued a degree in mechanical engineering. Due to the ongoing war in Latvia, he was forced to abandon the final year of the degree. Despite the fact that Berzins‚Äô father had almost completed his degree and her mother being a fully qualified nursing Sister, they had to work in unskilled jobs to support themselves. During this time, Berzins‚Äô father held a day job and attended night school. After years of hard work, he finally attained an accounting diploma from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). As a child, Valda grew up in the suburb of Glenroy, along with her parents and sister, Nora. Later on, her family relocated to Pascoe Vale where the family lived for numerous years. It is also in this same suburb that Berzins purchased her first house at the age of 22, a large seven bedroom house on a 1,000m¬≤ block of land. Her love for gardening and home renovation began to blossom during this period as Berzins personally redesigned and decorated the house in her own vision. Berzins spent only a small sum on renovations but managed to sell the house 7 years later at triple the sum of her initial investment. After that, Berzins relocated to North Balwyn and lived there for many years. She currently resides in Mount Martha, Victoria, with her husband of 23 years, Brian.  Career  Prior to 1995, Berzins held various accounting positions and strategic planning roles with Carlton & United Breweries (Foster's). She was promoted to Assistant Company Secretary and Finance Manager in a short span. During her time at Foster's Berzins directed significant mergers and acquisitions that helped propel the business. Later on, she became the Executive Director of Information Systems for Foster's Group. From July to November 1995, Berzins worked as Finance Director for the American-based toy manufacturing company, Mattel, Inc. Berzins career came to prominence as she took on the role of Group Manager of IT Services with Australia Post. After a few years, Australia Post specifically created the role of Chief Information Officer (CIO) for Berzins. She served as CIO for Australia Post from 1996 to 2004.(1) http://www.cio.com.au/article/179865/post_haste/ After an illustrious career with Australia Post, Berzins stepped into the role of CIO with Victoria Police from 2004 to 2008.

In November 2008, Berzins reignited her dreams of becoming an interior and exterior home designer/renovator and established her own company, Valdasigns.

Radio contact was lost about an hour after the pilot reported to be in cloud with zero visibility. The wreckage was found in heavily wooded, hilly terrain two days later. The pilot and five passengers were killed in the accident. The investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) found that the pilot most likely fell victim to spatial disorientation and lost control of the aircraft. He was not qualified for instrument flight and the aircraft was not equipped for such operations. The weather at the time was reported as low clouds and rain. Accident The aircraft departed from the Norra-Aus Fly-In airshow in Monto a few minutes after 11:00 on a direct track towards Caboolture carrying the pilot and five non-paying passengers. The weather for the flight was expected to be VFR (visual flight rules) conditions with good visibility, high clouds and light winds. At 13:15, the aircraft contacted air traffic control, reporting an approximate position 69 km north of Caboolture and requesting assistance with navigation. Shortly after, the pilot issued a distress call as the aircraft had entered thick cloud. Controllers in Brisbane then communicated positional information to the aircraft directly and relayed via other pilots in the area due to difficulties with radio reception. A friend of one of the passengers aboard Riama received a phone call from the aircraft, reporting that they were lost in cloud and unable to maintain altitude at around 13:20. Over the next hour, witnesses in the area around the crash site reported seeing the aircraft flying in and out of cloud at low level. At 13:48, the pilot reported he had one hour of fuel remaining and the last transmission from the aircraft came at 14:04. Neither the aircraft or the pilot were equipped or certified to fly without visual reference to the ground. A major search and rescue operation was coordinated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), involving as many as 15 helicopters as well as a specialized fixed wing aircraft flown in from Melbourne. The original search area covered an area of some 1500 square kilometers, made difficult by the hilly terrain and dense vegetation. Local residents on motorcycles also offered to help search remote trails. Police officers on horseback also joined the search. AMSA revealed that an emergency beacon had been activated on the aircraft about half an hour before the last contact, but the signal had since been lost. The wreckage was discovered just below a ridge line near Lake Borumba, 36 km south west of Gympie on 3 October with none of the occupants having survived the crash. Aircraft At the time of the accident, Riama was one of four airworthy examples of the DH.84 Dragon aircraft in the world. After sitting disassembled in a hangar for many years, the aircraft was restored at Murwillumbah Airport by vintage aircraft specialists Mothcair between 1998 and 2002. The aircraft was purchased by Des Porter, the accident pilot, who learned that parts used in the tail section of the aircraft had been sourced from another Dragon, also named Riama, which had been owned by his father but was damaged in a 1952 crash landing at Archerfield Airport near Brisbane. Porter himself had survived another accident in a Dragon at the age of 11 which killed his father and older brother in 1954. The distinctive red biplane had become a popular attraction at airshows and flying events around Australia. It was reported that on the weekend prior to the accident, Porter had raised some $15,000 for a Bundaberg based rescue helicopter service by offering joy-flights in Riama. Investigation An investigation into the Riama crash was carried out by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), with the final findings released in December 2013. The preliminary findings showed that, contrary to some media reports that the aircraft ran out of fuel, at least one engine was operating at the time of the crash, and fuel was found in the tanks. The ATSB determined the time of impact to be approximately 14:21, 17 minutes after the last communication with the aircraft. The impact was determined to be not survivable. = Final report = The final accident report by the ATSB was released on 19 December 2013. The ATSB stated that: and They found that: References Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Queensland Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2012 Category:2012 in Australia Category:2010s in Queensland Category:October 2012 events in Australia ","title":"2012 Queensland DH.84 Dragon crash"},{"id":"40217101","text":"Superorganism is an album by the Mickey Hart Band, a musical group led by former Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart.

Together with her sister Noel Streatfeild she illustrated the 1936 book Ballet Shoes. Her other book illustrations INCLUDE The Buttercup Farm Family, The Pole Star Family, The Saucy Jane Family and The Very Big Secret. Biography Gervis was born to William Streatfeild and Janet Venn and was the eldest sister of Noel Streatfeild. Due to asthma she was sent away to live with her grandparents where she was looked after by a nurse. In 1902 when her parents moved to St Leonards-on-Sea, she came to visit them. There, she also attended the Hastings College and St Leonard's College and Laleham school in Eastbourne. Before World War I, in 1911 her family relocated again while she herself was hired as a nurse during the war and also helped produce two plays called Vingt-en-Un and When Daydreams End with her sister Noel in 1915. After the war Gervis continued teaching and exhibited widely and then took over the studio and pupils of her original teacher, Miss McMunn. She married Shorland Gervis (known as Shor) who a science master at the Boys' School in Sherborne, where they lived together at Nortons, The Avenue. She continued children's art classes at home and also took ladies sketching. Ruth became more widely known as a successful illustrator of children's books such as those by Paula Harris, Mary Treadgold, Kitty Barne and the Caravan Family series by Enid Blyton. She seized the chance of illustrating Noel Streatfeild's book Ballet Shoes in 1936 when Mabel Carey, children's editor for Dent and Sons Publishers, suggested she might be suitable without realising she was in fact Noel's older sister. The book is still in print although Gervis's drawings now appear only in the Puffin paperback; the originals are held by the Centre for the Children's Book. She is also known for her other book illustrations such as The Buttercup Farm Family, The Pole Star Family, The Saucy Jane Family and The Very Big Secret. In 1931 Gervis became a founder member of Sherborne art club and later its Chairman and President. In 1941 she was asked to teach the art at Sherborne School as the art master was ill; he subsequently died and by 1941 she was in charge of the art department where she remained until 1953. She moved to a similar post at Lord Digby's school in 1953 until she retired in 1966. After her husband Shor died in 1968, Gervis became a founder member of the Museum at Sherborne, participating on its Council and taking a supporting role for twenty years. In 1988 when ill health became a problem, she moved to Oxford to be near her daughter, but died only a few days after moving into St. Luke's nursing home.https://www.sherbornemuseum.co.uk/RuthGervis.php The museum in Sherborne still holds a variety of examples of her artwork, both in the public gallery and the reserve collection. https://www.sherbornemuseum.co.uk/RuthGervis.php References Category:1894 births Category:1988 deaths Category:20th-century British women artists Category:British illustrators ","title":"Ruth Gervis"},{"id":"40217148","text":"Corsicana Lemonade is the sixth full-length studio album by Austin, Texas- based band White Denim.

Early life  Heinrich Bruns was born on 4 September 1848 in Berlin to Christian Gerhard Bruns, a landscape painter, and his wife, Caroline Henriette Hasse.  Education and professional appointments  Bruns studied mathematics, astronomy, and physics at the University of Berlin during 1866‚Äì1871 under Ernst Kummer and Karl Weierstrass and earned a doctoral degree with a dissertation titled De proprietate quadam functionis potentialis corporum homogeneorum (\\"On the properties of a certain potential function of homogeneous bodies\\"). From 1872 to 1873 he was employed at the Pulkowa Observatory in Russia as a calculator. There he met and married Marie Wilhelmine Schleussner, who also worked as a calculator at the observatory. In 1873 he became an observer at the Observatory of Dorpat (now Tartu) in Estonia, where he remained until 1876. During this time he also worked as a lecturer at the University of Dorpat. In 1876, Bruns was appointed an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Berlin. He also worked at the Prussian Military Academy and the Geodetic Institute of Potsdam. In 1882 he went to Saxony as a full professor of astronomy at the University of Leipzig and director of the Leipzig Observatory. That same year, he was elected a member of the academy of science Leopoldina.  Work  Heinrich Bruns was mainly engaged in developing the theoretical side of \\"the shape of the Earth\\" (the title of one of his major works). The fields of potential theory and the study of equilibrium shapes owe many key results to him. For the study of astronomical refraction he developed an unusual method of calculating the vertical gradient of air temperature together with his Assistant Felix Hausdorff. However, due to a lack of sufficiently accurate measurement methods this method has not been used in practice. The 20th century's higher geodesy (a sub-field of geodesy concerned with measuring the earth on a global scale) as practiced by Karl Ledersteger was based on theories developed by Bruns, including \\"Bruns' polyhedron\\". This construct was envisioned as a world-spanning net. Satellite geodesy turned this thought experiment into a reality with the development of the GPS.

Collectively, Alliance members represent the majority of North American imports of ready-made garments from Bangladesh, produced in more than 700 factories. Background After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Walmart became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. Monsoon was a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) from before the 2013 Savar building collapse due to structural integrity and failure. The building had housed a number of separate garment factories employing around 5,000 people, several shops, and a bank. The factories manufactured apparel for brands including Benetton, Monsoon Accessorize, Bonmarch√©, the Children's Place, El Corte Ingl√©s, Joe Fresh, Mango, Matalan, Primark, and Walmart. Formation of the Alliance The Alliance was organized through the U.S. Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) with discussions convened and chaired by former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-ME) and former U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME). The collaborative formation process involved apparel industry companies and stakeholders, including the U.S. and Bangladeshi governments, policymakers, international NGOs, and members of civil society and organized labor in Bangladesh. On July 10, 2013, the group announced the Bangladesh Worker Safety Initiative. The Initiative is a binding, five-year plan focused on fire and building safety inspections, worker training, and worker empowerment. The Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety has elected former US Representative Ellen Tauscher as independent chairperson. The company responsible for managing the Alliance is ELEVATE under CEO Ian Spaulding. http://www.elevatelimited.com Key Alliance documents * Alliance Action Plan * Alliance Timeline * Member Agreement for companies * Alliance Bylaws * Alliance Statistics - Provides key statistics regarding the status of factory inspections, remediation, training and other worker empowerment initiatives. Alliance work in Bangladesh =Factory inspections and public reporting= The Alliance helped develop a common Fire Safety and Structural Integrity Standard ‚Äì founded on the requirements of the 2006 Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC), though the Standard exceeds those requirements in some cases. The Standard was developed and is being implemented to ensure that all Member factories are held to the same safety requirements. The Standard was developed by technical experts from both the Alliance and the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, and finalized in December 2013. The Standard has been harmonized with the guidelines developed by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) for the National Tripartite Plan of Action (NTPA). The Alliance has retained a committee of independent fire and structural safety experts from Bangladesh, Europe and North America who are credentialed authorities in fire or building structural safety. The Committee of Experts (COE) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Alliance Standard, which includes approving qualified inspectors, conducting spot audits of remediation efforts and validating inspection reports. The Alliance has publicly announced that it aims to inspect all factories producing for its members by July 10, 2014. The Alliance is working with the Fair Factories Clearinghouse, a non-profit organization that provides software to facilitate information-sharing. Alliance Members use this public platform to provide and exchange information about factories they use, fire and building safety training programs and curricula, and submit monthly reports on safety inspections and progress update on remediation plans being undertaken. The Standard is used to evaluate all Alliance factories. The Board of Directors issues semi-annual public reports detailing its work and progress toward meeting in-country fire and building safety objectives, as well as training and worker empowerment goals. In early September, 2015 the Alliance has recognized six RMG factories of Bangladesh to international standard as they finished all reformation works. These factories are; Green Textile, Kwun Tong Apparel, Laundry Industries, Lenny Apparel, Optimum Fashions, and Univogue. =Worker participation= In November and December 2013, the Alliance conducted a Worker Baseline Survey among more than 3,200 workers in 28 garment factories in Bangladesh. 10 focus groups were conducted off-site with 101 participants in three Bangladeshi regions to obtain more information on fire and other health and safety issues. The purpose of the survey and the off-site interviews was to better understand the current level of awareness of health and safety risks and what workers believe needs to be done to improve safety and reduce risk in the factories. It is also a tool that will inform the necessary detail of our training programs. The Alliance's worker helpline and education program will be implemented by three worker empowerment-focused, organizations, working in partnership. Clear Voice, the organization that provides tools for communication with workers, was founded by an early worker rights and human rights pioneer, Doug Cahn. Clear Voice will partner with Phulki, one of Bangladesh's leading worker rights non-governmental organizations (NGO), and Good World Solutions, whose focus will be on applying its Labor Link technology to train workers on their rights and survey them on their wellbeing. Beginning March 2014, the helpline program will be piloted in 50 factories Dhaka and Chittagong, with in-factory orientations to accompany the launch at each location. Helplines will roll out to 100 factories by March 2015, with the goal of becoming functional in all Alliance factories by 2017. Local operations On December 9, 2013, the Alliance opened an office in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where the Alliance is focused on inspection implementation, development of a worker training curriculum, establishing a worker empowerment helpline, and building local capacity for completing factory improvements. As of February 2014, the Dhaka office serves as the primary hub for staff and organizational activities. All staff members in the Dhaka office are Bangladeshi nationals who bring decades of combined experience in Bangladesh's garment industry. As of March 2014, the team includes a managing director, managers for fire and structural safety, assessments, training, worker outreach and empowerment, factory liaison and remediation, as well as other support staff. Alliance governance The Board of Directors is entrusted with oversight responsibility for Alliance Members' compliance with Initiative requirements, such as meeting financial obligations and self-imposed deadlines for achieving inspections, information-sharing and worker training agreements. The Board has the authority to investigate possible non-compliance, and take appropriate action against delinquent companies, by a two-thirds majority vote, including termination of membership in the Alliance.

The twenty-second episode of the series is written by showrunner John Wirth and directed by Adam Davidson. In the episode, the railroad progress is interrupted by a family of Mormons in its path. When a family member kills Dick Barlow (Matthew Glave), the railroad's chief engineer, Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) seeks justice. Louise Ellison (Jennifer Ferrin), a New-York Tribune reporter, arrives in town to witness it all. Plot Cullen gives Louise, who's writing a story about the First Transcontinental Railroad, a tour of the town. He claims he doesn't need Thomas C. Durant's (Colm Meaney) help in the race against the Central Pacific Railroad. She asks where Lily Bell is buried. Cullen replies Lily is in a wildflower field, adding that Hell on Wheels is no place for a lady. Elam Ferguson (Common) meets Dick Bartlow, who says Elam now works for him. Three armed riders enter town and order Cullen to keep the railroad off their property. Cullen rides to a nearby farm and meets Aaron Hatch (James Shanklin), a Mormon, and his family. Hatch invites him to dinner, during which he insists his family is not moving. Cullen says he'll try to find a route around the farm, but the family will have to move if none can be found. Cullen spends the night and, in the barn, he and the eldest daughter, Naomi (Siobhan Williams), begin to kiss. Her inquisitive younger brother Henry (Christian Laurian-Kerr) interrupts them. The next day, Cullen is told an alternate route can be built but would put them five weeks behind schedule. Back in town, Sean McGinnes (Ben Esler), the railroad's new bookkeeper, tells Cullen that Durant has cancelled the livestock contracts and cornered the market. An angry Cullen says he should have killed Durant long ago. Louise overhears this. Later in the church, Cullen tells Ruth Cole (Kasha Kropinski) about the Hatch family situation. She cautions that Mormons are a \\"violent people.\\" In Omaha, Nebraska, Durant dines with some ranchers, one of which is a woman whom he proposes building a commercial railroad terminus on her land. As a representative of Cr√©dit Mobilier, he offers $100 per acre to prevent the railroad from claiming eminent domain. At the bar, he is joined by Sean, who slips him an envelope stuffed with money and the Union Pacific telegraph routing code. Durant can now eavesdrop on Cullen. Sensing Sean's unease, Durant assures him that he's not doing anything wrong. At Hell on Wheels, Louise is cornered by a large, drunk worker, who forces himself on her. She slashes his face with a razor and he strikes her. The next day, Elam and Dick have breakfast together. Cullen arrives and instructs them to ride out and order the Mormons off their land. At the Hatch farm, Dick approaches the boarded-up house. He hears Hatch yell that, again, the family isn't leaving. Dick is shot in the stomach. Elam drags him away and rides back to town with him draped over the horse. Elam tells Cullen he doesn't know who fired the shot. Eva declares Dick has no chance of surviving. Dick asks to see Elam's baby. declaring her beautiful as Elam had described. Dick dies and Cullen places his police badge on Elam's vest. Elam says he didn't want the job in this manner. Cullen, Elam, Louise and a cavalry arrive at the farm with a writ of execution. Hatch and his two sons approach the railroad group with weapons. Cullen tells Hatch that he must be accountable for the murder. After Hatch insists his family will not survive without him, Cullen assures him they'll be taken to a Mormon settlement. Hatch grabs his eldest son, Jeb (Ben Sullivan), and says the boy killed Dick. A reluctant Jeb agrees with his father and is hanged as his family watches. Hatch tells Cullen that he now owes him a life. Cullen rides off and stakes the property for the railroad. Later, Louise composes her newspaper story, writing that the railroad business has always involved unscrupulous and corrupt people, neither of which Cullen Bohannon seems to be.  Production  In an August 2013 interview, Anson Mount (Cullen Bohannon) discussed the scene with the seemingly young daughter (Siobhan Williams, who is actually 23) in the barn: \\"The network almost made us cut that [sex] scene out, and we fought for it to stay in. I'm not interested in pure, untainted heroes, just like I'm not that interested in strength. I'm interested in weakness, and I'm interested in what makes somebody human. Just because somebody's had their heart broken doesn't mean that they don't get a hard on every now and then. Okay. It's just realistic. He's out there alone. The only thing he's seen is whores, and half of 'em have syphilis. What's he gonna do?\\" He added, \\"The reason the sex is so important in that scene is that he has to hang her brother the next day and he doesn't even question it. He has to get on with the railroad. The law is the law. It makes the killing of that boy much more difficult, but he does it. We also had a scene in that episode in which I was reading to her little sister before she went to bed. We didn't have room for it, unfortunately, but that's the kind of stuff that we were trying to set up to make that ending so much more difficult.\\"  Reception  = Ratings = Seen as the second hour of the third season's premiere, \\"Eminent Domain\\" was watched by 2.49 million viewers and received a 0.5 rating among viewers aged 18‚Äì49, an increase from the second season's premiere and double the network's Saturday prime time average. = Critical reception = The A.V.

He has composed over 400 songs, mostly in Tamil. Many of his songs have been translated into other languages including Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Sinhala, Hindi and English. He is being viewed as an inspirational figure among Tamil Christians and many young and new worship leaders. He operates mainly from Kalayar Kovil in Tamil Nadu, where the headquarters of his \\"Jebathottam\\" Trust is located. Fr. Berchmans is well known and is referred to as ‚ÄúFather‚Äù in the Christian circles.  Early life  Berchmans was born on August 3, 1949 in Soosaiapparpatti (Semmangkudi), a small village near Paramakudi, Ramanathapuram district, Tamil Nadu, India. His parents were farmers, and were devout Catholics. Berchmans was the youngest of five children- elder sister, two elder brothers and one younger brother. He has completed his middle school in ‚ÄúThiruvarangam‚Äù a village nearby and high School in St.Mary's Higher Secondary School, Madurai. One of his aunts was a Catholic nun. Right from his childhood days, his sister who was also a nun was influential in making him lead a holy and God fearing life. As a youth he used to sing in the Church choir. He has had basic training in Carnatic and Western musical systems. After completing his high school education, he intended to become a Catholic priest and joined a Catholic seminary. Hence on completion of his schooling, he joined a St. Paul's Seminary in Trichy for his Philosophy and Theology. On completion of his studies there, he was ordained as a Priest in the year 1970 For the Arch Diocese of Madurai. While in the seminary, he improved his musical skills and by the time he became a priest, he had become well known as a good singer in the local Church circle.  Priesthood and Ministry  Fr. Berchmans started his ministry as a Catholic Priest in Satharasanpatti near Sivaganga, Tamil Nadu in 1978. While performing his duties as a priest, he developed a longing to do something more creative. He is said to have experienced a spiritual transformation in 1983 in a meeting organised by DGS Dhinakaran, another well known Tamil evangelist. He later began organising evangelical meetings, and composing and releasing Christian worship songs, which were received well by Tamil Christians who found the \\"voice...new...(and) melody...different\\". A land of about 5 acres was donated to his ministries by the villagers of Kalayar Kovil near Madurai. He established his \\"Jebathottam Trust\\" in the area, which now hosts an auditorium with a seating capacity of 2000, a 24-hours prayer chamber, board and lodging facilities and a shelter for helpless women. 'Jebathottam' is a Tamil word meaning \\"Prayer-Garden\\".  Present activities  Father Berchmans still organises evangelical rallies in Tamil Nadu and other Indian states including Bihar, Punjab and Delhi. He also works abroad especially in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Canada, France, England, Germany, Netherland and Middle-eastern countries. He is now a well-known figure among Tamil Christians, and his songs are being extensively used in church worships across denominations. He still composes and releases worship songs.

He released his first four volumes of compositions under the title \\"Visuvaasa Geethangal\\" (Songs of Faith), and the later ones under the title \\"Jebathotta Jeyageethangal\\" (Songs of victory from the Prayer Garden).

The cover artwork's depiction of a monkey's head superimposed on a suited body is a reference to the album's title track, which Kuti composed as a commentary on the colonial mentality of Africans who adhered to European customs and clothing.  Music and lyrics  The album's title track is Kuti's commentary on the colonial mentality of Africans who adhere to European customs and clothing, as referenced by the cover artwork's collage of a monkey's head on a suited body. In the song, he ponders why fellow Africans would wear so much clothing in the African heat: \\"I know what to wear but my friend don't know / I am not a gentleman like that! / I be Africa man original.\\" He solos on his tenor saxophone over most of the song's nine-minute intro, and switches to his electric piano during the vocal sections. Kuti had learned how to play after the departure of Igo Chico from his Afrika 70 band in 1973. \\"Gentleman\\" is followed by two jazzy compositions‚Äî\\"Fefe Naa Efe\\" and \\"Igbe\\".  Release and reception  Gentleman was originally released in 1973 by EMI. In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Sam Samuelson gave the album five stars and called it \\"both an Afrika 70 and Afro-beat masterpiece.\\" In 2000, MCA Records reissued and bundled Gentleman with Kuti's 1975 album Confusion. It was the last installment in a 10-CD, 20-album reissue project for Kuti. Rob Brunner of Entertainment Weekly gave the reissue an \\"A\\", while Robert Christgau from The Village Voice gave it an \\"A‚Äì\\". In Christgau's opinion, while the horn work that introduces the title track \\"embodies the contradictions of that song's anti-European message\\", the album is carried \\"off into the bush\\" with \\"two eight-minute Africanisms\\". He ranked the reissue number 80 on his dean's list for the Pazz & Jop critics' poll in 2000. In 2010, Gentleman was bundled again with Confusion by Knitting Factory Records as a part their extensive reissue of Kuti's 45-album discography.

Her obituary in The Times described her as skilled at portraying English domestic life.  Biography  Beatrice Kean Seymour (n√©e Beatrice Mary Stapleton) was born in Clapham, south London into a working-class family. Her father David was a farrier. She attended a secretarial school and was the first wife of William Kean Seymour. She began her professional life as a writer of short stories for magazines. However, at the suggestion of an editor, she reworked one of her unpublished short stories into her first novel, Invisible Tides, subsequently writing over 30 books during a career that spanned more than three decades. Her novels were published almost annually until shortly before her death from heart problems in 1955.  Approach to writing  Seymour believed that the role of the novelist is to help readers think through their emotions. She saw the novel as far superior to the short story as a vehicle for conveying social ideas.  Critical reception  Some British reviewers reportedly considered Invisible Tides to be the best novel of 1920. A reviewer from The Bookman wrote that it was: \\"a good and moving story, brilliantly set down, having affinities, it seems to us, with Jude the Obscure on the one hand and with Mr. McKenna's Sonia on the other. Mrs. Seymour is strong in characterisation, subtle and revealing in dialogue, and exquisite in her descriptions of nature, touched as they are with a fine imaginativeness\\". Her 1925 novel Unveiled received a glowing review in the 30 May 1925 issue of The New Yorker. But some critical responses were not so favourable. A Times Literary Supplement critic wrote of her 1927 novel Three Wives: \\"Had Miss Seymour compressed her novel into three- quarters its present length, it might have been a really distinguished piece of work\\". When she died in 1955, The Times said of her: ‚ÄúShe had already established herself as a literary figure of importance 30 years ago and the skill and variety with which she portrayed English domestic scenes and projected them against a larger social and political background are of a high order‚Äù. More recently, her novels have been appraised as reflecting an alertness to the role of women in society.

It was published in June 2012 by Random House in the United States and Simon & Schuster in the United Kingdom. The book chronicles the fictional phenomenon of \\"slowing\\", in which one Earth day begins to stretch out and takes longer and longer to complete. The novel received positive reviews and publishing deals totaling ¬£1.12 million (¬£ million today), and has been translated into a number of languages. The book was nominated as part of the Waterstones 11 literary award in 2012. Background The idea for the \\"slowing\\" first came to Walker when she read that the 2004 Indonesia tsunami had caused the Earth's rotation to slow by some fractions of a second. Walker started researching the effects of a more large-scale slowing, mostly on the Internet, but also had it verified by an astrophysicist. As she was working full-time as an editor at Simon & Schuster, she took to writing the story in mornings. Although it took her four years to complete the book, Walker enjoyed writing this way, calling it a \\"type of meditation.\\" Walker has said that Blindness by Jos√© Saramago was one of the books that inspired her to write The Age of Miracles.  Plot  The story begins with Julia, an eleven-year-old girl, who lives in California. A few months before her birthday, the world undergoes an unexplained phenomenon known only as \\"slowing\\", in which the completion of one rotation of the Earth around the Sun takes drastically longer. By the time it is confirmed by the experts, a \\"day\\" is 24 hours and 56 minutes. The hours steadily increase and dramatically alter life on Earth. Reactions differ: while some try to adapt with it, others, like Julia's grandfather, believe \\"slowing\\" to be a government hoax and still others, like Julia's best friend Hanna's family, believe it to be God's wrath and return to their hometowns. After weeks of chaos, the American government announces the adoption of \\"clock time\\", in which the world functions as normal according to the 24-hour clock, regardless of whether it is day or night outside. Some people reject clock time altogether, like Julia's neighbor Sylvia, and set their lives according to the sun, ignoring clock time altogether. These people are labelled \\"real timers\\" and they face discrimination. Meanwhile, the longer days have started to have psychological effects on people: Julia's mother starts suffering from a slowing-related disorder, which is referred to as \\"the syndrome\\", its effects vary from person to person. Crime rates begin to spike and people purportedly become more impulsive, the excuse Julia uses to convince herself when she finds her father having an affair with Sylvia. Additionally, Julia's grandfather goes missing on her twelfth birthday. Julia tries her best to adapt to her new life. Feeling lonely since Hanna's departure and her subsequent indifference, she strikes up a friendship with her long-time crush, Seth Moreno, and they eventually start a relationship. Julia's grandfather is finally found, dead, after having tripped and fallen into his nuclear-proof cellar. This is the catalyst for Julia's father to end his relationship with Sylvia and form a better bond with his wife. In the meantime, a thinning of the Earth's magnetosphere due to the slowing rotation causes solar superstorms to strike the Earth. The resulting radiation causes \\"the syndrome\\" to become more severe. As a result, Seth becomes victim of a more aggressive form of the syndrome that nearly kills him. Seth's father decides to take him to Mexico, where the symptoms are supposedly less fatal. Julia receives one last email from Seth after his reaching Mexico, but soon after, America is hit by a 72-hour black out because of excessive electricity usage to artificially grow crops. Subsequently, the government allows electricity use only for life-supporting activities. Julia is never able to reach Seth despite several letters to an address he left her. The last chapter skips to years ahead. By this time, a day stretches into weeks and the human race will soon become extinct. The government launches The Explorer, a spaceship that contains memoirs of life on Earth. Julia reveals that she never heard from Seth since his last email, but still maintains hope that they will be reunited one day. The book ends with her reminiscing about the words she and Seth had written on wet cement one summer day: \\"We were here\\".  Reception  The Age of Miracles received mostly positive reviews from critics. Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times hailed the book as a \\"clever mash-up of disaster epic with sensitive young-adult, coming-of-age story\\" despite noting its \\"made-for-Hollywood slickness\\" and some wayward plot developments. In Entertainment Weekly Melissa Maerz agreed with Kakutani on the book's strengths, giving it an \\"A-\\" and praising it as \\"lovely, because of its simple writing and quiet moments.\\" NPR's Maureen Corrigan also enjoyed the book, writing: \\"The Age of Miracles is a pensive page-turner that meditates on loss and the fragility of both our planetary and personal ecosystems.\\". The Daily Telegraph critic Claudia Yusef focused on the emotional aspect of the book, opining that the slowing was \\"the basis for a startlingly evocative portrayal of the beauty and horror of adolescence\\" and that \\"quibbl[ing] with the physics, seems futile.\\" Writing for The Huffington Post, Abigail Tarttelin praised the book's \\"light, ephemeral touch\\", calling it \\"a very enjoyable book\\", but felt the book was not as dramatic as the setting required. Becky Toyne of The Globe and Mail felt the consequences of the slowing read \\"too much like a catalogue\\" and the narrator's refrain too repetitive, but nevertheless summed up the book as \\"touching and harrowing, but above all magical.\\" In her Washington Post review, Jackie Stewart, felt the book's literary techniques to be \\"heavy-handed\\" and the descriptions \\"awkward\\", but ended with: \\"On the whole, 'The Age of Miracles' is a dark and beautiful book that follows the trials and tribulations of one child ... and also tracks society's reaction to a bizarre natural disaster.\\" However, writing for The Guardian, Christopher Priest slammed the book for its \\"total lack of irony, awareness of the larger world [and] characterization done by the numbers\\" and further highlighted the scientific fallacies in the book.

It was opened in 1910 to connect the historic Siegburg‚ÄìOlpe railway directly to Cologne and required the construction of the Hoffnungsthal tunnel. The section from Hoffnungsthal to R√∂srath partly used the track of the Cologne‚ÄìLindlar railway, which is now largely disused west of Bergisch Gladbach. The line, like the Siegburg‚ÄìOlpe line, is also called the Aggertalbahn (Agger Valley Railway), although it leaves the valley of the Agger not far from Overath. In 1997, Deutsche Bahn abandoned scheduled freight traffic throughout the Oberbergischer Kreis. After that passenger services ran only as far as Gummersbach, but, since 2003, they have been extended to Marienheide. Since May 2007, the Rhein-Sieg-Eisenbahn has occasionally operated freight traffic as required from the junction of the Siegburg‚ÄìOlpe railway with the Wiehl Valley Railway (Wiehltalbahn)Wiehl Valley Railway towards Cologne.  History  The planners of the Siegburg‚ÄìOlpe railway preferred a direct connection to Cologne from the beginning rather than the indirect route via Siegburg. But at this time, there was still a military base in Cologne, which was in the way of the line. When this site was closed, the line to Cologne was soon planned. In order to significantly shorten the travel time from Cologne to the Oberbergische district, the connection between Hoffnungsthal and Overath, including the 1,087 m-long Hoffnungsthal tunnel between Hoffnungsthal and Honrath and the connection from Rosrath to Cologne, were completed in 1910. The new line used part of the S√ºlz Valley Railway at Hoffnungsthal to connect the two extensions together. = Since the construction of the connection to Cologne = As in many other places there were disruptions to the line after the Second World War. Hitler's scorched-earth policy required a temporary diversion over the old line via Siegburg. This was made necessary by the destruction of a bridge between Overath and Cologne by German troops during their retreat. This bridge was repaired in 1946 and trains were then diverted on to the line via Olpe, because the main line to Siegen was much more damaged. This detour lasted until 1949. In these difficult years the line was also used by many of the starving urban population to buy food (on Hamsterfahrten, literally ‚Äúhamster rides‚Äù). Automatic Block Signaling was implemented the line from K√∂ln-Kalk to Dieringhausen on the Siegburg‚ÄìOlpe line in 1976. The line was also affected by the increasing motorisation and a systematic reduction in services by the Bundesbahn and other rationalisation leading to losses of passengers. At the beginning of the 1980s, after the closures of the Agger Valley Railway between Lohmar and Overath and Dieringhausen and Olpe, the remaining line was at risk of being closed. The railway workshop on the Agger Valley Railway was closed in 1982 and from then on rollingstock was serviced in Cologne. As the line was still seen as having potential for passenger traffic, the three lines between Cologne and Meinerzhagen were used in 1984 as the test track for an experimental City-Bahn service using specially painted trains. This service ran from Cologne via Overath and continued as the only passenger service on the remaining section of the Siegburg‚ÄìOlpe railway to Dieringhausen and then continued on the Volme Valley Railway (Volmetalbahn) via Gummersbach and Marienheide to Meinerzhagen. The result was a sudden increase in passenger numbers. However, the passenger service from Marienheide to Meinerzhagen was closed in 1986 as was the passenger service from Gummersbach to Marienheide on 30 May 1987. In 1989, the City-Bahn sets were withdrawn for the advance operation of the S 12 S-Bahn service between Cologne and Au (Sieg), which formally commenced in 1992, but regular-interval services were maintained. Since 1999, only modern class 644 (Bombardier Talent) diesel multiple units have run on the line. Since 1991, the Oberbergische Bahn has run in Cologne on the newly built S-Bahn trunk line on the K√∂ln Hansaring‚ÄìCologne Hauptbahnhof‚ÄìK√∂ln Messe/Deutz‚ÄìK√∂ln Trimbornstra√üe route. During the construction of the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed railway, the route was changed once again in Cologne. Shortly after K√∂ln-Frankfurter Stra√üe station, which opened in 2004, the line forks to Overath and via Cologne/Bonn Airport station to Troisdorf. In 2003, the signal boxes in R√ºnderoth, Dieringhausen and Gummersbach were closed. There is now no local signals staff on the line, except in Engelskirchen where one last mechanical signal box remains to guard a level crossing. The total line is remotely controlled from Cologne-Deutz. Since 20 April 2003, passenger services have again run to Marienheide. In recent years, there have been few improvements in service along the route. In February 2009, it was announced that Overath would have a modern passenger information system with LCD train destination indicators, which was installed in May 2010 and now supplies information about delays and outages. The announced reconstruction of Dieringhausen station (on the Volme Valley Railway) to provide barrier-free access has still not been implemented. Currently it is planned to convert the passenger operations into Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn line S 14 from 2015. This will combine the RB 25 service with the RB 24 (Eifel-Bahn) service on the Eifel Railway. This line re-uses a historical route, because once there was a regional rail service from J√ºnkerath on the Eifel line to R√∂srath.  Condition  While some station buildings have been renovated in recent years with the support of the city, others are privately owned and used as residences. Thus the Overath station building was completely renovated in 2008 and serves the city as a Kulturbahnhof (\\"culture station\\"). In addition to a facility of Regionalverkehr K√∂ln (a regional bus operators owned by various municipalities), the building houses a newly opened restaurant and rooms for social and cultural events. Several other station building, such as Honrath and Porz-Heumar, are privately owned. The buildings are in good condition and have been converted into residential accommodation. Some other entrance buildings still serve only for railway purposes and seem to be in a moderate condition. Since the closure of the ticket offices, the function of the buildings, however, is severely limited. Porz-Heumar station, which is located in a large residential area, is now just used for train operations (the shunting of freight trains from the nearby waste transfer station) as the Regionalbahn services to Marienheide have not stopped there since the 1980s. The station is used for passengers only if there are operational problems or road closures.  Rollingstock  In 1984, ten class 218 locomotives of the Hagen depot were repainted to match some Silberling carriages in pure orange (RAL 2004) with a pebble grey belly band for the CityBahn project and were used as push‚Äìpull trains in regular intervals services on the Cologne‚ÄìMeinerzhagen route. These sets were only used on this line and later for the advance operation of the S 12 S-Bahn service between Cologne and Au (Sieg), which commenced in 1992. Since 1999, services on the route have mainly been provided by diesel-electric multiple units of class 644 (Bombardier Talent) in double or triple traction. They are sometimes relieved by class 643 sets (also Talents) which were originally procured by Euregiobahn and are appropriately labelled. Since 2012, some trips have again been made with class 218 locomotives and Silberling carriages.  Rail services  Today the line from Cologne via Overath and Dieringhausen is operated as part of the Rhine-Sieg S-Bahn with a Regionalbahn service (RB 25: Oberbergische Bahn) over the Agger Valley Railway and Volme Valley Railway to Marienheide: * K√∂ln Hansaring via Cologne Central Station, K√∂ln Messe/Deutz, Overath, Dieringhausen and Gummersbach to Marienheide at hourly intervals, and *between Cologne and Overath every 30 minutes. Fares on the whole route are set by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg (Rhine-Sieg Transport Authority, VRS). Rail services on the lines used by the Oberbergische Bahn along with the Eifelbahn and the Voreifelbahn were advertised in 1997 by the VRS. DB Regio NRW won the tender. In November 2009, tenders for the operations of the line from 15 December 2013 until 2028 was let. Meinerzhagen is specified as the terminus of the RB 25 service.

It was published by HarperCollins in 1988. The book was made into a 1992 film of the same name, starring Michael Douglas as Edward Leland and Melanie Griffith as Linda Voss, though some of the plot and characters are changed in the adaptation. Plot summary In 1940, Linda Voss, 31 and unmarried, is secretary to John Berringer, a partner in a New York law firm. She is secretly in love with John, but he is married to Nan, the daughter of the senior partner Edward Leland, and politically and socially well-connected. She begins an affair with John after his wife leaves and sues for divorce. Linda becomes pregnant and they marry in a brief civil ceremony, which neither is really enthusiastic about. Leland moves to Washington to take a senior position in a new organisation, soon to be renamed the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which coordinates war-related information from German refugees in America. He requests that John and Linda join him; because of Linda's fluent German, learnt from her Berlin-born grandmother, and her full FBI security clearance, Linda works directly with Ed. She is able to alert him that a translator is falsifying information from a number of informants. Ed travels a lot and Linda learns that he is going into Germany and German-occupied Poland. His main contact is \\"Sunflower\\", a rich German industrialist he has known since the 1920s and visits regularly in Germany and Switzerland. Sunflower also runs a number of agents. Linda has a miscarriage and loses the baby. America enters the war. John is now in charge of counterespionage in Germany and France. At a meeting between the FBI and the OSS‚Äîa meeting charged with professional rivalry‚ÄîLinda learns of Alfred Eckert, a dress designer popular with the wives of many high Nazi officials. He has been passing information since 1938, but is now dead, murdered by a person unknown. The circumstances are unclear and it is not known if his cover had been compromised, but he needs to be urgently replaced. Linda begins to imagine herself in his place. In Brooklyn, Linda‚Äôs mother‚Äîa long-time alcoholic‚Äîdies, and John accompanies her to the funeral. John is forced to return to work, but Linda stays on. Going through old papers clearly relating to her grandmother's time, she finds fragments of German- language newspapers, photographs of her grandmother‚Äôs Jewish cousins Hannah and Liesel Weiss, and a document in Hebrew. She takes some of the material home to Washington. Linda returns to find John and Nan in a passionate embrace. Nan confesses that she is dissatisfied with Quentin, her new husband, and John admits that he never stopped loving Nan. After angry and emotional scenes, Nan leaves to return to Quentin. Linda, although furious with John, allows him to stay. Norman Weekes of the FBI calls a meeting at which he presents a short-list of potential agents to replace Eckert. Ed and John reject them all for various reasons. Linda finds herself saying, \\"Why not me?\\" Weekes is all for Linda‚Äôs suggestion, but Ed is furious. With John at the office at all hours and hardly ever home, Ed confronts Linda and angrily explains what a dangerous idea he thinks it is. He describes to her the latest information his office has received about the beginning of the mass-murder of all European Jews, and that if caught, Linda, with Jewish ancestry, could expect the same fate. She is not deterred and finally resigns. She goes to Weekes and volunteers her services. Linda is sent to OSS Assessment school, and then to Training school, where she gets a taste of what she can expect in Germany. She is given a cover identity and story, and then spends a few weeks with a German couple in Baltimore, fine-tuning her Berlinerisch accent. Sent via troopship to England, she spends a few days studying maps and learning about a safe house to which she can escape, but only in the direst emergency. With the cover name of \\"Lina Albrecht\\", she is flown to Lisbon, where she is to be contacted by agent named \\"Rex\\". He turns out to be Konrad Friedrichs, a respected senior employee of the German Foreign Office. He is their ranking expert on Spain and Portugal, hence his frequent visits. He is also a covert anti-Nazi. They fly to Berlin where Lina is installed in the basement of his house. Her cover is that of a cook, hence her working-class accent, but Friedrichs is uneasy, concerned that her accent is not genuine enough to pass for a native. With the housekeeper, who believes that Lina is her employer's mistress, sent away on a holiday, Lina meets Margarete von Eberstein. Margarete is a translator with the Abwehr, a friend of Friedrichs and a covert Resistance member. She is from an aristocratic family, with a mother who is a retired actress and once a favorite of Adolf Hitler. Margarete also has a lover, a colonel on Hitler's staff, from whom she gleans information. Margarete starts to teach Lina to cook gourmet German style. Venturing out into Berlin to familiarise herself with her surroundings, Lina is caught in a random police check, but her documents and accent do not arouse any suspicion. She also makes contact with Rolf, a fishmonger and courier of information. Lina is placed as a cook in the house of Horst and Hedwig Drescher, on the recommendation of Friedrichs. Drescher's cook has met with an \\"accident\\", and it is hoped that Lina can take up where Eckert left off, as it is known that Drescher, head of the British section of the Foreign Office, keeps confidential papers at home. Drescher, a social climber, regularly hosts dinner parties with high-ranking guests. The first meal is less than satisfactory, but Drescher seems not to notice, and Lina stays. Realizing that Hedwig is a chronic hypochondriac and rarely leaves the house, Lina learns to offer her milk and honey liberally laced with brandy. While Hedwig sleeps, Lina finds the hidden key to Horst's study and locates concealed documents. She makes copies, which she passes on via Rolf. Despite Margarete's pleas not to trust anyone‚Äîeven her‚ÄîLina eventually passes a message to Rolf asking him to try to locate her cousins, who she hopes are still in Berlin. A few weeks later, Rolf tells her that the sisters cannot be found; they are certainly deported and probably dead. As Spring 1944 approaches, Lina finds a document suggesting that the Germans have penetrated the plans for the D-Day landings and have placed a man in a key position. She knows she must get this intelligence back as soon as possible, but Horst phones from his office, asking Hedwig to get a document from his study. She cannot find the secret key, which Lina has hidden, and goes into hysterics. Lina realises that she has to get out, so taking only the clothes she is wearing, she flees and takes refuge with Margarete. She then goes to Rolf‚Äôs shop, but it is closed. Lina breaks into Friedrichs‚Äôs house and confronts him with the news that he is probably compromised and must leave Germany immediately any way he can. Then she spends the day on the streets, hiding in shop queues, before returning to Margarete‚Äôs flat. She reveals to Margarete her real identity and mission and that she has to get out. Under cover of fetching some food, Margarete pulls a gun on her, admitting that it was she who betrayed Eckert and that she has also denounced Rolf. She tells Lina, now revealed as Linda, that she has been a \\"mole\\" in the Resistance movement and that she must now kill Linda. They fight and Linda is wounded in the arm before she manages to shoot Margarete dead. Faint from blood loss, Linda manages to apply an improvised bandage as she had been taught in training school, before falling unconscious. She awakes the next day to find herself being treated by Friedrichs, accompanied by Ed Leland in the uniform of a General of the SS. It transpires that Friedrichs flew to Lisbon, contacted Ed and they returned to Berlin. Ed has documents for Linda, not good ones but it is hoped they will do. His cover is of a General who is mute owing to a throat wound on the Russian front. He is taking Linda, travelling as his mistress, by train to Basel for a medical appointment. Friedrichs sees them onto the train, but refuses to leave his beloved Berlin. At the Swiss border, Ed is allowed through but Linda's fake papers cause some delay. Ed calmly bribes the German customs officer with twenty thousand dollars in Swiss francs. Linda recovers in a Swiss hospital, but as Ed is about to leave, she realizes that she loves him, that she always did and never loved John in the same way. Ed reveals that Nan has returned to Quentin and is about to make Ed a grandfather. Linda persuades Ed that he really loves her‚Äîdespite him being twenty years older‚Äîand they agree to marry.

Its carunculate seeds are usually dispersed by ants (myrmecochory) attracted by the edible elaiosome. The entire plant is covered in stinging hairs, and has a native range covering Central and South America, being found in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Venezuela. Cnidoscolus urens is monoecious and self-compatible. Its male and female flowers appear superficially similar, but differ structurally. The principal pollinator during the dry season is a butterfly, Eurema daira, which does not discriminate between male and female flowers. Female flowers, making up only some 6% of the total, produce almost no nectar and appear to mimic males in order to receive attention from the pollen- and nectar-gathering insect. Male flowers usually function for only 1 day, while female flowers may remain functional for up to 7 days if unpollinated. Cnidoscolus was separated from the Linnaean genus Jatropha on the basis of its stinging hairs or trichomes, that consist of a multi-cellular pedestal and a single, elongate, hollow cell with a slightly swollen tip. On being touched, the brittle swollen tip breaks off at an oblique angle, the sharpened end readily penetrates the skin, and the cell contents are injected as if by a hypodermic syringe. This poison leads to great irritation of the skin, a condition which may last several days. If part of the plant is eaten it causes swelling of the lips, flushing of the face, vomiting and even unconsciousness. Its latex is highly corrosive and may produce serious sores.\\"Toxic Plants of North America\\" - George E. Burrows et al. A study in Costa Rica revealed that larvae of Erinnyis ello, a moth of the family Sphingidae, trim the stinging hairs from the leaf petiole then constrict the vessels supplying latex to the leaf, after which it can safely eat the leaf.Butterflies of British Columbia - Jon Shepard, Crispin Guppy References External links *Images *Gallery of images urens Category:Poisonous plants Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Cnidoscolus urens"},{"id":"40218508","title":"Nitesh Pandey"},{"id":"40218530","title":"Poonam Joshi"},{"id":"40218532","text":"Borislav Nikolov (; born 3 February 1992) is a Bulgarian footballer who currently plays as a defender for Strumska Slava Radomir.

Education He obtained his M.D. degree from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1947. He moved to the Washington University School of Medicine in 1954, becoming professor in 1966. In 1971 he moved to head the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Iowa College of Medicine until 1990, remaining as emeritus professor until his death in 1996. Contributions to Psychiatry He is known for having played a key role in the development from the 1950s of diagnostic criteria for mental disorders, particularly as a trio alongside Eli Robins and Samuel Guze. The proposals were influentially published as the so-called Feighner Criteria in 1972, which became the most cited article in psychiatry and shaped the Research Diagnostic Criteria and DSM-III of the American Psychiatric Association. Winokur is also known for seminal contributions to the genetics of affective (mood) disorders, such as the inheritance of bipolar disorder. He made seminal contributions, often along with Paula Clayton, to establishing a distinction between unipolar and bipolar depression, and was one of the first in America to prescribe Lithium for mania. He directed the \\"Iowa 500 studies\\" on the course of depression, mania and schizophrenia. He published extensively, over 400 articles and book chapters plus 20 textbooks and monographs. What is less known is that Winokur came to have significant doubts about the development of the diagnostic criteria. While he considered them an improvement, he wrote that it was a fiction that the data could speak for themselves, and that it was impossible to eliminate clinical judgment in diagnosis, or carelessness or inconsistencies in how criteria are applied.The Making of DSM-III: A Diagnostic Manual's Conquest of American Psychiatry Hannah Decker, Oxford University Press, 13 June 2013.

It was their final album before their break up a week later (they played their final concert in Tallinn on the 13th of April, 9 days after the album was mixed), but they reformed in 1993. The album's songs are covers of songs by the band Instruktsiya po Vyzhivaniyu. The songs were written between 1986 and 1989. After IPV's lead singer Roman Neumoev converted to Christianity, he gave the songs to Letov, telling him he could use them in whatever way he wanted. Letov decided to record a tribute to IPV using these songs. The LP issue in 2013 has 5 bonus tracks taken from these sessions and the sessions for the Egor i Opizdenevshie album Pryg-skok. In 2016, it was released on CD by Bull Terrier Records, including two extra bonus tracks. The album has two different renditions of \\"Posvyashchenie A. Kruchonkyh\\" and \\"Nepreryvny suicid\\". Track 2 was sung by Igor Zhevtun, while track 12 was sung by Egor Letov. The two versions of the song differ in the first line of the final verse - the word \\"menty\\" (cops) in the line \\"–Ø –ø–æ–¥–∞–º—Å—è –≤ –º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã, –≤ –ø–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Å—Ç—ã, –≤ –ø–æ—ç—Ç—ã, –≤ –º–æ–Ω–∞—Ö–∏\\" (I'll become a cop, a queer, a poet, a monk) on track 2 was changed to \\"zhidy\\" (kikes) on track 12.  Track list   Personnel  * Igor \\"Jeff\\" Zhevtun - guitar, vocals, backing vocals * Yegor Letov ‚Äì vocals, guitars, bass guitar, drums, production * Konstantin \\"Kuzya UO\\" Ryabinov - keyboards, saxophone, backing vocals  Legacy  In 2008, shortly before his death, Letov answered a fan's question on the GrOb website, saying the album would never be reissued, stating \\"there is no such album\\". However, his widow Natalia Chumakova remastered the album in late 2011. The remaster was reissued on double vinyl in 2013 by Neuro Empire. The remaster was also remixed: changes include a missing stick hit from the beginning of \\"Nepreryvnyy suitsid\\" (track 1) being restored, the fade out of the final chord in \\"Moya severnaya strana\\" having some laughter from Letov added, the feedback in the beginning of \\"Rodina-Smert'\\" starting up straight away instead of fading in and \\"Khuy\\" being slower (presumably the original speed of the song) and ending slightly differently. 5 bonus tracks were also included, among them being the original Egor i Opizdenevshie version of \\"Krasny smekh\\", recorded in 1990 and released on vinyl and CD on BSA, but being left off the 2006 CD reissue of Pryg-skok for the same copyright reasons precluding this album's reissue. The original version on the album was faded out, however this version had the natural ending of the song. The version of \\"Nepreryvnyy suitsid\\" recorded for Pryg- skok under the title \\"Pro malinovuyu devochku\\" was not included, however it would be on the CD release of the remaster three years later. Zhevtun, who substituted for Letov on two tracks due to the similarity between their voices, participated in GrOb's 35th anniversary reunion tour in 2019 as lead vocalist and guitarist.

Release The film was released in the UK on 2 May 2014, and later released in the US on 26 September 2014. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 3.33/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Far-fetched, frantically overstuffed, and unfunny, Plastic seems to use its title as a goal as much as a description.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 32 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Guy Lodge of Variety said \\"The title says it all in this cheap, laborious junior heist thriller from British B-movie journeyman Julian Gilbey\\". Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent \\"A nasty streak of casual sexism runs through an already unpleasant and absurdly far- fetched film\\". Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter said \\"All champagne and strippers, conspicuous consumption and witless machismo, Plastic is a contemporary British heist movie that already feels dated, as if it were made before the bubble burst on Guy Ritchie's comic book gangster voyeurism\\". There were, however, some positive reviews. Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times stated that \\"As mindless entertainment goes, it's a pretty watchable time- passer.\\", and Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times said \\"It's hard to escape the sense that 'Plastic' is itself a cheap knockoff, but the point is not to look too closely\\". In an interview with The Guardian whilst promoting his film, The Maze Runner, actor Will Poulter expressed his disdain for starring in the film, describing the film as \\"bad\\" and saying \\"It‚Äôs really tough, man. Because it‚Äôs shaming. And the worst thing is thinking someone will think you did it for dishonourable reasons. I‚Äôm not shifting the blame. I recognise my responsibility to that film. But I‚Äôve tried to shake it off since.‚Äù He closed out his interview by saying \\"I‚Äôve got the one film that I regret out of my way.

Brim was fortunate enough to start writing graffiti in one of the most important periods of graffiti history. He began bombing and hitting New York City Subway trains, in the late 1970s, all the way through to the mid-1980s. After the trains were cleaned in 1989 he and the rest of TATS CRU took to the streets and began bombing and creating street art all over the city. Brim's friendship to Afrika Bambaataa, and the almighty Universal Zulu Nation led to Brim being featured in one of the most important videos in hip-hop culture, ‚ÄúAfrika Bambaataa - Renegades of Funk‚Äù, Brim was also featured in many other important documentaries and movies about Hip-Hop and graffiti culture from that time period including Dick Fontaine's 1987 documentary \\"Bombin\\" where he was introduced to fellow British graffiti artists Goldie and 3D (who later went on to form Massive Attack) .25th Anniversary Of The Bombin Documentary Brim became Goldie's artistic mentor, New York was the place that lifted his horizons, and America was where he would later become \\"Goldie\\".Brim became Goldie's artistic mentor Left to right, Nicer, Goldie, Brim, Bio, T Kid, Vulcan; Brighton Seafront 1987 Brim was documented as the first graffiti artist to come to the UK and appeared on many TV stations and newspapers including the front page of the Daily Telegraph discussing this graffiti culture. Upon this media frenzy Brim was invited to lecture at Oxford University and was asked personally by Michael Winner to create the backdrops in his film Death Wish 3 which starred Charles Bronson. The prequel to this film was BBC'S 1984 Beat This: A Hip-Hop History The film included footage from DJ Kool Herc's original parties, The Cold Crush Brothers, Jazzy Jay, Soul Sonic Force and Afrika Bambaataa. The film featured Brim's take on graffiti in New York. The film was one of the first documentaries about Hip-Hop. Brim would go on to form a clothing line FJ560 with then famous rapper and friend Fat Joe The flagship store was located in the Bronx, New York City. Fat Joe, The Terror Squad and Big Pun can be seen in many videos wearing FJ560. Fat Joe would paint with TATS CRU before he was a famous rapper. Brim and TATS CRU would be heavily involved with advertisement for Fat Joe and created painted billboards across the city promoting his album releases. By becoming such an iconic figure in the world of art he received a mention alongside other TATS CRU members in the KRS-One track \\"Out For Fame\\". On the passing of Big Pun, TATS CRU painted the memorial wall that is visited daily; Brim is currently working on the Big Pun statue project that will create a 3D memorial wall in honor of the late Big Pun Brim currently lives in China.

The group's work is focused on various disciplines such as performance, theatre, game design and visual art. In their projects gold extra's artists chose their genre according to whatever the project and its concept demand. They transgress into unknown territories and allow themselves the liberty to constantly explore new trajectories in the arts. This led to the creation of work in extreme variations, from Commedia-dell‚Äôarte styled street theatre to computer games, from robotic theatre to audio compilations, from public picnics to dance performances with electrodes. Another characteristic of the group is their strong interest to interact with the public and involve them into the creation and performance of the work. Productions of gold extra therefore address the relationship of society with media, technology and politics. gold extra started in 1998 as a theatre company, but swiftly moved into other fields. They became a multidisciplinary network and platform for artistic production. In this spirit they produced various collaborative pieces and events in Linz, Salzburg and Vienna, very often for public and urban spaces and always in cooperation with regional artists and activists. A good example for this period would be the exhibition and performance installation Komm nach Hause (Come home) in the K√ºnstlerhaus Salzburg in 2002. A bus station was reconstructed inside of the exhibition space and housed a multi-layered and playful exchange of interior and exterior spaces and events. This and other projects used already a tremendous amount of technology and real-time media, a tendency to develop further in the upcoming years. In 2004 gold extra participated in the EU-project \\"Trichtlinnburg\\", for which they produced Love City and Survival Camp. They were invited to participate at the symposium of the Osterfestspiele in Salzburg, to which they contributed the humorous performance lecture Cosi.Mixtur. This marked the beginning of a new phase of work for gold extra. With some older members retiring and new faces becoming part of gold extra, the group also started to work on a more international scale. They produced pieces for the Salzburger Mozartjahr in 2006, became Salzburg's artistic embassador at \\"Kosmos √ñsterreich\\" in Germany and were supported by the European Cultural Foundation to make their computer game Frontiers. Their productions were shown at international festivals, museums and venues, such as Ars Electronica (A), Zentrum f√ºr Kunst und Medientechnologie (ZKM) Karlsruhe (D), Festival der Regionen (A), Garage X Vienna (A), Digital Arts Week Z√ºrich (CH), Casa Encendida Madrid (E), Belef Festival Belgrad (RS), Forum Freies Theater D√ºsseldorf (D), Games for Change Festival NY (USA), Theaterkapelle Berlin (D), The Arches Glasgow (UK), DansWerkplaats Amsterdam (NL), K3 Hamburg (D), brut Koproduktionshaus Wien (A), DOX Centre for Contemporary Art Prague (CZ), Tanzhouse_Festival Salzburg (A) and the No Border Camp 2007 (UA). Their most prominent project of the recent years was the computer game Frontiers, which was selected as \\"mod of the month\\" by the German magazin GEE in 2009 and received extensive media coverage in the German speaking region.

After the death of his father Alauddin Khalji in 1316, he ascended the throne as a minor, with the support of Alauddin's slave- general Malik Kafur. After the assassination of Kafur, his brother Qutb-ud-din Mubarak became the regent, and subsequently dethroned him to become the Sultan.  Early life  According to the 14th century chronicler Isami, Shihab-ud-Din was Alauddin's son from Jhatyapali, the daughter of Alauddin's Yadava feudatory Ramachandra.  Ascension to the throne  Alauddin fell seriously ill during his last years, and the administration was controlled by his slave-general Malik Kafur. After Alauddin's original heir apparent Khizr Khan was imprisoned at Gwalior for allegedly conspiring to kill him, Malik Kafur convened a meeting of important officers at Alauddin's bedside. It was decided at this meeting that Shihabuddin would succeed Alauddin, with Malik Kafur as the regent. According to Isami, Alauddin was too weak to say anything during the meeting, but all the attendees agreed that his silence should be interpreted as his consent. At this time, Shihabuddin was a little over six years of age. The day after Alauddin's death on the night of 3-4 January 1316, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers (maliks and amirs), and appointed Shihabuddin as the new Sultan. He read Alauddin's order according to which the deceased Sultan had disinherited his eldest son Khizr Khan and appointed Shihabuddin as his successor. The other sons of Alauddin - Mubarak Shah, Shadi Khan, Farid Khan, Usman Khan, Muhammad Khan and Abu Bakr Khan - were ordered to kiss Shihabuddin's feet.  Reign  Shibabuddin's complete title was \\"al-sultan al-azam shihab al-dunya wa'l din abu'l muzaffar umar shah al-sultan\\". During Kafur's short regency, Shihabuddin's participation in governance was limited to his appearance in a short court ceremony that was held daily by Kafur. After the ceremony, Kafur would send Shihabuddin to his mother, and held separate meetings to issue orders to the various officers. To maintain his control over the throne, Kafur had Alauddin's sons Khizr Khan and Shadi Khan blinded. He also imprisoned Alauddin's senior queen Malika-i Jahan and Mubarak Shah, another adult son of Alauddin. According to the 16th century historian Firishta, Kafur married Alauddin's widow Jhatyapalli, the mother of Shihabuddin. Becoming the new Sultan's step-father was probably Kafur's way of legitimizing his power. The former bodyguards (paiks) of Alauddin disapproved of Kafur's actions against the family of their deceased master, and murdered Kafur. Kafur's killers freed Mubarak Shah, who was appointed first as the regent. In April 1316, Mubarak Shah detained Shibabuddin, and became the Sultan. Shibabuddin was moved to Gwalior, where he died the same year.
