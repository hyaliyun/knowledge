Ordered built by Queen Maria I of Portugal as the fulfilment of a vow, the Basilica is not only a product of the Queen's particularly fervent devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, but remains the most important architectural endeavour of her reign. The Estrela Basilica was the first church in the world dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  History  Shortly after her wedding to her uncle Infante Peter of Braganza in 1760, Maria, Princess of Brazil vowed, before an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the Convent of Carnide, to build a church and convent under the Rule of Saint Theresa if she was given the grace of bearing children that would assure the succession of the House of Braganza. Princess Maria was, at the time, the eldest daughter and heiress presumptive of King Joseph I, whom she would eventually succeed after his death in 1777. She gave birth to her first child, Joseph, Prince of Beira, on 20 August 1761 (who would later die of smallpox in 1788, while construction of the Basilica was underway). Only after acceding to the throne could Queen Maria afford to see to the fulfilment of her vow. Construction began in 1779; the groundbreaking ceremony took place on 24 October: the Queen's husband, Peter III, laid the first cornerstone and Fr. delivered the speech. Mateus Vicente de Oliveira, an important court architect, is made in charge of the works: it is under his direction that the construction of the conventual areas was carried out (from February 1778 to May 1781), as well as the beginning of the Basilica. Oliveira died in 1785, and was replaced with Reinaldo Manuel dos Santos, who saw to the conclusion of the works. Reinaldo Manuel made substantial alterations to the exterior design of the church (namely, a different design of the pediment, of the fa√ßade, of the bell towers, and of the dome to which he added a roof lantern).  Architecture  The huge church has a giant dome, and is located in a hill in what was at the time the western part of Lisbon and can be viewed from far away. The style is similar to the Mafra National Palace, in late baroque and neoclassical. The front has twin bell towers and includes statues of saints and some allegoric figures. A large quantity of grey, pink and yellow marble was used in the floor and walls, in intricate geometric patterns, one of the most beautiful in European churches. Several paintings by Pompeo Batoni also contribute to a balanced design. The tomb of the Queen Maria I is in the right transept. A famous nativity scene made by sculptor Joaquim Machado de Castro, with more than 500 figures in cork and terra cotta is a major attraction to visitors.

Cottonclads were prevalent during the American Civil War, particularly in the Confederate States Navy for riverine and coastal service such as in the battles of Memphis, Galveston, and Sabine Pass. Confederate tactics generally had cottonclads, which were outgunned by Union warships, steam at full speed towards enemy vessels, relying on the cotton to absorb fire. Once they were within firing range, they would open fire, and, if possible, ram or board the enemy.  Conversion  Around 1863, Confederate Commander John B. Magruder realized that Texas did not possess the funding and resources‚Äîsuch as iron mills‚Äîto produce impressive and potent vessels such as the ironclad CSS Virginia, thus inspiring the development of a new type of warship, later classified as a cottonclad warship. Cottonclads were various kinds of steamboats transformed into warships in places such as Buffalo Bayou, near Houston. In this process, the upper deck, called the texas deck, was removed. As a result of this, many of these ships developed \\"the rakish look of an ironclad ram, if not the potency.\\" Five hundred-pound cotton bales were placed, on their sides, three bales high, with another row of bales lying flat behind the first row; these bales served as platforms for sharpshooters. All of the bales would be held in place with iron straps fastened to the bulwarks. To provide additional protection for the sharpshooters, heavy 14 x 14‚Äù timbers were fastened to the floor in the hold of the ship; these extended through the boiler deck to form a breastwork. A typical sharpshooter force on a cottonclad would consist of about 100 men arranged behind their bales of cotton. A refurbished thirty-two-pound cannon was mounted to the bow. Gangplanks were then suspended from their upper decks; they could be dropped onto the decks of nearby ships for boarding by teams of soldiers called \\"horse marines\\" - they were usually cavalrymen whose horses had been left ashore. Once protected by layers of both wood and cotton, the ships needed some way to fight back; they needed weapons. However, finding any heavy guns to place on the new cottonclads proved to be a difficult task. A motley of guns had to be scavenged for and affixed to the steamers, as no standard armament could be found. However, much of the time, a lack of ammunition forced these guns to be used purely for morale boosters for the men onboard. The brunt of the offense had to be shifted over to the sharpshooters and rams on the tips of the ships. These rams would be built onto many of the newly-converted cottonclads, and would consist of a 4-inch oak sheath covering a 1-inch layer of iron plating. The rams would be affixed to the bow of the ship, extending below the water level. The cottonclad would steam at full power towards an enemy ship, and the ram would collide with the ship‚Äôs hull, sinking or at least severely impairing the boat. The cotton bales would be compressed into the space between the double pine bulwarks. Some of the vessels that were converted into cottonclads included the former mail packet Neptune, and others such as John F. Carr, Lucy Gwinn, Josiah Bell, Uncle Ben, Bayou City, Governor Moore, Stonewall Jackson, General Sterling Price, Little Rebel, General Bragg, and the Beauregard. Although the retrofitting of these ships into cottonclads took time, at the end of the work, what were once dainty river steamers were now turned into what one observer deemed as \\"savage looking gunboats.\\"  Cottonclads in Battle  Having been converted into these makeshift battleships, the cottonclads were now ready to deploy at Galveston. Their mission was to retake the city from the Union forces, which now possessed several warships, including the USS Harriet Lane, USS Owasco, USS Corypheus, and USS Sachem, all anchored in Galveston Harbor. Cottonclads fought larger, better-armed/armored Federal gunships by steaming directly at them, subsequently using their various offensive measures to take down the ship. The Federal ship would engage the cottonclad as soon as it was spotted, but the dense cotton bales absorbed most of the fire. Meanwhile, the cottonclad‚Äôs smaller caliber cannon would begin firing at the Federal ship as soon as it was within the cannon‚Äôs range, which was fairly limited. At an even closer range, sharpshooters behind the bales would produce a steady stream of fire at any enemies on the deck. Often, the sharpshooters' fire was so effective that the Federal crewmen, especially gun crews, ran for cover below the deck. Once the more maneuverable cottonclad rammed or entangled the Federal warship, the ropes suspending the cottonclad's gangplanks above the enemy deck would be cut. The gangplanks would fall onto the enemy deck, and the awaiting \\"horse marines\\" would board the Federal ship, proceeding to kill or capture its crew. If possible, the captured ship would be towed back into shallow waters, where the cottonclad‚Äôs crew would scavenge its cannons, weapons, and other provisions. If the captured ship could not be towed to safety, its prisoners were transferred to the cottonclad and the captured ship was burned to prevent it from being recaptured by the Federals. Two cottonclads, CS Bayou City and CS Neptune, played key roles in the Confederate strategy at the Battle of Galveston in which Confederate forces demanded the surrender of the important Texas port. Major General John Magruder equipped the two cottonclads with weapons and officers, appointing Capt. Leon Smith to utilize these ships in seizing the wharf. The cottonclads attacked from the rear of the Union squadron, resulting in the sinking of the CS Neptune as it attempted to ram the Union ship Harriet Lane. However, the CS Bayou City managed to board the Union vessel despite the immense damage it had taken during the battle, leading to the retreat of the remaining Union forces and the successful acquisition of Galveston for the Confederate. However, in the end, every single one of the once proud cottonclad warships were either sunk, burned, or captured by Union forces.

It was released in the USA with English subtitles. Plot The old sea-captain retires, but the next day German World War II occupation of Norway begins. He then kisses his wife good-bye and is off to Regiment HQ. There he finds a lack of leadership and morale that offends him. They even laugh at him and his out-dated uniform and discontinued second lieutenant officer-rank, that he had earned years before. He is sent with a few men to blow up a bridge. The young men laugh at him and generally ignore his advice. When the bridge fails to collapse, he does the job himself. He returns to HQ to find that its officers have voted to surrender. He leaves the HQ with a few men, taking trucks and supplies to continue the fight, often at odds with the remainder of army leadership. He rebuilds a small fighting unit with volunteers and draftees and he achieves some battlefield success. Eventually his men abandon him, and he faces a German attack alone. Historical context The film is set during the early part of World War 2, and specifically around Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasion of Norway and Denmark by Germany, beginning on 9 April 1940. This film is based, somewhat loosely, on the actions of 2nd Lt. Thor O. Hannevig, Norwegian Army (Reserve). He was a retired sea Captain who rejoined the Norwegian Army and fought with a force of 150 mostly reserve soldiers as the Telemark Infantry Regiment after his original regiment surrendered on 9 April 1940. The ad hoc regiment operated from 21 April 1940, around the town of Vinje in Telemark County, until 3 May when the regiment became aware that the 4th Division had also capitulated, dashing any hope of relief forces. Most of his men were discharged from service at this time and left the area in civilian clothing. On 8 May, Hannevig and the remaining three soldiers and six female auxiliaries of the regiment were taken as prisoners of war and the 28 German POWs Hannevig's force had captured were freed.Translation of Norwegian Defense Information Service page on Thor Hannevig Key differences between the actual events and those depicted in the film are the age of Lt. Hannevig, that he disbanded his unit instead of being abandoned by his soldiers, and a small staff remained with him until he surrendered to the Germans. In addition, the German POWs his regiment had captured were still held, and were handed over to the German forces directly.

He has applied his methods to the identification and mapping of genes affecting economically important single- gene (e.g. polled, double-muscling, callipyge, weaver, congenital muscular distonia), as well as complex multi-gene traits (e.g. milk and fattening yield and quality, fertility, disease resistance). He has also established working relationships with the major breeding organizations in many countries, helping them to apply the results of his discoveries on a large scale, using so-called marker assisted selection to accelerate the otherwise slow process of farm animal improvement. He is also a pioneer in opening up the field of epigenetics for animals, a hereditary form that does not conform to simple Mendelian rules.

The foundations for both the low and high towers were laid in October 1831 with both of the towers being constructed at the same time. Both towers went into operation on 1 September 1832. While the sands were a danger to all ships in the area, it appears that the accident involving a passenger ship, the Frolic, in March 1831, was the driving force behind the rapid construction and completion of the towers. The engineering chief was Joseph Nelson and both towers exhibited a light, giving a clear set of leading lights for vessels sailing eastwards up the Bristol Channel, guiding them through the narrow channel. between the rocky shore and the dangerous Nash Sands. During the 1920s the use of the low tower was discontinued and a red sector placed in the lamp of the east tower, shining red over the sandbank.

After the war, the Institute evolved into the Royal Anglo-Belgian Club. At the end of the lease on the Belgrave Square house in 1978, the Club became associated with the Royal Thames Yacht Club, sharing the latter's modern premises at 60 Knightsbridge. The joint RTYC-ABC clubhouse had an impressive first-floor dining room looking out over Hyde Park. On 1 July 2010, the Anglo-Belgian Club moved to another Club House near Trafalgar Square, which it shared with a hotel belonging to Club Quarters. The Club closed its doors at the end of June 2012. Its social, cultural and sporting activities were taken over by the Anglo-Belgian Society. http://www.belgianball.com/anglo-belgian.html} Membership The Club was open to both men and women and had about 400 members, who were predominantly either Belgian citizens living in the United Kingdom or British citizens with Belgian connections.

The current part, S≈çdanyaku Shima K≈çsaku, began in 2019. The manga has also been published as 7 bilingual volumes (Japanese-English) called Division Chief Kosaku Shima and President Kosaku Shima, and in French and German. In addition to various manga there has also been one comedic ONA, and two comedic anime adaptations lasting 11 episodes each, a live action film, and a single episode TV drama.

He is later promoted to buch≈ç (division chief) and eventually promoted to manager and executive-director, and with each promotion the title of the series changed as well.

Other names used for the community include Annes Aggravation, Flippos Folly, Pathologists Quagmire, and Scientists Cliff. Its altitude is 105 feet (32 m), and it is located at (38.5176224, -76.5132867). The private community was first established in 1935 as a summer colony for scientists by Flippo and Annie Gravatt. The founders of Scientists' Cliffs chose this land because the population of American Chestnut trees showed a particular resistance to the blight. Original cabins in the area were built from felled American Chestnut trees that died from the blight. Although established as a seasonal community, the first year-round resident moved to the community in 1943. The bylawsBylaws at http://www.cliffers.org still require that a new member be \\"...a graduate of a four‚Äêyear course in a recognized institution of higher learning or has attained the educational equivalent...\\" In 1986, when residents of Scientists Cliffs heard that forests and abandoned farms surrounding their homes were up for sale, possibly to developers, they chipped in and bought the land. A tract of 436 wooded acres near the Chesapeake Bay became the \\"American Chestnut Land Trust.\\" In the years since its founding, ACLT has expanded its land preservation by partnering with the Nature Conservancy and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. By 2019, over 4,000 acres surrounding Scientists' Cliffs have been preserved. The community is accessed by Scientists Cliffs Road and divided into five sub-sections, called \\"Gates,\\" though it is not a \\"gated\\" community. Gates are named Gate A, Gate B, Gate C, Gate D, and Gate E, respectively. The streets in each gate all begin with the corresponding letter of the gate, and are botanically named. For example, Gate A features streets named Aster, Aspen, Azalea, etc., Gate B features streets named Birch, Beech and Bluebell, and so forth. All five gates have direct access to the Chesapeake Bay via a series of paths and wooden boardwalks. Additionally, Gate A features a community center, a residential swimming pool, tennis courts, horseshoe pit, a baseball field, a recycling center, and a private beach referred to as \\"South Beach\\". Another feature of Scientists' Cliffs is that a restrictive covenant requires all houses within the community to have a wooden exterior, giving the homes a distinctively rustic look. Recently, however, environmentally neutral cement-based siding such as \\"Hardie board\\" has been allowed. The tall cliffs along the edge of the bay contain one of the world's richest fossil deposits from the Miocene period. The cliffs are part of the Calvert Formation. Carcharodon megalodon teeth are found in this area.

It was organized at Buckley Field, Colorado, and was extended federal recognition on 1 October 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The unit was the first Air National Guard group receiving federal recognition. The 140th Fighter Group was entitled to the history, honors, and colors of the 370th Fighter Group. It was assigned to the 86th Fighter Wing. During August of '51 they deployed 20 P-51D aircraft and supporting personnel to Wilmington, North Carolina on Operation Southern Pine. It was one of the largest exercises of the era which involved 100,000 troops and over 400 aircraft to defend North and South Carolina from a mock Soviet invasion. The 140th Fighter Group consisted of the 120th Fighter Squadron at Buckley Field. As part of the Continental Air Command Fourth Air Force, the unit trained for tactical fighter missions and air-to-air combat.

Three hundred and seventy five (375) airmen of the 140th FBW volunteered to take part in the tactical phase of the Charlie Shot of Operation Tumbler- Snapper which was a nuclear bomb test in Nevada. On 22 April 1952, they were among the first troops to go to ground zero an hour after the detonation to simulate an attack. It was also the first time the media was allowed to witness a nuclear test and it was the first event ever to be televised nationally. On 15 November 1952, the elements of the 140th returned to Air National Guard control in their respective states. Cold War Upon return to Colorado state control, the 140th was re-equipped by Tactical Air Command with F-80C Shooting Star jets.

In 1958, the 140th FIW implemented the ADC Runway Alert Program, in which interceptors of the 120th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron were committed to a five-minute runway alert. In 1960 the F-86s were again replaced by the F-86L Sabre Interceptor, a day/night/all-weather aircraft designed to be integrated into the ADC SAGE interceptor direction and control system. Tactical Air Command/Vietnam War 120th TFS F-100D Super Sabres, 1973 The 140th was transferred back to Tactical Air Command in January 1961, being equipped with the F-100 Super Sabre supersonic tactical fighter-bomber. During the 1961 Berlin Crisis and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the Wing was placed on Alert by Tactical Air Command, however the aircraft and personnel of the wing stayed in place at Buckley Air Force Base, and were not deployed. The 140th deployed to Incirlik, Turkey, for 15 days in 1967, to take part in a NATO exercise called \\"Deep Furrow\\". On 26 January 1968, the 140th Tactical Fighter Wing was federalized and taken under the jurisdiction of Twelfth Air Force, Tactical Air Command. The Wing's 120th TFS was reassigned to the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing, its aircraft/personnel/equipment being reassigned to Phan Rang AB, South Vietnam. As was the practice during the Vietnam Era, most of the wing's personnel were also sent to various Tactical Air Command units, either in the United States or deployed to units in Pacific Air Forces or USAFE. The Wing, stripped of its assets, was placed in a Non-Operational status by HQ TAC. With the end of its federalized service, the Wing, the 120th TFS and its personnel were released from active duty and returned to Colorado state control on 30 April 1969. With its return to Buckley, the wing was returned to Operational Status. The 120th TFS F-100Cs returned to Buckley, however with the withdraw of the F-100Ds from South Vietnam in 1971, the squadrons were upgraded with the newer model from the Vietnam Veteran aircraft returning. Colorado ANG A-7D, 1986 In 1974, the Wing began receiving A-7D Corsair II ground attack aircraft from active duty U.S. Air Force wings as part of their transition to the A-10 Thunderbolt II. Then in 1975, new A-7Ds were received as the result of Congressional funding to the DOD FY 1975 and FY 1976 budgets for the procurement of additional A-7Ds, primarily to keep the LTV production line in Dallas open and the workers employed in the wake of post-Vietnam DOD procurement reductions. As a result of these unplanned acquisitions, the Air Force assigned these new 1975 and 1976 built aircraft in the mid-1970s. Then the wing relieved some new twin seat A-7Ks trainers in 1983. The 140th deployed in 1977 to Gilze-Rijen AB, Netherlands, to participate in exercise Coronet Ante, with A-7D Corsair. This was the first time a U.S. Air Force or National Guard unit had deployed to a Dutch-owned and operated base. In September and October 1979, the unit deployed to Merzilon AB, Turkey, as part of Exercise Coronet Rider. The unit deployed its entire squadron of 24 aircraft for 30 days. This was the first time any Air National Guard unit had deployed under \\"bare base\\" conditions in which only a runway and water supply were provided. Under the Coronet Cove program, the 140th deployed to the Republic of Panama 11 times to support the defense of the Canal Zone as provided under the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977. The first such deployment took place in December 1978 and the last deployment ended in February 1989. The A-7Ds were flown to victory as the \\"World Champions\\" in the inaugural \\"Gunsmoke\\" competition held at Nellis Air Force Base in 1981. Modern era The \\"Minutemen\\" F-16C, 2006 The A-7Ds were operated until March 1992 when the Wing converted to Block 30 F-16C/Ds Fighting Falcons, and the Corsairs were retired to Davis-Monthan AFB. With the conversion to the F-16 in September 1991, the 140th Wing had deployed to the Republic of Korea; the CommonWealth of Australia in March 1995; to Incirlik, Turkey, for Operation Provide Comfort II in April 1995; to Al Jaber AB, Kuwait, for Operation Southern Watch in June 1996; to Karup, Denmark, for NATO exercise Coronet Blade in August 1997 (with mini-deployments to Germany to fly with German MiG-29s and to the Republic of Slovenia for state-to-state partnership); and again to Al Jaber AB, Kuwait for Operation Southern Watch in January 1998. The unit deployed again to Incirlik, Turkey, in 2000 for Operation Northern Watch. The 140th WG transferred financial and operational responsibility for Buckley ANGB to US Air Force Space Command in October 2000. The major reason for the change in responsibilities for providing base operating support and quality of life services from the Colorado Air National Guard to the active-duty Air Force is the growing presence of active-duty personnel at Buckley. Becoming an active duty base, Buckley ANGB was renamed Buckley AFB. Following the attacks on the United States on September, 11th 2001, the 140th FS assumed tasking to provide homeland defense as an integral part of Operation Noble Eagle. In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport AGS, OH. It would distribute the 178th Fighter Wing's F-16 aircraft to the 140th Wing (ANG), Buckley AFB, CO (three aircraft) and two other installations. DoD claimed that it made this recommendation because Buckley (64) had higher military value than Springfield-Beckley (128) and Buckley had a role in the Homeland Defense mission. Units circa 2019 The 140th Wing is a composite organization, composed of diverse units. * 140th Operations Group :: The 120th Fighter Squadron (FS) operates the F-16 Fighting Falcon. It is a dual-purpose fighter squadron with pilots qualified to perform air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, including offensive counter-air (OCA), defensive counter-air (DCA), OCA interdiction, close air support (CAS), and combat search and rescue (CSAR) missions. :: The 200th Airlift Squadron (AS) operates the C-21A Learjet. It provides secure priority airlift for the highest level of military and civilian leaders throughout the world. :: 140th Operations Support Flight * 140th Mission Support Group * 140th Medical Group * 140th Maintenance Group * 233rd Space Group based at Greeley, Colorado. The group is composed of more than 300 Airmen and operates a strategic, survivable, mobile USAF ground system that provides immediate, worldwide missile warning, space launch, and nuclear detection data to the National Command Authority (Secretary of Defense and President). They are able to survive and operate through all phases of trans/post nuclear attack.

Known as Short Lane, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Aberdeen east to an entrance to Aberdeen Proving Ground. MD 715 was constructed during World War II as a military access project. Between 2010 and 2013, the state highway was reconstructed to better handle the increased traffic brought by the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. Route description View north from the south end of MD 715 at the entrance to Aberdeen Proving Ground MD 715 begins at a modified trumpet interchange with US 40 (Philadelphia Boulevard). The state highway heads east from US 40 as a six-lane divided highway that intersects Old Philadelphia Road and the entrance to an industrial park. MD 715 crosses Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line and passes north of the Visitor Center of Aberdeen Proving Ground as it reaches its eastern terminus at an entrance to Aberdeen Proving Ground. This gate is open 24 hours daily and allows entry for persons with a Government ID along with visitors without a Government ID. All visitors to the Aberdeen Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground must use this gate to enter. Past the gate, the road continues into the Aberdeen Proving Ground as Maryland Boulevard.

Her work in watercolour, extensive illustrations, and English language descriptions were included in a number of publications on the flora of the State. Biography Caladenia Plate 1 from West Australian OrchidsEmily Sims was born in St Kilda, later moving to Perth, Western Australia where she married a banker, Theodore Parker Pelloe, in 1902. An early interest in equestrian sports was replaced with an interest in botany in 1916. In 1920 she wrote for The West Australian, in a column 'Women's Interests' as 'Ixia', and contributed to such organisations as the Country Women's Association, a writers club, and continued her interest with horse riding. She began to paint and publish a large number of watercolours, her landscapes were also acquired by government departments. She collaborated with the state botanist, C. A. Gardner, in producing her books, and was included in Hal Colebatch's A Story of a Hundred Years: Western Australia, 1829‚Äì1929. Aside from a number of paintings and illustrations, her most noted works are Wildflowers of Western Australia in 1921 and West Australian Orchids in 1930. These publications were intended to be accessible by amateur naturalists and enthusiasts, the scientific descriptions were accompanied with more 'subjective' exposition. The specimens are carefully illustrated, painted, and described, yet her Drosera and Cephalotus were presented as \\"bloodthirsty savages of plant life\\". The books were popular and commended. Several publications were issued as Wildflowers Of Western Australia, another so-titled (1936) by the state's Tourist & Publicity Bureau was by Gardner, with a painting by Emily Pelloe. Another was published in 1941 by Gardner; 'localities and flowering seasons, by Emily H. Pelloe'. These shorter publications were for the promotion and celebration of the states flora, and similar works continued to be produced as supplements in the West Australian newspaper for many years. Legacy Her career was abbreviated by ill health and she died while riding a horse in 1941. The large collection of paintings by Emily Pelloe was presented to the University of Western Australia in a ceremony the following year. The gift was made by her husband and received by the Governor of the State, Sir James Mitchell, who gave a eulogy. The collection of over 400 paintings is housed at St. Catherine's College, and within the department of botany.

The film is about an aging man coming to terms with his homosexuality and mortality. It was a pioneer in its frank and mature examination of homosexuality. Plot  Jos√©, a middle age magician, is an elegant discreet homosexual who lives alone and has an occasional affair with Miguel, a young politician who finds it more convenient in Madrid's high society to marry than assert his homosexuality. Jos√© is a man romantically possessed and obsessed by his childhood in Granada during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in the spring of 1936. Now in his fifties, Jos√© returns to Granada and relives his childhood there. A time when he fell in love with Garc√≠a Lorca and had a youthful affair with one of Lorca's own lovers. Memories come flooding back to the mature Jos√©, of youthful sexual conquest, of Lorca's murder at the hands of Franco's agents, and his own early homosexual affairs. Jos√©'s entire life is colored by his obsessions with Garc√≠a Lorca, his unknown God, to whom the film is dedicated. Jos√© travels twice to Granada. First, he revisits a woman who is also obsessed with Garc√≠a Lorca's memory, and steals a photograph of the boy with whom he had his first sexual encounter; later, Jos√© returns to Madrid, to a party in search of his youth, and meets a pianist with whom he had sexual relations many years before but now does not remember. When Jos√© returns to Madrid, he is a man tormented by his past, and in search of peace. Listening to a taped recording of Garc√≠a Lorca's famous \\"Ode to Walt Whitman\\", he desires nothing more than to face the rest of his life in loneliness, although his recent lover, Miguel has returned to his bed and wants to continue their affair. Jos√© realizes that he is really all alone in their world, alone with his God.

Produced by Hanna-Barbera and based on the classic Mark Twain characters, the program starred its three live-action heroes, Huck Finn (Michael Shea), Becky Thatcher (LuAnn Haslam), and Tom Sawyer (Kevin Schultz), navigating weekly adventures within an animated world as they attempted to outrun a vengeful \\"Injun Joe\\" (voiced by Ted Cassidy). After the show's original run, the series continued to air in reruns as part of The Banana Splits and Friends Show syndication package. Production In February 1967, Hanna-Barbera Productions announced it was in the process of developing a record number of six new animated television series. According to the Los Angeles Times, the six new series in various stages of production at the time were Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor, Zartan (a.k.a. The Herculoids), Shazzan, Samson & Goliath, Fantastic Four and The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Also nearing the end of post-production at the time was Hanna-Barbera's Jack and the Beanstalk, an hour-long special which featured Gene Kelly dancing alongside various cartoon characters and aired on February 26, 1967. In a 2005 interview, LuAnn Haslam stated that Jack and the Beanstalk had served as a \\"trial run\\" for the technology of combining live-action with animation, saying, \\"NBC had to be convinced that combining people with cartoon figures would work. It was a big success and so NBC went forward with our series.\\" At the time of production, The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was the first weekly television series to combine live-action performers and animation. During development of the series, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera also stated the show was to be the most expensive half hour ever put on television. In a July 1967 interview with columnist Hal Humphrey, William Hanna expressed high hopes for the innovative new concept, saying \\"When you say the word 'cartoon', people think of children only, and we limit ourselves ‚Äì although plenty of adults watch cartoons. We think combining the live action with the animation will give our company a special identification,\\" with Joseph Barbera adding, \\"And do you know the clothes from that period are 'mod' today? The kids are wearing the same high-gaiter shoes now that Huck and Tom wore then.\\" After NBC green-lit the series, preparations began to find the youngsters to portray the series' three leads. In 2005, Haslam recalled the casting process, saying \\"(T)he show was produced by both Hanna-Barbera and NBC. As a result there were a lot of people to make happy when it came to choosing the cast. As I understand it, Hanna-Barbera cast the show and sent some kind of screen test/pilot to the NBC executives in New York. NBC didn't like the choices that had been made. They decided that they wanted the cast to be younger. So Hanna-Barbera had to start all over again.\\" In casting their lead, Hanna-Barbera and NBC eventually found their ideal \\"Huck\\" in 14-year-old veteran child actor Michael Shea, reportedly selecting him out of 1,300 boys. 14-year-old newcomer LuAnn Haslam was chosen to play \\"Becky\\". In recounting how she landed the role, Haslam stated, \\"I got a call from my agent to go to Hanna-Barbera for an interview. Carmen Sanchez was the casting director. As I walked into her office she was on the telephone. She turned, looked at me and said to the person on the telephone, 'I have to go, Becky just walked in.'\\" Rounding out the series live-action cast was 13-year-old Kevin Schultz who was cast as \\"Tom\\". At the time, Schultz was best known for starring on the television western series The Monroes alongside his twin brother Keith, who had reportedly also auditioned for the role of \\"Tom\\" before Kevin was selected. Character actor Ted Cassidy was cast to voice the role of the animated antagonist \\"Injun Joe\\". In an August 1967 interview with columnist Mel Heimer, Cassidy stated that he was looking forward to his upcoming role on the new series, saying, \\"I think I'll get more of a chance to do some acting than I did in (The Addams Family).\\" With the series' three young live-action stars in place, the complicated filming process began. During the months the series was in production, each day of filming reportedly began at 9:00 a.m. Under California law at the time, child actors were required to attend school for three hours a day and periods of instruction had to last at least 20 minutes at a time. When asked about the filming process, Michael Shea described an average day on the set, saying, \\"First we'd get made-up and dressed, and then we'd go to school while the shot was being set up. By coincidence, we were all taking the exact same subjects, so we were tutored together.\\" The live actors' scenes were filmed in front of a royal blue backdrop (an early forerunner to the modern-day CGI green screen) and the cartoon background and characters were animated in later. Working with a technology still in its infancy, the young cast was required to master the art of engaging in conversational exchanges without having their animated co-stars to interact with. Shea recalled, \\"Injun Joe, for instance, was a cartoon character, so when I had to talk to him, I'd run my eyes slowly up the blue screen until the director told me to stop. Then I'd just try to remember where that point on the screen was.\\" Since the voice actors would not record their audio tracks until after principal filming was completed, character actor Bruce Watson, whom Shea described as \\"the greatest dialogue coach in the world\\", would perform the lines of all the animated characters during filming for the live-action stars to interact with. Each episode reportedly took approximately 4 hours to film and six months to animate. Premise The pilot episode opens with a live-action prologue which sets the premise for the series. It is late afternoon in Hannibal, Missouri, and Twain's classic characters, Aunt Polly (Tom's aunt) and Mrs. Thatcher (Becky's mother) appear distressed in their concern for the youngsters, who are said to be late arriving home. Next, we see our three protagonists, Huckleberry Finn (Michael Shea), Becky Thatcher (LuAnn Haslam) and Tom Sawyer (Kevin Schultz) taking a shortcut home through the town's graveyard, where they encounter \\"Injun Joe\\" (Ted Cassidy). Furious at the two boys for testifying in court to seeing him murder Doctor Robinson, Injun Joe chases the three children into McDougal's Cave. As the spry children outrun him, an angry Injun Joe vows revenge, calling out to them \\"You'll never get away from me! No matter where you go, I'll get you!\\" Once inside, however, the three youngsters find themselves hopelessly lost in the cave's labyrinthine passageways. This prologue would be re-edited with a voice-over by Michael Shea as Huck Finn summarizing the events, and would serve as the opening sequence for each subsequent episode. Although we never see the three youngsters emerge from the cave, it is presumed that they eventually find a way out since, as each episode proper begins, we join our three young live-action heroes as they now inhabit an animated world. Throughout the series, the children embark on a quest to return to their families in Hannibal, Missouri, traveling to various exotic animated lands (tropical islands; Egyptian deserts; Aztec cities; etc.) and make friends with‚Äîor run afoul of‚Äîan array of fanciful animated characters (leprechauns; pirates; sorcerers; etc.). Every episode also features an evil animated antagonist who bears an uncanny resemblance to Injun Joe (voiced by Cassidy). The likeness is not lost on the three children, who are routinely startled by the striking similarity to their nemesis back home; however, no explanation is offered of how, or why, Injun Joe is constantly able to remain one step ahead of them and assume these various guises. As the series only lasted one season, an episode explaining how, or if, the three children ever make it back home, or if it may, in fact, all be some sort of surrealistic \\"dream\\", is never seen.

Initial reaction was generally positive, with critics praising Hanna-Barbera's technique of combining live-action with animation as well as the performances of the show's three young leads. While acknowledging the series bore little resemblance to the original Twain stories, Milwaukee Journal critic Wade Mosby felt the series would be enjoyable for its target audience, describing the series' three young leads as \\"engaging\\" and continuing, \\"There's lots of activity, some thrills and chuckles and (aside from the introduction) not too much violence.\\" The Newburgh Evening News also expected the show to be popular with children, writing, \\"The younger set will love this show.\\" and continuing the following week, \\"(T)he combined animation‚Äìlive action techniques are excellent\\", as well as singling out young Haslam as \\"a charming scene stealer.\\" However, Telegram News Service critic Kathy Brooks expressed disappointment in Hanna-Barbera's handling of the beloved Twain characters writing, \\"Shame on Hanna-Barbera. They've taken the characters, and in reverse Twain tradition, white-washed them into fine upstanding citizens with no deviltry, and no charming original thoughts. Michael Shea plays Huck, and a more freshly-scrubbed looking Huck would be hard to find; Kevin Schultz plays Tom, and ditto for him. [...] No parent worth his salt should let his offspring think the TV version is the real Twain, or the real Becky or Tom or Huck.\\" As a Sunday evening show, the series garnered a wider audience than Saturday morning cartoons of the time, and launched its three attractive young stars as popular teen idols of the day. The series aired in over 15 countries and its three young leads were routinely in demand to make celebrity appearances to meet with young fans across the United States during the show's original run. During this time, the series also inspired a comic book adaptation. In December 1968, Gold Key Comics published a one-issue The New Adventures Of Huck Finn comic book, based on the episode \\"The Curse Of Thut\\" which aired around the same time. Although popular with child and teenage audiences, the series struggled in the ratings against its Sunday night competition and, by the end of 1968, news sources were already reporting that a second season appeared unlikely. The final original episode aired on February 23, 1969, with NBC continuing to air the show in reruns through the fall of that year, ultimately replacing it with Wild Kingdom on September 14, 1969. After the show's cancellation, the series was repackaged into syndication as part of The Banana Splits and Friends Show. Although originally airing in an hour-long format as a Saturday morning show called The Banana Splits Adventure Hour, subsequent incarnations were re-edited and sold into syndication as half-hour episodes which included several series not originally part of the original show. As part of The Banana Splits, The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn enjoyed new life, becoming well known to subsequent generations for the next four decades.

From left to right are Harold C. Urey, Ernest O. Lawrence, James B. Conant, Lyman J. Briggs, E. V. Murphree and Arthur Compton Eger Vaughan Murphree (November 3, 1898 ‚Äì October 29, 1962) was an American chemist, best known for his co- invention of the process of fluid catalytic cracking. Biography He was born on November 3, 1898 in Bayonne, New Jersey, moving as a child to Kentucky. He graduated from Kentucky University with degrees in chemistry and mathematics in 1920, and a master's degree in chemistry in 1921. After teaching school for a year he spent several years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a Staff Assistant and Research Associate in the Chemical Engineering Department. In 1930 he joined what was then Standard Oil of New Jersey. During the Second World War Murphree was a member of the committee that organized the Manhattan Project and was widely recognized as a leader in the fields of synthetic toluene, butadiene and hydrocarbon synthesis, fluid cat cracking, fluid hydroforming, and fluid coking. He was also involved in the early Manhattan Project as a member of the S-1 Section. Murphree was head of the centrifuge project (soon abandoned) and overall engineer for the Manhattan Project in June 1942. He struck Deputy District Engineer Kenneth Nichols as \\"more like the industrial engineers I was accustomed to dealing with. He was stable, conservative, thorough and precise\\". He was to have been on the Lewis Committee reviewing the entire project in November 1942, but was sick. He (and James Conant) disagreed with the committee recommendation to build only a small electromagnetic plant, and a full-size plant was built. In the 1950s he served in the Defense Department on scheduling missiles and coordinating the programs of the three services (as Nichols had done earlier). From 1947 to 1962 he served as Vice President of research and engineering Standard Oil of New Jersey, the company later known as Exxon. Among his awards were the Perkin Medal in 1950 and the Industrial Research Institute (IRI) Medal in 1953. The E. V. Murphree Award in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry awarded annually by the American Chemical Society is named in his honor. He died on October 29, 1962 at Overlook Hospital in Summit, New Jersey of coronary thrombosis. Legacy He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1999.

Theater Hopkins, which is a semi- professional theater company associated with Johns Hopkins University, was established in 1921, but routed itself to becoming a semi-professional theater company in 1931. Formed in 1989 from a merger between through a joint effort of the Board of Directors of both The Kensington/Garret Players and The Montgomery Players, The Montgomery Playhouse, in some form, has been providing theater performances for 85 years. History=Montgomery Players The second oldest community theater in Maryland (The Vagabond Players enters their 99th continual season as of September 2014), The Montgomery Players have been in existence since 1929, where they performed regularly in the Chevy Chase, Maryland area at Leland Junior High and the Landon School. In 1962 the group relocated to Inverness Playhouse in North Bethesda, Maryland, where they spent the next ten years performing there. In 1972 The Montgomery Players once again moved and took up residence at 1201 Quince Orchard Boulevard in Gaithersburg, Maryland in a newly renovated 305-seat theater that they would call their own. This group, up through the merger in 1989, had produced 60 continuous seasons of community theater. The Kensington/Garrett Players The Garrett Park Players organization originated in 1949. In their early years they performed on rented stages in local schools and recreation centers throughout Montgomery County, Maryland. In 1960 they merged with the Kensington Players (who had been performing for several years at Kensington Junior High School). This combined group was known as the Kensington/Garret Players (K-G Players). In 1966 the group moved to a permanent residence at the Kensington Armory. When the State of Maryland closed down the Armory in 1974, the group moved to Quince Orchard Boulevard. The Merger In the ensuing years, the Montgomery Players and the K-G Players were both theaters who's attendance was in a slight decline. While sharing actors and technical personnel, they were not sharing in the same profits they once did. In May 1989, the Montgomery Players and the K-G Players decided to join forces in a business accord, since the majority of their theater talent were shared by the two companies, they decided to join forces in hopes of turning a profit, and the Montgomery Playhouse was born in the space in which the Montgomery Players were occupying. In December 1999, the Montgomery Playhouse was forced to move from its home in Gaithersburg, Maryland to a temporary facility at the Shady Grove Middle School in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The final production at their facility, ironically, was Our Town. Eighteen months later, The Montgomery Playhouse made an accord with the Asbury Methodist Village to perform their main stage productions at their new facility, a 300-seat theater. Soon after that, the City of Gaithersburg, recognizing the accomplishments by offering an additional venue to perform smaller, more intimate performance pieces at the newly renovated Gaithersburg Arts Barn, a 99-seat theater. To this date, the Montgomery Playhouse performs at both venues. The Black Box New Play Festival In November 1993, local actor and playwright Eric C. Peterson pitched an idea to the Montgomery Playhouse that it needed to foster and develop young, talented writers. As a member of The Writers Center in Bethesda, MD, the idea was to foster a relationship between the two organizations to help local writers get their works seen. Unfortunately, the connection between The Writers Center and The Montgomery Playhouse never did achieve its full potential. However, from this meeting, the Black Box New Play Festival was born. This short playA short-play, or one-act play, is a stage production of no greater length than one hour, but no less than fourteen minutes in length festival was designed to encourage writers to submit new work for stage presentation. The winners of this festival would represent The Montgomery Playhouse in regional and national competitions. The works of local and nationally notable writers, such as John Morogiello and Mark Scharf have been showcased in these festivals. The festival remains a summer staple to Montgomery Playhouse's bill of fare to this day, performing in the Arts Barn in the Kentlands, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Combat Command. The 119th Fighter Squadron assigned to the Wings 177th Operations Group, is a descendant organization of the World War I 5th Aviation School Squadron (later 119th Aero Squadron), established on 5 June 1917. It was reformed on 30 January 1930, as the 119th Observation Squadron, and is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. Mission Federal Mission: provide combat-ready citizen airmen, aircraft and equipment for worldwide deployment in support of United States Air Force objectives. State Mission: support the citizens of New Jersey by protecting life and property, preserving the peace, order, and public safety when called upon by the Governor. Units The 177th Fighter Wing comprises the following units: * 177th Headquarters Group * 177th Mission Support Group * 177th Maintenance Group * 177th Operations Group : 119th Fighter Squadron * 177th Medical Group * 227th Air Support Operations Squadron History=Tactical Air Command On 15 October 1962, the New Jersey Air National Guard 119th Tactical Fighter Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 177th Tactical Fighter Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 119th TFS became the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 117th Headquarters, 117th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 177th Combat Support Squadron, and the 177th USAF Dispensary. In January 1968, a new crisis, the seizure of the American ship USS Pueblo by North Korean forces, and the 119th was called to active duty. In May 1968, the 119th TFS was assigned to the 113th Tactical Fighter Wing, District of Columbia Air National Guard and stationed at Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina when the active-duty 354th TFW was deployed to South Korea. Group personnel were spread throughout the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, and South Vietnam. The 177th TFW was placed in non-operational status. The 177th TFG was reformed at Atlantic City airport in June 1969, and returned to New Jersey State control. The 119th TFS transitioned into the F-105 \\"Thunderchief\\" in 1970. Air Defense mission F-106s of the 119th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 1984 In 1972, the National Guard Bureau announced that the 177 TFG would be assigned to the Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) and be responsible for protecting the United States from airborne attacks, and so was re-designated as the 177th Fighter- Interceptor Group and 119th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. In 1973, the unit transitioned to the F-106 \\"Delta Dart\\" all-weather interceptor and assumed alert status the following year. In 1979 Aerospace Defense Command was inactivated and the group was reassigned to Air Defense Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), and then again changed to a numbered Air Force, First Air Force in 1985. October 1984, the 177th FIG participated in the air defense community's Worldwide Weapons Meet, known as \\"William Tell\\", at Tyndall AFB, Florida. The unit captured the Special Achievement Award for Professionalism and Team Spirit, Overall Best Looking Aircraft, Best F-106 Team, Major Richard I. Bong Fighter Interceptor Award, Top Gun Award, F-106 Category Best Looking Aircraft Award, the Pratt and Whitney Award, the Sperry Corporation Award, and the General Dynamics Corporation Award. In July 1988 the 177th started receiving their first F-16A/B, \\"Fighting Falcon\\"s. These were of the block 15 type, replacing the aging F-106 in the air defense role. Since this was the primary role of the unit, it was decided to upgrade these airframes with the Air Defense Fighter (ADF) option. To that date the unit also flew some F-106s aside the F-16. The 119th FS was the last USAF unit to withdraw the F-106 from operational duty. In 1994 the squadron started trading in their ADF version of the Falcon for the more advanced block 25 version. During Operation Desert Shield/Storm, 73 members of the 177 FIG were called to active duty, and others served as volunteers. Fire fighters and Food Services personnel from the 177th Civil Engineering Squadron, elements of the 177th USAF Clinic, members of the Transportation section of the 177th Resource Management Squadron, and Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel from the Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Squadron provided backfill at various bases whose members had been deployed to Saudi Arabia. Those activated from the 177th Security Police Flight served at home station. And the 177th Chaplain's Assistant completed a five-month tour of active duty in Saudi Arabia. All members were returned to normal Guard status at home base by July 1991. Last F-106 59-0031 of the 119th FIS with a newly assigned F-16C 81-739 of the squadron flying over the Atlantic City Beach, 1988 From 18‚Äì26 January and 14‚Äì21 March 1998, the wing provided Operational Readiness Inspection support for 125th FW, based in Jacksonville, Florida. This included six aircraft and 35 support personnel deployed to the Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC) at Savannah, Georgia. The deployment lasted from 18 through 26 January. 177th personnel also provided support for the 108th ARW's Operational Readiness Exercise from 14 through 21 March, also held at the CRTC. The 177th participated in a live missile firing exercise - COMBAT ARCHER - at Tyndall AFB, Florida. 12 pilots and 60 maintenance personnel deployed to support this exercise from 1 through 14 February. From 1 May through 13 June 1998, the wing deployed five F-16C Fighting Falcon aircraft and 46 personnel to Howard AFB, Panama, in support of OPERATION CORONET NIGHTHAWK. 130 personnel rotated on a two-week basis during the six-week deployment. Operating as part of a joint interagency task force, the wing's role was to detect and identify suspected drug smuggling aircraft. Once identified, the suspected aircraft are turned over to law enforcement agencies for apprehension. The 177th FW deployed from November to December 2000 to Saudi Arabia, as part of Aerospace Expeditionary Force 9 in support of Operation Southern Watch. The 177th has previously deployed personnel in support of both Operations Northern and Southern Watch. As a result of the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 the Wing found itself in a key position. Located between New York and Washington DC, the 119th FS was immediately tasked with providing combat air patrols over cities in its region. In fact three aircraft were scrambled to intercept the aircraft that impacted the Pentagon, but were too late. They were then vectored to intercept flight 93 which eventually crashed in Pennsylvania. Although these three pilots did not know it at the time they would have been given authorization to down the airliners once intercepted. Following the attacks, the 119th FS began flying missions for Operation Noble Eagle. On 12 July 2002 the squadron flew its 1000th mission for Operation Nobel Eagle. From that year they also started to contribute in other overseas contingency operations. In September 2007 the first USAF F-16Cs to be retired to AMARG were from the 119th FS who sent two to the desert boneyard. In replacement for the ageing block 25s were the not much newer block 30s. During this transition the mission of the squadron remained. This being a double task as an air defense squadron in the northern section of the US and as a multirole squadron to carry out contingency operations abroad. The 177th Medical Group earned the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 2009. The wing's 119th Fighter Squadron currently flies the F-16C Fighting Falcon, a compact, multi-role fighter aircraft. It is highly maneuverable and has proven itself in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack. It provides a relatively low-cost, high-performance weapon system for the United States and allied nations. Since October 1998, the wing has had an active involvement in Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Southern Watch, Operation Northern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.http://www.177fw.ang.af.mil/ Lineage * Designated 177th Tactical Fighter Group, and allotted to New Jersey ANG, 1962 : Extended federal recognition and activated, 15 October 1962 : Placed in Non-Operational Status, 26 January 1968 ‚Äì 18 June 1969 : Re-designated: 177th Fighter-Interceptor Group, 27 Jan 1973 : Re-designated: 177th Fighter Group, 15 Mar 1992 : Status changed from Group to Wing, 11 October 1995 : Re-designated: 177th Fighter Wing, 11 October 1995 Assignments * New Jersey Air National Guard, 15 October 1962 : Gained by: Tactical Air Command : Gained by: Aerospace Defense Command, 27 January 1973 : Gained by: Air Defense, Tactical Air Command, 1 October 1979 : Gained by: First Air Force, Tactical Air Command, 6 December 1985 : Attached to: Northeast Air Defense Sector, 1 July 1987 : Attached to: Northeast Air Defense Sector (ANG), 1 December 1994 : Attached to: Eastern Air Defense Sector, 15 July 2009-Present Components * 177th Operations Group, 11 October 1995 ‚Äì Present * 119th Tactical Fighter (later Fighter- Interceptor, later Fighter) Squadron, 15 October 1962 ‚Äì 26 January 1968; 18 June 1969 ‚Äì 11 October 1995 : Assigned to 177th OG, 11 October 1995-Present Stations * National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center, Atlantic City, New Jersey, 15 October 1962 ‚Äì 26 January 1968; 18 June 1969 : Designated: Atlantic City Air National Guard Base, New Jersey, 1991-Present Aircraft *F-16C/D Fighting Falcon (1994 ‚Äì present) *F-16A ADF Fighting Falcon (1988‚Äì1994) *F-106A/B Delta Dart (1973‚Äì1988) *F-105B Thunderchief (1970‚Äì1973) *F-100C Super Sabre (1963‚Äì1970) *F-86H Sabre (1962‚Äì1963) References *177th Fighter Wing at GlobalSecurity.org External links * New Jersey ANG: 177th Fighter Wing Category:Wings of the United States Air National Guard 177 Category:Military units and formations in New Jersey ","title":"177th Fighter Wing"},{"id":"13403237","text":"Antonio Riccianti was an Italian painter of the 17th century.

The hospital was built as a result of the last will and testament of Granville Sharp, the husband of Matilda Lincolne Sharp. Granville Sharp was a successful banker descended from the well-known Sharp family of Romsey, Hampshire, United Kingdom, another member of which was 'Conversation' Sharp.Knapman, David:Conversation Sharp 1759‚Äì1835, the Biography of a London Gentleman in Letters, Prose and Verse. Private Pub.2003.British Library. History Originally from the UK, Granville Sharp and his wife Matilda moved to Hong Kong. Matilda died in 1893, and Granville bequeathed a hospital to be constructed in his wife's memory upon his own death.Michael Ingham. Hong Kong: A Cultural History. p131. Oxford University Press (2007) The hospital admitted its first patients in 1907, at that time providing free care to expatriates. Non-British were barred from The Peak by legislation, and could not benefit from being treated in the hospital. The original building, still in use today, is outstandingly beautiful, as is the hospital's location in The Peak, Hong Kong Island. In the past it was known as the Matilda Memorial & War Hospital, but it has been renamed Matilda International Hospital (MIH), and is a not-for-profit hospital serving all the people of Hong Kong and the wider region. It provides core services, including maternity, orthopaedics and spine, surgical, health assessment and outpatient services. The Matilda Medical Centre (MMC) was opened in the Central area of Hong Kong to mark the hospital's centenary celebration in 2007, and extended its services to Caine Road, Mid-Levels serving a wider public and corporate clients. Joining hands with Asia Medical Specialists, The Matilda Orthopaedic and Spine Centre opened in the year of 2017, with the outpatient clinic at the peak and central. The Hospital used to be surveyed and accredited bi-annually by the Trent Accreditation Scheme of the United Kingdom. In 2010 it adopted the standards of the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS), becoming fully ACHS accredited in December 2010. The hospital has also obtained the ISO 9001:2008 certification, a non-clinically orientated quality management system.

Circle In Amsterdam he associated, on the one hand, with the Collegiants Adam Boreel, and Galenus Abrahamsz, and their sect; and, on the other hand, also with the Portuguese Jews settling there at the time, among them Menasseh ben Israel and Benedictus de Spinoza.van den berg (1977), p. 189.

Popkin (2004), Spinoza, p. 40, states that \\"Serrarius became Spinoza's contact with the outside world,\\" after his excommunication by the Jewish community, and during the period when he lived among the Collegiants in Rijnsburg. He was a correspondent of Samuel Hartlib.van der Wall (1988), pp. 79-81.

Book extract. He corresponded with the Baptist Henry Jessey.van der Wall (1988), p.81, and note 32. Friendship with Benedictus de Spinoza Nadler often mentions Serrarius in his biography of Benedictus de Spinoza.Serrarius was very important to Spinoza because Serrarius brought him into contact with the Amsterdam chiliasts and Quakers as well as with Henry Oldenburg. Serrarius may have known Spinoza from the group of Amsterdam Collegiants and may have introduced him to the Quaker William Ames.Oldenburg may have heard from Serrarius about Spinoza and he visited Spinoza in Rijnsburg in mid-July 1662, which led to a strong friendship.Spinoza Epistolae 1, 2, 6, 13Serrarius had attended chemical experiments of Johannes Glauber in Amsterdam with Franciscus van den Enden, the teacher of Spinoza. Maybe Spinoza was there too. Oldenburg asked Spinoza to send him a copy of his book Renati Descartes principia philosophiae, more geometrico demonstrata via Serrarius. Serrarius acted as postmaster in Amsterdam and courier to England for Spinoza.Spinoza Epistolae 14Later Oldenburg wrote that he had heard from Serrarius that Spinoza was doing well and that he had not forgotten.Spinoza Epistolae 25While Spinoza was in Amsterdam for a few weeks, he spoke to Serrarius.Nadler p. 284, Spinoza Epistolae 25-28Oldenburg expected a package via Serrarius in Amsterdam, and hoped that Spinoza would send a manuscript with his thoughts on the Bible.Spinoza Epistolae 31Serrarius spread among Protestants in Amsterdam the message that Sabbatai Zevi was the Messiah. Controversy Initially an orthodox Calvinist, he had left his church before coming to Amsterdam around 1630. He attacked the views of Moses Amyraut, who had in Du r√®gne de mille ans ou de la Prosp√©rit√© de l'√âglise (1654) taken up a position against the millenarians of the time. Serrarius replied with Assertion du r√®gne de mille ans (1657). He in turn was attacked by Samuel Maresius (Samuel Des Marets), a pupil of Franciscus Gomarus. Maresius attempted to undermine the appeal to the work of Joseph Mede made by Serrarius.Jeffrey K. Jue, Heaven Upon Earth: Joseph Mede (1586-1638) And the Legacy of Millenarianism (2006), p. 233. Serrarius was also one of the loudest critics of Lodewijk Meyer after the anonymous publication of the latter's Philosophia S. Scripturae Interpres, Exercitatio paradoxa (Philosophy interpreting Sacred Scripture, an exercise in paradox) in 1666, which caused a big controversy in Dutch and wider European Reformed circles at the time.* Publications Including * 1653: (in Dutch) Goddelycke aandachten ofte vlammende begeerten, Amsterdam Salomon Savrij, 1653.

Early life and education D√∂pfner grew up in Offenbach am Main. His mother was a housewife and his father Dieter C. D√∂pfner was a university professor of architecture, and director of the Offenbach College of Applied Arts from 1966 to 1970. D√∂pfner studied musicology, German literature and theater science in Frankfurt and Boston. Career D√∂pfner began his career in 1982 as the music critic of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung supplement. After working as the FAZ correspondent in Brussels, D√∂pfner moved to Gruner + Jahr in 1992 ‚Äì initially employed by board member Axel Ganz in Paris, later as assistant to the CEO Gerd Schulte-Hillen. In April 1994, D√∂pfner became editor-in-chief of the Berlin weekly newspaper Wochenpost. In 1996 he took over the post of editor-in-chief of the Hamburg tabloid Hamburger Morgenpost. In March 1998, D√∂pfner became editor-in-chief of Axel Springer SE's national daily newspaper Die Welt. Under his leadership, the content and visual appearance of the paper was fundamentally revised. On February 26, 2008, Axel Springer announced that the Welt Group had generated a profit for the first time.Welt-Gruppe schreibt erstmals schwarze Zahlen, Die Welt, 26 February 2008 D√∂pfner became a member of the management board of Axel Springer SE and head of the newspaper division in 2000. He became CEO in 2002. A defining characteristic of his leadership continues to be a rigorous focus on digital transformation. Since the start of his tenure as CEO, revenues from digital activities increased from ‚Ç¨117m to ‚Ç¨2.5bn. EBITDA from digital went up from ‚Ç¨-12 to ‚Ç¨582m, accounting for 80 percent of the company's EBITDA. Worldwide digital audience expanded to more than 200 million users. In 2020, Friede Springer designated D√∂pfner as her successor as she gifted, sold and transferred the right to vote her stake in the business to him. Under the arrangement, she sold a 4.1% stake to D√∂pfner and gifted 15% more, bringing his direct stake to 22%. She also transferred voting rights her remaining 22% in the business.Klaus Lauer and Douglas Busvine (September 24, 2018), Axel Springer heiress anoints CEO Doepfner to succeed her at German publisher Reuters. Journalistic and publishing activities D√∂pfner regularly speaks out on media and socio-political, economic and cultural issues. Particular attention was given to his debate with Nobel laureate G√ºnter Grass, documented by Der Spiegel (June 2006). D√∂pfner surprised with the confession: \\"I am a non-Jewish Zionist\\". Alongside the topics of threats from Islamic fundamentalism and the image of the United States in Germany, the discussion also focused on the achievements and the failings of the 1968 movement. D√∂pfner published his opinion on the threat from Islamism in his WELT essay \\"The West and the mocking laughter of Islamism\\". In July 2009, ARD TV broadcast D√∂pfner's film \\"My friend George Weidenfeld\\". D√∂pfner sees the film portrait, in which he accompanies Lord Weidenfeld on his travels and at meetings and interviews prominent companions such as Daniel Barenboim, Helmut Kohl, Angela Merkel or Shimon Peres, as \\"a very subjective approach to a great European\\". He has repeatedly commented on the subjects of freedom and digitization, particularly in the fall of 2010 as a visiting professor at the University of Cambridge. Under the title \\"Freedom and the Digital Revolution\\" D√∂pfner held three lectures, which addressed Germans' difficult relationship to freedom, the global erosion of freedom and its causes, and digitization as the fourth major cultural revolution and its impact on the freedom of press, privacy, and journalism as well as in his book \\"Die Freiheitsfalle - The freedom trap\\" published by Propyl√§en Verlag in 2011, in which he focuses on the West's growing tiredness of defending freedom. Taking three watershed events as examples ‚Äì the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nine Eleven and the financial crisis ‚Äì D√∂pfner analyzes the triumphs, threats, and excesses of liberal societies and argues that freedom needs to be fought for, defended and answered for daily, and that democratic societies have not been sufficiently resolute in this regard. They risked falling into the freedom trap and either losing freedom through inaction or betraying it by defending with the wrong means. Alongside the power of freedom in politics and business, D√∂pfner reflects upon the spirit of freedom in music, literature and painting on the basis of three central works by Richard Wagner, Thomas Mann and Gustave Courbet. The book closes with an analysis of the digital world, in which D√∂pfner emphasizes the ambivalence of the Internet as a platform critical of authority at the same time as being a monitoring tool controlled by authority. D√∂pfner's contributions to media policy include keynotes, for example at the NOAH Conference Berlin 2015 or at the SPIEGEL Publishers Forum, the focus of which were the establishment of paid online content and the differentiation between private and public media in digital channels. For the occasion of the centenary of Axel Springer's birth in 2012, D√∂pfner gave his personal view of the founder in his New Year's speech. The \\"Ceremony\\" in May 2012 was a surprise in itself, as D√∂pfner converted the entire event into a tongue-in- cheek and entertaining revue without a single speech. He made his own debut as an actor, reciting a fictitious letter to the publisher wearing a hoodie jacket and jeans. The F.A.Z described the revue as an event, in which \\"pathos, flippancy, understatement and exaggeration, self-righteousness and self-irony were mixed together in a wondrous, sometimes uplifting way, a milestone in the history of the Springer Group.\\" In an open letter to the executive chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, he criticized the search engine company, thus triggering a public debate. In April, 2016, D√∂pfner showed solidarity with the German satirist Jan B√∂hmermann in an open letter.Solidarit√§t mit Jan B√∂hmermann!, Die Welt, in German In his show \\"Neo Magazine Royale\\", B√∂hmermann had previously illustrated the difference between satire and insulting criticism based with a poem about the Turkish President Erdoƒüan, which lead to resentment in the Turkish government as well as public prosecution in Germany (‚Üí B√∂hmermann affair). Erdogan subsequently applied for an injunction against D√∂pfner in May 2016 at a German Court. The request was rejected in the first and second instance. In November 2017, D√∂pfner condemned Kuwait Airlines for barring an Israeli passenger from a flight. A German court ruled in favor of an airline that refused to fly an Israeli passenger ‚Äî and there isn't enough outrage, Business Insider Other activities In 2010, D√∂pfner was visiting professor in media at the University of Cambridge and became a member of St John's College. In addition, he holds a variety of paid and unpaid positions.

Philanthropy In 2007, D√∂pfner bought Villa Sch√∂ningen which is situated right beside Glienicke Bridge with Leonhard Fischer. On the eve of the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, a German-German Museum was opened there on 8 November 2009 by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The privately funded project documents the events at the Bridge of Spies during the Cold War on the ground floor of the permanent exhibition. Temporary exhibitions of contemporary art are shown on the first floor. Among the artists were Andreas Slominski (Summer 2012), Georg Baselitz (\\"The Berlin Years\\", Spring 2012), Andy Warhol (\\"Early Works\\", Spring 2011), Anselm Kiefer (\\"Europe\\", Autumn 2010), Martin Kippenberger (Summer 2010) and Olaf Metzel (2014).

The F-104S also served in the Turkish Air Force until the mid-1990s. The F-104S was the final development of the Starfighter line. Derived from Lockheed's design studies on a \\"Super Starfighter\\", the F-104S was one of the most capable of the F-104 series, and destined to be the last in service worldwide. The F-104S (upgraded to ASA/M standard) was retired from service in October 2004. Design and development F-104S in original camouflage scheme with Sparrow missiles mounted under the wings, around 1969. The F-104 series had entered a second development phase with the F-104G (for Germany, lead country for this version). While the USAF had no more interest in the F-104, Lockheed proposed the Model CL-901 featuring the new J79-GE-19 engine and the improved Sparrow III.Niccoli 2005, p. 4. Further proposed developments included the CL-958 with larger wings, the CL-981 with retractable canard wings behind the cockpit, and the CL-984 optimised for low-level strike missions. An RF-104G was modified and flew in December 1966 as the prototype CL-901 \\"Super Starfighter\\". Externally, the new type had slightly larger air intakes and steel inlet guide vanes that allowed an increase in operating temperature from , enabling a maximum speed of Mach 2.2. During the first five years in Italian service, 23 F-104G aircraft were lost; as only 80 to 90 F-104s (of 149 acquired) were operational at best, it was decided to purchase a new interceptor and fighter- bomber to reinforce front-line units. The AMI mid-1960s \\"AW-X\\" (All-Weather- eXperimental) requirement for a new all-weather fighter aircraft led to an evaluation of many available types: the McDonnell Douglas F-4B/C Phantom, Dassault Mirage IIIC-1, BAC Lightning, and North American F-100S Super Sabre among others. The eventual choice was the Lockheed CL-980 (a simplified version with the same wings of the projected Model CL-901). On 26 January 1966, the AMI chose the definitive F-104S as their future fighter. The first F-104S was actually a modified Fiat-built F-104G, MM6658, that acted as an aerodynamic prototype and first flew on 22 December 1966, while a second prototype, MM6660, fitted with new avionics systems closer to the final configuration, flew on 28 February 1967.Pace 1992, p. 88. MM.6701, the first production F-104S built by Aeritalia flew on 30 December 1968. The F-104S was designed to carry AIM-7 Sparrow missiles (while deleting the Vulcan gun). In the attack role, the F-104S had nine hardpoints, and could carry up to seven or bombs, an improvement over the F-104G, which could lift only half that on five hardpoints, two of which were needed for auxiliary tanks. Theoretically, an F-104S could be equipped with four or five bombs, two droptanks, and two AIM-9s, becoming a dual-role aircraft. The new type entered service in mid-1969, with 22¬∞ Gruppo (51¬∞ Stormo);\\"F-104 ASA-M, Il Portale dell'Aeronautica Militare Italiana (in Italian).\\" aeronautica. Retrieved: 6 October 2007. and in that year, the F-104S accumulated 460 flying hours. The AMI bought 205 examples, all delivered from 1969 to 1979,Michell 1994, p. 118. with the 100th aircraft delivered in January 1973, and the 200th in May 1976. The model was built in two versions; as an interceptor armed with AIM-7 Sparrow missiles (the M61 Vulcan being removed); and as a fighter bomber, with the gun retained and bombs and other air-to-surface ordnance. The models were interchangeable, making it unclear how many were built or rebuilt to these specifications. Operational history=Italian service AMI squadrons equipped with the F-104G and S versions were: 9, 10, 12, 18 (initially for reconnaissance, then dual-role), 20 (training), 21, 22, 23, 28 (reconnaissance), 132 (reconnaissance) 102, 154, 155, and 156 (bombers). MM.6945, the first F-104ASA, with low-visibility colours (not adopted in AMI Service). The J79-GE-19 allowed a faster climb, comparable with contemporary fighters (up to , with a time-to-climb of 80 seconds claimed; ten seconds less than the F-104G), with the capability of reaching Mach 2 at in around five minutes. Napoleone Bragagnolo, a test pilot for Aeritalia, was able to land at Ciampino, Rome, 19 minutes and 30 seconds after taking off from Turin in northern Italy. During this flight with two wingtip auxiliary tanks, he climbed and accelerated to Mach 2\\\\. The aircraft still had of fuel on board when it landed; enough to reach Palermo, Sicily at subsonic speeds. The average speed for the flight was Mach 1.5. Even with these new Starfighters, the loss rate remained high, with peaks in 1973 and 1975 (ten F-104s of all versions were lost in AMI service during this period). Up to 1997, Italy had lost 137 (38%) of its F-104s in 928,000 flying hours (14.7 aircraft every 100,000 hours). Despite a drop in the loss rate in the 1980s (with 33 losses between 1981 and 1990 included), the debate about the reliability of this aircraft was often fierce in the mass media. In the 1980s the loss rate dropped, even more so in the 1990s, when all the old versions (except TF-104s) were scrapped. The last Italian F-104 was withdrawn from front line in 2004, after the type had flown around a million flying hours in a total of over 40 years of service. Four F-104s (2 TF-104M and 2 f-104ASAM) were flown by the Italian Air Force Test Center until July 2005. The last F-104's military flight was in Pratica di Mare on July 27. Turkish service Turkey was the only other customer for the Aeritalia F-104S. The initial order was placed in 1974, with the first of 18 examples entering service by December 1974. These first aircraft were a gift from Libya to Turkey during US embargo against 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus. These may have been a reward for good relations and Turkish technical assistance to improve the capabilities of the Libyan Air Force.Fricker and Jackson 1996, p. 98. Another 18 were ordered in May 1975, which eventually increased to 40 aircraft, but another batch (for 20 aircraft) was dropped, probably because F-4E's were delivered as well. They served with 142 and 182 Filo from the 1970s, and around a dozen were still in service until the mid-1990s. While 200 Selenia AIM-7 missiles were delivered, Turkish F-104Ss were seldom seen carrying them, thus F-4E's were probably the main users of those missiles. Mid-life updates F-104S on display at Lignano Sabbiadoro, in north-eastern Italy Two further update programs were carried out prior to the introduction into AMI service of the Eurofighter Typhoon, resulting in the F-104S-ASA and F-104S-ASA/M. =F-104S-ASA= The F-104ASA (Aggiornamento Sistemi d'Arma, Weapon Systems Update), developed in 1986, introduced a Fiar Setter radar, with 'look-down' capability and compatibility with the Selenia Aspide missile. AIM-9Ls were then used as the main armament, replacing the previous \\"B\\" and \\"F\\" version of this missile, while the older AIM-7s were retained. One AIM-7 was usually carried under each wing. In total, 147 of the F-104S airframes were converted to ASA standard at an expense of around 600 billion lire, the last ASA model was delivered in the early 1990s. =F-104S-ASA/M= The ASA/M upgrade (initially known as the 'ECO' (Estensione Capacit√† Operative) upgrade) focused on improving reliability rather than combat enhancements, and involved 49 ASA aircraft. 15 TF-104Gs were also involved in this program . Variants A formation of Italian F-104Ss ;F-104S (Lockheed Model CL-901): 246 aircraft produced mainly by Fiat and Aeritalia (one aircraft was lost before delivery), upgraded for the interception role having NASARR R-21G/H radar with moving target indicator and continuous wave illuminator for semi-active radar homing missiles (initially AIM-7 Sparrow), two additional wing and two underbelly hardpoints (to give a total of nine), uprated J79-GE-19 engine with 52.8 kN (11,870 lbf) thrust (79.6 kN/17,900 lbf with afterburner), and two additional ventral fins for increased stability at high Mach numbers. The 20 mm (.79 in) M61 cannon was sacrificed to make room for the missile avionics, the cannon was always fitted to fighter-bomber variants. Up to two Sparrow; and two, theoretically four or six, Sidewinder missiles were carried on all the hardpoints except the central (underbelly), or seven 340 kg (750 lb) bombs (normally, two-four 227‚Äì340 kg/500-750 lb). Range was up to 1,250 km (777 mi) with four tanks, ferry range 2,940 km (1,827 mi).Sgarlato 2004 ;F-104S-ASA: (Aggiornamento Sistemi d'Arma - \\"Weapon Systems Update\\") - An upgraded Italian version, with 147 modified from existing airframes, upgraded with Fiat R21G/M1 radar with frequency hopping, look-down/shoot-down capability, new IFF and weapons delivery computer, and provision for AIM-9L all-aspect Sidewinder and Selenia Aspide missiles. Due to the delays of Aspide integration, it was also called the ASA-1 with Sparrows, and ASA-2 when the Aspide became available, and eventually all F-104Ss were upgraded to ASA-2 standard. The fighter-bombers had no substantial improvements in the \\"ASA\\" version, and were later modified to interceptor standards (CI) without the M61. ;F-104S-ASA/M: (Aggiornamento Sistemi d'Arma/Modificato - \\"Weapon Systems Update/Modified\\") - 49 F-104S-ASA and 15 two-seat TF-104G aircraft were upgraded from 1998 to ASA/M standard with GPS, new TACAN and Litton LN-30A2 inertial navigation system, refurbished airframe, and improved cockpit displays. All strike-related equipment was removed, and the IRST as well (the small unit known as 'IR-Sight', forward the windshield). The last Starfighters in combat service, they were withdrawn in October 2004 (the last unit was 10¬∞ Gruppo/9¬∞ Stormo, Grazzanise), and temporarily replaced by the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, while awaiting Eurofighter Typhoon deliveries.

In general, when we define metric space the distance function is taken to be a real-valued function. The real numbers form an ordered field which is Archimedean and order complete. These metric spaces have some nice properties like: in a metric space compactness, sequential compactness and countable compactness are equivalent etc. These properties may not, however, hold so easily if the distance function is taken in an arbitrary ordered field, instead of in \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbb R. Preliminary definition Let (F,+,\\\\cdot,<) be an arbitrary ordered field, and M a nonempty set; a function d :M\\\\times M\\\\to F^+\\\\cup{0} is called a metric on M, iff the following conditions hold: # d(x,y)=0\\\\Leftrightarrow x=y; # d(x,y)=d(y,x), commutativity; # d(x,y)+d(y,z)\\\\geq d(x,z), triangle inequality. It is not difficult to verify that the open balls B(x,\\\\delta)\\\\;:={y\\\\in M\\\\;:d(x,y)<\\\\delta} form a basis for a suitable topology, the latter called the metric topology on M, with the metric in F. In view of the fact that F in its order topology is monotonically normal, we would expect M to be at least regular.  Further properties  However, under axiom of choice, every general metric is monotonically normal, for, given x\\\\in G, where G is open, there is an open ball B(x,\\\\delta) such that x\\\\in B(x,\\\\delta)\\\\subseteq G. Take \\\\mu(x,G)=B(x,\\\\delta/2). Verify the conditions for Monotone Normality. The matter of wonder is that, even without choice, general metrics are monotonically normal. proof. Case I: F is an Archimedean field. Now, if x in G, G open, we may take \\\\mu(x,G):= B(x,1/2n(x,G)), where n(x,G):= \\\\min{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N:B(x,1/n)\\\\subseteq G}, and the trick is done without choice. Case II: F is a non-Archimedean field. For given x\\\\in G where G is open, consider the set A(x,G):={a\\\\in F\\\\colon \\\\forall n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N,B(x,n\\\\cdot a)\\\\subseteq G}. The set A(x, G) is non-empty. For, as G is open, there is an open ball B(x, k) within G. Now, as F is non-Archimdedean, \\\\mathbb N_F is not bounded above, hence there is some \\\\xi\\\\in F with \\\\forall n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N\\\\colon n\\\\cdot 1\\\\le\\\\xi. Putting a=k\\\\cdot (2\\\\xi)^{-1}, we see that a is in A(x, G). Now define \\\\mu(x,G)=\\\\bigcup{B(x,a)\\\\colon a\\\\in A(x,G)}. We would show that with respect to this mu operator, the space is monotonically normal. Note that \\\\mu(x,G)\\\\subseteq G. If y is not in G(open set containing x) and x is not in H(open set containing y), then we'd show that \\\\mu(x,G)\\\\cap\\\\mu(y,H) is empty. If not, say z is in the intersection. Then : \\\\exists a\\\\in A(x,G)\\\\colon d(x,z). From the above, we get that d(x,y)\\\\le d(x,z)+d(z,y)<2\\\\cdot\\\\max{a,b}, which is impossible since this would imply that either y belongs to \\\\mu(x,G)\\\\subseteq G or x belongs to \\\\mu(y,H)\\\\subseteq H.

It was primarily developed in the early 1990s by Dr. Amano Atsushi. Historically, during bypass surgeries, the heart is stopped and a heart-lung machine takes over the work of the heart and lungs. When a cardiac surgeon chooses to perform the CABG procedure off-pump, also known as OPCAB (Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass), the heart is still beating while the graft attachments are made to bypass a blockage. Off-pump coronary artery bypass was developed partly to avoid the complications of cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery. The medical community believes cardiopulmonary bypass causes a post- operative cognitive decline known as postperfusion syndrome (informally called \\"pumphead\\"), but research has shown no long-term difference between on and off pump coronary artery bypassPostperfusion syndrome in patients of lower risk. This is probably because the pump is not the main cause of brain damage, rather it is the embolic process described below. Sometimes the fatty type materials that collects to form a blockage or line on the walls of an artery may break loose during CABG procedure manipulation. This debris can result in clots, or ‚Äúemboli‚Äù, that may interrupt the flow of blood to the brain, causing neurological damage or even stroke. Data analysis from beating heart surgery patients shows a significant reduction in the release of this debris with correspondingly lower stroke rates. The fatty emboli which cause brain damage are generated when the large artery from the heart (aorta) is manipulated and although these are reduced in most off-pump coronary bypass surgeries they are not eliminated because the aorta is still used as a site to attach some of the grafts. A growing number of OPCAB surgeons, however, are avoiding the aorta completely, known as \\"anaortic\\" or no-touch coronary bypass surgery, by taking all their grafts from sites other than the aorta (e.g. the internal mammary arteries.). This results in a very low risk of stroke, actually less than occurs during percutaneous coronary intervention. In addition to off-pump surgery being associated with the clinical benefits of a reduced risk of stroke or memory problems, patients also typically have a faster recovery and shorter hospital stay, fewer blood transfusions, and fewer unwanted inflammatory/immune response issues. Off-pump surgery can be more technically challenging. The technique has a steep learning curve, but with adequate training and experience, the quality of the anastomoses has been shown to be similar to on-pump results in surgeons with comparable experience On February 18, 2012, Amano Atsushi performed a successful off-pump coronary artery bypass operation on Emperor Akihito.http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201205230073 See also *Cardiac surgeon *Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) *Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery (MIDCAB) *Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a.k.a. angioplasty ReferencesExternal links *Myocardial Revascularization without Cardiopulmonary Bypass chapter by Todd M.

Swan served in the Confederate States Congress during the American Civil War, and served one term as mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee, from 1855 until late 1856. He also helped establish the town of East Knoxville (later annexed by Knoxville), and served as its first mayor in the late 1850s.John Wooldridge, George Mellen, William Rule (ed.), Standard History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company, 1900; reprinted by Kessinger Books, 2010), pp. 104, 138, 328. In 1854, Swan and his brother-in-law, Joseph Mabry, donated the initial land for the formation of Market Square in downtown Knoxville. Biography=Early life Swan's early life is obscure, but he was likely born in East Tennessee or Alabama. He graduated from East Tennessee College (now the University of Tennessee) in 1838, and studied law afterward. By 1843, he had a law office on Gay Street in Knoxville, and he attended courts in Knox, Anderson, Roane, Campbell, and Claiborne counties. He served as Attorney General of Tennessee 1851 until 1853. 1850s Throughout the early 1850s, Swan speculated in land along the periphery of Knoxville, especially in what is now East Knoxville, which he helped develop. In 1854, he and Mabry purchased several acres of land then located north of Knoxville (the boundary at the time being Union Avenue). They donated a portion of this land to the city for creation of a Market House, laying the foundation for what is now Market Square. That same year, Swan and William Montgomery Churchwell founded the Knoxville Gas Light Company, which installed the first gas lights on Gay Street. Swan was elected Mayor of Knoxville in 1854, succeeding James C. Luttrell, and served in this capacity from 1855 through most of 1856. He made a number of progressive proposals, including the construction of a tunnel to allow development over the railroad, and the digging of a canal between First Creek and Second Creek to give factories navigable access to the Tennessee River (both proposals were rejected). A measure was also passed during Swan's tenure that attempted to rein in the city's growing number of noisy saloons by giving the city recorder the authority to close saloons for an indefinite period of time. In 1855, Swan met John Mitchel, an Irish nationalist visiting in Knoxville while in exile. Swan and Mitchel established a radical newspaper, the Southern Citizen, in 1857. This newspaper defended the South and the practice of slavery, and went so far as to call for the reopening of the Atlantic slave trade. In 1856, Swan was elected the first mayor of East Knoxville, which he had helped incorporate the previous year. Swan served as the new city's mayor until 1859. East Knoxville was annexed by Knoxville in 1868. Civil War In the years leading up the Civil War, Swan was a staunch secessionist. Radical pro-Unionist William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, whose Knoxville Whig had been quarreling with the Knoxville Register (which was co- owned by Swan) since the early 1850s, stepped up his attacks on Swan, calling him an unprincipled politician who had defected to the Democratic Party only after being snubbed by the Whigs.Robert McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 46, 88, 107. When Brownlow was arrested by Confederate authorities in late 1861, Swan wrote a letter to Jefferson Davis demanding that Brownlow be hanged. Swan was elected to the First Confederate Congress in November 1861, having easily defeated Knoxville attorney John Baxter, and was reelected in 1863. As a congressman, Swan proposed high import taxes on European nations that refused to recognize the Confederacy, rejected federal taxation, and rejected the arming of slaves. In 1864, Swan made national headlines when he attacked fellow Tennessee congressman Henry S. Foote, who had criticized Swan's friend, John Mitchel.Collision Between Rebel Congressmen, Sacramento Daily Union, December 27, 1864. Retrieved: October 14, 2010. Crudely scanned text. After the war, Swan settled in Memphis, Tennessee, where he practiced law. He died of consumption on April 12, 1869, and was interred in Elmwood Cemetery the same day.

History In or around 1007, Emperor Henry II moved St. George's Abbey from its former location on the Hohentwiel in Singen to Stein am Rhein -- at that time, little more than a small fishing village on the Rhine. The move was a means to strengthen his presence at this strategic point, where major roads and river routes intersected. He gave the abbots extensive rights over Stein and its trade so that they could develop it commercially. In this, they were very successful and Stein am Rhein rapidly became a flourishing and prosperous town which, in the 15th century, was itself (if briefly) granted reichsfrei status. The abbey also prospered and, in the 15th century, completely rebuilt its premises, which remain a significant example of late Gothic architecture in the region. The last and greatest abbot, David von Winkelsheim, who came to power in 1499, completed the building works and added a spectacular suite of Renaissance frescoes that are among the earliest known in northern Europe. Under the Reformation however, the abbey was secularised and its assets taken over by Z√ºrich. Abbot von Winkelsheim negotiated a settlement with the Z√ºrich authorities, whereby, although control of the abbey was handed over to them, he and the remaining monks would be allowed to remain on the premises until their deaths. Z√ºrich however, suspected the abbot of collusion with the Habsburgs and locked him up in his new rooms. He was able to escape to Radolfzell, but died shortly after, in 1526.Winkel municipal website The Gottfried Keller Foundation aims the acquisition of major works from Switzerland and abroad, to entrust them as loans to Swiss museums or to return them to their original locations. Among other, the foundation acquired the St. Georgen Abbey. The collection comprises more than 8,500 paintings, sculptures and other art objects in around 110 museums respectively locations in Switzerland. Buildings Church plan The buildings remained unharmed until the 19th century, when they were used by their owners for a number of industrial purposes, during which they suffered considerable damage. A Protestant pastor acquired them, and left them in trust for the community, thus saving them. Since 1945, they have accommodated a museum. The banqueting hall, or Festsaal, containing the frescoes commissioned by David von Winkelsheim, and the cloisters are of especial interest in a building complex. The abbey church, which dates predominantly from the 12th century, has also survived intact, and is now the (Protestant) parish church.

The species is distinguished from other Lynceidae members because the males have a pair of large claspers, with the right clasper being larger than the left. There are no growth marks on the carapace, as in other clam shrimp. Graceful clam shrimp swim upside down or on their side, using legs and antennae for backward propulsion.

He entered the Royal Navy by competitive examination as master's assistant in 1854 and served in the Baltic during the Crimean war. In 1860 he was promoted second master and commenced surveying in the Rifleman Reed, during which time he commanded the tender Saracen for three years.The Admiralty Hydrographic Service, 1795-1919 By Sir Archibald Day, Dawson, Llewellyn Stiles, Great Britain.

Towards the end of 1872 Tizard transferred to . The appointment opened to him the greatest opportunity of his life in bringing him into contact with the leaders of the science of oceanography. The Challenger expedition resulted in a vast increase of knowledge of the physical condition of the oceans and of the distribution of marine life, and in the progressive improvement of apparatus and methods of research. Tizard remained with the Challenger until she paid off in 1876, and spent the next three years at the Admiralty writing the narrative of the voyage in association with Sir John Murray. In 1879 Tizard resumed surveying duties afloat, and took charge of the Home survey. During the nine years that he held this command he wrote many papers of scientific value and interest. Among these may be mentioned a report on deep-sea exploration in the Faroe Channel (Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xxxv, 1883, and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xi, 1882); lectures on Marine Surveying and Hydrographic Surveying (Professional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers, 1885 and 1890), and an article on the ‚ÄòThames Estuary‚Äô (Nature, 1890) which is of great permanent value. He was promoted to staff captain in 1889, and in 1891 was appointed assistant hydrographer of the navy, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Overview Tetsuko no Tabi is a non-fiction series. It is inspired on the book Getting On and Off of JR‚Äôs 4600 Stations by Hirohiko Yokomi, published in 1998, which chronicles his experience visiting all of Japan rail‚Äôs train stations.

In accordance with Title VIII of the Constitution, the federal legislative power, which consists of the King and the bicameral Federal Parliament, has the right to declare that there are reasons to amend the constitutional provisions it determines. This is done by means of two Declarations of Revision of the Constitution, one adopted by the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, and one signed by the King and the Federal Government. Following this declaration, the Federal Parliament is automatically dissolved and a new federal election must take place. This makes it impossible to amend the Constitution unless an election has intervened. Following the election, the new Federal Parliament can amend those provisions that have been declared revisable. Only the articles of the Constitution listed in both declarations are revisable. The first such declaration was made in 1892, triggering the 1892 elections, and the second one in 1919. In recent decades however, such declaration has become a regular way to call elections: all national/federal elections since 1985 have been called by declaration of revision of the Constitution.

Early life and education He was born in 1928 to an Irish- Catholic family from Brooklyn. He and his brother Gerald attended Xavier High School, an elite Jesuit College Preparatory High School, in Manhattan, where he was on the basketball team. He graduated from there in 1950 and then entered the Society of Jesus. He attended Bellarmine College, was ordained at Fordham University, and received a doctorate in education from Harvard University. Career At the seminary, he first became interested in media studies. Later, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, his dissertation was a curriculum to study film. There, he also met Marshall McLuhan; they became lifelong colleagues because of their mutual interest in mass media and its effect on society. McLuhan appointed Culkin to a position at the University of Toronto. In 1964, Culkin came to Fordham University, convinced them to hire McLuhan for a year, and earned a reputation as an intellectual for his interest in media studies.John M. Culkin, obituary in Variety Magazine, July 28, 1993 In 1969, Culkin left the Jesuit priesthood and formed the Center for Understanding Media, named after a McLuhan book. He started a master's program through the center to study media, which was initially at Antioch College and subsequently moved to the New School for Social Research, where he remained until 1978. There, his Center for Understanding Media administered the film portion of the Artists in Schools program of the National Endowment for the Arts and created a forum for filmmakers in the education field to preview important films, the Metropolitan Area Film Instructors Association. Culkin advocated media studies in public school systems. He observed that children watch television thousands for more hours than they study.Why Study the Media? Culkin, John M., SJ Introduction to his doctoral dissertation, \\"Film Study in the High School: An Analysis and Rationale,\\" Harvard Graduate School of Education, 1964 Culkin knew that films, radio, and TV profoundly affect young people. He believed that even young children should be taught to analyze mass media, new means of communication should enhance education, and programming quality should be improved and focused on childhood development. He came to believe that children should examine the arts as experience, to develop their own positive value system.John Culkin, SJ: The Man Who Invented Media Literacy .

In medieval central Europe, annual cattle drives brought Hungarian Grey cattle across the Danube River to the beef markets of Western Europe.Longhorns at Home on Hungarian Range. Los Angeles Times. April 06, 2003. In the 16th century the Swiss operated cattle drives over the St. Gotthard Pass to the markets in Bellinzona and Lugano and into Lombardy in northern Italy. The drives had ended by 1700 when sedentary dairy farming proved more profitable. Australia Australia is noted for long drives. Patsy Durack, for instance, left Queensland for the Kimberley in Western Australia in 1885 with 8,000 cattle, arriving with only half that number some two years and two months later, completing a drive of some 3,000 miles. Indeed, long cattle drives continued well into the latter half of the twentieth century.\\"The Americanisation of the Outback: Cowboys and Stockmen\\", questia.com. login required. On March 26, 1883 two Scottish/Australian families, the MacDonalds and the McKenzies, began a huge cattle drive from Clifford's Creek near Goulburn, New South Wales to the Kimberley, where they established \\"Fossil Downs\\" station. The journey of over 6,000 km lasted more than three years and involved Charles ('Charlie') MacDonald (1851‚Äì1903) and William Neil ('Willie') MacDonald (1860‚Äì1910), sons of Donald MacDonald from Broadford on the Isle of Skye (who had sailed from Scotland in the 1830s). The family moved to Clifford's Creek, Laggan, and the brothers had become expert bushmen. The cattle drive was undertaken after Donald MacDonald heard glowing reports of the Kimberley from Scots/Australian explorer Alexander Forrest in 1879. The MacDonalds and the McKenzies formed a joint venture to obtain leases in the Kimberley and to stock them by overlanding the cattle. The brothers were joined by their cousins Alexander and Donald MacKenzie, Peter Thomson, James McGeorge and Jasper Pickles. They set out with 670 cattle, 32 bullocks yoked to two wagons and 86 horses. All foodstuffs and equipment for the long journey were carried in the wagons. Drought conditions delayed progress and most of the original party, apart from Charlie and Willie MacDonald, withdrew long before Cooper's Creek was reached. Stock losses were replaced, only to be reduced again by the continued drought. Despite a grueling journey through crocodile- and mosquito-infested territory in the top end with frequent Aboriginal attacks, the cattle eventually arrived at the junction of the Margaret and Fitzroy Rivers in July 1886 and \\"Fossil Downs\\" station was established. It is the longest cattle drive in history.McKenzie, Keith. They Paved the Way, Mudgee Guardian, NSW,(1980), pp79-92, McDonald, Nan.

Cattle drives were at one time a major economic activity in the American West, particularly between the years 1866-1895, when 10 million cattle were herded from Texas to railheads in Kansas for shipments to stockyards in Chicago and points east. Drives usually took place in Texas on the Goodnight-Loving Trail (1866), Potter-Bacon trail (1883), Western trail (1874), Chisholm Trail (1867) and Shawnee Trail (1840s). Due to the extensive treatment of cattle drives in fiction and film, the cowboy tending to a herd of cattle has become the worldwide iconic image of the American West.

Albright made great strides and contributions to the understanding of disorders associated with calcium and phosphate abnormalities in the body. He also was a published author and in his books he detailed his findings. Early life  Albright was born on January 12, 1900, in Buffalo, New York. He was the third child of John J. Albright, a prominent businessman and philanthropist who constructed the Albright Art Gallery in Buffalo, and Susan Fuller, a Smith College graduate who was Albright's second wife. John J. Albright had three children from his first marriage and six from his marriage to Fuller. His maternal grandparents were Eben and Nancy Fuller, of Lancaster, Massachusetts. His paternal grandparents were Joseph Jacob and Elizabeth S. Albright, both from Pennsylvania. The family was descended from Andrew Albright, a gunsmith who supplied arms to the troops of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, who had come to America in 1750. Joseph was a coal agent for Delaware and Hudson Canal Company and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and eventually, President of the First National Bank. Education Albright entered Harvard College at the age of seventeen. After graduating cum laude three years later he entered Harvard Medical School in the Fall of 1920. While he initially took an interest in obstetrics and orthopedic surgery, the discovery of insulin attracted him to internal medicine, specifically the study of metabolism. After his internship at Massachusetts General Hospital he embarked on a one-year programme of research with Joseph Charles Aub, mainly into calcium metabolism and lead poisoning. He was subsequently assistant resident to Dr. Warfield Longcope at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and School of Medicine in Baltimore, where he performed numerous experiments (often without realizing their significance) together with his friend John Eager Howard. Finally, he spent a year in Vienna with pathologist Prof. Jakob Erdheim. Career In the early 1930s he returned to Boston, where he became a member of the staff of Massachusetts General Hospital \\"MGH\\". At MGH, he rapidly developed an endocrinology research group. Albright is credited with numerous discoveries in medicine. He described polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (a version of this disease with an endocrine component was later eponymically called McCune-Albright syndrome), the clinical and pathological features and different types of hyperparathyroidism (excessive production of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands), the mechanism of Cushing's syndrome, and renal tubular acidosis (inability of the kidneys to regulate the acid-base balance in the body), and recognised the importance of menopause on osteoporosis. He also delineated forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Appointments and honors In 1941 Albright was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation (1943‚Äì1944), the Association for the Study of Internal Secretions (1945‚Äì1946) and the Endocrine Society (1946‚Äì1947). In 1955 he was elected to the National Academy of the Sciences. Since 1981, the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research has every year given the Fuller Albright Award in recognition of meritorious scientific accomplishment in the field of bone and mineral research. *Roche-Organnon Award in Endocrinology (1947) *American College of Physicians Award for Achievement in Internal Medicine (1947) *Borden Award, Association of American Medical Colleges, for \\"extraordinarily original and monumental contributions to the understanding of metabolism of bone and other tissues.\\" (1949) *The Joseph Goldberger Award of the American Medical Association's Council on Foods and Nutrition (1951) *Doctorate of Science, Harvard University (1955) *Citation, Massachusetts General Hospital, for being one of the 15 outstanding physicians who had received early training at the hospital (1961) Personal life In 1930, he met Claire Birge (1906-1990) of Greenwich, Connecticut, daughter of Walter William Birge and Mabelle Clair Brown, and by 1933, they were married. As a wedding present, Albright's father bought them a house in Brookline, Massachusetts next door to conductor Serge Koussevitzky. Together, they had two sons: * Read Albright (1939-2011), who married Jo Anne Pierson * Birge Albright, who married Carol Bonomo (b. 1938), an author Albright developed Parkinson's disease in 1937. By 1956 his symptoms were so intractable that he underwent experimental brain surgery, chemical pallidotomy (obliteration of the globus pallidus by injection of alcohol). The intervention on the right was a success, but the left-sided procedure was complicated by haemorrhage, which left him aphasic and comatose for the remaining 13 years of his life, during which he was nursed at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Rifai received another scholarship, this time to the University of Bristol in the UK after the 1958 revolution which brought down the Iraqi Monarchy at the time. Once again graduating with honors after four years, he returned again to the National Telephone Company in Baghdad. Another scholarship came subsequently, this time to Purdue University in Indiana, United States. There Rashid graduated earned his M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with honors which culminated in yet another scholarship at Rice University in Houston, Texas, this time earning him a Ph.D. in the same subject. Death Rashid al-Rifai died on the evening of 3 September 2009 at his home in Amman, Jordan.

Background  The initiative, No. 07-0032, was proposed by a group called Californians for Equal Representation,Petition to the Office of the Attorney General, July 17, 2007. Retrieved on September 23, 2007. originally for placement on California's June 3, 2008, primary election ballot. The group's address was apparently the offices of Bell, McAndrews & Hiltachk, a law firm that also has represented the California Republican Party in some matters,Hendrik Hertzberg, \\"Votescam.\\" New Yorker, August 6, 2007.Terry Heath, \\"GOP secretly behind proposal to change California electoral disbursement solely to benefit its 2008 presidential candidate.\\" Online Journal, August 31, 2007 and whose senior partner, Charles H. Bell Jr., serves as General Counsel to the California Republican Party. \\"Website of Bell, McAndrews & Hiltachk, LLP\\" The initiative's sponsors sought to change the way California's presidential electoral votes are distributed. Currently, as in most states, California's votes in the electoral college are distributed in a winner-take-all manner; whichever presidential candidate wins the state's popular vote wins all 55 of the state's electoral votes. Under Initiative No. 07-0032, the state's electoral votes would instead have been awarded by Congressional district; the candidate who won a Congressional district's popular vote for president would have won an electoral vote representing that district, and the winner of the most electoral votes statewide would have won an additional two votes.Legislative Analyst's Office. Retrieved September 23, 2007. The proposed referendum's scheme is known as the District Method (a.k.a. the Maine-Nebraska Method), which describes the process by which voters in each of the state's congressional districts select a single elector, with the two remaining electors being selected by the aggregate popular vote of the entire state.CRS Report: RL30804 - The Electoral College: An Overview and Analysis of Reform Proposals - NLE Under the District Method, a State's electoral votes can be split among two or more candidates, just as a state's congressional delegation can be split among multiple political parties. As of 2008, Nebraska and Maine are the only states using the District Method of distributing electoral votes. Maine started using the method with the 1972 presidential elections and Nebraska started using the method during the election of 1992.Methods of Choosing Presidential Electors\\"Nebraska's Vote Change.\\" (April 7, 1991) The Washington Post The 2008 presidential elections was the first time Nebraska did not award all its electoral votes to a single candidate since switching to the District Method, as Barack Obama won the popular vote within the 2nd congressional district. Donald Trump carried the second Congressional District of Maine in the 2016 election, to date the only time Maine has split its electoral votes.  Controversy = Alleged partisan motivation  Several commentators criticized the proposed initiative, claiming that it was simply an attempt by some Republicans to award the Republican presidential nominee more votes than that nominee would receive under a winner-take-all system.See, e.g., Vikram David Amar, \\"The So-Called Presidential Election Reform Act: A Clear Abuse of California's Initiative Process,\\" Findlaw.com, August 17, 2007; Doug Kendall, \\"The Legislature Thereof: California voters can't change the 2008 election rules on their own,\\" Slate.com, September 13, 2007. The Democratic presidential candidate has won California's popular vote in every presidential election since 1992.Terry Heath, \\"GOP secretly behind proposal to change California electoral disbursement solely to benefit its 2008 presidential candidate.\\" Online Journal, August 31, 2007. Had the Presidential Election Reform Act been in effect during the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush would have won 22 of the state's electoral votes instead of 0, and John Kerry would have won only 33 of the state's votes instead of all 55 votes and would have lost the electoral college vote even if he had carried Ohio. Possible unconstitutionality Some commentators also argued that the initiative violated Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Under Article II, a state's electoral votes must be appointed \\"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.\\" Because the Presidential Election Reform Act would have appointed the state's electoral votes in a manner directed by popular initiative instead of in a manner directed by the California legislature, the act would arguably have violated Article II, Section 1, Clause 2. This legal issue is addressed in Section 8.3 of the book Every Vote Equal, which notes that \\"Legislature\\" is used with two distinct meanings in the U.S. Constitution: either to each state's actual Legislature, or to the state's lawmaking process.Every Vote Equal: A State- Based Plan For Electing The President By National Popular Vote, Section 8.3. Outcome Efforts to get the initiative on the ballot in time for the 2008 election failed. The initiative first appeared to be dead in September 2007.Dan Morain, \\"GOP electoral initiative dealt major blows,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 28, 2007; Carla Marinucci, \\"GOP-backed bid to reform California's electoral process collapsing,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, September 28, 2007.

But on December 6, 2007, the initiative's backers said that the measure would not appear on the June 2008 ballot due to lack of funds and insufficient time. The group then attempted to get the initiative onto the November 2008 ballot, which meant that even if the initiative had passed, there would have probably been a court challenge to determine if the act could have gone into effect for the 2008 presidential election held on the same day.Dan Morain, \\"Electoral vote measure fails to make June ballot,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 7, 2007. The deadline to file signatures was February 4, 2008, but no signatures were filed by that date; therefore, the initiative did not appear on the ballot in 2008.Steven Maviglio, \\"CMR Exclusive: Electoral College Initiative -- Dead (Again),\\" February 5, 2008; Shane Goldmacher, \\"Electoral college measure falls short,\\" February 5, 2008.

Early career In the 1970s, Baby Dee began her musical career as a street performer, but soon decided to take work as an organist at a Catholic church in the Bronx. Ten years later, after Dee had begun her transition into life as a woman, she left her job at the church and returned to her earlier occupation as a performance artist. She performed as an accordion-playing bilateral hermaphrodite in Coney Island leading to a stint as the bandleader for the Bindlestiff Family Cirkus. She also became known for a street act in which she played harp atop a high-rise tricycle in Manhattan. In the 90s, Baby Dee met fellow transgender musician and performance artist Anohni. The two became friends, and Hegarty later invited Dee to perform harp on her 1998 debut album, Antony and the Johnsons. During this time, Dee returned to her childhood home in Cleveland and took up work as a tree surgeon. Never having envisioned herself as a recording artist, Dee gave Hegarty songs she had written in hopes that she would perform them. Hegarty, instead, sent them to her friend David Tibet, founder of the music group Current 93. Tibet contacted Dee encouraging her to record an album for his label, Durtro. The Durtro Years: 2000‚Äì2006 In 2001, Baby Dee released her debut album, Little Window. The album was composed and produced by Dee and featured only her, singing and playing piano on seven songs bookended by two accordion instrumentals. Though the album went largely unnoticed at the time of its release, the few reviews it did receive were often positive. Dee released her second album, Love's Small Song, in 2002. This album was recorded in much the same fashion as the first, with Dee acting as the sole producer, composer, and performer. This time, though, the album contained more varied instrumentation with layered tracks of vocals, piano, accordion, and harp. Dee even set the entire album against a recording of birdsong. Still, while the album received a few very positive reviews, it, too, garnered little attention. In 2007, the out-of-print albums Little Window and Love's Small Song along with Made for Love, a 2005 three-song EP, were re-released in a 2-CD compilation entitled The Robin's Tiny Throat. Drag City: 2007‚Äìpresent By 2006, Baby Dee had grown tired of recording and returned to private life at her Cleveland home. Unfortunately, Dee's tree climbing career was cut short when a tree she was doctoring fell on a customer's home. The incident left Dee jobless and in need of money. Soon though, Dee came into luck when she met musicians Will Oldham and Matt Sweeney who were both fans of her work. They offered to produce an album for her, and, while initially hesitant, Dee soon agreed. In 2008, Dee released her third official studio album and debut for Drag City, Safe Inside the Day. The album was her first to feature collaborators. Other performers included producers Oldham and Sweeney and fellow eccentric personality/singer-songwriter Andrew WK. The album garnered significantly more attention than its predecessors and was well-reviewed by most. In 2010, Dee released her fourth album, a re-recording of a limited- edition book and CD entitled A Book of Songs for Anne Marie released by Durtro in 2004. The recording significantly expanded on the original version adding chamber orchestration and three additional songs. The album also featured Dee, for the first time, predominantly using harp as opposed to piano. Following in the path of Safe Inside the Day, it gained the artist further visibility and recognition. It was released on the Drag City label in America and on Tin Angel Records in the UK. In 2011, Baby Dee released her fifth album, Regifted Light. The album was recorded in Dee's home and produced by friend and collaborator Andrew WK. It featured mainly instrumental tracks performed on a Steinway D grand piano with a small backing band. In 2015, Baby Dee released her sixth album, I Am A Stick on Tin Angel Records. \\"Working in what often sounds like a free-form style, the band's instrumentals punctuate Dee's piano arrangements, adding an element of unpredictability that's definitely more 'experimental' than anything she's done before\\". Collaborations Baby Dee has worked with Antony and the Johnsons, Andrew WK, and many other artists on the New York City scene. She has toured extensively with Current 93, playing piano and harp. She has also toured with Marc Almond and The Dresden Dolls. In 2010 she toured with Little Annie. In 2016 and 2017 she toured with Swans and later appeared on their 2019 album Leaving Meaning. Personal life Assigned male at birth, Baby Dee is a transgender woman. Her sister, Mary Norris, is a copy editor at the New Yorker.

The Refo:mation was a de facto reunion of the Australian psychedelic rock band The Church with their original guitarist Peter Koppes, but without other guitarist Marty Willson-Piper. Koppes had left the band in 1992 but had played as a guest on their 1996 album Magician Among the Spirits. Following that album's commercial failure however, the members of The Church had turned their attention to other projects and Willson-Piper had left Australia in order to collaborate with other artists and write new solo material. In his absence, singer/bassist Steve Kilbey, drummer Tim Powles and the returning Koppes spent some studio time together and quickly wrote and recorded an album. Loose in feel, but rich in atmosphere, the eccentrically-titled Pharmakoi/Distance- Crunching Honchos With Echo Units saw a greater focus on concise, guitar- dominated songs, in contrast to the experimentation of Magician Among the Spirits. The trio had initially thought of calling themselves \\"The Reformation\\", but this was altered, on Powles' suggestion, as a courtesy to the absent Willson-Piper.

She was originally laid down as PCS-1416, and, when renamed later in her career, became the third U.S. Navy ship named for the swallow. History Swallow was laid down as PCS-1416 on 8 June 1943 by Stadium Yacht Basin, Inc., of Cleveland, Ohio; redesignated YMS-461 on 27 September 1943; launched on 8 January 1944, and commissioned on 22 June 1944. YMS-461 departed Cleveland on 3 July and sailed down the St. Lawrence River. She made stops at Montreal, Quebec, and Halifax, before arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 August. She completed shakedown training out of Norfolk on 2 September and began patrolling the U.S. East Coast under the command of the Commander Eastern Sea Frontier. She patrolled for enemy submarines and escorted coastal convoys until mid-March 1945. On 17 March, she got underway from Norfolk and sailed south, stopping at Miami, Florida, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before transiting the Panama Canal at the end of the first week in April. She stopped at San Diego, California, from 20 to 27 April, and at Pearl Harbor on 6 May, then continued on to the Central Pacific Ocean. After brief stops at Eniwetok and Guam, she arrived off Okinawa on 27 June and served there for almost two months. Late in August, she moved to Tokyo Bay and, for the next few months, operated in that area. In February 1946, she returned to the Marianas, at Saipan, then continued east via Eniwetok to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 14 March. She reached San Francisco, California, on the 26th, remained there in overhaul until 20 October, and then shifted to San Diego. On 16 November, YMS-461 headed back to the Far East. She stopped at Pearl Harbor, Johnston Island, and Eniwetok Atoll, before entering Apra Harbor at Guam on 9 January 1947. On 18 February 1947, she was named Swallow and redesignated AMS-36. Swallow served in the Far East, operating out of Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan, for the remainder of her career which included minesweeping duties during the Korean War. In October 1950, Swallow was part of a group consisting of , , , , , , , , four Republic of Korea minesweepers, and a helicopter from that cleared the heavily mined port of Chinnampo in less than two weeks. On 7 February 1955, she was redesignated MSC(O)-36. She was decommissioned on 16 April 1955 and loaned to Japan. She served the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force as Yugeshima (MSC-660) and was later redesignated YAS-41.

The ship was launched on 4 June 1863 by the Boston Navy Yard; and commissioned there on 15 January 1864, Lt. Comdr. Stephen P. Quackenbush in command. The ship was named for the Pequot Indian tribe resident in Southern Connecticut, members of the Algonquian language grouping. Service history The new gunboat departed Boston on 5 February and joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She captured British blockade runner Don off Beaufort, North Carolina, on 4 March, and helped the Army beat back a Confederate attack on Wilson's Wharf, James River, Virginia, on 24 May. Blockade duty occupied her until she participated in the first and the second battles on Fort Fisher which protected Wilmington, North Carolina, on 24 February 1864 and 13 January 1865, closing that last major Confederate port. She followed this victory by helping capture Fort Anderson, North Carolina. Post-war After the end of the Civil War, she was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 3 June 1865. She remained there in reserve until she was sold to Haiti in 1869, where the ship was renamed Terreur. In December of that year, she was captured by rebels.

Sequences presented in G√∂del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid The first Hofstadter sequences were described by Douglas Richard Hofstadter in his book G√∂del, Escher, Bach. In order of their presentation in chapter III on figures and background (Figure-Figure sequence) and chapter V on recursive structures and processes (remaining sequences), these sequences are: Hofstadter Figure-Figure sequences The Hofstadter Figure-Figure (R and S) sequences are a pair of complementary integer sequences defined as follows : \\\\begin{align} R(1)&=1~ ;\\\\ S(1)=2 \\\\ R(n)&=R(n-1)+S(n-1), \\\\quad n>1. \\\\end{align} with the sequence S(n) defined as a strictly increasing series of positive integers not present in R(n). The first few terms of these sequences are :R: 1, 3, 7, 12, 18, 26, 35, 45, 56, 69, 83, 98, 114, 131, 150, 170, 191, 213, 236, 260, ... :S: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, ... Hofstadter G sequence The Hofstadter G sequence is defined as follows : \\\\begin{align} G(0)&=0 \\\\ G(n)&=n-G(G(n-1)), \\\\quad n>0. \\\\end{align} The first few terms of this sequence are :0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, ... Hofstadter H sequence The Hofstadter H sequence is defined as follows : \\\\begin{align} H(0)&=0 \\\\ H(n)&=n-H(H(H(n-1))), \\\\quad n>0. \\\\end{align} The first few terms of this sequence are :0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, ... Hofstadter Female and Male sequences The Hofstadter Female (F) and Male (M) sequences are defined as follows : \\\\begin{align} F(0)&=1~ ;\\\\ M(0)=0 \\\\ F(n)&=n-M(F(n-1)), \\\\quad n>0 \\\\ M(n)&=n-F(M(n-1)), \\\\quad n>0. \\\\end{align} The first few terms of these sequences are :F: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 13, ... :M: 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, ... Hofstadter Q sequence The Hofstadter Q sequence is defined as follows : \\\\begin{align} Q(1)&=Q(2)=1, \\\\ Q(n)&=Q(n-Q(n-1))+Q(n-Q(n-2)), \\\\quad n>2. \\\\end{align} The first few terms of the sequence are :1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 10, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, ... Hofstadter named the terms of the sequence \\"Q numbers\\"; thus the Q number of 6 is 4. The presentation of the Q sequence in Hofstadter's book is actually the first known mention of a meta-Fibonacci sequence in literature. While the terms of the Fibonacci sequence are determined by summing the two preceding terms, the two preceding terms of a Q number determine how far to go back in the Q sequence to find the two terms to be summed. The indices of the summation terms thus depend on the Q sequence itself. Q(1), the first element of the sequence, is never one of the two terms being added to produce a later element; it is involved only within an index in the calculation of Q(3). Although the terms of the Q sequence seem to flow chaotically, like many meta-Fibonacci sequences its terms can be grouped into blocks of successive generations. In case of the Q sequence, the k-th generation has 2k members. Furthermore, with g being the generation that a Q number belongs to, the two terms to be summed to calculate the Q number, called its parents, reside by far mostly in generation g ‚àí 1 and only a few in generation g ‚àí 2, but never in an even older generation. Most of these findings are empirical observations, since virtually nothing has been proved rigorously about the Q sequence so far. It is specifically unknown if the sequence is well-defined for all n; that is, if the sequence \\"dies\\" at some point because its generation rule tries to refer to terms which would conceptually sit left of the first term Q(1). Generalizations of the Q sequence=Hofstadter‚ÄìHuber Qr,s(n) family 20 years after Hofstadter first described the Q sequence, he and Greg Huber used the character Q to name the generalization of the Q sequence toward a family of sequences, and renamed the original Q sequence of his book to U sequence. The original Q sequence is generalized by replacing (n ‚àí 1) and (n ‚àí 2) by (n ‚àí r) and (n ‚àí s), respectively. This leads to the sequence family : Q_{r,s}(n) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 , \\\\quad 1 \\\\le n \\\\le s, \\\\ Q_{r,s}(n-Q_{r,s}(n-r))+Q_{r,s}(n-Q_{r,s}(n-s)), \\\\quad n > s, \\\\end{cases} where s ‚â• 2 and r < s. With (r,s) = (1,2), the original Q sequence is a member of this family. So far, only three sequences of the family Qr,s are known, namely the U sequence with (r,s) = (1,2) (which is the original Q sequence); the V sequence with (r,s) = (1,4); and the W sequence with (r,s) = (2,4). Only the V sequence, which does not behave as chaotically as the others, is proven not to \\"die\\". Similar to the original Q sequence, virtually nothing has been proved rigorously about the W sequence to date. The first few terms of the V sequence are :1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 11, ... The first few terms of the W sequence are :1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 7, 5, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 9, 9, 13, 11, 9, ... For other values (r,s) the sequences sooner or later \\"die\\" i.e. there exists an n for which Qr,s(n) is undefined because n ‚àí Qr,s(n ‚àí r) < 1. Pinn Fi,j(n) family In 1998, Klaus Pinn, scientist at University of M√ºnster (Germany) and in close communication with Hofstadter, suggested another generalization of Hofstadter's Q sequence which Pinn called F sequences. The family of Pinn Fi,j sequences is defined as follows: : F_{i,j}(n) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 , \\\\quad n=1,2, \\\\ F_{i,j}(n-i-F_{i,j}(n-1))+F_{i,j}(n-j-F_{i,j}(n-2)), \\\\quad n > 2. \\\\end{cases} Thus Pinn introduced additional constants i and j which shift the index of the terms of the summation conceptually to the left (that is, closer to start of the sequence). Only F sequences with (i,j) = (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), the first of which represents the original Q sequence, appear to be well-defined. Unlike Q(1), the first elements of the Pinn Fi,j(n) sequences are terms of summations in calculating later elements of the sequences when any of the additional constants is 1\\\\. The first few terms of the Pinn F0,1 sequence are :1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, ... Hofstadter‚ÄìConway $10,000 sequence The Hofstadter‚ÄìConway $10,000 sequence is defined as follows : \\\\begin{align} a(1)&=a(2)=1, \\\\ a(n)&=a(a(n-1))+a(n-a(n-1)), \\\\quad n>2. \\\\end{align} The first few terms of this sequence are :1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ... This sequence acquired its name because John Horton Conway offered a prize of $10,000 to anyone who could demonstrate a particular result about its asymptotic behavior. The prize, since reduced to $1,000, was claimed by Collin Mallows. In private communication with Klaus Pinn, Hofstadter later claimed he had found the sequence and its structure some 10‚Äì15 years before Conway posed his challenge. References=Sources *. *. *. *. *.

Albert Levy (1844 to 1847 ‚Äì 1907) was a French photographer active in Europe and the United States. Most active in the 1880s and 1890s, he was a pioneer of architectural photography. He developed a catalogue with 2500 titles that is available through the Gallica web projectGallica Project of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BnF) as well as in the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library. His catalogue covers France, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. He was one of the first photographers to have studios on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean: in Paris and New York. His main contribution to history documentation was his \\"Albert Levy's architectural photographic Series\\" in the 1870s that consists of albums with 30‚Äì40 albumen prints of the Architecture of the United States, with a size of 20x24 cm approximately. There are at least 36 series. Biography According to one source, who cites only \\"Biblioth√®que Nacionale de France\\", Levy was born in France in 1844. However, the 1880 United States Census notes that he was 33 years old, which would put his birth date at 1847 if he was asked his \\"age on your birthday anniversary in 1880\\". Alternatively, it could be either 1846 or 1847 if asked for his age at the time of being asked (which could be before or after his birthday anniversary in 1880).1880 United States Census The New York Passengers list 1820‚Äì1957 indicates that he came to the United States in 1876 and that his occupation was photographer.New York Passengers list 1820‚Äì1957 The 1880 Census gives his profession as bookseller.

It is administered as part of the village of Kitadait≈ç, Shimajiri District, Okinawa. Geography Okidait≈çjima is a relatively isolated coralline island, located approximately south of Minamidait≈çjima, the largest island of the archipelago, and south of Kitadait≈çjima. Naha, Okinawa, is to the northwest. As with the other islands in the archipelago, Okidait≈çjima is an uplifted coral atoll with a steep coastal cliff of limestone (the former fringing coral reef of the island), and a depressed center (the former lagoon of the island). The island is roughly triangular in shape, with a circumference of about and an area of . The highest point is above sea level. Due to extensive phosphate mining operations in the early 20th century, and decades of use as a bombing and gunnery range by the United States Navy, the island has very little topsoil and no trees. Okidait≈ç has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa) with very warm summers and mild winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year; the wettest month is June and the driest month is February. The island is subject to frequent typhoons. History It was first sighted by the Spanish navigator Bernardo de la Torre on 25 September 1543, during his abortive attempt to reach New Spain from the Philippines with the San Juan de Letran. It was then charted as Abreojos (Keep your eyes open!) because being so flat and almost water level it was dangerous for navigation. It was later sighted by a Manila galleon on 28 July 1587, commanded by Pedro de Unamuno who charted the Dait≈çs as the Islas sin Provecho (Useless Islands). Another Manila galleon, the Nuestra Se√±ora de la Consolaci√≥n commanded by Felipe Tompson, reported its sighting in 1773 and charted it as Isla Dolores. Its sighting was also reported by the British in 1788 and named \\"Grampus Island\\", but the recorded coordinates were not correct. The French also reported sighting an island in 1807. However, in 1815, the last Manila Galleon, the Spanish frigate San Fernando de Magallanes, made a definite sighting at the present coordinates, and named the island \\"Isla Rasa\\" (Flat Island in Spanish). The island remained uninhabited until formally claimed by the Empire of Japan in 1900. In 1907, a team of pioneers from Hachij≈çjima, one of the Izu Islands located south of Tokyo, led by Tamaoki Han'emon (1838‚Äì1910), who had previously pioneered settlement on Minamidait≈çjima, became the first human inhabitants of the island. The island was surveyed in 1908 by Tsuneto Noritaka, a professor with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, who recommended that its guano resources be exploited for fertilizer. \\"The Rasa Island Phosphate Ore Company\\" (; today: Rasa K≈çgy≈ç KK) was created in 1911 for this purpose and also for the export of sugar. During this period (1911‚Äì1945), Okidait≈çjima was inhabited by up to 2000 people, with a settlement was located in the west of the island. Until 1929, the population was exclusively male and consisted of workers from Okinawa and managers from Hachijojima. The disparity in wages led to labor unrest in the 1920s. Mining operations were halted from 1929 to 1940 for economic reasons, but were resumed in 1940 due to the need for phosphates in explosives. The inhabitants were evacuated to mainland Okinawa in 1945 due to the increasing threat of attack during World War II. After World War II, the island was occupied by the United States and was used as a bombing range by the United States Navy. The island was returned to Japan in 1972, and remains the private property of Rasa Industries. Self-Defense Force Exercises In late October 2013 it was announced that Okidaitojima would be the site of large scale exercises by the JSDF, including live fire naval exercises and amphibious landings, intended to test the JSDF's ability to defend remote islands against hostile incursions. These would be among the largest exercises ever held by the JSDF, involving at least 34,000 troops along with vessels and aircraft.

Early years  Brƒìdermanis was born in Riga in 1900. His father, KƒÅrlis, was a civil servant. Brƒìdermanis attended Vilis Olavs' Commercial School and the Riga City Realschule. During World War I and the occupation of much of Latvia by the German Army, his family evacuated as refugees to other parts of the Russian Empire. In 1919, Brƒìdermanis finished his secondary education in Barnaul, and prepared to matriculate at Tomsk University. Instead, however, he was mobilised into Aleksandr Kolchak's anti- Bolshevik army in Siberia. He later transferred to the Latvian volunteer Imanta Regiment and also served the French military mission in Vladivostok. He eventually returned to Latvia along with the Imanta Regiment, and served in the Latvian Army for a year, until demobilisation in January 1920.  Pioneering role in Latvian Scouting  Latvian Scouting began during World War I, when many of Riga's schools had been evacuated to Dorpat (Tartu in present- day Estonia) as the Russian‚ÄìGerman front lines approached Riga. In Tartu, three Scout troops‚Äîthe 5th, 6th, and 7th Dorpat Troops‚Äîwere formed completely or primarily of Latvian boys from evacuated Riga schools.See also: Eesti Skautide √úhing#History. These were the first ever Latvian Scouts. Brƒìdermanis was the leader of the 6th Troop, founded 26 September 1916. Most of these first troops proved short lived, however, disbanding already when the schoolboys left the town for their holidays. In April 1917, many of the former Latvian Scouts from Dorpat/Tartu were back in Riga for Easter holidays. K. Pere≈°s, former leader of the 5th Troop, placed an appeal in the daily newspaper JaunƒÅkƒÅs Zi≈Üas on 8 April 1917, for the boys from Tartu to meet up and found a Scout Group in Riga. As a result, a new troop (officially known as the 92nd Russian Troop) was founded on 17 April 1917, with Pere≈°s as Scout Leader and Brƒìdermanis as Patrol Leader. The troop numbered some 120 Scouts, about half of them Latvian boys. On 3 August 1917, about 50 Latvian Scouts founded a separate 5th Riga Troop under Brƒìdermanis' leadership. This troop's activity was interrupted when the German Army occupied Riga, and the German military authorities arrested them as if they were military cadets. Following his evacuation as a refugee to Samara in the Russian interior, Brƒìdermanis tried unsuccessfully to revive the activity of the 5th Riga Troop.  Foreign service career  After his military service, Brƒìdermanis took up studies in economics at the University of Latvia in Riga. In parallel, he began working in the Foreign Ministry, where he made a career for himself in the foreign service. Aside from various ministry posts, he served abroad in Latvia's diplomatic missions in Berlin (1923‚Äì24) and in Kaunas (1930‚Äì33), then the provisional capital of Lithuania. He left the foreign service to work as a journalist for the Latvian Telegraph Agency from 1935 to 1939. From 1938 to 1939, he studied theology, again at the University of Latvia. From 1939 until the Soviet occupation of Latvia in mid-1940, he worked as press secretary for the Japanese Embassy in Riga.  Persecution and later life under the Soviets  After the loss of Latvia's independence in 1940, the Soviet authorities arrested Brƒìdermanis as a Japanese spy. In August 1940, he was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment in the Gulag, which he spent in labor camps in Mordovia. In 1948 his sentence was changed to 15 years' imprisonment. He was released and returned to the Latvian SSR in 1955. Eventually he was able to settle in Riga. For the rest of his working life he was employed as an accountant at state enterprises. He died in Riga on 22 February 1970 and was buried in the Riga Forest Cemetery.

SBVR is intended to formalize complex compliance rules, such as operational rules for an enterprise, security policy, standard compliance, or regulatory compliance rules. Such formal vocabularies and rules can be interpreted and used by computer systems. SBVR is an integral part of the OMG's model-driven architecture (MDA).  Overview  The SBVR standard defines the vocabulary and rules for documenting the semantics of business vocabularies, business facts, and business rules; as well as an XMI schema for the interchange of business vocabularies and business rules among organizations and between software tools. SBVR allows the production of business vocabularies and rules; vocabulary plus rules constitute a shared domain model with the same expressive power of standard ontological languages. SBVR allows multilingual development, since it is based on separation between symbols and their meaning. SBVR enables making business rules accessible to software tools, including tools that support the business experts in creating, finding, validating, and managing business rules, and tools that support the information technology experts in converting business rules into implementation rules for automated systems. SBVR uses OMG's Meta-Object Facility (MOF) to provide interchange capabilities MOF/XMI mapping rules, enable generating MOF-compliant models and define an XML schema. SBVR proposes Structured English as one of possibly many notations that can map to the SBVR Metamodel. SBVR and Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) are designed as two parts of a unique OMG Technology Stack for software analytics related to existing software systems. KDM defines an ontology related to software artifacts and thus provides an initial formalization of the information related to a software system. SBVR can be further used to formalize complex compliance rules related to the software.  Background  Business rules represent the primary means by which an organization can direct its business, defining the operative way to reach its objectives and perform its actions. A rule-based approach to managing business and the information used by that business is a way of identifying and articulating the rules which define the structure and control the operation of an enterprise it represents a new way to think about enterprise and its rules, in order to enable a complete business representation made by and for business people. Business rules can play an important role in defining business semantics: they can influence or guide behaviours and support policies, responding to environmental situations and events. Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) is the OMG implementation of the business rules approach.  History  In June 2003 OMG issued the Business Semantics of Business Rule (BSBR) Request For Proposal, in order to create a standard to allow business people to define the policies and rules by which they run their business in their own language, in terms of the things they deal with in the business, and to capture those rules in a way that is clear, unambiguous and readily translatable into other representations. The SBVR proposal was developed by the Business Rules Team, a consortium organized in August 2003 to respond to the BSBR RFP.Co-submitters of SBVR were: * Adaptive, Business Rule Solutions LLC, Business Semantics Ltd, Hendryx & Associates, MEGA, Neumont University, Unisys CorporationSupporters of SBVR are: * Automated Reasoning Corporation, Business Rules Group, Fujitsu Ltd, Hewlett-Packard Company, InConcept, LibRT, KnowGravity Inc, Model Systems, Ness Technologies, Perpetual Data Systems, Sandia National Laboratories, The Rule Markup Initiative, X-Change Technologies Group In September 2005, The Business Modeling and Integration Task Force and the Architecture Board of the Object Management Group approved the proposal Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) to become a final adopted specification in response to the RFP. Later SBVR proposal was ratified by the Domain Technical Committee (DTC), approved of the OMG Board of Directors, and SBVR finalization task force was launched to convert the proposal into ISO/OMG standard format and perform final editing prior to release as an OMG formal specification. In January 2008, the finalization phase was completed and the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), Version 1.0 formal specification was released and is publicly availableSemantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), Version 1.0 (formal) at the Catalog of OMG Business Strategy, Business Rules and Business Process Management Specifications web page.  Conceptual formalization  SBVR is a landmark for the OMG, the first OMG specification to incorporate the formal use of natural language in modeling and the first to provide explicitly a model of formal logic. Based on a fusion of linguistics, logic, and computer science, and two years in preparation, SBVR provides a way to capture specifications in natural language and represent them in formal logic so they can be machine-processed. Methodologies used in software development are typically applied only when a problem is already formulated and well described. The actual difficulty lies in the previous step, that is describing problems and expected functionalities. Stakeholders involved in software development can express their ideas using a language very close to them, but they usually are not able to formalize these concepts in a clear and unambiguous way. This implies a large effort in order to interpret and understand real meanings and concepts hidden among stakeholders' words. Special constraints on syntax or predefined linguistic structures can be used in order to overcome this problem, enabling natural language to well represent and formally define problems and requirements. The main purpose of natural language modelling is hence to make natural language suitable for conceptual modelling. The focus is on semantic aspects and shared meanings, while syntax is thought in a perspective based on formal logic mapping. Conceptualization and representation play fundamental roles in thinking, communicating, and modeling. For each concept there is a triad of 1) the concept in our minds, 2) the real-world things conceptualized by the concept, and 3) a representation of the concept that we can use to think and communicate about the concept and its corresponding real-world things. (Note that real-world things include both concrete things and representations of those concrete things as records and processes in operational information systems.) A conceptual model is a formal structure representing a possible world, comprising a conceptual schema and a set of facts that instantiate the conceptual schema. The conceptual schema is a combination of concepts and facts of what is possible, necessary, permissible, and obligatory in each possible world. The set of facts instantiates the conceptual schema by assertion to describe one possible world. A rule is a fact that asserts either a logical necessity or an obligation. Obligations are not necessarily satisfied by the facts; necessities are always satisfied. SBVR contains a vocabulary for conceptual modeling and captures expressions based on this vocabulary as formal logic structures. The SBVR vocabulary allows one to formally specify representations of concepts, definitions, instances, and rules of any knowledge domain in natural language, including tabular forms. These features make SBVR well suited for describing business domains and requirements for business processes and information systems to implement business models.  Fact-orientation  People communicate facts, that is the fact is the unit of communication. The fact-oriented approach enables multidimensional categorization. * The fact- oriented approach supports time changeability. * The fact-oriented approach provides semantic stability. * The fact-oriented approach enables extensibility and reuse. * The fact-oriented approach involves breaking down compound fact types into elementary (atomic) ones. Conceptual formalization describes a business domain, and is composed of 1) a conceptual schema (fact structure) and 2) a population of ground facts. A business domain (universe of discourse) comprises those aspects of the business that are of interest. The schema declares: * the relevant fact types (kinds of ground fact, e.g. Employee works for Department) * the relevant business rules (typically constraints or derivation rules). A fact is a proposition taken to be true by the business. Population facts are restricted to elementary and existential facts. Constraints can be static or dynamic: * A static constraint imposes a restriction on what fact populations are possible or permitted, for each fact population taken individually e.g. Each Employee was born on at most one Date. * A dynamic constraint imposes a restriction on transitions between fact populations e.g. a person‚Äôs marital status may change from single to married, but not from divorced to single Derivation of facts. * Derivation means either, how a fact type may be derived from one or more other fact types e.g. ** Person1 is an uncle of Person2 if Person1 is a brother of some Person3 who is a parent of Person2 * Or, how a noun concept (object type) may be defined in terms of other object types and fact types e.g. ** Each FemaleAustralian is a Person who was born in Country ‚ÄòAustralia‚Äô and has Gender ‚ÄòFemale‚Äô  Rule- based approach  Rules play a very important role in defining business semantics: they can influence or guide behaviours and support policies, responding to environmental situations and events. This means that rules represent the primary means by which an organization can direct its business, defining the operative way to reach its objectives and perform its actions. The rule-based approach aims to address two different kinds of users: * it addresses business communities, in order to provide them with a structured approach, based on a clear set of concepts and used to access and manage business rules; * it addresses IT professionals, in order to provide them with a deep understanding about business rules and to help them in models creation. The rules-based approach also helps bridge the rift that can occur between the data managers and the software designers. The essence of the rule-based conceptual formalizations is that rules build on facts, and facts build on concepts as expressed by terms. This mantra is memorable, but a simplification since in SBVR: Meaning is separate from expression; Fact Types (Verb Concepts) are built on Noun Concepts; Noun Concepts are represented by Terms; and Fact Types are represented by Fact Symbols (verb phrases). Rule statements are expressed using either alethic modality or deontic modality and require elements of modal logic as formalization. SBVR Structural Business Rules use two alethic modal operators: :it is necessary that ‚Ä¶ :it is possible that ‚Ä¶ SBVR Operative Business Rules use two deontic modal operators: :it is obligatory that ‚Ä¶ :it is permitted that ‚Ä¶ Structural business rules (static constraints) are treated as alethic necessities by default, where each state of the fact model corresponds to a possible world. Pragmatically, the rule is understood to apply to all future states of the fact model, until the rule is revoked or changed. For the model theory, the necessity operator is omitted from the formula. Instead, the rule is merely tagged as a necessity. For compliance with Common Logic, such formulae can be treated as irregular expressions, with the necessity modal operator treated as an uninterpreted symbol. If the rule includes exactly one deontic operator, e.g. O (obligation), and this is at the front, then the rule may be formalized as Op, where p is a first-order formula that is tagged as obligatory. In SBVR, this tag is assigned the informal semantics: it ought to be the case that p (for all future states of the fact model, until the constraint is revoked or changed). From a model-theoretic perspective, a model is an interpretation where each non-deontic formula evaluates to true, and the model is classified as: a permitted model if the p in each deontic formula (of the form Op) evaluates to true, otherwise the model is a forbidden model (though still a model). This approach removes any need to assign a truth value to expressions of the form Op.  Formal logic with a natural language interface  SBVR is for modeling in natural language. Based on linguistics and formal logic, SBVR provides a way to represent statements in controlled natural languages as logic structures called semantic formulations. SBVR is intended for expressing business vocabulary and business rules, and for specifying business requirements for information systems in natural language. SBVR models are declarative, not imperative or procedural. SBVR has the greatest expressivity of any OMG modeling language. The logics supported by SBVR are typed first order predicate logic with equality, restricted higher order logic (Henkin semantics), restricted deontic and alethic modal logic, set theory with bag comprehension, and mathematics. SBVR also includes projections, to support definitions and answers to queries, and questions, for formulating queries. Interpretation of SBVR semantic formulations is based on model theory. SBVR has a MOF model, so models can be structurally linked at the level of individual facts with other MDA models based on MOF. SBVR is aligned with Common Logic ‚Äì published by ISO as ISO/IEC 24707:2007. SBVR captures business facts and business rules that may be expressed either informally or formally. Business rule expressions are formal only if they are expressed purely in terms of: fact types in the pre-declared schema for the business domain, certain logical/ mathematical operators, quantifiers etc. Formal rules are transformed into a logical formulation that is used for exchange with other rules-based software tools. Informal rules may be exchanged as un-interpreted comments. An approach to automatically generate SBVR business rules from natural language specification is presented in.  Other OMG standards  SBVR specification defines a metamodel and allows to instance it, in order to create different vocabularies and to define the related business rules; it is also possible to complete these models with data suitable to describe a specific organization. the SBVR approach provides means (i.e. mapping rules) to translate natural language artifacts into MOF-compliant artifacts; this allows to exploit all the advantages related to MOF (repository facilities, interchangeability, tools, ...). Several MDA-related OMG works in progress are expected to incorporate SBVR, including: * Business Process Definition Metamodel (BPDM) * Organization Structure Metamodel (OSM) * Business Motivation Model (BMM) * UML Profile for Production Rule Representation (PRR) * UML Profile for the Department of Defense Architecture Framework/Ministry of Defense(Canada) Architecture Framework (DoDAF/MODAF). * Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) * Wider interest in SBVR‚Äì Semantic Web, OASIS The Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM) has been made compatible with SBVR, primarily by aligning the logic grounding of the ISO Common Logic specification (CL) referenced by ODM with the SBVR Logical Formulation of Semantics vocabulary. CL itself was modified specifically so it potentially can include the modal sentence requirements of SBVR. ODM provides a bridge to link SBVR to the Web Ontology Language for Services (OWL-S), Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS), Unified Modeling Language (UML), Topic Map (TM), Entity Relationship Modeling (ER), Description Logic (DL), and CL. Other programs outside the OMG are adopting SBVR. The Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE), an integrated project of the European Commission Framework Programme 6, has adopted SBVR as the basis for its Business Modeling Language. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is assessing SBVR for use in the Semantic Web, through the bridge provided by ODM. SBVR will extend the capability of MDA in all these areas.

It occupies the area of 161 hectares and possesses a collection of over 4,500 taxonomic groups. Its history spans more than three centuries. It was first described, in 1671, by the French traveller Jean Chardin as royal gardens which might have been founded at least in 1625 and were variably referred to as \\"fortress gardens\\" or \\"Seidabad gardens\\" later in history. The gardens appear in the records by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1701) and on the Tbilisi, map composed by Prince Vakhushti (1735). Pillaged in the Persian invasion of 1795, the garden was revived in the early 19th century and officially established as the Tiflis Botanical Garden in 1845. From 1888 on, when a floristics center was set up, Yuri Voronov and several other notable scholars have worked for the Garden. Between 1896 and 1904, the Garden was expanded further westward. Between 1932 and 1958, the territory around the former Muslim cemetery was included in the botanical garden. Several graves have survived, however, including that of the prominent Azerbaijani writer Mirza Fatali Akhundov (1812-1878). The central entrance to the Garden is located at the foothills of the Narikala Fortress. The other, cut through the rock as a long tunnel in 1909‚Äì14, had been functional until the mid-2000s when the tunnel was converted into Georgia's largest nightclub \\"Gvirabi\\".

The municipal corporation has been named Rama since its inception in 1919 the name was not declared official by other levels of government until years later, 1956. While other names such as Silver Hill (1907) were discussed for the village or school district they were ultimately passed over and for simplicity sake the decision was made to keep with the name already given to the train platform and siding there. Rama is assigned a UN/LOCODE of CA-RMA.  Doukhobors  Until 1899 a large area directly to the east of Rama, around the north end of good spirit lake, was reserved for the Doukhobors; this reserve was called the Good Spirit Lake Annex. It was part of the South Colony. The people settled eight communal villages in this area of almost 170,000 acres. Decisions of the Canadian government in the early 1900s (1907) caused almost all these communal farm villages to be deserted for individual homesteads by 1918. These families moved on to southern British Columbia or onto individual farmsteads.  Homesteading and surveys  Rama incorporated as a village on December 18, 1919. The first British-Canadian surveys in the Assiniboia district were completed in this area for the British crown by around 1879, by 1890 the provisional government began to encourage European immigration to the area. At about the same time the site for Rama was being surveyed a large wave of immigrant homesteaders were coming to the province from all over the world. The settlers that arrived to homestead in the area of Rama were largely of Eastern European origin. Some of the first area families lived south of the town site. They were documented as the Landstad's, Murray's, Dean's, and Lockhart's all on or near the former Pelly Trail to the south of Rama. John Berge (and family) are listed as homesteaders in the area near the rail siding.ShehoCairn  Timeline  *1600s to 1800s - European activity in what is then known as New France and later the Assiniboia district are summed up as fur trading with Natives. *1690 - Henry Kelsey, a British explorer for the HBC, is guided by First Nations People on his journey deep into the Assiniboine River area. His mission was to meet with the area First Nations people in an effort to encourage them to bring furs east to be traded at York Factory (on the shores of Hudson Bay). Kelsey was the first British person to explore the plains of Canada and this area of Saskatchewan. *1800 to 1904 - European settlement of the area was still quite limited due to uncertainty and instability. Most of Assiniboia was made part of the US in 1812 and was transferred back in 1869. In 1870 the Riel Rebellion would effectively mean the area was under Metis control from 1870. While claimed by the British, Assiniboia would not fully become a part of Canada until after 1882. Because of this instability only a few cattle ranchers were bravely tending herds in the no-mans land area of the Whitesand River and Devil's Lake (Good Spirit Lake). Bison still roamed the plains. Devils Lake School District *1890 - The Dominion Land Survey of Canada is being made of the district Assiniboia for the purpose of settlement. *1899 - The area immediately to the East of present-day Rama (Buchanan, Canora, Kamsack, Veregin area) is turned into the Doukhobor South Reserve and Devil's Lake annex totaling almost 384,000 acres of land.

Public passenger bus service is discontinued to many communities in Saskatchewan as the Saskatchewan Transportation Co. is shuttered due to budget cutbacks. Rama finds itself disconnected from public transport for the first time since 1927.  Geography  Rama is located on the banks of Spirit Creek and is found at the junction of Highways 5 and 754 in Saskatchewan's aspen parkland region. This area is part of the east central region of the province. Growing zones are geographical areas which are generally determined by the lowest sustained temperature in that area achieved during the year and other climate variables. Rama and the surrounding area finds itself in Growing Zone 1b. Growing zone 1 is defined as having the lowest temperature achieved of below -45.6 ¬∞C or -50 ¬∞F with the first frost usually occurring by September 12 and the last frost of the spring on or about May 22. Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture studies show the available Corn Heat Units in this area to be in the 1,401-1,800 range. While suitable for silage, these conditions are quite unfavorable to grow corn in. The soils in the community and the nearby farmland are generally black with a heavy clay base. Growing seasons are short and high soil PH (alkalinity) are challenging growing conditions for many types crops, trees and plants. Despite these challenges, cereal crop production often exceeds other areas of the province. In the 1950s, the Canora area held nearly 500 country elevators within a 30 miles radius in order to handle all the grain produced from the region.  Climate  Being located in the middle of North America has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, Saskatchewan is located so far away from any large bodies of water (Great Lakes, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean) that any moderating effect these bodies of water would have on the temperature here is negligible. Because of this, Saskatchewan as a whole is considered to have a temperate continental climate. In the summer the days are very long and hot, in the winter the days become shorter and very cold, making for a temperature range that can exceed 65 ¬∞C or more. Hours of sunlight and frequently clear skies are an important feature of the climate here. Hours of sunlight typically exceeding 2,300 hours annually. *Please note: The climate data presented in the weather box is for the nearest airport with complete climate data available, in this instance the (Yorkton Municipal Airport (YQV)) was chosen as being representative of this area. There may be some variation from what is seen in the climate data infobox and the actual climactic conditions observed in the area.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Village of Rama recorded a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census of Population, the Village of Rama recorded a population of , a change from its 2006 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  Economy  Industry in the community consists mainly of 'family' or corporate farming with several small and medium-sized farming support businesses. While self-employment in farming is the generally accepted occupation in the area, Olysky and the Rama Co-Operative Assoc., as well as area farms, also provide employment opportunities to area residents and newcomers looking for work.  Tourism and recreation = Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes  The annual pilgrimage in Rama, Saskatchewan, Canada. Located in Rama is the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes, an homage to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in Lourdes, France. Many of these grottoes in Saskatchewan and eastern Alberta were created by Fr. Anthony Sylla and his parishioners. Sylla arrived in Saskatchewan in 1909 and by 1933 was in charge of the parish in Rama. By 1939 he began to establish the shrine and pilgrimage site. The shrine was largely completed during the next two years. Updates, landscaping changes and additions to the grounds have continued gradually until today. Every year on August 14 and 15 (since 1941) St. Anthony's parish holds a 'Pilgrimage'. Mass is held in several languages, and a candlelight procession occurs. The shrine in Rama is located west of St. Anthony's church.  Old-fashioned farming  Heritage horse drawn seeding and farming demonstrations are held in the village annually in the spring and fall (seeding and harvest). Teamsters hitch their horses up to vintage farm equipment such as discs, seeders and plows as spectators watch horse powered farming.  The outdoors  Moose wintering in Rama, Saskatchewan 2013 Nearby the farmland gives way to nearly endless lakes and rivers fed by uncountable streams, swamps and other wetlands. Ducks, geese and many other water-loving migratory birds congregate here and in the nearby Quill Lakes area during the spring and fall migrations. In the fall, hunters from the local area as well as visitors from other provinces, the United States and around the world come to this area for the birds and many other game animals. Good Spirit Lake Provincial Park, Whitesand Regional Park, Camp Whitesand, Leslie Beach, Canora Beach and many other parks and recreational opportunities nearby.  Winter and sports  Winter recreational activities include snowmobiling with an extensive network of groomed trails located nearby. The surrounding area offers activities such as hockey, curling, Ukrainian Dance, figure skating, and softball to name a few. Rama is former home of the Rama Rams softball team and the Rama Rebels recreational hockey club.

After editing The Ladder magazine, published by the lesbian civil rights group Daughters of Bilitis, she launched a lesbian book- publishing company Naiad Press, which achieved publicity through its controversial volume Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence. She built a major collection of lesbian literature, catalogued with detailed indexing of topics. Early life Born in Cincinnati to Dorothy Vernon Black, a secretary, and Philip Strang Grier, a doctor, Grier grew up in several midwestern US cities. She claims she came out as a lesbian at 12 years old and spent her life finding as much information about female homosexuality as she could.Brownworth, Victoria. (2002) \\"Barbara Grier\\" Before Stonewall: Activists for gay and lesbian rights in historical context. Bullough, Vern, ed. Harrington Park Press. Her parents divorced when she was 13 years old. Grier went to the library to discover more about lesbians after noticing her own behavior patterns were different from her friends. She told her mother that she was homosexual, and her mother replied, \\"No, because you're a woman, you're a lesbian. And since 12 years old is too young to make such a decision, let's wait six months before we tell the newspapers.\\"Greenblatt, R. \\"Barbara Grier.\\" Gay & Lesbian Biography. St. James Press, 1997. She began collecting books when her mother gave her a copy of The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall when she was 16 years old. She describes her collection of lesbian-themed books as Lesbiana, a collection that was fueled by a \\"love affair with lesbian publishing.\\" Shortly after Grier graduated high school in 1951, she met Helen Bennett in a public library. They spent 20 years together living in Denver, Colorado while Bennett went to library school, then moving to Kansas City where both worked in public libraries. The Ladder Grier began writing book reviews in The Ladder, a magazine edited by members of the Daughters of Bilitis, soon after subscribing to it in 1957. She used multiple pen names in her writings including Gene Damon, Lennox Strong, Vern Niven, most often writing to review literature in which lesbians were characters or a plot device. Grier took over editing The Ladder in 1968 with the goal of expanding the magazine to include more feminist ideals. The magazine gained a more professional and sleeker layout and increased to more than 40 pages from the 25 average under previous editors and tripled in subscriptions. She described her roles in editing the magazine, \\"\\"In 1968, I became editor of The Ladder, and I had to write three hundred letters a week, edit the magazine, run a staff of fifteen people spread all over the world, work a part-time job, keep house, read the books, and write my 'Lesbiana' column.\\"Clay, Jim. \\"Literati Lesbiana.\\" Gay Community News. Boston: Oct 16, 1982. Vol. 10, Iss. 13; pg. 2. Grier also removed the word \\"lesbian\\" from the front cover, after being placed there in 1963, in an attempt to reach more women. Grier's tenure took place at a time when the Daughters of Bilitis were in conflict about the direction of the organization. DOB founders tended to encourage a more assimilationist stance for the organization and came in direct conflict from more radical separatist lesbians, including Grier. When the DOB folded in 1970, Grier, who was editing the magazine from Kansas City, planned with DOB president Rita LaPorte to take the only two copies of the subscription list from the printer and the DOB headquarters in order to keep The Ladder alive. LaPorte took both copies to the ignorance of DOB founders Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, and relocated the magazine to Reno, causing an uproar. The Ladder ran for two more years before it outgrew its finances and folded in September 1972. Said Grier about her role in the controversy, \\"You have to understand that none of these things were done with malice aforethought or with intention to damage. I mean I was just as much a light-eyed maniac then as I am now in terms of the mission. The mission is that the lesbians shall inherit the earth, you see.\\"Soares, Maneula. \\"The Purloined Ladder: Its Place in Lesbian History.\\" Journal of Homosexuality: Vol. 34, No. 3/4, 1998, pp. 27-49. Naiad Press Her twenty-year relationship with Helen Bennett ended when Grier fell in love with librarian Donna McBride. Grier claims the only decision she ever agonized about was whether to leave Bennett for McBride. Grier and partner Donna McBride began running Naiad Press at the support and urging of two editors of The Ladder, Anyda Marchant and Muriel Crawford in 1973. Their first published work was The Latecomer written by Marchant under the pen name Sarah Aldridge. Naiad was run from Kansas City until 1980 when it relocated to Tallahassee, Florida. Both women continued to work full-time until 1982 when they dedicated all their time to the publishing company. Authors represented by Naiad include Valerie Taylor, Katherine V. Forrest, Jane Rule, Ann Bannon's reprinted Beebo Brinker Chronicles, and Gale Wilhelm, whom Grier spent several years attempting to locate to bring out of obscurity. One of the most controversial of these was Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence, a work of non-fiction that was banned in Boston and criticized by the Catholic Church. Penthouse Forum ran a series from the book and it made Naiad an internationally-known publishing name. Grier used her extensive lesbian literature collection, what she termed \\"Lesbiana\\" at Naiad. By 1994, the company had a staff of 8 and projected sales of $1.8 million US. In 1992, Grier and McBride donated Naiad's entire collection to the San Francisco Public Library, which consisted of a tractor trailer full of 14,000 books estimated at $400,000 US.Cain, Paul. \\"Barbara Grier.\\" Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender History in America. Charles Scribner's & Sons: 2004 What began as a search became a self- described obsession for Grier. She worked with Jeannette Howard Foster and Marion Zimmer Bradley to compile the largest collection of books with lesbian themes in the English language, they called The Lesbian in Literature. Books were rated from A to D referencing how important lesbian characters were to the plot, or T, indicating the book was \\"trash\\". In 1985 Grier earned the President's Award for Lifetime Service from the Gay Academic Union. In 1991, Grier and McBride, representing Naiad Press, was given the Lambda Literary Award for Publisher's Service. Grier and McBride were given the Lambda Literary Pioneer Award in 2002.

Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  The new gunboat sailed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, 2 October and joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron there on the 8th. She got underway on the 26th, seeking Confederate cruiser CSS Tallahassee then preying on northern merchantmen near Boston, Massachusetts. After steaming as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia, she returned to New York City, 8 November, en route back to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to prepare for an attack on Fort Fisher which protected Wilmington, North Carolina.  The attack on Fort Fisher, North Carolina  The first assault made on Christmas Eve was unsuccessful, but the Union ships returned 13 January 1865 and shelled the southern stronghold while troops were landed. They supported the Union ground forces during a 2 day campaign which carried the Confederate works on the 15th, closing the vital southern port.  Virginia operations  On 15 February Maumee was ordered up Cape Fear River to support Union Army operations, and 10 days later she was assigned to the James River for similar action. In March, when the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia, fell, Maumee was one of the vessels assigned occupation duty along the waterfront.

Range and habitat This subspecies is fairly common in some areas, in oak and pine-oak woods and clearings in the highlands of Mexico (1600 m to 3000 m elevation) from Oaxaca north to Coahuila and Sonora and in neighboring southeastern Arizona. Description Its appearance is very similar to the house wren's, 11.5 to 12.5 cm (4.5 to 4.7 inches) long, with brown head and upperparts, barred with black on the wings and narrow tail. It has a stronger buff eyebrow stripe and black eyestripe than the house wren. Below it is buffy, grayer (more like the house wren) in subspecies cahooni of northern Mexico and Arizona, more ocher in the other subspecies. The flanks and undertail coverts have dark brown bars. The voice is also similar to the house wren's. The song consists of \\"scratchy, chortling, warbling, and trilling\\" sounds, and there are scolding calls starting with a ch sound, as well as a mewing call.Howell and Webb, Birds of Mexico, p. 567 (House Wren) One sound not in the house wren's repertoire is \\"a bright springy trill, tseeeurr or ssreeuur, suggesting a rock wren.\\" The brown-throated wren's behavior is, perhaps unsurprisingly, similar to the house wren's: typically skulking but not infrequently visible, especially when singing from an open perch. Classification Some authorities do not list the brown-throated wren as a separate species., according to Lepage, op. cit. An argument for lumping it with the house wren is that house wrens in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico have characters intermediate between the two species. The brown-throated wren is considered a separate species following the Handbook of the Birds of the World. A 2005 DNA study corroborated this split by suggesting that the brown-throated wren was not only a separate species but likely not the house wren's closest relative. For further information, see Troglodytes. As a separate species, it comprises five subspecies: brunneicollis, cahooni, compositus, nitidus, and vorhiesi.

On 10 March 1951 it was renamed as Apostolic Exarchate of Toronto. On 3 November 1956 it became the Eparchy (Diocese) of Toronto, losing its missionary pre-diocesan and exempt status, because until then it was directly subject to the Holy See.  Extent  Parishes under the authority of the eparchy are located in Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. In 2007, the diocese contained 75 parishes, 96 active diocesan and religious priests, and 36,910 Catholics. It also had 36 women religious, 15 religious brothers, and 19 permanent deacons. In 2010, Bishop Stephen Chmilar gave the blessing for the creation of the Eparchial Office of Youth Ministry, with the mission of promoting the involvement of young adults within the church.

The person playing it is called kud√ºmzen. It is among ney, rebap, and halile as one of the four main instruments in Mevlevi music. It consists of a pair of small, hemispherical drums. Traditionally kud√ºm was played in religious ceremonies; in a secular context, like in mehter music, its slightly bigger cousin nakkare is played. The drums are some 28‚Äì30 cm. in diameter and about 16 cm high, growing narrower toward the bottom like a half- sphere. They are made of beaten copper, and resemble two bowls, one larger than the other. The difference in the thickness of the skin in the two bowls create a difference in pitch: the high-pitched drum (tek) is placed on the left, the other (d√ºm) on the right. The tek, with its thinner skin, is slightly smaller than the d√ºm. The tension in the skin can be adjusted to tune the instrument according to the makam of the music being played. Camel's skin is usually preferred, although sometimes cattle or llama is also used. The drums are placed on two leather links filled with cotton to prevent them from slipping and to avoid direct contact with the floor to get the right sound. The kud√ºm is played with two wooden sticks made of soft wood known as zahme. The metal body of the kud√ºm is generally covered with leather to prevent it giving off a tinny sound. Historically, the kud√ºm was played and developed by the Mevlevis in religious ceremonies. In fact, it was not until the 20th century that the instrument was used in mainstream Turkish classical music. It was used in a nonreligious setting for the first time in 1947 in a concert organized by the √úsk√ºdar Musical Association. In 1957, the first radio performance was performed by Kud√ºmzen Hur≈üit Ungay. Cafer A√ßƒ±n was an instrument maker who made important changes in the making of the instrument in the latter half of the 20th century.

Early life and education Edith Marie Flanigen was born January 28, 1929 in Buffalo, New York. She and her two sisters, Joan and Jane, were introduced to chemistry by their high school teacher. The three sisters all went on to study chemistry at D'Youville College. Edith Flanigen graduated class president and valedictorian. Joan and Edith both went on to receive master's degrees in chemistry at Syracuse University. Flanigen received an M.S. in inorganic physical chemistry in 1952.  Career  In 1952, Edith Flanigen joined the Union Carbide company. Her job at first was the identification, purification and extraction of different silicone polymers. In 1956, she moved to the molecular sieves group. In 1973, she was the first woman at Union Carbide to be named corporate research fellow, and in 1986, senior corporate research fellow. She was moved to UOP (a joint venture between Union Carbide and Allied Signal) in 1988, where she was named senior research fellow. Flanigen was promoted to UOP Fellow in 1991. Edith Flanigen retired from UOP 1994. Following her career at UOP, and through at least 2004, Edith Flanigen remained active professionally, including as a consultant with UOP. In her 42-year career associated with Union Carbide, Edith Flanigen invented more than 200 different synthetic substances, authored or co-authored over 36 publications, and was awarded at least 109 patents. Chemistry In 1956 Flanigen began working on molecular sieves. Molecular sieves are crystal compounds with molecular sized pores that can filter or separate very complex substances. Edith Flanigen is best known as the inventor of zeolite Y, a specific molecular sieve. Zeolite Y was a certain type of molecular sieve that could refine petroleum. Zeolite Y surpassed Zeolite X before it. When refining \\"crude oil\\", or petroleum, it must be separated into all of its different parts, or fractions. Gasoline is one of the many fractions that come from refining petroleum. Flanigen's zeolites are used as catalysts, or a substance that enhances chemical reactions. Zeolite Y is a catalyst that enhances the amount of gasoline fractioned from petroleum, making refining petroleum safer and more productive. In addition to her work on molecular sieves, Flanigen also co-invented a synthetic emerald, which Union Carbide produced and sold for many years. The emeralds were used mainly in masers (predecessors to lasers) and were even used in jewelry for a time, in a line marketed as the \\"Quintessa Collection.\\" Structure of silicalite, a form of silicon dioxide discovered by Flanigan et al. Honors and awards Flanigen has been the recipient of many awards and honors. She was, for example, the first female recipient of the Perkin Medal in 1992. She was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2014, the Edith Flanigen Award was created by the Collaborative Research Centre at Humboldt University of Berlin. The award is to be given annually to an outstanding female scientist at the early stage of her career. The first award was given to Natacha Krins for her work at the University of Paris. In 2012, Flanigen was named recipient of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.Laureates, National Medal of Technology and Innovation, nationalmedals.org; accessed October 21, 2016.

Early years and career Billy Woodward was the only son of William Woodward Sr. and his wife, Elizabeth Ogden \\"Elsie\\" Cryder. His mother was one of the \\"Cryder triplets\\" of New York City society fame. His father was president and director of the Hanover Bank of New York, and was secretary to the ambassador to the Court of St. James's during the reign of Edward VII. Woodward Sr. frequented the race track with the king, and they developed a close friendship. Woodward was educated at Buckley School, Groton School and graduated from Harvard University. After graduation, he fought in the United States Navy during World War II. There, he received a Purple Heart after a torpedo attack on his ship, the USS Liscome Bay. After leaving the Navy, Woodward became a director of Hanover Bank. A young, tall, wealthy man, he was considered by some to be the most eligible bachelor in America, and eventually became one of the country's finest horse breeders. On the senior Woodward's death in 1953, Woodward inherited Belair Mansion and stud farm in Collington, Maryland, the oldest in America, along with the thoroughbred horse Nashua. Personal life During his naval service, Woodward met Ann Eden Crowell (born Angeline Lucille Crowell), a Powers model and stage and radio actress who also danced as a showgirl in upscale Manhattan nightclubs. There were rumors that Ann was initially Woodward Sr.'s mistress and that he passed her along to his son. Woodward Sr. did in fact set his son up with Ann much to the displeasure of his wife Elsie who thought Ann was a gold digger. The couple announced their engagement on March 6, 1943 and were married two weeks later. They had two sons, William \\"Woody\\" III (born July 1944) and James \\"Jimmy\\" (born January 1947). The Woodward marriage was reportedly turbulent. Both had affairs, drank frequently and often argued publicly. Ann also began abusing prescription drugs. Shooting and death After attending a dinner party for Wallis Simpson on October 30, 1955, Woodward and his wife returned to their home in Oyster Bay, New York. Both were nervous about reports of a prowler roaming nearby estates, including their own. The Woodwards, both avid hunters, each went to their separate bedrooms that evening with loaded shotguns. A few hours later, Ann heard a noise on the roof and went into a darkened hallway with her gun, where she saw a shadowy figure standing in front of Woodward's bedroom door. Believing the figure to be a prowler, Ann fired the gun, killing her husband. Upon arriving at the home, police found Ann holding her husband's body and sobbing. She immediately confessed that she had shot her husband because she thought he was a burglar. Police later arrested a man named Paul Wirths, who admitted that he had attempted to break into the Woodwards' house on the night of the shooting. Wirths claimed that he had been scared by the sound of gunshots and then left. Woodward's mother Elsie, however, believed that the shooting had been deliberate but publicly supported her daughter-in-law in order to avoid further scandal. There was speculation that Elsie had paid Wirths to say he had attempted to break into the home in an effort to exonerate Ann. Three weeks after the shooting, Ann testified before a grand jury and maintained that the shooting was an accident and that she thought her husband was an intruder. The grand jury determined that no crime had been committed. Aftermath The shooting of Woodward immediately became a cause c√©l√®bre and was detailed extensively by the mainstream media and tabloid newspapers. Life magazine called the episode \\"The Shooting of the Century\\". The story was also frequently gossiped about within the Woodwards' social circle, who speculated that Ann intentionally shot her husband to get his money. Despite the fact that she was never charged and was cleared of wrongdoing by a grand jury, Ann was banished from high society. The tale followed Ann everywhere and people continued to speculate about her guilt. She spent her remaining years traveling and having relationships with younger men. The case was brought back to public attention when, in 1975, chapters of author Truman Capote's novel Answered Prayers were set to be published in Esquire magazine's November issue. The book features thinly veiled characters that are based on Capote's friends in high society. Capote was an acquaintance of Ann and had become convinced that she was guilty of murder (he nicknamed her \\"Bang Bang\\"). Capote created a character based on Ann named \\"Ann Hopkins\\", who is described as a bigamist and \\"cold blooded murderess\\" who shoots her husband after the two arrive home one night from a party. Ann Hopkins also tells police that she mistook her husband for a burglar when, in reality, she kills her husband because he confronted her with evidence that she was having an affair and asked for a divorce. Upon learning of the impending publication of Answered Prayers, Ann Woodward consumed a cyanide pill on October 9, 1975. \\"Well, that's that\\", said her mother-in-law, Elizabeth Woodward, \\"she shot my son, and Truman just murdered her, and so now I suppose we don't have to worry about that anymore.\\"Braudy, p. 414 However, Ann's friends said that she was already suffering from severe depression, which Capote's story exacerbated. Both of the couple's children, William \\"Woody\\" III and James \\"Jimmy\\" Woodward, were asleep at the family home at the time of the shooting. Neither was awakened by the gunshot. Like their mother, gossip and speculation about their father's death followed them for the rest of their lives. Three years after Ann's suicide, Jimmy jumped to his death from a ninth-story window in 1978 at age 31. Woody also took his own life in 1999 at 54 years of age. Woodward, Ann, and their sons are buried in the Woodward family plot in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. In popular culture Truman Capote's novel Answered Prayers features a character based on Woodward's wife Ann and includes a fictionalized account of Woodward's death. Dominick Dunne's 1985 novel The Two Mrs. Grenvilles is also a fictionalized account of the shooting which was made into a television miniseries in 1987. The case was detailed in the 1992 non- fiction book This Crazy Thing Called Love by Susan Braudy. The series A Crime to Remember on Investigation Discovery featured the story of Ann and Billy Woodward in an episode named \\"Who Killed Mr. Woodward\\", which first aired on December 17, 2013. The case was made into an episode of Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice.

Times Triangle edition reprinted 1945. The story centers on love, honor, and wartime treachery in an American-run hospital in the fictional town of Chen-li, China, during the Japanese invasion. The book was the basis of a 1945 film of the same name starring Randolph Scott, Ruth Warrick, Ellen Drew, and Anthony Quinn. Plot summary Dr. Gray Thomison grew up the only son of a wealthy American family and chose to build a hospital in Chen-li, where he is the resident doctor in charge. Dr. Sara Durand is a 28-year-old American from rural Kansas in charge of the women's ward. She was brought to the hospital two years before the novel begins. Sara and Gray both speak Chinese and English. They are very committed to helping their patients, and they admire the Chinese people and their culture. Sara and Gray have worked closely together; Sara is in love with Gray but she has not told him. During an air raid. Sara and Siu-mei, a young Chinese intern, evacuate patients and babies from the women's hospital. Sara is in charge of the hospital while Gray is away fund-raising in America. Sara stays in the women's ward with the terminal patients and those who cannot be moved, while Dr. Chung, a young Chinese doctor just out of American medical school, tends patients in the men's ward. A cable from Gray tells Sara that he is bringing his new wife to Chen-li. Sara fixes up the bungalow near the hospital for the couple. Before they arrive, Chen-ta, the leader of the local guerrillas, brings Yasuda, an injured Japanese prisoner, to the hospital. He does not trust the Chinese to keep him alive. He asks Sara to operate on him and care for him. Dr. Chung assists and gives blood for Yasuda. There is an air raid the night that Gray's wife, Louise, arrives. Gray takes her to safety in the caves, then returns to the hospital to tend the male patients. She is angry and terrified. Dr Chung and Yasuda both speak to her in English. Louise is in love with Gray, but petulant and angry to be living amidst Chinese people and Japanese bombing. She does not speak Chinese and does not like the Chinese people. She wishes to return to America with Gray. Gray's cook-boy, Siao Fah, does not respect Louise and spies on her. Louise makes friends with some English-speaking men from nearby Treaty Port, including Harry Delafield, an English businessman. Dr. Chung believes the Japanese will win the war, so he makes friends with Yasuda. Yasuda promises to make Chung governor of the province after the Japanese victory.Buck, China Sky, Times Triangle edition, p. 152 Chung enlists his younger brother, Chung Third, to join Chen-ta's guerrillas to gather information for the Japanese. Chung convinces Louise to assist him in helping Yasuda send messages to the Japanese by writing letters in English to a man named Delafield. These messages stop the hospital from being bombed. Chung gives Yasuda a poison to make him appear sick and unable to be released back to Chen-ta. Siu-mei and Dr. Chung begin courting. He is attracted mainly by her wealthy family, but she falls in love. Chung brings letters to Louise for her to sign and mail. Siao Fah intercepts one letter, gives it to Sara, who gives it to Gray. Gray and Sara question whether Louise is being faithful to Gray, but nobody mentions the letter itself to Louise. Chen-ta's guerrillas begin losing battles. The citizens of Chen-li stop coming to the hospital because it is not suffering the same fate as the rest of the town. Sara and Gray are committed to helping the people and do not know what is going wrong. Siu-mei's father and five other elders from Chen-li visit Chen-ta in his hide- out. With the guerrillas losing, the elders are worried for the safety of Chen-li. Chen-ta begins to suspect Chung Third of spying, and he also lets Siu-mei's father know that he is interested in his daughter. One night, Sara discovers Dr. Chung and Yasuda discussing a map. Yasuda appears healthy. That same night, Ya-ching, a nurse in love with Chung, is spurned by him when she becomes pregnant by him. Ya-ching plans her revenge when she discovers that Chung is keeping the Japanese prisoner in the hospital by administering poison pills. She intercepts a message from Chung Third to Dr. Chung, but she does not tell anyone. She makes harmless substitute pills and gives them to Yasuda one night, then tells Siu-mei that Chung was poisoning Yasuda and using Chung Third to gather information about the guerrillas. Ya-ching witnesses Yasuda murder Dr. Chung, then drowns while returning to her own village. Nobody learns that Yasuda murdered Chung; Yasuda threw the body out a window to make it look like suicide. Louise discovers Chung's body. Gray and Siu-mei see a healthy Yasuda. Gray learns from Yasuda that Dr. Chung and Louise are passing information to the enemy.Buck, China Sky, Times Triangle edition, p. 262 Yasuda promises Gray Japanese support in exchange for safety. Siu-mei and her father travel to tell Chen-ta about Dr. Chung's treachery. Chen-ta has Chung Third killed, then he goes to the hospital to collect his prisoner. Gray sends Louise back to America and goes on working with Sara, whom he now knows he loves. The Japanese resume bombing the hospital.

Early years Born in Funchal in 1792, Ars√©nio was the son of illiterate unlucky emigrants forced to return to Madeira after a failed attempt to make their fortune in the Portuguese colony of Brazil; he soon started to work as a mason, like his father, but in 1817 he was arrested in Lisbon for joining a plot aiming to overthrow the king Jo√£o VI. Embarking for Rio de Janeiro in 1820, he changed his family name - Santos - to the pompous Pomp√≠lio Pompeu de Carpo, probably borrowing it from theatre, a juvenile passion. Deeply fascinated by Roman sonorities and connotations, Ars√©nio loved to boast of his presumed classic erudition by quoting Latin authors or evoking personalities such as Titus or Nero. However, the choice of similar names also denotes a touch of megalomania, the evidence of his need to stand out, and it can be considered as the first step towards a career based on self-promotion which culminated in the middle of the 19th century. Exile in Angola One of the most remarkable sans-culottes of his time, Ars√©nio returned to his native island where, in 1823, he was arrested and condemned to a five-year banishment in Portuguese Angola for evoking British protection in case of a secession of Madeira from Portugal, and for his incendiary words and sarcastic remarks on monarchy, church and the saints. Ars√©nio initially appealed to have his sentence commuted, hoping to serve confinement in a more welcoming location such as Portuguese Cape Verde but eventually decided to withdraw his appeal. According to Jo√£o Pedro Marques he was probably persuaded by the prospect of quick enrichment through slave trade related activities in Angola. Moreover, it has to be said that this decision could also be influenced by his network of freemason acquaintances. It seems unlikely that Pompeu de Carpo became a freemason in Portugal, which he left for Angola in 1824 to return, once again as a prisoner, only in 1845. Angolan scholar Carlos Pacheco is inclined to think that he received his initiation in jail, but Brazil is another possible option, since at least until 1834 Dom Miguel's temporary comeback to the throne compelled a relatively significant number of Portuguese liberals to flee to Rio de Janeiro. Of all the contingents of this diaspora, freemasons certainly belonged to the category most persecuted by crown and church. It‚Äôs probably in this context and thanks to his friend Tom√°s Tolentino da Silva, cleric at the Funchal cathedral and angry liberal and freemason, that Ars√©nio got acquainted with freemasonry in general and with the group of Portuguese dissidents who printed the periodical Gazeta Estrela. This publication was known in Angola since the 1820s, but it had to be read undercover because of the measures taken by the Miguelist Governor-General Nicolau de Abreu Castelo Branco, who had outlawed it \\"for referring irreverently to His Majesty the King and to the highest Portuguese authorities... and for inciting subversive elements to unleash disorder...\\" Slave trading During his confinement period Ars√©nio de Carpo served in the army, but by the end of the 1820s his military career was cut off by Governor General Nicolau de Abreu Castelo Branco and he became an innkeeper. Back then, in Angola, that was a logic choice for a political exile: inns were privileged gathering places where business, politics and plots were discussed. New ideas fecundated in Angola after the success of the liberal revolutions in Europe and South America and the local imagination was invaded by the inebriant desire of freedom. During the years following the independence of Brazil soldiers and residents were often accused by authorities of supporting \\"revolutionaries\\" (a generic name used to define liberals organized in Masonic lodges wishing the unification of Angola and Brazil). Contacts between innkeepers and slave traders were manifest, since aguardente was Angola's main import to be exchanged in the interior for slaves. Ars√©nio probably worked also as a representative for a well-established trader between 1826 and 1830. Slave traders tried to exploit the period encompassing the issue of the treaty between Britain and Portugal for the abolition of the slave trade and its coming into force before leaving for Brazil, aware of the fact that Angola would fall on hard times. It seems that Ars√©nio followed the trend: after serving his ban and after being imprisoned again because of some sonnets mocking the governor‚Äôs authority, he left Luanda bound for Recife. At least until the 1840s, when Portuguese- Brazilians from Pernambuco hastily left Brazil to settle down in Mo√ß√¢medes supported by the Portuguese Crown, Angolan and Brazilian oligarchies traded almost exclusively among themselves and Pernambuco was the main market place dealing with Luanda. After spending some years in Brazil and in the United States, Ars√©nio returned to Angola in 1837, where he started working for the slave trader Francisco Teixeira de Miranda - also known as Mirandinha. His main activities consisted in buying goods in America and distributing them to his agents, who travelled to the African interior and exchanged them for slaves. Ars√©nio promoted then the export of slaves to Brazilian markets, relying upon a web of front men who signed record books and documentation on his behalf, keeping his name unblemished. This was a risky activity: the ephemeral character of such profession was explained by the fact that officially outlawed slave traders were often no longer able to secure their business by simply bribing the authorities or buying the silence of associates who proved to be too greedy or ambitious. However, by the time of his return to Luanda, Ars√©nio was an accomplished and wealthy cosmopolitan gentleman, creating a sensation in the capital for the sophisticated luxury he liked to display. In fact, even if the abolition of the transatlantic traffic had been a serious blow to Luanda traders, instead of renouncing their luxurious lifestyles they tended to turn luxury into a powerful social weapon which, at the same time, allowed them to both confront the central government and obtain respect or recognition from the colonial authorities. Ars√©nio de Carpo, as this letter from a British emissary seems to confirm, showed the way: > \\"The only slave trader that I met in Angola lived there as a prince. That > was a professional necessity, rather than a matter of extravagance or > natural bent for luxury. A slave trader basically depends on authorities‚Äô > tolerance and benevolence: the only way to attract powerful friends is to > act as a magnate, being generous, holding parties and gatherings. It's not > different from a diplomat's life.\\" Political career By the end of the 1830s, the Portuguese government produced the first serious effort aimed at ending slave smuggling, provoking an inevitable clash with Luanda families involved in the traffic. Ars√©nio de Carpo, elected interim president of the Luanda Municipal Council in 1837, rapidly became their leader. Taking advantage of his literary skills, he wrote several times to Lisbon asking for the perpetuation of the traffic and accusing \\"overzealous ministers and ill-informed councillors\\" of unleashing an abolitionist storm over Portuguese Angola, instigated by the grim British allies. His point was that an abrupt application of the abolitionist law would have been equal to a death sentence for Portugal, Spain and Brazil. Already in his seventies and unable to bear the pressure, the Prime Minister of Portugal, Ant√≥nio de Noronha, resigned. The slave traders gained some time and, strongly backed by the Septembrist front, now in power, Ars√©nio de Carpo pursued a career in politics, presenting himself as a candidate to both the senate and the Cortes, hoping - in vain - to be elected as the representative for Angola. During this period he also managed the supply of British ships at the harbour of Luanda, profusely offering his estates to influent British friends, who apparently ignored that their man in Luanda was one of the last slave traders in the area. In 1848 he even travelled to London and paid homage to Queen Victoria. His purpose was to promote the creation of a Portuguese West Africa Company and to raise funds for the construction of a steam sawmill on the banks of the Kwanza River and a railway connecting Luanda to Calumbo. However, by the middle 1840s Portugal could no longer tolerate ambiguities, crushed as it was between the persistent pressure exerted by Britain and France in order to achieve the full application of the decree on slave trade abolition and the desperate need to affirm its authority in Africa. In 1842 a military coup in Portugal, led by Ant√≥nio Bernardo da Costa Cabral promulgated the restoration of the 1826 Constitutional Charter, abolished by the September Revolution in 1836. The Cabralist regime remained in power, with brief interruptions, until the Regeneration (1851). Cabralism is normally associated with the right wing of the liberal movement, while the previous regime - Septembrism - is usually associated with the left wing. Governor General Pedro Alexandrino da Cunha, who considered Ars√©nio de Carpo the greatest slave trader of the region and the colony‚Äôs public enemy number one, expelled him as soon as he set foot in Angola. Exile and return Ars√©nio de Carpo was forced to move to Lisbon where, backed up by Septembrist left wing press and freemasonry, he had the chance to maintain his standard of living. Discharged for lack of evidence from the accusation of slave trade and misuse of power as a member of the Luanda Municipal Council, Ars√©nio de Carpo savoured his triumph and posed a further menace to his Cabralist opponents, when he unsuccessfully presented himself for the position of Governor General of Angola. In 1849, as soon as Pedro Alexandrino da Cunha left the province, Ars√©nio de Carpo returned to Luanda, re-established his network and then tried to do the same in Brazil. Unfortunately for him, in this period the Brazilian Empire too started to take appropriate disciplinary action in order to dismantle the slave traffic. Arrested in Rio de Janeiro and expelled from the empire, Ars√©nio returned to Luanda discredited and financially ruined. Put on trial for insolvency, he was sentenced to ten years to serve in S√£o Tom√© Island on Portuguese S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. Final years Already approaching his sixties, Ars√©nio was granted the chance to be transferred to the Castle of S√£o Jorge, in Lisbon. In 1853, his conviction revoked, he was free to return to Angola. Back in Luanda, he spent his last years desperately trying to restore his discredited reputation: he published the documentation attesting to his presumed innocence and made a living out of legal trade. He never managed to get rid of the tag of slave smuggler. He died in 1869.

Background  Cui Zhiwen was born in 627, during the reign of Emperor Taizong. His family was from Xu Prefecture (Ë®±Â∑û, roughly modern Xuchang, Henan), was from the \\"Xuzhou Yanling branch \\" of the prominent Cui clan of Qinghe. His grandfather Cui Shishu (Â¥î‰∏ñÊ®û) served as the minister of agriculture, and his father Cui Yizhi (Â¥îÁæ©Áõ¥) served as a prefectural prefect.Cui's biography in the Old Book of Tang did not specify whether Cui Shishu and Cui Yizhi served during Tang or its predecessor dynasty Sui Dynasty. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 185, part 1. But the epitaph of Cui's second son Cui Qingzhi (Â¥îÊÖ∂‰πã) claimed that they served during Tang. At one point, he served as an officer in the imperial guard corps.  Local government service  During Emperor Gaozong's Linde era (664-665), Cui Zhiwen became the military advisor to the prefect of Ling Prefecture (ÈùàÂ∑û, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). At that time, within the boundaries of the prefecture were two nomadic tribes, the Hun (Ê∏æ) and the Huxue (ÊñõËñõ), who were submissive to the Tang, but nevertheless were pillaging the Han residents of the prefecture. As a result, the residents could not spend their time on agriculture, and had to take up riding and archery to defend against Hun and Huxue pillages. Cui proposed that the Hun and the Huxue be moved north of the Yellow River‚Äîa proposal that the Hun and the Huxue were unwilling to agree to, and the non-Han general Qibi Heli (Â•ëËãæ‰ΩïÂäõ) spoke on their behalf, and so Emperor Gaozong initially rejected Cui's proposal. Cui resubmitted the proposal 15 times, and eventually it was approved. When the Hun and the Huxue reached the new location, they found the pastures fertile and appreciated them. On one occasion, when the Huxue chiefs were going to the capital Chang'an to greet Emperor Gaozong, they visited Ling Prefecture and thanked Cui for his proposal, as it in fact benefited the tribes. At a later time, Cui served as the prefect of Lan Prefecture (Ëò≠Â∑û, roughly modern Lanzhou, Gansu). On one occasion, Dangxiang forces were attacking Lan Prefecture, and there were few Tang forces within the prefecture capital, causing a great panic. Cui opened up the city gates and acted as if nothing was happening, and this caused the Dangxiang forces to believe that there were troops hidden within, and therefore went past Lan Prefecture. Later, the general Quan Shancai (Ê¨äÂñÑÊâç) arrived with a relief force and defeated the Dangxiang. Much of the Dangxiang army surrendered, and Quan initially wanted to slaughter them, stopping only after Cui pointed out that it was unfair to slaughter them all and also that this may cause a violent reaction. Quan, thankful for the suggestion, wanted to give 500 of the surrendered households to Cui as personal property, and Cui declined, pointing out that his proposal was for the state's benefit, not personal benefit. Later, because of this, the remaining Dangxiang submitted to Cui.  Central government service  At a later point, Cui Zhiwen was recalled to Chang'an to serve as a secretary general of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). In 680, he was made Huangmen Shilang (ÈªÉÈñÄ‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). He was also given the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. In 681, he was made acting Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§) -- the head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor. He died in 683 and was buried with honors, with the posthumous name of Zhong (Âø†, \\"faithful\\").  Notes and references  * New Book of Tang, vol. 106. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 202, 203.

It was adapted from a story by Yitzhak Ben Ner and mostly shot on location at Kibbutz Yakum. Plot Atalia (Michal Bat-Adam) is a 40-year-old widow who lost her husband in the Six-Day War and lives on a kibbutz with her adolescent daughter (Gail Ben-Ner). Lonely and feeling outcast, she enters into a forbidden affair with her daughter's classmate, Matti (Yiptach Katzur), an idealistic 19-year-old who had been rejected by the army. Atalia is independent-minded and non- conformist, so when her affair becomes known, the kibbutz leaders have the excuse they need to ostracize her. The slow degeneration of the once- idealistic kibbutz into a puritanical society, the strait-jacket of its conservative view of masculinity, and the conformity of her daughter all provide a backdrop to Atalia's problems. Cast *Michal Bat-Adam as Atalia *Yiptach Katzur as Matti Dan Toren *Gail Ben-Ner as Netta *Yair Rubin *Tamar Amiran Significance of the name The original Athaliah was a Biblical queen of Judea, whom the Bible presents as a tyrannical usurper and idolater. Used, though not commonly, as a female first name in Israel, Atalia is a secularist name associated with the sector of Israeli society which tends to rebel against old traditions and conventions and seek new ways. This meaning is obvious to Israeli audiences, and clearly has some relevance to the film's themes.

By 1930, Wilhelm had moved with her family to California. At 21 years old, she lived in Berkeley, CA with her sister, Nina Clark in Clark's family home, along with Nina‚Äôs husband and their three children.\\"Gale Wilhelm\\" in the 1930 United States Federal Census (Year: 1930; Census Place: Berkeley, Alameda, California; Page: 15B; Enumeration District: 0321; FHL microfilm: 2339846)  Writing career  Wilhelm published several short stories in 1934 and 1935, her first appearing in Literary America. With the assistance of a literary agent, Wilhelm published We Too Are Drifting in 1935 by Random House, to many favorable reviews. In 1938, Random House published Torchlight to Valhalla, another lesbian-themed novel in which the protagonist, a young woman, is pursued by a very handsome and charming young man, but realizes her true happiness is with another young woman. Wilhelm wrote three more novels, Bring Home the Bride in 1940, The Time Between in 1942 and Never Let Me Go in 1945, all with heterosexual themes. Never Let Me Go included praise from Wilhelm's friend Carl Sandburg on the book jacket. In 1943, Wilhelm received an honorary membership in the International Mark Twain Society for her ‚Äúoutstanding contribution in the field of fiction‚Äù. Wilhelm also published stories in Colliers and Yale Review in the early 1940s, but didn't publish anything new after 1943. However, both Wilhelm's lesbian themed books were reprinted many times in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Torchlight to Valhalla was given a new name, The Strange Path, with a rather salacious cover in 1953. In 1975, Torchlight to Valhalla was reprinted by Arno Press's library edition of Homosexuality: Lesbians and Gay Men in Society, History and Literature. Wilhelm is now lauded for prose imitating, if not on par, with Hemingway‚Äôs, as well as her accomplishment in We Too Are Drifting of taking the lesbian narrative away from the root of homosexuality and instead creating a discourse on gendered and sexual dynamics in lesbian relationships that had been scarcely written about at the time. Personal life Around 1935, when We Too Are Drifting was published, Wilhelm briefly lived in New York City, before returning to California by 1940.\\"Gale Wilhelm\\" in the 1940 United States Federal Census (Year: 1940; Census Place: Oakdale, Stanislaus, California; Roll: m-t0627-00352; Page: 3A; Enumeration District: 50-39A) Wilhelm lived with Helen Hope Rudolph Page in San Francisco from 1938 until Page's death in the late 1940s. When they first started living together, they lived along with Page‚Äôs mother, and Wilhelm is written in the 1940 census as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of the household. Wilhelm's disappearance from the writing and publishing world coincided with both the death of her father in 1941, and more noticeably, with the death of Helen Page in the late 1940s. Barbara Grier spent several years attempting to locate Wilhelm. The 1984 Naiad Press edition of We Too Are Drifting included a foreword by Grier describing Wilhelm's life and pleading for any assistance from anyone who knew any information on the whereabouts of Wilhelm.Grier, Barbara. \\"Foreword\\" We Too Are Drifting.

He was the grandson of Arcas. His daughter Auge was the mother of the hero Telephus, by Heracles. His sons Amphidamas and Cepheus, and his grandson Ancaeus were Argonauts. Ancaeus was killed by the Calydonian boar. Family Aleus was the son of Apheidas whose father was Arcas, the son of Zeus and Callisto, and the eponym of Arcadia.Apollodorus, 3.8.2, 3.9.1, Pausanias, 8.4.1-2, 8.4.4, Hyginus, Fabulae 155 . Some accounts make Aleus the brother of Stheneboea, the wife of Proetus.An early genealogy in Hesiod's Catalogue of Women (Hesiod fr. 129 Merkelbach‚ÄìWest numbering, Most, pp. 148-151) has Stheneboea as the daughter of Aleus' father Apheidas (see also Apollodorus 3.9.1) but by the time of Euripides' lost tragedy Stheneboea her father is Iobates (Gantz, pp. 311-312), see Apollodorus, 2.2.1, Hyginus, Fabulae 57. Aleus succeeded his father as king of Tegea in Arcadia, and when Aepytus died, Aleus became king of all Arcadia, with Tegea as his capital.Pausanias, 8.4.3, 8.4.5, 8.4.7-8. He was said to have been the eponymous founder of the city of Alea.Pausanias, 8.23.1. From Aleus also comes, presumably, the epithet Athena Alea, whose temple at Tegea, he was said to have built.Pausanias, 8.4.8, 8.45.4. According to various accounts Aleus had three sons, Lycurgus, the Argonauts Amphidamas and Cepheus, and two daughters, Auge, and Alcidice, by either Neaera the daughter of Pereus, or Cleobule.Pausanias, 8.4.8, Apollodorus, 3.9.1-2, Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1.161-171, Hyginus, Fabulae 14 and Diodorus Siculus, 4.68.1. Of the sources given here, only Diodorus Siculus mentions Alcidice. Pausanias, gives no mother. Apollodorus names Neaera the daughter of Pereus as mother (but compare with Pausanias, 8.4.6 which says that Neaera married Autolycus), and has Amphidamas as a son of Lycurgus. Hyginus says that Cleobule was the mother of the Argonauts Amphidamas and Cepheus.  Mythology =Auge and Telephus Aleus' daughter Auge, virgin priestess of Athena Alea, was made pregnant by Heracles, and though Aleus tried to dispose of mother and child, both ended up at the court of king Teuthras in Mysia, with Auge his wife (or by some accounts his adopted daughter) and Telephus his adopted heir.Gantz, pp. 428-431; Hesiod (Pseudo), Catalogue of Women fr. 165 (Merkelbach‚ÄìWest numbering) from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri XI 1359 fr. 1 (Most, pp. 184-187, Grenfell‚ÄìHunt, pp. 52-55--this version of the myth, unlike all others, has Heracles fathering Telephus in Mysia); Alcidamas, Odysseus 16 (Garagin and Woodruff, p. 286); Hecataeus (according to Pausanias, 8.4.9); Hyginus, Fabulae 99; Diodorus Siculus, 4.33.10-12; Strabo, 12.8.2, 12.8.4, 13.1.69; Apollodorus, 2.7.4, 3.9.1 (Hesiod and Hyginus have Teuthras adopting Auge). According to one account, the Delphic oracle had warned Aleus that if his daughter had a son, then this grandson would kill Aleus' sons, so Aleus made Auge a priestess of Athena, telling her that she must remain a virgin, on pain of death.This is according to a declamation attributed to the fourth century BC orator Alcidamas, Odysseus 14-16 (Garagin and Woodruff, p. 286) which probably used Sophocles' play Aleadai as a source (see Gantz, p. 428). Alcidamas is the only source for the oracle given to Aleus (see Jebb, I, p.46, 47). As for Auge being a priestess of Athena see also, Euripides, Auge, test. iia (Hypothesis), Collard and Cropp, pp. 264-267; Apollodorus, 3.9.1; Pausanias, 8.45.4-7, 8.47.2 and 8.47.4; Moses of Chorene, Progymnasmata 3.3 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 266-267). But Heracles passing through Tegea,Alcidamas, Odysseus 14 (Garagin and Woodruff, p. 286), says that Heracles stopped at Tegea on his way to Elis to make war on Augeas; Apolodorus, 2.7.2-4 and Diodorus Siculus, 4.33 say that he was on his way back from Elis and his subsequent campaign against Hippocoon in Sparta. became enamored of Auge and while drunk had sex with her.Euripides' Auge, had Auge raped (Collard and Cropp, pp. 260, 264‚Äì265, Rosivach, pp. 43-44, Webster, p. 238-240, Winnington-Ingram, p. 333, Huys, pp. 115-116), see also Apollodorus, 2.7.4, 3.9.1, Hyginus, Fabulae 99, Pausanias, 8.47.4, Diodorus Siculus, 4.33.8, Strabo, 13.1.69, Ovid, Heroides 9.47, Moses of Chorene, Progymnasmata 3.3 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 266-267). In other versions Auge received Heracles willingly: Hesiod (Pseudo), Catalogue of Women fr. 165 (Merkelbach‚ÄìWest numbering) from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri XI 1359 fr. 1 (Most, pp. 184-187, Grenfell‚ÄìHunt, pp. 52-55), Hecataeus (according to Pausanias, 8.4.9), Quintus Smyrnaeus, 6.152-153. In some accounts, Aleus discovered that Auge was pregnant and gave her to Nauplius to be drowned,Alcidamas, Odysseus 15 (Garagin and Woodruff, p. 286), Pausanias, 8.48.7 and Diodorus Siculus, 4.33.8, which adds that Aleus did not believe Auge when she told him that Heracles was the father. Apollodorus, 3.9.1 says simply that Naupliaus was to kill Auge. Moses of Chorene, Progymnasmata 3.3 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 266-267), says that Auge was to be \\"drowned in the ocean\\", but does not mention Nauplius. but instead Nauplius sold her to Teuthras.Alcidamas, Odysseus 16 (Garagin and Woodruff, p. 286); compare with Diodorus Siculus, 4.33.10, where Nauplius gave Auge to \\"some Carians\\" who ultimately gave her to Teuthras, and Apollodorus, 2.7.4, where (contradicting 3.9.1) Aleus gave Auge to Nauplius \\"to sell far away in a foreign land; and Nauplius gave her to Teuthras\\". Others say that Auge had her baby secretly in the temple of Athena at Tegea and hid it there, but that an ensuing plague and investigation caused her to be found out,Euripides' Telephus, fr. 696 has Telephus say that Auge \\"bore me secretly\\" (Collard and Cropp (2), pp. 194-195; Page, p. 131), see also Pausanias, 8.4.9. Euripides, Auge had Auge give birth in the temple and hide it there, (see Aristophanes, Frogs 1080, with Tzetzes on Aristophanes, Frogs 1080, test. iii, Collard and Cropp, pp. 266-267, and frs. 266, 267, pp. 270-271; Webster, p. 239; Huys p. 115). Apollodorus 2.7.4, 3.9.1, says that pestilence and pollution caused the birth to be discovered, events suggested by Auge frs. 266, 267 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 260, 270-271). so Aleus put Auge and Telephus to sea in a wooden chest and cast them adrift.Hecataeus (Pausanias, 8.4.9). See also Strabo, 13.1.69, which attributes this to Euripides, if so then this would have presumably been in Euripide's Auge (see Webster, p. 238) however Strabo's attribution may be erroneous (see Collard and Cropp, p. 261). In some accounts, the infant Telephus arrives together with Auge in Mysia, where he is adopted by Teuthras.Alcidamas, Odysseus 16 (Garagin and Woodruff, p. 286); Euripides, Auge (Collard and Cropp, p. 261, Webster, pp. 238--240); Strabo, 12.8.2, 12.8.4, 13.1.69; Moses of Chorene, Progymnasmata 3.3 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 266-267). In others, Telephus is left behind in Arcadia, having been abandoned on Mount Parthenion, either by Aleus,Apollodorus, 2.7.4, 3.9.1. Moses of Chorene, Progymnasmata 3.3 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 266-267) says simply that Aleus \\"ordered Telephus to be cast out in a deserted place\\". or by Auge when she was being taken to the sea by Nauplius to be drowned;Diodorus Siculus, 4.33.9, 4.33.11. Compare with Hyginus, Fabulae 99, which has Auge abandoning Telephus on Parthenius while fleeing to Mysia. however Telephus is suckled by a deer,Sophocles, Aleadae fr. 89 (Lloyd-Jones, Sophocles Fragments p. 40-41), Apollodorus, 2.7.4, Diodorus Siculus, 4.33.11, Hyginus, Fabulae 99, 252, Pausanias, 8.48.7, 8.54.6, Quintus Smyrnaeus, 6.154-156, Moses of Chorene, Progymnasmata 3.3 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 266-267). In the Telephus frieze from the Pergamon Altar, Telephus is shown being suckled by a lioness (Heres, p. 85). and eventually reunited with Auge in Mysia, many years later.Euripides, Telephus fr. 696 (Collard and Cropp (2), pp. 194-195, Page, pp. 131-133, Webster, p. 238), Apollodorus, 3.9.1, Hyginus, Fabulae 100, Diodorus Siculus, 4.33.11-12. Some accounts have Telephus killing his maternal uncles, the sons of Aleus, thereby fulfilling the oracle, but none say how.Sophocles, Aleadae (Lloyd-Jones p. 33, Jebb I, p.47-48); Hyginus, Fabulae 244; Frazer, note to Apollodorus 2.7.4. Ancaeus When Aleus was an old man, his sons Amphidamas and Cepheus left Tegea to join Jason and the Argonauts on their quest to find the Golden Fleece. Aleus' eldest son Lycurgus stayed home to care for his father, sending his son Ancaeus in his stead. But Aleus, hoping to keep his grandson with him safe at home, hid all of Ancaeus' implements of war, and so Ancaeus went with Jason wearing a bearskin, and wielding a double-sided axe.Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1.161-171; Hyginus, Fabulae 14. Later Ancaeus joined the hunt for the Calydonian boar, but was killed when the beast gored him.Apollodorus, 1.8.2 says that Ancaeus was accompanied by Cepheus also a son of Lycurgus. Ovid, Metamorphoses 8.315, 8.391-402, 8.519, Seneca, Medea 643, Hyginus, Fabulae 173 . At the time of Pausanias, the scene was depicted on the front gable of the temple of Athena Alea at Teage, with Ancaeus shown wounded, supported by Epochus, next to his dropped axe.Pausanias, 8.45.6-7. The story of Aleus and his grandson Ancaeus shares similarities with the story told by HerodotusHerodotus, 1.34 ff.. about Croesus and his son Atys. Croesus had dreamed that Atys would be killed by a spear. Because of this, to keep Atys safe, Croesus locked away all of his son's weaponry. A wild boar began to ravage the countryside and when a hunt was organized to rid the land of the raging beast, Croeus would not let his son join. However Atys said the boar would surely not kill him using a spear. So Croesus relented, and Atys was killed by a spear thrown by a fellow hunter.During the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, Peleus accidentally kills Eurytion in a similar manner: Apollodorus, 1.8.2, 3.13.2.

Although her photos document a wide spectrum of Sicilian life, she is best known for her work on the Mafia. Biography Battaglia was born in Palermo, Sicily. Married at 16, she took up photojournalism after her divorce in 1971, while raising three daughters. She picked up a camera when she found that she could better sell her articles if they were accompanied by photographs and slowly discovered a passion for photography. In 1974, after a period in Milan during which she met her long-time partner Franco Zecchin, she returned to Sicily to work for the left-wing L'Ora newspaper in Palermo until it was forced to close in 1992.Letizia Battaglia: Her photographs awakened awareness of the Sicilian Mafia, by Alexander Stille, Courage, Media Studies Journal, Volume 14, Number 2, Spring/Summer 2000 Battaglia took some 600,000 images as she covered the territory for the paper. She documented the ferocious internal war of the Mafia, and its assault on civil society. She sometimes found herself at the scene of four or five different murders in a single day. Battaglia and Zecchin produced many of the iconic images that have come to represent Sicily and the Mafia beyond Italy. She photographed the dead so often that she once said, \\"Suddenly, I had an archive of blood.\\"Testimony of a Keen Witness To Sicily's Enduring Sorrow, The New York Times, December 16, 2001 Battaglia also became involved in women's and environmental issues. For several years she stopped taking pictures and officially entered the world of politics. From 1985 to 1991 she held a seat on the Palermo city council for the Green Party, from 1991 to 1996 she was a Deputy at the Sicilian Regional Assembly for The Network. She was instrumental in saving and reviving the historic center of Palermo. For a time she ran a publishing house, Edizioni della Battaglia, and co-founded a monthly journal for women, Mezzocielo. She is involved in working for the rights of women and, most recently, prisoners. In 1993, when prosecutors in Palermo indicted Giulio Andreotti, who had been prime minister of Italy seven times, the police searched Battaglia's archives and found two 1979 photographs of Andreotti with an important Mafioso, Nino Salvo, he had denied knowing. Aside from the accounts of turncoats, these pictures were the only physical evidence of this powerful politician's connections to the Sicilian Mafia. Battaglia herself had forgotten having taken the photograph. Its potential significance was apparent only 15 years after it was taken. In 1985 she received the W. Eugene Smith Grant in Humanistic Photography. In 1999 she received the Photography Lifetime Achievement of the Mother Jones International Fund for Documentary Photography. In 2007 she received the Dr. Erich Salomon Award, a 'lifetime achievement' award of the German Society for Photography (DGPh). Salomon-Preis f√ºr Letizia Battaglia, Fokussiert, September 5, 2007 Press release, Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Photographie, August 2007 In 2009, she was given the Cornell Capa Infinity Award by the International Center of Photography. In 2005, she appeared in the documentary Excellent Cadavers based on the 1995 book by Alexander Stille. Battaglia plays the role of survivor and passionate eyewitness.'Excellent Cadavers,' an Italian Documentary, Dissects the Mafia, The New York Times Movie Review, July 12, 2006 Battaglia has a cameo appearance in the 2008 Wim Wenders film Palermo Shooting as a photographer.

She was launched from Germaniawerft's Kiel shipyard on 17 December 1914 and commissioned on 29 June 1915. The \\"G\\" in G37 refers to the shipyard at which she was constructed. G37 was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Three oil-fired water- tube boilers fed steam to 2 sets of Germania steam turbines rated at , giving a speed of . of fuel oil was carried, giving a range of at and at . Armament consisted of three 8.8 cm SK L/45 naval guns in single mounts, together with six 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes with two fixed single tubes forward and 2 twin mounts aft. Up to 24 mines could be carried. The ship had a complement of 87 officers and men. Service On 16‚Äì18 November 1915, G37, part of the Eleventh Torpedo Boat Half Flotilla, took part in operations by 18 torpedo boats in the Skagerrak to intercept merchant shipping. On 10 February 1916, G37 took part in a sortie by 25 torpedo boats of the 2nd, 6th and 9th Torpedo- boat Flotillas into the North Sea. The sortie led to an encounter between several German torpedo boats and British minesweepers off the Dogger Bank, which resulted in the British minesweeper being torpedoed and sunk by ships of the 2nd Flotilla. G37 was assigned to the Sixth Torpedo Boat Flotilla, Twelfth Half-Flotilla, of the High Seas Fleet at the Battle of Jutland. Early in the battle, she fell astern of the rest of her flotilla, because she had temporarily lost power from a boiler, and fired two torpedoes at British light cruisers at about 17:44 CET (i.e. 16:44 GMT). The 12th Half Flotilla attempted a torpedo attack against the battlecruisers of the British 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron at about 19:00 CET. While fired two torpedoes and and both fired a single torpedo at the battlecruisers, the light cruisers of the German 2nd Scouting Group fouled G37s line of fire, and instead she fired a single torpedo at British destroyers. None of the torpedoes from this attack, or one immediately afterwards from the 9th Flotilla, hit their targets. The battlecruiser had been badly damaged by shells from British battlecruisers, and G37 was one of seven German torpedo boats tasked with escorting L√ºtzow. Heavy flooding forced the crew of L√ºtzow to abandon ship at 01:55 CET, 1 June. G37, together with , and V45 came alongside to take off L√ºtzows crew before the battlecruiser was scuttled by G38. Later that night (at about 03:25 CET) the four torpedo boats took part in a brief engagement with the British destroyers and in which neither side received further damage. The four torpedo boats had another encounter with British forces at 04:25 CET when they encountered the light cruiser and the destroyers , , and . G40 was damaged by a shell from Champion and had to be taken under tow by G37. On 18 August 1916, the High Seas Fleet sailed on a sortie to bombard Sunderland in order to draw out units of the British Fleet and destroy them. G37 formed part of the Seventh Torpedo Boat Flotilla, but no general fleet engagement took place, despite both the High Seas Fleet and the British Grand Fleet being at sea at the same time. On 22 January 1917, 11 torpedo boats of the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, including G37 left Helgoland to reinforce the German torpedo forces in Flanders. The British Admiralty knew about this transfer due to codebreaking by Room 40, and ordered the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers to intercept the German torpedo boats. During the night of 22‚Äì23 January, the 6th Flotilla encountered three British light cruisers (, and ). The Germans attempted a torpedo attack against the British cruisers, but were driven off by heavy fire and broke off the attack behind a smoke-screen. , leader of the flotilla, was hit by three shells, one of which jammed her rudder, forcing her to move in a circle, resulting in colliding with V69, badly damaging both torpedo boats, although both survived. The remainder of the flotilla, including G37, escaped unharmed and continued on to Flanders. On the night of 25/26 February, the Flanders-based torpedo boats launched a three-pronged attack against Allied shipping in the English Channel and the Dover Barrage. Six ships of the 6th Flotilla, including G37 were to attack the Dover Barrage, while other torpedo boats were to attack shipping on The Downs and off the mouth of the River Maas. The 6th Flotilla ran into the British destroyer which was patrolling the Barrage. While the German ships attacked Laverock with heavy gunfire and torpedoes (one of which hit the British destroyer but failed to explode), the British destroyer only received light damage, and the 6th Flotilla turned back for Zeebrugge, with the drifters of the Dover Barrage unharmed. The Flanders-based flotillas attacked again on the night of 17/18 March. Seven torpedo boats of the 6th Flotilla (, , , G37, , and ) were to attack the Dover Barrage north of the Sandettie Bank, with five torpedo boats of the 1st Zeebrugge Half-Flotilla attacking south of the Sandettie Bank, and four ships of the 2nd Zeebrugge Half-Flotilla operating against the Downs. The 6th Flotilla met the British destroyer on crossing the Dover Barrage. Paragon challenged the German torpedo boats, which replied with gunfire and torpedoes, Paragon being struck by torpedoes from S49 and G46 and sunk. The 12th Half-Flotilla (including G37) became separated from the rest of the 6th Flotilla and therefore returned to base, while the remaining three ships of the flotilla continued on, torpedoing and badly damaging the destroyer before returning to base, while a merchant ship was sunk by the 2nd Zeebrugge Half-Flotilla east of the Downs. The 6th Flotilla returned to Germany on 29 March 1917. On 4 November 1917 at 04:55 hours, G37 struck a mine, part of a minefield laid on the night of 30/31 May 1917 by the British destroyer and the light cruisers and , in the southern North Sea off Walcheren Island, Netherlands () and sank.

They speak a Nilo-Saharan language that is not related to those of their Nilo-Saharan neighbors (Gumuz, Uduk). Their total Ethiopian population is about 183,000 people.  History  Their origins are to be found in Sennar in eastern Sudan, in the area of the former Funj sultanate (1521-1804). During the 16th or 17th century, they migrated to western Ethiopia, in the area of the modern Benishangul-Gumuz Region. \\"Benishangul\\" is an Arabicized form of the original name Bela Shangul, meaning \\"Rock of Shangul\\". This refers to a sacred stone located in a mountain in the Menge woreda, one of the places where the Berta originally settled when they arrived to Ethiopia.On the \\"Rock of Shangul\\", see Alessandro Triulzi, \\"Trade, Islam, and the Mahdia in Northwestern Wallagga, Ethiopia\\", Journal of African History, 16 (1975), p. 57 and the sources there cited. Their arrival in Ethiopia was marked by strong territorial conflict among the diverse shangul communities. For this reason, and for protecting themselves from slave raids coming from Sudan, the shangul communities decided to establish their villages in naturally-defended hills and mountains, amidst rocky outcrops. Due to this harsh topography, houses and granaries were raised over stone pillars. German traveler Ernst Marno described shangul architecture and villages in his Reisen im Gebiete des Blauen und Weissen Nil (Vienna, 1874). The shangul of Benishangul were incorporated into Ethiopia only in 1896. After conflicts and raids receded during the 20th century, the Shangul people moved to the valleys, where their villages are located today. During the 19th century, the area of Benishangul was divided in several sheikhdoms (Fadasi, Komosha, Gizen, Asosa), the most powerful of which was ruled by Sheikh Khoyele at the end of the 19th century.  Customs  After several centuries of Arab Sudanese influence, the Berta are now mostly Muslim and many speak fluent Arabic. Due to their intermarriage with Arab traders, some Berta were called Watawit -the local name for \\"bat\\", meaning that they were a mix of two very different groups. However, they still have traditional customs that are similar to those of their Nilo-Saharan neighbors. For example, there still exist ritual specialists called neri, who have healing and divination powers. They are the ones who know how to deal with evil spirits (shuman). Rain-making rituals are also found among the Berta, as among other Nilo-Saharan and Nilotic communities. In their wedding ceremonies music is played by males with large calabash trumpets (was'a). The groom arrives to the wedding on a donkey and carrying a bang (throwing stick) in his hand. After the wedding, the husband has to build a hut and live in his wife's village for a year or more, tilling their father-in-law's land. Divorce is accepted. The Berta practice scarification, usually three vertical lines on each cheek, which they consider to be symbols of God (each line is interpreted as the initial letter of Allah, the Arabic alif). Most Berta are mixed farmers also involved in livestock raising, trade, beekeeping, and coffee cultivation. Their staple food is sorghum, with which they make porridge in ceramic vessels. They also make beer with sorghum. Beer is prepared in large ceramic containers called awar and is'u. Working parties play an important role in Berta society. When somebody wants to build a house or cultivate a field, he calls his neighbors for help and provides beer and food.

Early life and education Ziedonis was born in the Sloka fisherman's district of J≈´rmala, Latvia. He was educated at the University of Latvia in Riga where he earned a degree in philology in 1959. He earned an additional degree in advanced literature in Moscow in 1964. As a young man, Ziedonis worked in a wide variety of jobs ranging from librarian to road construction worker and from teacher to literary editor. Career and literary works Ziedonis published his first major collection of poetry 'Zemes un sap≈Üu smilts' ('Sand of earth and dreams') in 1961. By the end of the decade, he had established himself as among the preeminent voices of Latvian literature through publishing three more important collections of poetry: 'Sirds dinamƒ´ts' (1963, 'Heart's Dynamite'), 'Motocikls' (1965, 'Motorcycle'), and 'Es ieeju sevƒ´' (1968, 'I Enter Myself'). During the same period, Ziedonis began publishing work besides poetry. His 1965 Dzejnieka dienasgrƒÅmata (1965, A Poet's Diary) and two years later his (1967, Along the Foamy Path) established his prose writing reputation as well. His reputation established, Ziedonis rose to become the Chairman of the Writers' Union Board and Chairman of the Latvian Culture Foundation. Ziedonis considered defecting to the West but chose to remain in Latvia to preserve from what he perceived as Russian destruction the best of Latvian literature in the National Library.Skujins, Z: \\"Imants Ziedonis Opens Clocks\\", World Literature Today, Spring 1998. In the 1970s Ziedonis became interested in the roots of Latvian folk culture. To this end, he built a house in the countryside outside the town of MurjƒÅ≈Üi. The very act of building a house as private property was a defiant act in Latvia during the Soviet occupation, so the choice to do so was in some respects a political statement. Ziedonis, however, emphasized his desire to establish his roots with the countryside. There he wrote his three books of lyrical and ironic miniatures, \\"EpifƒÅnijas\\" (\\"Epiphanies\\", 1971, 1974, 1994), which can be identified as prose poetry. It was during this period that he began to collect and write folk tales and children's books. These included KrƒÅsainƒÅs pasakas (1973, Colored Tales), LƒÅƒçu pasaka (1976, Tales of Bears) and Blƒì≈Üas un pasakas (1980, Twaddle and Tales). His children's book Kas tas ir ‚Äî kolhozs? (1984, What is a Kolkhoz?) directly addressed the kolkhoz or Soviet collective farm in an era when the collective system was under increasing scrutiny in Latvia as elsewhere in the USSR. Ziedonis maintained an odd balance between dissidence and acceptance in the Soviet occupation era. As one of the most open voices in poetry during the Soviet occupation era, he repeatedly risked appearing as a dissident to the Soviet leaders. A leading voice in the perestroika period toward the end of the Soviet occupation era, Ziedonis was an outspoken advocate of freer expression and the growth of the Latvian Cultural Fund. This was particularly evident in his first published collection of essays Garainis, kas veicina vƒÅrƒ´≈°anos (1976, Steam That Promotes Boiling). At the same time, Ziedonis never fully broke with the Soviet authorities. Indeed, in 1977, the year following his inflammatory essays, the Soviet government awarded him the National Poet of Soviet Latvia prize. Ziedonis was a prominent member of Atmoda, the re-awakening movement in Latvia, he was elected to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia in 1990 and was one of the Supreme Council members who voted for the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of Latvia. Awards and honors Following Latvian independence from the Soviet Union, Ziedonis in 1995 was awarded the Order of the Three Stars, Latvia's highest honor for civic merit to the nation. He has also been nominated for The Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award ‚Äì the world's largest prize for children's literature. He died in 2013. Ziedonis was held in highest esteem, indicated by the fact that the prime minister ordered the formation of a special committee for organization of the funeral. He is buried in Ragaciema Cemetery, Lapmezciema County, Engure Region. The charity fund Viegli,http://fondsviegli.lv/ created in 2010, to aid the realization of the ideas of Imants Ziedonis, has released first an album of songs with words by Ziedonis simply entitled Viegli (Easily). The second album, entitled Vakars (Evening), was released in 2011, and featured a number of different Latvian musicians. The stamp Imants Ziedonis Will Bloom Eternally was the winner in the stamp design contest organized in social networks by Latvijas Pasts and in 2014. It was realised by a graphic designer Andra Petersone, and the portrait of Ziedonis that is depicted on the stamp is based on the poet's photograph by Leonid Tugalev, which took the first place in an international photo contest in Spain in 1982.

Written by Shonda Rhimes and directed by Mark Tinker, the episode was originally broadcast with \\"Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response\\", in a two-hour season finale event on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on May 15, 2006. Grey's Anatomy centers around a group of young doctors in training. In this episode, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and her fellow interns have to plan a prom for Dr. Richard Webber's (James Pickens, Jr.) niece Camille Travis (Tessa Thompson). Further storylines include Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) recovering from his gunshot wound and Denny Duquette's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) death following his seemingly-successful heart transplant surgery. The episode marked Sara Ramirez's (Dr. Callie Torres) final appearance with recurring billing, as she would be upgraded to a series regular in season three. Morgan, Ramirez, Thompson, Brooke Smith, Sarah Utterback, Loretta Devine and Chris O'Donnell reprised their roles as guest stars, while Hallee Hirsh and Tiffany Hines made their first and only appearances. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics, who disapproved of the storyline involving Grey and Shepherd and the show's lack of repercussions for the interns, but lauded Dr. Cristina Yang's (Sandra Oh) storyline along with Heigl's performance. \\"Losing My Religion\\" was also included in several \\"best episodes\\" lists. Upon its initial airing, the episode was viewed 22.50 million Americans, garnered an 8.0/22 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, ranking fifth for the week in terms of viewership, and registering as the week's second highest-rated drama. Plot Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) and Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) finish Dr. Preston Burke's (Isaiah Washington) surgery to remove a pseudo-aneurysm in the subclavian artery that threatened the functioning of his arm and which was caused by a gunshot wound. At the same time, Dr. Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) successfully transplants a heart into Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). The interns face Webber, who orders them to plan a prom for his dying niece, Camille Travis (Tessa Thompson), until the one who cut Duquette's left ventricular assist device (LVAD) comes forward. With the instructions of Camille's friends, Claire (Hallee Hirsh) and Natalie (Tiffany Hines), they prepare the prom as they each struggle with their own personal problems. Trying to recover from his injury, Burke finds a tremor in his right hand. Dr. Meredith Grey's (Ellen Pompeo) love interest Dr. Finn Dandrige (Chris O'Donnell), the vet of Doc‚Äîthe dog she shares with Shepherd‚Äîinforms her that Doc has had several seizures due to his bone cancer and that she and Shepherd have to make a decision. Webber interrogates the interns individually about Duquette's LVAD wire, but only learns about their personal problems instead. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) finally accepts Duquette's marriage proposal. At Dandridge's office, Grey and Shepherd, joined by Dr. Addison Montgomery-Shepherd (Kate Walsh), decide to put Doc to sleep. The hospital staff begins to arrive at the prom and Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Dr. George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) discuss the status of their relationship, which leads to the former admitting her love and commitment. During the dance, Grey and Shepherd escape Dandridge and Montgomery to have a heated argument that leads to sexual intercourse. In the meantime, as Duquette waits for Stevens alone in his room, he experiences a sudden sense of pain, and unexpectedly dies. While Webber is sitting in the operating room gallery and reflecting on his career, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) announces Duquette's death. News of the death spreads, and the interns hurry to his room to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, clinging to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, the cause of his death is revealed to have been a blood-clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and hugging her as she cries. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who did not know how to handle Burke's situation, goes to his room and puts her hand on his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program. After everyone begins going their separate ways, Grey remains torn on who she should follow: Shepherd or Dandridge. Production The episode was written by series creator Shonda Rhimes and directed by filmmaker Mark Tinker, while Ed Ornelas edited it. It was the last episode to feature Sara Ramirez as a guest star, as she began receiving star billing in the season three premiere. Morgan, Ramirez, Thompson, Smith, Utterback, Devine, and O'Donnell reprised their roles as Duquette, Torres, Travis, Hahn, Harper, Adele, and Dandridge, respectively, while Hirsh and Hines made their first and only appearances as Claire and Natalie, respectively. The soundtrack of the episode consisted of Pete Droge's \\"Under the Waves\\", Dressy Bessy's \\"Side 2\\", Amos Lee's \\"Colors\\", Masha Qrella's \\"Destination Vertical\\", Kate Havnevik's \\"Grace\\", and Snow Patrol's \\"Chasing Cars\\". The American profile of Northern Irish band Snow Patrol increased after their single was used in this episode. Lead singer Gary Lightbody was initially uncertain about licensing a song for the soundtrack, but has since admitted that the publicity had a positive effect. Rhimes entitled the episode \\"Losing My Religion\\" because she felt \\"that is what happens to each intern in this episode. Each intern lets go of the things they've held onto all season. George lets go of loving Meredith. Cristina lets go of her well-checked emotions. Izzie is forced to let go of her idealism, and that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex lets go of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith ... well, Meredith just lets go.\\" The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the 5 main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: \\"this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages into the hands of the actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue.\\" The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes said she wanted to do it since the beginning of the season. Reception \\"Losing My Religion\\" was originally broadcast on May 15, 2006 in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), along with \\"Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response\\". The episodes were watched by a total of 22.50 million Americans. It represents a slight decrease in comparison to the episode airing the previous night, \\"17 Seconds\\", which garnered 22.60 million viewers. The episode received an 8.0/22 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, ranking fifth for the week in terms of viewership, and registering as the week's second highest-rated drama. The episode's rating outranked CBS's The New Adventures of Old Christine and CSI: Miami, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC)'s The Apprentice, and the Fox Broadcasting Company's 24. The episode received mixed reviews among critics. Joel Keller of The Huffington Post expressed mixed opinions on the episode, putting the emphasis on Yang's development, whom he deemed \\"transformed\\" by the end of the episode. He applauded Torres' evolution throughout the episode, and also praised Heigl's performance and dress. Keller criticized the non-realism of the punishment the interns received, Grey and Shepherd's storyline being tiresome, and the cliffhanger, calling it a \\"lame clich√©\\". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Maureen Ryan gave a mixed review of the episode, stating: \\"overall, the whole thing just fell a little flat.\\" Though Ryan appreciated the scene of Doc's death, she was critical of Torres' underdevelopment, her lack of chemistry with O'Malley, and her prom dress. Abigail Chao of Television Without Pity was also critical of Torres' dress, but liked Heigl's pink dress. She also applauded Karev's intervening to calm Stevens down, and agreed that Grey's cliffhanger was not good. Eyder Peralta of The Houston Chronicle criticized Stevens' ethics for cutting Duquette's LVAD wire, writing that she \\"should not be practising medicine\\". Alan Sepinwall, a former television columnist for The Star-Ledger, commented favorably on Karev \\"finally displaying some humanity\\" in the scene following Duquette's death. He was critical of Shepherd's arc, however, and on the absence of severe consequences for Stevens having cut the LVAD wire, an action he called \\"insane and dangerous\\". This episode was included on the list for the \\"25 Sexiest TV Shows on DVD\\" by magazine Entertainment Weekly. It was also listed in Entertainment Weekly \\"20 Unforgettable Proms\\" and in StarPulse's \\"Top 10 TV Proms\\". AOL TV placed the hook-up scene involving Grey and Shepherd on its Top 20 Of TV's Sexiest Scenes. In 2009, TV Guide ranked \\"Losing My Religion\\" #63 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes. In 2013, the magazine named Duquette's death one of TV's Most Heartbreaking Deaths. In December 2011, Wetpaint named \\"Losing My Religion\\" one of the 5 best episodes of the series.

Starting as a follower of Edwin Lutyens, in the 1920s he gained a reputation as a designer of country houses. He turned towards architectural modernism in the 1930s, though in doing so he did not abandon his appreciation of natural materials. His plans made abundant use of curving lines. He also became known for luxurious interior decoration. Hill was the architect of the Midland Hotel in Morecambe, Lancashire and of the British pavilion at the Paris Exposition of 1937. Early years Oliver Hill was born at 89 Queen's Gate, Kensington, to William Neave Hill, a London businessman, and his wife Kate Ida n√©e Franks. The family had roots in Aberdeen and he retained a lifelong affection for Scotland, choosing to serve in the London Scottish Regiment during World War I.Powers (1989), pp. 5‚Äì7. Moor Close, Berkshire Following the suggestion of Edwin Lutyens, his early mentor, Hill's first step towards architecture was to gain experience in a builder's yard.Guise and Brook (2008), pp. 20‚Äì21. In 1907 he became a pupil of architect William Flockhart. An interest in garden design was stimulated by a visit to the Garden of Eden in Venice, the garden of Frederic and Caroline Eden. She subsequently introduced him to her sister, the garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, who became a friend. Setting up his own office, Hill's first major project (1910‚Äì14) was Moor Close, in Berkshire, where he created a complementary composition of terraces and gardens around a Jacobethan house which he extended. Between the wars In the 1920s Hill produced a number of Arts and Crafts style country houses, the best-known being The Thatched House in Warwickshire, Woodhouse Copse in Surrey, and Cock Rock in Devon.Powers (1989), p. 11. This group of three closely related designs, in which Hill produced distinctive combinations of locally sourced materials such as weatherboarding, thatch, brick and stone, was important in establishing his early reputation as a country house designer. The influence of Lutyens continued to be felt in Hill's country houses, and some of his town houses of the period have also been called \\"Lutyenesque\\".Powers (1989), pp. 17‚Äì18. Hill turned towards architectural modernism in the 1930s. On visiting the Stockholm Exhibition of 1930 he was impressed by the works of Gunnar Asplund. He was also influenced by his friend Christopher Hussey, Raymond McGrath and Mansfield Forbes. His work continued to be marked by his appreciation of the textures of natural materials,Powers (1989), pp. 25‚Äì28. as well as by a predeliction for curving lines, including very free or irregular ones.Powers (2005), pp. 140‚Äì41. Midland Hotel, central tower Hill's first major modernist project was Joldwynds in Surrey. The dominant feature of the Joldwynds plan, a curving front with a central, large-windowed circular stair- tower, recurred at the Midland Hotel in Lancashire, and at Holthanger, now known as Cherry Hill in Surrey. Landfall in Dorset had a circular stairhall as the house's central feature.Powers (1989), p. 29. The Prospect Inn in Kent was an oval-shaped pub, with a serpentine wall around the car park. Hill was the lead designer for the Frinton Park Estate, an attempt at a modernist settlement in Essex, where a number of his curving buildings were constructed before the project failed. He was also the lead designer for the 1933 Exhibition of British Industrial Art in relation to the Home, in Dorland Hall, London, a successful showpiece for modernism conceived by Christopher Hussey, and also for the similar exhibition at Dorland Hall the following year.Powers (1989), pp. 36‚Äì40. Hill also became known for luxurious interior decoration. The architectural historian Alan Powers has identified his style of decoration as \\"transitional modern\\",Powers (2008), pp. 38‚Äì41. or \\"Vogue Regency\\",Powers (1989), pp. 19‚Äì22. two roughly equivalent terms for a form of Art Deco.Powers (2008), p. 63. The best-known example was the second Gayfere House in Westminster (that is, the second house of that name built by Hill, for the same client), which featured mirrored walls and ceilings. Others were 40 and 41 Chelsea Square, and Upper Terrace House. He collaborated with the interior decorator Syrie Maugham, the creator of the \\"all-white room\\", in a redecoration of her house, 213 King's Road. He designed the British pavilion at the Paris Exposition of 1937.Powers (1989), pp. 75‚Äì76. When Frank Pick, the chairman of the Council for Art and Industry, appointed Hill as architect for the pavilion he told him to avoid modernism and to focus on the presentation of traditional crafts, and there was considerable criticism that the result was underwhelming compared to the other pavilions' nationalistic projections of strength. The British budget for its pavilion was only a small fraction of Germany's, however. The main architectural element of Hill's pavilion was a simple white box, but it contained a spiral ramp circling the display space, and other elements of the complex also contained prominent circular features. Later years Hill blamed Adolf Hitler for ending his career, as his post- war career consisted of many designs but few built works. His designs covered a wide array of styles and his last house built in the 1960s, The Priory at Long Newnton, Gloucestershire, harked back to the 17th century. Personal life Hill was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1923. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and a Fellow of the Institute of Landscape Architects. He kept a London townhouse first at 19 West Eaton Place, and later at 35 Cliveden Place. He also maintained a country residence, first from the mid 1920s at Valewood Farm, in Haslemere, Surrey,Powers (1989), p. 24. and then from 1948 at Daneway House, the former house and workshop of the Arts and Crafts architect-designer Ernest Gimson, in Sapperton, Gloucestershire.Powers (1989), p. 55.

The aerodynamic control and stabilisation functions in both pitch and roll are incorporated into the main wing. A tailless type may still have a conventional vertical fin (vertical stabilizer) and rudder.Torenbeek, E.; Advanced Aircraft Design: Conceptual Design, Analysis and Optimization of Subsonic Civil Airplanes, Wiley (2013), Section 6.2.3. Plan View Classification, Category B Planar monoplane single body: \\"B4 ‚Äì Tailless aircraft: lacks a horizontal stabiliser but does have a vertical tail.\\"Kroes, Rardon & Nolan; Aircraft Basic Science, Eighth Edition, McGraw-Hill (2013), Page 101: \\"A flying wing is a tailless aircraft that ... may have some small additions ... such as ... vertical stabilizers ....\\"Nickel, K.; and Wohlfahrt, W.; Tailless Aircraft in theory and Practice, ButterHeinem (1994). Theoretical advantages of the tailless configuration include low parasitic drag as on the Horten H.IV soaring glider and good stealth characteristics as on the Northrop B-2 Spirit bomber. The most successful tailless configuration has been the tailless delta, especially for combat aircraft, though the most familiar tailless delta is the Concorde airliner. NASA has recently used the 'tailless' description for the novel X-36 research aircraft which has a canard foreplane but no vertical fin. Flying wings A flying wing is a tailless design which also lacks a distinct fuselage, having the pilot, engines, etc. located directly in or on the wing. Aerodynamics=Drag A conventional fixed-wing aircraft has a horizontal stabiliser surface separate from its main wing. This extra surface causes additional drag requiring a more powerful engine, especially at high speeds. If longitudinal (pitch) stability and control can be achieved by some other method (see below), the stabiliser can be removed and the drag reduced. Longitudinal stability A tailless aeroplane has no separate horizontal stabilizer. Because of this the aerodynamic center of an ordinary wing would lie ahead of the aircraft's center of gravity, creating instability in pitch. Some other method must be used to move the aerodynamic center backward and make the aircraft stable. There are two main ways for the designer to achieve this, the first being developed by the pioneer aviator J. W. Dunne. Sweeping the wing leading edge back, either as a swept wing or delta wing, and reducing the angle of incidence of the outer wing section allows the outer wing to act like a conventional tailplane stabiliser. If this is done progressively along the span of the outer section, it is called tip washout. Dunne achieved it by giving the wing upper surface a conical curvature. In level flight the aircraft should be trimmed so that the tips do not contribute any lift: they may even need to provide a small downthrust. This reduces the overall efficiency of the wing, but for many designs - especially for high speeds - this is outweighed by the reductions in drag, weight and cost over a conventional stabiliser. The long wing span also reduces manoeuvrability, and for this reason Dunne's design was rejected by the British Army. An alternative is the use of low or null pitching moment airfoils, seen for example in the Horten series of sailplanes and fighters. These use an unusual wing aerofoil section with reflex or reverse camber on the rear or all of the wing. With reflex camber the flatter side of the wing is on top, and the strongly curved side is on the bottom, so the front section presents a high angle of attack while the back section is more horizontal and contributes no lift, so acting like a tailplane or the washed-out tips of a swept wing. Reflex camber can be simulated by fitting large elevators to a conventional airfoil and trimming them noticeably upwards; the center of gravity must also be moved forward of the usual position. Due to the Bernoulli effect, reflex camber tends to create a small downthrust, so the angle of attack of the wing is increased to compensate. This in turn creates additional drag. This method allows a wider choice of wing planform than sweepback and washout, and designs have included straight and even circular (Arup) wings. But the drag inherent in a high angle of attack is generally regarded as making the design inefficient, and only a few production types, such as the Fauvel and Marske Aircraft series of sailplanes, have used it. A simpler approach is to overcome the instability by locating the main weight of the aircraft a significant distance below the wing, so that gravity will tend to maintain the aircraft in a horizontal attitude and so counteract any aerodynamic instability, as in the paraglider. However, in practice this is seldom sufficient to provide stability on its own, and typically is augmented by the aerodynamic techniques described. A classic example is the Rogallo wing hang glider, which uses the same sweepback, washout and conical surface as Dunne. Stability can also be provided artificially. There is a trade-off between stability and maneuverability. A high level of maneuverability requires a low level of stability. Some modern hi-tech combat aircraft are aerodynamically unstable in pitch and rely on fly-by-wire computer control to provide stability. The Northrop B-2 Spirit flying wing is an example. Pitch control Many early designs failed to provide effective pitch control to compensate for the missing stabiliser. Some examples were stable but their height could only be controlled using engine power. Others could pitch up or down sharply and uncontrollably if they were not carefully handled. These gave tailless designs a reputation for instability. It was not until the later success of the tailless delta configuration in the jet age that this reputation was widely accepted to be undeserved. The solution usually adopted is to provide large elevator and/or elevon surfaces on the wing trailing edge. Unless the wing is highly swept, these must generate large control forces, as their distance from the aerodynamic center is small and the moments less. Thus a tailless type may experience higher drag during pitching manoeuvres than its conventional equivalent. In a highly swept delta wing the distance between trailing edge and aerodynamic centre is larger so enlarged surfaces are not required. The Dassault Mirage tailless delta series and its derivatives were among the most widely used combat jets. However even in the Mirage, pitch control at the high angles of attack experienced during takeoff and landing could be problematic and some later derivatives featured additional canard surfaces. Yaw stability A conventional aeroplane is unstable in yaw and needs a tail fin to keep it straight. Movement of the ailerons creates an adverse yaw pulling it out of the turn, which also has to be compensated by the rudder. While a swept wing is stable in straight flight, it still experiences adverse yaw during a turn. One solution is to give the wing sufficient twist for the outer section to angle downwards and give negative lift. This reverses the adverse yaw action of the ailerons, helping the plane into the turn and eliminating the need for a vertical rudder or differential-drag spoilers. The bell-shaped lift distribution this produces has also been shown to minimise the induced drag for a given weight (compared to the elliptical distribution, which minimises it for a given span). History :See also History of the flying wing J. W. Dunne A Burgess-Dunne biplane in the US Army of 1917. Between 1905 and 1913, the British Army Officer and aeronaut J. W. Dunne developed a series of tailless aircraft intended to be inherently stable and unstallable. Inspired by his studies of seagulls in flight, they were characterised by swept wings with a conical upper surface. The cone was arranged so that the wing twisted progressively outwards towards the tips creating negative incidence, and hence negative lift, in the outboard sections, creating overall stability in both pitch and yaw. A single control surface on the trailing edge of each wing tip acted as combined aileron and elevator. Dunne had an advanced qualitative appreciation of the aerodynamic principles involved, even understanding how negative lift at the wing tips, combined with steep downward-angled anhedral, enhanced directional stability.J. W. Dunne; \\"The Theory of the Dunne Aeroplane\\", The Aeronautical Journal, April 1913, pp. 83-102. Serialised in Flight between 16 August 1913 and 13 September 1913, Although originally conceived as a monoplane, Dunne's initial designs for the Army were required to be biplanes, typically featuring a fuselage nacelle between the planes with rear-mounted pusher propeller and fixed endplate fins between each pair of wing tips. After his Army work had ended, in 1910 the D.5 biplane was witnessed in stable flight by Orville Wright and Griffith Brewer, who submitted an official report to the Royal Aeronautical Society to that effect.\\"An Automatic Stability machine\\", Flight 18 February 1911, Pages 133-134. It thus became the first aeroplane ever to achieve natural stability in flight, as well as the first practical tailless aeroplane. The later D.8 was license-built and sold commercially by W. Starling Burgess in America as the Burgess-Dunne. He also returned to his monoplane. The D.6 of 1911 was a pusher type high-wing monoplane which also featured pronounced anhedral or droop to the wing tips. The control surfaces now also acted as rudders. Many of Dunne's ideas on stability remain valid, and he is known to have influenced later designers such as John K. Northrop (father of the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber). Inter-war and WWII ;G.T.R. Hill and the Pterodactyls After WWI, pilot Geoffrey T. R. Hill also sought a stable, unstallable design. Dunne gave some help initially and Hill went on to produced the Pterodactyl series of tailless aircraft from the 1920s onwards. Hill also began to develop the theory of the intrinsically stable aerofoil and incorporated it into his designs. ;Lippisch deltas German theorists further developed the theory of the stable aerofoil. The designer Alexander Lippisch produced his first tailless design, the Delta I, in 1931. He went on to build a series of ever-more sophisticated designs, and at the end of the Second World War was taken to America to continue his work. ;Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet During the Second World War, Lippisch worked for the German designer Willy Messerschmitt on the first tailless aircraft to go into production, the Me 163 Komet. It was the only rocket-powered interceptor ever to be placed in front-line service, and was the fastest aircraft to reach operational service during the war. ;Northrop In parallel with Lippisch, in the USA, Jack Northrop was developing his own ideas on tailless designs. The N-1M flew in 1941 and a succession of tailless types followed, some of them true flying wings. Postwar ;de Havilland DH 108 Swallow In the 1940s, the British aircraft designer John Carver Meadows Frost developed the tailless jet-powered research aircraft called the de Havilland DH.108 Swallow. Built using the forward fuselage of the de Havilland Vampire jet fighter. One of these was possibly one of the first aircraft ever to break the sound barrier - it did so during a shallow dive, and the sonic boom was heard by several witnesses. All three built were lost in fatal crashes. ;Northrop X-4 Bantam Similar to the D.H. 108, the twin-jet powered 1948-vintage Northrop X-4 was one of the series of postwar X-planes experimental aircraft developed in the United States after World War II to fly in research programs exploring the challenges of high- speed transonic flight and beyond. It had aerodynamic problems similar to those of the D.H.108, but both X-4 examples built survived their flight test programs without serious incidents through some 80 total research flights from 1950-1953, only reaching top speeds of 640 mph (1,035 km/h). ;Dassault Mirage The French Mirage series of supersonic jet fighters were an example of the tailless delta configuration, and became one of the most widely produced of all Western jet aircraft. By contrast the Soviet Union's equivalent widely produced delta-winged fighter, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, does have a tail stabiliser. ;Convair F2Y Sea Dart In the 1950s, the Convair F2Y Sea Dart prototype became the only seaplane ever to exceed the speed of sound. Convair built several other successful tailless delta types. ;Supersonic airliners The Anglo-French Concorde Supersonic transport and its Soviet counterpart the Tupolev Tu-144 were tailless supersonic jet airliners, with gracefully curved ogival delta wings. The grace and beauty of these aircraft in flight were often remarked upon.Trubshaw, B.; Concorde: The inside story, Pub. Sutton, England (2000), . ;Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird The American Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft was the fastest jet powered aircraft at the time it was retired, achieving speeds above Mach 3. ;NASA PRANDTL-D The NASA Preliminary Research Aerodynamic Design To Lower Drag (PRANDTL-D) wing has been developed by Al Bowers at the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center. Bowers was inspired by the work of Ludwig Prandtl and, like Dunne, by watching bird flight. As with the Dunne design, it has a wing twist sufficient to set the wing tips at a negative angle and create the same positive roll-yaw coupling.Preliminary Research Aerodynamic Design To Lower Drag (PRANDTL): An Overview, Nasa Armstrong Flight Research Center, 2015Flying Wing-Shaped Experimental Airplane Validating New Wing Design Method, Nasa Armstrong Flight Research Center, 2016 (podcast) Bowers developed a quantitative analysis of the lifting characteristics, leading to his more general discovery of a bell- shaped lift distribution which minimises induced drag for the aircraft weight. He applied this distribution in the \\"Prandtl-D\\" series of designs. By the end of 2017, he had flown three such research models.Subscale Glider Makes First Flight, Nasa Armstrong Flight Research Center, 2015NASA Armstrong Fact Sheet: Prandtl-D Aircraft, Nasa Armstrong Flight Research Center, 2016  See also  *Movement of center of pressure *Longitudinal static stability *List of tailless aircraft References=Inline citationsGeneral references * Poulsen, C.M. \\"Tailless trials, Tribute to a British Pioneer: The Dunne Biplanes and Monoplane.\\", \\"p. 557.\\", \\"p. 558.\\" Flight, 27 May 1943, pp, 556‚Äì558.

He was born in Correggio, a small town in the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy and died in nearby Reggio Emilia because of AIDS. Tondelli enjoyed modest success as a writer but often encountered trouble with censors for his use of homosexual themes in his works. Tondelli was buried in a small cemetery in the hamlet of Canolo, just outside Correggio.Tondelli, Pier Vittorio, and Fulvio Panzeri. Opere: romanzi, teatro, racconti. Classici Bompiani. Milano: Bompiani, 2000: liii __TOC__ Biography Tondelli developed an early interest in reading as an adolescent, reading what one might normally expect from a young adult male -- Treasure Island, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and various Westerns. As Tondelli grew older, his reading tastes would develop and in 1974 he began to write his first narratives, saying: \\"I have always written, starting at 16 years of age with the usual story about adolescent frustrations\\".Tondelli, Pier Vittorio, and Fulvio Panzeri. Opere: romanzi, teatro, racconti. Classici Bompiani. Milano: Bompiani, 2000: xxxiv These adolescent frustrations are conflicts between Tondelli's religiosity, his desire to express his artistry, and his homosexual desires as well as a change in Tondelli's belief system, in which he writes: \\"I find it vulgar to pray to God side by side with people for whom God is different from my God.\\"Tondelli, Pier Vittorio, and Fulvio Panzeri. Opere: romanzi, teatro, racconti. Classici Bompiani. Milano: Bompiani, 2000: xxxv Tondelli developed a jealousy towards God, who he describes as unique to himself, developing a mysticism all of his own but admitted to losing something as his belief system matured. Tondelli took his high school exams in 1974 and then enrolled at the University of Bologna's DAMS (Discipline Arte Musica e Spettacolo) where he took courses with Umberto Eco and Gianni Celati, two of Italy's most celebrated writers and academics. In 1979, he sent a manuscript to Aldo Tagliaferri. Tondelli credits Tagliaferri with teaching and guiding him in his writing, reinforcing upon the young author the necessity of re-writing one's work. A year later in January 1980, Altri Libertini was published, and, the following month, Tondelli graduated from the University of Bologna. In April 1980, Tondelli was called up for military service, a requirement for Italian men at the time, stationed at Orvieto and then in Rome. Tondelli's military service provided him with the necessary experience to write two works: Il diario del soldato Acci and Pao Pao. Works by Tondelli Many of Tondelli's works have been published by Bompiani in a two-volume set. Volume 1 contains his novels and short stories, and Volume 2 contains more stories, essays, conversations and miscellaneous writings. Volume 1 includes an introduction and chronology by Fulvio Panzeri: Opere. Milano: Bompiani, 2000. . Volume 2 contains an extensive bibliography of Tondelli's writings and writings on/about Tondelli, his works, etc. Many of his works can also be purchased individually as well. *Altri Libertini (1980) *Il Diario Del Soldato Acci (1981) *Rimini (1985) *Camere Separate (1989) *Pao Pao (1989) *Un weekend postmoderno.

He was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center from 1995 until his death, and was best known for his work developing the field from early balloon instruments to today's space observatories such as the NASA Swift mission, for which he was the Principal Investigator. He was leading the WFIRST (now called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope) wide-field infrared telescope forward toward a launch in the mid-2020s. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Gehrels died on February 6, 2017, at the age of 64. On January 10th, 2018, NASA announced that Swift had been renamed the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, in his honor.. Early life and education Gehrels was born in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, on October 3, 1952. His father was astronomer Tom Gehrels. He grew up in Tucson, Arizona, and attended the University of Arizona as an undergraduate student. He received bachelor's degrees in music and physics from UofA in 1976. He received his Ph.D. in physics in 1982 from the California Institute of Technology, with advisor Edward C. Stone. He took a postdoctoral position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 1981 working with Bonnard Teegarden. In 1982, he became permanent at Goddard as an astrophysicist. He is survived by his wife, Ellen Williams, who is a professor of physics at the University of Maryland and Director of ARPA-E at the Department of Energy. They have two children, Thomas (born 1987) and Emily (born 1990). Career Gehrels was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center starting in 1995. He was the Principal Investigator for the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission. Other responsibilities include: Project Scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991‚Äì2000), Mission Scientist for Mission INTEGRAL, Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and Project Scientist for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, then known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST).WFIRST Home Page He was also a professor at the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at University of Maryland and adjunct professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State. His research focused on transient objects in the universe such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), supernovae and active galaxy flares. He worked to develop gamma-ray astrophysics from a field of experiments detecting a few objects to a full astronomical discipline with thousands of sources in many classes. He was elected chair of the Astronomy Section of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013. He published over 600 academic articles, which have been cited 40,000 times for an h-index of 97. His most cited works include papers on the discovery of the origin of short gamma-ray bursts, the Swift satellite, Poisson statistics, observations of gamma-ray bursts at the edge of the visible universe, discovery of a relativistic tidal disruption event, and finding of two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the gamma-ray band.  Research =Overview Gehrels was an astrophysicist with broad interests. He worked predominantly in the area of high energy astrophysics, studying explosive objects in the universe such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational wave transients and tidal disruption events (stars torn apart when they approach too close to a massive black hole). He was also a laboratory physicist developing instrumentation for space observation. Graduate studies Gehrels' graduate schooling was at Caltech, working with advisors Rochus Vogt (1976‚Äì1979) and Edward C. Stone (1979‚Äì1981). The early period was spent performing laboratory and accelerator calibrations of the cosmic ray instrument on Voyager. The later years saw analysis of data from the instrument during the fly-bys of Jupiter (1979 for both Voyager 1 and 2). The elemental abundance of MeV particles in the Jovian magnetosphere was expected to be dominated by hydrogen and helium, so it was a surprise to find oxygen and sulfur dominant. This discovery was found to be related to the Voyager discovery of volcanoes on the moon Io spewing oxygen and sulfur into the magnetosphere. The Gehrels and Stone paper describing the measurement made a prediction, later confirmed, that the auroral emissions on Jupiter are cause by precipitating oxygen and sulfur ions. Balloon Observations of SN 1987A As a postdoc and then permanent scientist at Goddard, Gehrels worked on the GRIS balloon payload for high resolution (germanium detector) spectroscopy of gamma-ray sources. He first was involved in the proposal to NASA for the instrument, specializing in the design and techniques for background reduction. The payload was nearing completion when Supernova 1987A was discovered. The construction was quickly finished and the instrument flown to observe the gamma-ray line emission from Co-56 decay. The GRIS detection of a broadened and redshift 847 keV line was some of the first strong evidence for mixing and asymmetries in the ejecta, now recognized as signature characteristics of supernova explosions. Compton Gamma Ray Observatory Gehrels was the Project Scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory from its launch in 1991 to de-orbit in 2000. He followed Don Kniffen, who was Project Scientist during the development. The mission was one of the Great Observatories and provided the first comprehensive observations of the gamma- ray sky from 30 keV to 30 GeV. Discoveries include an isotropic distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the sky, supporting an extragalactic origin, two classes of GRBs with short and long durations, blazars with bright gamma-ray emission and harder spectra than Seyfert AGN (e.g., Dermer & Gehrels 1995), detailed mapping of gamma-rays from Al-26 decay in the galactic plane mapping regions of nucleosynthesis over the past million years, and detailed mapping of the 511 keV line from positron annihilation in the galaxy with concentration at the galactic center. Gehrels et al. (Nature, 2000) found a new population of mid-latitude high energy gamma-ray sources. Swift and Fermi Observatories Gehrels was the Principal Investigator of the Swift mission and Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi observatory. Swift is a three-instrument satellite launched in 2004 and designed to study GRBs and their afterglows. Since approximately 2009, it has become a community tool for observing transient and variable sources of all types including novae, supernovae, AGN, magnetars, galactic black hole and neutron stars, tidal disruption events, and comets. Several requests are received per day. Gehrels led the Swift proposal, oversaw the development, and was chief scientist of the operations. Scientifically, he led several papers, including the discovery paper of short GRB afterglow and origin (Gehrels et al. Nature, 2005), and played a significant role in many others. The mission has characterized the afterglow and origin of short GRB for the first time, determine the shape of the X-ray and optical afterglow lightcurves to great precision and with large statistics (>1000 GRBs), provided a comprehensive data set of UV observation of supernova, and discovered X-ray outbursts from supernova shock breakouts and relativistically beamed tidal disruption events. For Fermi, Gehrels worked with lead scientists at Goddard, Stanford, the United States Naval Research Laboratory, and several other institutions to propose the mission and bring it to fruition. He was Chair of the Senior Scientist Advisory Committee of the LAT instrument collaboration. Fermi scans the full sky every 3 hours in the high energy gamma ray band. It has revolutionized our understanding of the high energy gamma-ray sky with observations of pulsars, AGN, GRBs, novae, and diffuse emissions. WFIRST Era Gehrels joined the SNAP dark energy mission proposal led by Saul Perlmutter and Michael Levi in 2008. This evolved in the DOE-NASA Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) program, for which Gehrels became the Project Scientist and chaired the Science Coordination Group in 2009. He led the proposal of JDEM to the 2010 Decadal Survey. This mission was combined with two other proposals to become the top ranked large mission WFIRST (now known as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope). It is a wide- field infrared survey observatory. In 2012, NASA decided to use a donated Hubble-class telescope for WFIRST and to add a coronagraph instrument to the primary wide-field infrared survey instrument. The mission is in development for launch in the mid-2020s. It will perform observations at Hubble depth and image resolution with 100 times the field of view of Hubble, and will make direct imaging and spectroscopic measurement of exoplanets. The science areas are dark energy/cosmology, exoplanets, and general astrophysics. The mission began Phase A development in 2016. Gehrels was the Project Scientist and chaired the Formulation Science Working Group with co-chairs Jeremy Kasdin and David Spergel. Other scientific work Working at the conjunction of data analysis and theory, Gehrels wrote several papers of general interest: * 1986 highly referenced paper on statistical confidence limits for small numbers of events, particularly in astrophysical data * 1993 paper with Jack Tueller on the gamma-ray emission from the galactic ridge * 1993 paper with wife Ellen Williams on temperatures of enhanced stability in hot thin plasmas * 1993 Nature paper with Wan Chen on the Geminga supernova as a cause of the Local Bubble * 1997 in Il Nuovo Cimento on the use of nu_Fnu spectral energy distributions * 2003 paper with several co-authors on depletion of the Earth's ozone from nearby supernovae * 2015 paper with John Cannizzo and several other co-authors on the galaxy observation strategy for follow-up observations of gravitational wave detections with large error regions on the sky  Awards and honors  *2017, Dan David Prize, astronomy (with Shrinivas Kulkarni and Andrzesj Udalski) *2016, Caltech Distinguished Alumni Award *2016, Milner Breakthrough Prize for LIGO gravitational wave discovery (Drever, Thorne, Weiss & LIGO Team) *2016, Physical Sciences Award, Washington Academy of Science *2016, Honorary Fellow, Royal Astronomical Society *2015, Asteroid 16000 Neilgehrels named in his honor *2012, Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science *2012, Alumnus of the Year, Honors College, University of Arizona *2012, Harrie Massey Award of COSPAR *2011, Member, International Academy of Astronautics *2010, Member, National Academy of Sciences *2009, George W.

He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Arizona Cardinals, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Kansas City Chiefs. He also played in NFL Europe with the Scottish Claymores and in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Montreal Alouettes. He attended college at Purdue University, where he earned a communications degree and played for the Purdue Boilermakers. After his professional football career ended, Allen started careers in music, broadcasting, and business. He started Nova 53 Records, a recording company, under which he released the album \\"Nova's Lounge\\". He appeared as a game-day football analyst on several television stations. After earning a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, Allen worked for a variety of companies in business roles.  Early career  Allen played high school football at Westlake High School in Atlanta, Georgia as both an offensive and defensive lineman. As a junior in 1994, Allen was selected to the All-South Fulton team for his role as the \\"best blocker\\" on the offensive line of Westlake. He earned an honorable mention for the All-State team as a defensive lineman the following year. Allen was recruited by Georgia and Georgia Tech, but he declined both offers in favor of \\"play[ing] for an underdog\\". After offering a verbal commitment to play for the Vanderbilt Commodores as a defensive lineman, Allen instead signed with Purdue, where he played as a right guard. Playing under head coach Joe Tiller and blocking for quarterback Drew Brees, Allen was a member of the 2000 team that won a Big Ten Conference championship and competed in the Rose Bowl against the Washington Huskies. He played in 47 games for the Boilermakers, including four starts.  Professional career = Kansas City Chiefs  Allen was eligible for the 2001 NFL Draft but went undrafted. He was later signed as a free agent to the Kansas City Chiefs, who released him prior to the start of the 2001 regular season. After being waived by the Chiefs, Allen intended to leave football behind, but he accepted a spot on the practice squad of the Atlanta Falcons in January 2002. Later that month, the Chiefs signed Allen to a three-year contract. During the offseason, Allen was sent to play for the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe to gain experience. After his father had a stroke, Allen was forced to leave the Claymores and return to the United States. He participated in training camp and the preseason with the Chiefs but was waived shortly before the start of the regular season.  New York Giants  Shortly after Allen was released by the Chiefs, the New York Giants signed Allen to their practice squad. The Giants signed Allen to the active roster in early October 2002 following a series of injuries to their offensive linemen. Allen was active as a backup offensive lineman for the remainder of the regular season, but he never played a down on the offensive line. In a mid-October game against the Atlanta Falcons, Allen was forced into action as a defensive lineman on goal-line plays when multiple starting linemen were injured. Speaking about the situation, defensive line coach Denny Marcin stated \\"I told Ian, 'You line up on the right side and go straight ahead.' I just needed a body.\\" Allen was active for the Giants' loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the wild card playoff round. Before the 2003 season, both Jason Whittle and Mike Rosenthal left the Giants via free agency, leaving two starting positions open on the offensive line. By the start of the Giants' pre-season minicamp, Allen was considered the favorite to start at right tackle, but he remained in competition with four other players for the two starting roles. The newly constructed right side of the offensive line played poorly in the first preseason game against the New England Patriots, but Allen showed enough improvement the following week against the Carolina Panthers to be named the starter going into the regular season. In a Sports Illustrated article published before the start of the regular season, NFL scouts sharply criticized Allen's play, with one anonymous scout calling him \\"awful\\" and another saying \\"I can't believe he might start.\\" Both head coach Jim Fassel and offensive line coach Jim McNally were critical of Allen's play in the season opener, where a missed block led to a forced fumble from quarterback Kerry Collins. Center Chris Bober started in place of Allen at right tackle the following week. Following a season-ending injury to left guard Rich Seubert, Bober was moved back to center and Allen returned as the starting right tackle. In his second stint as a starter, Allen's performance was praised by coaches and the media, including after a game against the New York Jets which saw NFL sack leader Shaun Ellis held to half a sack. The offensive line's performance was \\"far from overwhelming\\" in the second half of the season, but they benefited from more consistency in their lineup as Allen continued to start at right tackle. The Giants ended their season with a 4‚Äì12 record and did not make the playoffs. Allen started in 11 games at right tackle in 2003. Allen played as the starter at right tackle in each of the Giants' three minicamps prior to the 2004 preseason, but incoming head coach Tom Coughlin moved right guard David Diehl to the right tackle position before the first preseason game. Allen was originally designated the primary backup at left and right tackle going into the 2004 season, but he was released after the Giants signed Marques Sullivan off waivers.  Late career  In the week after being released by the New York Giants, Allen was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles for the 2004 season. He acted as a backup throughout the season, playing in only four games. The Eagles lost to the New England Patriots 21‚Äì24 in Super Bowl XXXIX, where Allen was among the inactive players. In April 2005, Allen was signed by the Arizona Cardinals. He participated in training camp and remained on the team through the preseason. Allen was released in early September before the beginning of the regular season but later returned to the team. The Cardinals placed Allen on injured reserve in mid-October. Allen signed with the Kansas City Chiefs for the third time in 2006, but he again didn't make their final roster. Allen was signed to the developmental roster of the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League in July 2006, and he played six games with them that season. Following his debut game, Allen was fined $300 due to an incident that involved BC Lions linebacker Carl Kidd punching Allen twice in the face. In May 2007, Allen announced his retirement to pursue his music career.  Music career  As a freshman in high school, Allen played the tenor saxophone in the marching band before joining the football team. He also plays the drums and keyboard. He continued to pursue music on the side throughout his football career, maintaining a \\"mini-studio\\" in his home even while starting at right tackle for the New York Giants. After being cut by the Kansas City Chiefs for the final time, Allen contacted Alouettes head coach and general manager Jim Popp about playing for the Alouettes due to the presence of a large music scene in Montreal. During his year with the Alouettes, Allen worked on a jazz album titled \\"Nova's Lounge\\" with his company Nova 53 Records. The album was released on November 24, 2006 in Canada, with Allen credited as producer and composer. Allen retired before the 2007 CFL season to pursue his music career.  Post-retirement = Broadcasting  Allen worked for the NFL Network, Sky Sports NFL, and the Big Ten Network as a game-day analyst in the years following his retirement from football. He also co-hosted the radio broadcast Inside the Trenches with former NFL defensive linemen R-Kal Truluck and Lance Legree. Inside the Trenches aimed to provide the perspective of offensive and defensive linemen while discussing professional football.  Ipswich Cardinals  In March 2008, Allen completed a deal to co-own the Ipswich Cardinals of the BAFA National Leagues in the United Kingdom. Allen did not invest money into the club to receive an ownership stake, but he became involved in promotion and advertising.  Business career  Allen attended an entrepreneurship program at Northwestern University which prompted him to continue his schooling at the Krannert School of Management at Purdue. He enrolled in an MBA program and graduated in 2012. He later worked for General Motors and Xerox. As of February 2017, Allen works for Target in Minneapolis.

In 1900, he installed a glass kiln at the school and studied stained glass manufacture in London under Christopher Whall so that, in the Arts and Crafts tradition, design and manufacture could be taught as an integrated process.Harrison, Martin: \\"Stained Glass: Windows on another World\\" in Crawford, Alan (ed): By Hammer and Hand : the Arts and Crafts Movement in Birmingham, Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery, 1984 pp 120-123 Among his outstanding students was Margaret Agnes Rope. Stained glass and painting From at least 1904 onwards, he established an independent business designing and manufacturing stained glass, producing large and notable works for churches such as E. S. Prior's St. Andrew's, Roker, St Martins, Kensal Rise, St Mary's, Madresfield and J. L. Pearson's St Alban's, Bordesley. In common with most of the Birmingham Group he worked across a wide variety of media, producing book illustrations for the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft and interior decoration for the Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts. Although most prolific in stained glass, Payne's most notable achievements were arguably in the field of decorative painting. Between 1902 and 1923 he worked on the wall paintings of the chapel at Madresfield Court near Malvern in Worcestershire. Painted as fresco in tempera and sitting alongside work by other figures of the Birmingham Arts and Crafts movement such as William Bidlake, Georgie Gaskin and Charles March Gere, Madresfield Court is \\"not only Payne's most important scheme of decorative painting, but probably the most famous of all such Arts and Crafts schemes\\".

His work Plucking the Red and White Roses in the Old Temple Gardens - an allegory on the Wars of the Roses - now hangs in the Palace's East Corridor.

It is on Lleida Street on the slopes of Montju√Øc, a hill to the south east of the city centre. The arena is able to host competitions of any indoor sport. In 2000 it was adapted to better accommodate theatre and musical shows and given a new name: Barcelona Teatre Musical. The seating capacity was reduced from 8,000 to 3,500, but comfort and the acoustic quality were enhanced. History Inaugurated in 1955 for the Mediterranean Games, it was designed by the architect Josep Soteras. It was the only indoor arena of its type in Barcelona until 1971 when FC Barcelona inaugurated the Palau Blaugrana. Even after this, the Palau dels Esports continued to be the only indoor arena in public hands: for this reason it continued to host the main sporting, social, cultural and musical events that took place in the city. During the 1980s it was the home of the RCD Espanyol basketball team, which for several seasons competed in the ACB. It was remodelled in 1986 by the architect Francesc Labastida for the group E games of the World Basketball Championship of 1986. At the beginning of the 1990s activity in the arena began to diminish. The basketball team disappeared and in 1990 the Palau Sant Jordi was inaugurated, attracting many of the top events from that date on. The venue hosted rhythmic gymnastics and the preliminary phase of the volleyball for the 1992 Summer Olympics.1992 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. pp. 192-5. This proved to be its sporting swansong, however, and from the mid-1990s it concentrated on hosting drama, music and comedy.

In 1494 Erazm Cio≈Çek (future Bishop of P≈Çock) became the secretary of Polish king Alexander Jagiellon and one of his favorite courtiers. In 1501 he left on a diplomatic mission to Rome, where he received Holy Orders. In Rome, Cio≈Çek discussed Alexander's marriage and possible divorce from Helena of Moscow, who was an Eastern Orthodox. Helena's father, Ivan III of Russia, accused Alexander of religious intolerance and used it as a pretext for the renewed Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian War (1500‚Äì1503).

It originally stood on a small island in the Firth of Forth accessible only at low tide, and dates from around 1450, built as a secure residence by Sir David Stewart, who had been granted the Barony of Rosyth in 1428. The original tower house (58 feet high) was enlarged and extended in the 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1572 it was attacked by men from Blackness Castle on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth and it was occupied in 1651 by Oliver Cromwell's army after the Battle of Inverkeithing. It remained a Stewart residence until it was sold in the late seventeenth century to David Drummond of Invermay. It ultimately ended up in the possession of the Earl of Hopetoun and from the eighteenth century onward remained unoccupied. During this and later periods large parts of the stonework were re-used in other structures, and the later courtyard buildings were almost razed to the ground, leaving only the tower and north courtyard wall remaining significantly above ground-floor level. It became Admiralty property in 1903 and as the result of land reclamation lost its waterfront position, becoming marooned within the dockyard. Although plans were made to restore and use the building, they came to nothing and the structure was made safe in its current condition. It passed into private hands when large tracts of the surrounding dockyard were sold. About half a mile north of the castle is a well-preserved sixteenth-century dovecot, with a crow-stepped gable roof, with carved heads at two corners. Internally it has a barrel vaulted ceiling.

The episode runs for 53:05 minutes, making it the longest episode of the series, excluding 2-part episodes. The episode opened to polarized reviews from critics; however, the performances of Washington and Oh received high critical acclaim. The episode marked Isaiah Washington's (Dr. Preston Burke) final appearance to the series until Season 10, Episode 22 entitled \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\". It was Kate Walsh's (Dr. Addison Montgomery) last episode with regular billing who became a main character in Grey's Anatomy spin-off Private Practice and Chyler Leigh's (Dr. Lexie Grey) last appearance with recurring billing as she would be upgraded to a series regular in season 4. Plot The episode opens to a voice-over narrative from Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Addison gets to the ER with Joe (Steven W. Bailey) and Walter's (Jack J. Yang) surrogate from the bar, the previous episode. Burke starts treating her and decides that the twins must be born. Derek (Patrick Dempsey), Mark (Eric Dane) and Bailey (Chandra Wilson) start treating the newly-found fourth climber. The other climbers eventually talk to the police. Cristina (Sandra Oh) attempts to write her vows. Callie (Sara Ramirez) writes them on Cristina's hand. At work, Cristina discovers that the wedding has given her the day off. Jeff Pope (Jason London) arrives and hugs Rebecca (Elizabeth Reaser). Alex (Justin Chambers) asks Jeff why he didn't search for his wife before. Rebecca wants Alex, but he tells her to stay with her 'decent guy'. Derek tells Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) that he met a girl in the bar. Meredith seems confused. Meanwhile, Adele (Loretta Devine) has a miscarriage, revealing that Richard was the father. Mama Burke (Diahann Carroll) forces Cristina to remove her eyebrows; she panics and convinces Bailey to let her scrub in. Bailey agrees, having found out that Callie is the new chief resident. Derek removes the axe from the fourth climber while Burke treats the new babies. Callie and George (T. R. Knight) agree to have children, but Izzie (Katherine Heigl) tells George she's in love with him. The interns receive their test results. George hides the fact that he didn't pass. Derek feels Meredith is taking him for granted. She evades responding and goes to the chapel. Mark, Addison and Burke are rejected as Chief of Surgery candidates. At the chapel, Burke finds out Derek is not the new Chief, though Derek doesn't explain. Addison tells Alex to fight for Rebecca. Outside SGH, Bailey and George talk. She thinks that she failed him, but he says: \\"I failed you\\". Alex decides to go after Rebecca. Callie tells Izzie she and George is planning to have a baby; Izzie is stunned. Cristina realizes that she washed her vows off when she scrubbed in, and freaks out. Meredith convinces her to go on. Burke sees the delay and calls off the wedding, feeling he has forced her to change. He walks away. Meredith tells everybody that it is over. She looks at Derek and leaves the chapel. Cristina arrives at Burke's apartment to discover that he has gone. Cristina starts shaking uncontrollably and crying. To calm her down, Meredith hugs her and cuts her out of her wedding dress. George runs into the new interns, and meets Lexie Grey, Meredith's paternal half-sister. Richard tells Derek he is the new Chief, but Derek suggests that he start over. We see Richard looking over the hospital. Production The alt= A photo of the First Baptist Church, in Los Angeles After an off-screen incident, in which Isaiah Washington aimed a homophobic slur at gay actor T. R. Knight, ABC chose not to renew Washington's contract, making \\"Didn't We Almost Have It All?\\" his final appearance to the series. It was also the last episode to feature Chyler Leigh as a guest star, since she was promoted to star billing in the season 4 premiere and Kate Walsh's last regular episode as she would only make guest appearances in the future, due to her being a main character on the Grey's Anatomy spin-off Private Practice. The wedding scenes were filmed at the First Baptist Church of Los Angeles. Kenneth Pool designed the Amsale wedding dress worn by Cristina.

Too much padding, too much repetition, too many characters forced into ridiculous situations\\", citing as example Adele Webber's pregnancy at 52. She criticized Shepherd for being arrogant and condescending. Salon.com's TV critic Heather Havrilesky found that Shepherd's threat to break up with Grey came in a bad timing after what she went through during the season and wondered why he did not so when she questioned their relationship. She then wrote: \\"Grey‚Äôs Anatomy has countless charms ‚Äî snappy yet moving dialogue, nice-looking humans, fast-moving story lines. But lately one of those strengths ‚Äî those hurtling plotlines ‚Äî seems to be killing creator Shonda Rhimes‚Äô golden goose.\\" Havrilesky cited Sandra Oh as one of the episode's highlight deeming her \\"fantastic\\" and \\"believable\\", and named the moment when Yang goes home to find Burke and breaks down the best scene of the finale. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Gregory Kirschling thought that \\"as a finale, maybe the show lacked a defining happy, warm-gooseflesh moment\\" but that in comparison to normal episodes, this one was \\"well above average\\". To him, Shepherd's speech to Grey before the start of the wedding was the highlight of the episode, explaining he likes to see \\"these two flailing hot people ‚Äî he soft, she hard ‚Äî trade well-turned TV wooing dialogue. It still works; it's still romantic.\\" However, he considered what followed, Grey's non- response, not romantic and though he likes their goo-goo courtship scenes together, he wrote it was time for them to be happy together. Kirschling criticized the choice of Torres as chief resident instead of Bailey. He praised Oh's performance in the episode, especially during Burke's dumping speech calling it \\"so affecting\\" and in her last scene, which he described as \\"an amazing breakdown\\". Commenting on the finale, Andy Dehnart of MSNBC wrote that the stories were completed \\"in mostly unsatisfying, occasionally depressing, and sometimes illogical ways that will leave the show decidedly changed.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 3) episodes Category:Television episodes about weddings ","title":"Didn't We Almost Have It All?"},{"id":"13405952","title":"Shayne Stevenson (ice hockey)"},{"id":"13405967","title":"Matt Arroyo"},{"id":"13405969","text":"Dave Mullins is a New Zealand freediver and world record-holder.

He has performed at numerous national and international storytelling festivals, in theaters worldwide, and on the radio. He performs almost exclusively material of his own authorship. He has recorded many of his oral stories and has written picture books based on several of his tales. O'Callahan is best known for his large-scale oral stories that present the texture of a culture and a time in history through the perceptions of a central narrative character. O'Callahan's storytelling style is generally quiet and understated. His performances do not use props, sets, costumes, dramatic movement or instrumental music. He has a spellbinding ability to embody through the cadence of words his central characters (young and old, male and female), evoking soundscapes of seemingly ordinary life, with something epic and magical flickering just around the edges. Biography O'Callahan grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts, near the many hospitals of the Boston Longwood Medical Area, in a neighborhood which he has fictionalized in his stories as Pill Hill. He is the son of Edward J. and Helen Gately O'Callahan, two teachers who founded the Wyndham Secretarial and Finishing School on Marlborough Street in Boston's Back Bay, a women's secretarial college that sought to teach not only clerical skills but a broader liberal education. In the mid-1940s, his parents bought a 32-room mansion in Pill Hill built in 1883 for Charles Storrow and landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. As O'Callahan put it: > They didn't have any money, they were teachers. But nobody wanted those big > old houses because nobody wanted to heat them. So my parents bought it and > didn't heat it.\\" His childhood neighbors, parents, and other relatives figure prominently in many of his stories. After graduating from the College of the Holy Cross and unsuccessful attempts at law school and writing novels, O'Callahan found his voice as a professional storyteller in the 1970s, one of the early proponents of what has been called the American Storytelling Renaissance. He came to national prominence in 1980 with his first appearance at the National Storytelling Festival. In 1996 he was inducted into the Circle of Excellence by the National Storytelling Association (now National Storytelling Network). Jay and his wife Linda are the parents of two children, Ted and Laura. They live in Marshfield, Massachusetts.  Notable performance venues  *National Storytelling Festival , Jonesborough, Tennessee 1980, 1987, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2007 *Abbey Theatre, Dublin, Ireland *National Theatre, London, England *Lincoln Center, New York *National Public Radio O'Callahan has performed and recorded with John Langstaff and appeared several times in the character role of an ethnic storyteller in the Christmas Revels. He appeared on a 1980 episode of children's television show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.Episode 1471, IMDB, accessed June 7, 2015.  Stories  Most of O'Callahan's early stories were developed from improvised bedtime tales for his two children, and are highly whimsical and showcase O'Callahan's talent for vocal characterization (including giving personalities to inanimate objects), rhythmic verbal poetry, his gentle absurdist humor, and ability to enter into a child's perception of the world. Notable stories of this type include \\"The Little Dragon\\", \\"Tulips\\", \\"The Bubble\\", \\"The Red Ball\\", and \\"Orange Cheeks\\". The fictional kingdom of Artana is the setting for several of O'Callahan's tales of childhood adventure and heroism in a magical world set somewhere between Narnia and the island of Shakespeare's The Tempest. O'Callahan's major breakthrough as an adult storyteller was \\"The Herring Shed\\", which depicts the World War II homefront through the perceptions of a young woman working at a fish packing plant in the Canadian Maritimes. Using the verbal singsong rhythm of the work of stringing herring on rods for the smokehouse, the story creates a momentum of a girl finding her social place and sense of self-esteem in this small monotonous work shed, seemly utterly remote from a world at war. But their work is for the war, a war that periodically intrudes in the form of telegrams announcing deaths of relations at the front. Among O'Callahan's most often requested stories are an ongoing series known as the Pill Hill stories. These are somewhat fictionalized tales of O'Callahan's Irish-Catholic childhood in 1950s Boston, and of his uncle's and aunt's experiences during World War II and its aftermath. Frequently humorous and with a sense of magic and absurdity, these tales are told through the eyes of a young boy, and are tightly focused on the emotional lives of the characters. They nevertheless deal in this microcosm with larger historical and cultural issues including class and ethnic prejudice, politics, the effects of alcohol abuse on family members, the plight of Japanese-Americans during and after World War II, and the complex nature of heroism. O'Callahan has created other long-form adult stories from factual material, always from the intimate point of view of a central narrative character, and imbued with a sense of the mythic. These include \\"The Spirit of the Great Auk\\" a tale of Dick Wheeler's real-life epic kayak trip along the eastern coast of Canada and New England, following the migratory route of the extinct great auk, and encountering its ghostly spirit; \\"Pouring the Sun\\", commissioned by Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to commemorate the city's steel-making history; and \\"Father Joe: A Hero's Journey\\" the story of his uncle, U.S. Navy chaplain Joseph T. O'Callahan, who saved the USS Franklin (CV-13) after it was set ablaze by Japanese aircraft during World War II.  Publications  Almost all of O'Callahan's oral stories are available on compact disk or audio cassette through his website . Three of the Pill Hill stories, \\"Pouring the Sun\\", \\"Herman and Marguerite\\", and \\"Six Stories about Little Heroes\\" are available on DVD or video. The Pill Hill stories (in order of publication) are \\"Chickie\\", \\"Glasses\\", \\"Politics\\", \\"The Dance\\", \\"Electra\\", \\"Muddy River High\\", \\"Equations\\", \\"A Good Night's Rest\\", \\"Muddy River Playhouse\\", \\"Books and Burglars\\", \\"Report Card\\", and \\"The Labyrinth of Uncle Mark\\". \\"Father Joe: A Hero's Journey\\" is arguably a Pill Hill story, as its principal characters include a youthful college-age Jay O'Callahan and his uncle, Father Joe. However, much of this story is not from the point of view of Oak, O'Callahan's autobiographical character, and none of this story occurs in or references the Pill Hill neighborhood. Three of O'Callahan's oral stories have been published as illustrated children's books: *Tulips (illustrated by Debrah Santini) *Orange Cheeks (illustrated by Patricia Raine) *Herman and Marguerite: An Earth Story (illustrated by Laura O'Callahan) Stories by O'Callahan are published the following anthologies: *The Greatest Generation Speaks: Letters and Reflections by Tom Brokaw (\\"Father Joe\\") *Best Loved Stories Told at the National Storytelling Festival (\\"Orange Cheeks\\") *Ready-to-Tell Tales by David Holt (\\"The Magic Mortar\\" a Japanese folktale) *Chicken Soup for the Grandparent's Soul by Jack Canfield et al.

Career Enyinnaya started his career with Eagle Cement, where he made his debut at the age of 16. He was then loaned out to FC Ebedei, being subsequently signed in the summer of 1998 by Belgian Second Division side Molenbeek. Noted by Carlo Regalia, scout of then-Serie A club Bari, he was then signed in 1999 by the galletti in a 200mln ‚Ç§ bid, and initially joined the Under-20 Primavera squad, where he formed a striking partnership with a young Antonio Cassano. He marked his Serie A debut on 17 October 1999 in a home match against Torino. On 18 December he was first featured in the starting lineup, together with Cassano, in a home league match against Internazionale, which ended in a surprising 2-1 win for Bari thanks to goals from Enyinnaya (a 30-meter shot during the 7th minute) and a late winner by Cassano. Enyinnaya later failed to gain a spot in the regular lineup, unlike Cassano. In 2002 he was loaned to Serie B side Livorno, where he scored only two goals in 17 matches. He returned to Bari in 2003, but failed to impress, being loaned again, this time to Serie C1's Foggia, on January 2004. In July 2004 his contract expired, and Enyinnaya subsequently joined G√≥rnik Zabrze under request by then-chairman Marek Ko≈∫mi≈Ñski. Adaptation difficulties however affected his performances, and Enyinnaya played only 7 times with the Polish side.

The beach is a known surf destination mentioned in numerous guidebooks. Note there is a strong rip current at the north end of the beach. Despite its remoteness, five of the six houses in the village were connected to fibre broadband in November 2012.Stornoway Gazette In August 2016, the Transocean Winner oil rig ran aground, on a headland just off Dalmore beach. The oil rig was being towed from Norway to Malta, when it became detached from the tug boat. Archaeology Excavations were conducted at Dail M√≤r in the autumn of 1982 by Gerald and Margaret Ponting when part of the sea wall collapsed near the beach. This was further excavated by Sharples and Curtis. Prehistoric stone structures were found and documented, suggested to be a dwelling, along with various artefacts left in place by Beaker culture with some earlier finds from the neolithic. These included tools made of bone or antler and pottery. A large number of flints and arrowheads found during excavations and on the beach nearby suggest the area may have been used for a workshop of their manufacture. One noted artefact recovered was the Dalmore bone; a square-sectioned 34mm with perforation. Zig-zag markings just over 5mm apart on the bone were analysed by P.J. Scott and Margaret Ponting.

However, it was especially valuable when the ship lost electrical power and normal pumping ability was lost. On smaller ships, it was a critical piece of equipment.

Album Reviews *\\"The perfect summation of Gene Summers' career, The Ultimate School of Rock & Roll offers 32 tracks spanning the years 1957-77, although the preponderance of the collection is devoted to his early rockabilly and rock'n'roll recordings. Summers was a regional artist, but his classic rockabilly sides are masterpieces of the genre. In the '60s Summers stuck with rock'n'roll instead of performing straight country like most former rockabilly artists, and his efforts from this period wouldn't sound out of place on the Nuggets box set. Also of interest is a topical song from 1968 about the theft of Bonnie (of Bonnie and Clyde fame) Parker's headstone, and a song written for Elvis on which he approximates Elvis' vocal style. A lot of care obviously went into this package, which features excellent notes, session info, photos, and numerous previously unreleased tracks.\\" - Greg Adams, All Music Guide, 1997 *\\".....All of Gene Summers‚Äô rocking recordings together on one CD ‚Äìwhat more could a rockabilly fan ask for? Also included are rare out- takes and previously unissued performances from the Head Teacher at the School of Rock 'n Roll.\\" - CD Review, 1999 *\\"In my hands I have maybe the most complete Gene Summers compilation ever released, the best looking one for sure, this set of 35 tracks is based on another compilation released in 1997 in the USA by Crystal Clear Sound from Dallas, Texas. In order to offer the Rockabilly side of Summers the pals at Roller Coaster have excluded some of the songs from the 1960s originally released by Crystal Clear and which won't be missed by the Rockabilly lovers and have added 14 unreleased tracks that are partly songs from the 1950s and mostly different versions of Nervous, Twixteen, Fancy Dan and others, plus a few recordings from the early 1980s made in England with the best Rockabilly musicians of the moment backing Summers. The presentation of the CD on a cardboard open out sleeve cannot be better; filled with cool pictures and a 28 page booklet in the fabulous line of the latest Rollercaster Records releases , the Rolapak rules again!

Because this condition is a syndrome, there is no single treatment method, therefore efforts focus on mitigating/relieving the individual patient's specific pain. When pain in the epididymides is the primary symptom, post-vasectomy pain syndrome is often described as congestive epididymitis. Incidence A review study in 2017 found that in the United States, 1-2% of vasectomy patients will experience chronic testicular pain for greater than three months after the procedure. An investigation of peer-reviewed articles published in March 2020 examined 559 articles, performed meta-analysis on 25 separate datasets, and concluded that the incidence of post-vasectomy pain syndrome is 5% (95% CI 3% to 8%) with similar incidence of PVPS for both the scalpel and the no-scalpel technique.  Symptoms  * Persistent pain in the genitalia and/or genital area(s). * Groin pain upon physical exertion. * Pain when achieving an erection and/or engaging in sexual intercourse. * Pain upon ejaculation. * Loss of erectile function Any of the aforementioned pain conditions/syndromes can persist for years after vasectomy and affect as many as one in three vasectomized men. The range of PVPS pain can be mild/annoying to the less-likely extreme debilitating pain experienced by a smaller number of sufferers in this group. There is a continuum of pain severity between these two extremes. Pain is thought to be caused by any of the following, either singularly or in combination: testicular backpressure, overfull epididymides, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, sperm granulomas, and nerve entrapment. Pain can be present continuously in the form of orchialgia and/or congestive epididymitis or it can be situational, such as pain during intercourse, ejaculation or physical exertion.  Mechanisms of pain  There is a noticeable enlargement of the epididymides in vasectomized men. This is probably due to increased backpressure within the vas deferens on the testicular side following its blockage by vasectomy. The efferent ducts and seminiferous tubules of the testes are also affected by backpressure, leading to an increase in area and thickness. Backpressure from blockage of the vas deferens causes a rupture in the epididymis, called an \\"epididymal blowout\\", in 50% of vasectomy patients. Sperm sometimes leak from the vas deferens of vasectomized men, forming lesions in the scrotum known as sperm granulomas. Some sperm granulomas can be painful. The presence of a sperm granuloma at the vasectomy site prevents epididymal pressure build-up, perforation, and the formation of an epididymal sperm granuloma. It thus lessens the likelihood of epididymal discomfort. As part of the reaction of the body to the surgical wounds of vasectomy, the body produces hard scar-like tissue. Clamping the vas deferens can produce muscle disruption and fibrosis. As the diameter of the vas lumen is less than the thickness of the wall, the thick muscle layers can easily become disrupted, leading to sperm accumulation and extravasation. Cysts often form from the fluid that spreads between the muscle layers. Nerves can become trapped in the fibrous tissue caused by vasectomy. This pain is often heightened during sexual intercourse and ejaculation because, with arousal and ejaculation, muscles elevate the testis. There are several nerves that run parallel to the vas deferens that may be cut or damaged during vasectomy. One study found that the vas deferens exhibits two periodic forms of electrical activity on an electrovasogram, slow pacesetter potentials and fast action potentials. In vasectomized men, the pacesetter potentials on the testicular side exhibit an irregular rhythm. One study using ultrasound found that the epididymides of patients suffering from post-vasectomy pain syndrome were enlarged and full of cystic growths. Treatment Treatment depends on the proximate cause. In one study, it was reported that 9 of 13 men who underwent vasectomy reversal in an attempt to relieve post-vasectomy pain syndrome became pain-free, though the followup was only one month in some cases. Another study found that 24 of 32 men had relief after vasectomy reversal. Nerve entrapment is treated with surgery to free the nerve from the scar tissue, or to cut the nerve. One study reported that denervation of the spermatic cord provided complete relief at the first follow-up visit in 13 of 17 cases, and that the other four patients reported improvement. As nerves may regrow, long-term studies are needed. One study found that epididymectomy provided relief for 50% of patients with post-vasectomy pain syndrome. Orchiectomy is recommended usually only after other surgeries have failed.

Construction began in 1847, and it was intended that it would be completed by 1 December the same year. The route required tunnels beyond Newchurch, and the expense of these meant that construction was curtailed, and the line was opened as far as Newchurch, where a station was opened on 27 March 1848. Construction of the line onwards to Bacup resumed in 1851, and this was opened on 1 October 1852. The ELR amalgamated with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway on 13 May 1859. The whole line between Rawtenstall and Bacup was single-track at first; work to double the track began in 1878, and was completed in 1881. The station, originally named Newchurch, was renamed Waterfoot for Newchurch on 1 August 1881; and the name was simplified to Waterfoot by 1922. The station was closed on 5 December 1966.

The river finally runs into the North Sea in the village of Mundesley. The source River Mun Passing through Osier Carr A footbridge over the River Mun at Frogshall The source of the River Mun can be found next to Craft Lane, close to Furyhill plantation between Northrepps and the hamlet of Frogshall. It runs in a south easterly direction through a wooded valley and passes under Craft Lane close to Frogshall Farm House. From here it runs through woodland for a short distance and into a large pool called Little Broad. From Little Broad, still in woodland, the river falls over a weir and into some marshy woodland known as Osier Carr. Deep in the heart of Osier Carr Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae)Malacological Society of London - Bulletin Board can be found. The mussels are filter feeders, removing phytoplankton and other suspended particulate matter from the river. This removal of suspended matter from the water is often considered ecologically desirable, as it reduces phytoplankton blooms and in the treatment of drinking water. The river now passes under another lane from Sidestrand. From here the river feeds a system of ponds and sluices in an area known as the Grove. Many drains feed into the river here. The river now turns almost south and passes under another lane called Cromer Road and crosses countryside towards Ash Tree Farm and Ash Plantation. The river now widens slightly and begins to cross open countryside, slowly turning south east again. Along this section the Mun runs adjacent to several small reservoirs and ponds and drains. Gimingham watermill Gimingham mill pond The Diesel mill Engine at Gimingham At Gimingham the river flows into a series of Mill Ponds. These ponds fed Gimingham watermillNorfolk Mills - Gimingham watermill (Nat Grid Ref TG28663690) which is the first of two mills that stood on the river. The Mill dam once held back a broad fed by the River. The water ran under the Mill street to reach the waterwheel, which was probably originally overshot. There has been a mill at this point since the time of the Domesday book. The last mill to work here was built of local brick and flint brought in from local beaches. The original waterwheel went fairly early on, first being supplemented by steam and then replaced by a turbine with half twist drive in 1912 and then later by diesel engines, although water was still used for cooling them. The mill carried on working until 30 November 1976, using its diesel power to mill animal feedstuffs. The watermill was worked in conjunction with the nearby Gimingham postmill until 1877. The original heavy diesel oil engine has been carefully preserved and stands on Mill Street just below the old mill. Gimingham Mill Lake is a very popular fishing location. In the lake, pit and river, Bream, Carp, Tench and Roach can be caught. From Gimingham the river cross more open farm land now heading east, passing on its left Mundesley Hospital which was refurbished in 1997 and is now the Diana Princess of Wales Treatment Centre for Drug and Alcohol Problems. Where the road leading up to the hospital crosses the River Mun, the Environment Agency has a Water Resource Management gauging station. From here the river begins to skirt the southern side of the coastal village of Mundesley. Mun valley and Mundesley golf course River Mun or Mundesley BeckRoad Bridge over the River in Mundesley VillageThe valley here is part of Mundesley Golf Club. The golf club was established in 1901, and was designed with the help of one of the sport‚Äôs legends, 6-times Open winner Harry Vardon (1870‚Äì1937), built on the rolling hillside of the River Mun valley. Today its nine holes, with 18 tees, offer a satisfying challenge to players of all abilities. Harry Vardon‚Äôs association with Mundesley Golf Club spanned many years, from consultation, in 1900 to his misfortune to contract tuberculosis in 1903, and it was to Mundesley‚Äôs sanatorium that he went for treatment. While recuperating in 1904, still at the sanatorium, he ventured along the lane which bisects the course to enjoy a round of golf. Here he experienced his only career hole-in-one, on what is now the sixth, a feat which no doubt contributed to the success of his convalescence. From the golf course the river travels a short distance due east and enters the village under Trunch Road close to its junction with High Street and Heath Road. Just past Trunch Road the river falls over another weir before turning north into the eastern side of the village. Mundesley Watermill Mundesley mill pond The Waterwheel at Mundesley The river now fills another mill pond where once the second mill on the river worked. Mundesley watermillNorfolk Mills - Mundesley watermill was built c.1723 and consisted of two brick floors supporting a weather boarded upper floor and roof space under a Norfolk pantiled roof. Seen from the roadside, Mundesley Mill has five floors but if you took the public pathway round to the back, only two would have been visible. This is because the mill pool lying behind was level with the third floor. The builders set the mill deep into a high bank, over which the water would have fallen freely in the old days before findings its way to the beach, although it is quite possible the water was diverted to this point for the purpose of driving the mill. Unusually the mill had an overshot waterwheel. The only way to provide a sufficient head of water was to dam the river to form the mill pond we see today which is some considerable height above the road. When the mill was working, 8 million gallons of water flowed through per day. When the mill was worked by the Larter family in the 1920s, the deeds stated that anyone interfering with the river had to pay dues to the millers. The Larter family also used the mill to generate electricity, which also supplied power to some of the surrounding properties including a Bell's grocery shop, Larter & Rudran's bicycle garage and a property at The Dell. The mill burnt down in November 1956. Some of the cog wheels were still visible in their mountings within the shell of the building in 1959. The remains of the building were finally pulled down in the summer of 1965. The waterwheel was large with a diameter of and the owner of the Mill House decided to enclose the wheel behind a grill and to leave it as a showpiece. The wooden spokes and the rim can still be seen, and some of the metal scoops and some wooden cogs have been replaced. For many years it still turned whenever enough water was available. The river's water flowed over the wheel and then under the road and into the North sea through a pipe.

Its range extends to the rest of Western Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, and along the Atlantic coast of Africa as far south as South Africa. Actinia equina can be found both in exposed and sheltered situations. It is highly adapted to the intertidal zone as it can tolerate both high temperatures and desiccation. The anemone may also be found in regions of variable salinity such as estuaries. Beadlet anemones can live in solitary or in aggregations. Solitary beadlet anemones are found to be larger- sized than those that form clustered aggregation. Furthermore, larger sea anemones were found submerged in low tide, where they have greater access to food resources and are less subjected to harsh environmental exposures. The size of beadlet anemones may be connected to their physiological adaptation in regards to limited food resources and withstanding environmental conditions. Underwater, it displays up to 192 tentacles, arranged in six circles. Out of water, the tentacles retract and the anemone resembles a blob of red, brown, green or orange jelly, up to about across. It has bright blue beads (known as acrorhagi) located just beneath the tentacles, organised as an external ring containing stinging cells located at the top of the column that it uses to fight over territory. The acrorhagi contains the cnidocysts which themselves contain the nematocysts. There is some evidence that the various colour forms may in fact be different species. Actinia equina is similar in form to the Waratah anemone (Actinia tenebrosa) of Australia and New Zealand. It is also similar in form to the strawberry anemone (Actinia fragacea) but is a uniform colour and is typically rather smaller. Actinia equina is viviparous, with up to one hundred embryos developing inside the body cavity before being ejected into the open water as juveniles.

Film=Proposed Flash and Justice League films Warner Bros. hired comic book writer Jeph Loeb to write a screenplay in the late-1980s, but the outing never materialized. Development for a film adaptation was revived after the studio was impressed with David S. Goyer's script for Batman Begins, and he was offered the choice of a Flash or Green Lantern film adaptation. In December 2004, it was announced that Goyer would be writing, producing and directing The Flash. He approached his Blade: Trinity co-star Ryan Reynolds for the Barry Allen role, with the intention of also using Wally West as a supporting character. Goyer's script, which he tonally compared to Sam Raimi's work on the first two movies of the Spider-Man trilogy, was influenced by seminal comic book runs by Mike Baron, Mark Waid, and Geoff Johns. By 2007, however, Goyer dropped out of the project, citing creative differences with the studio. The same month Goyer revealed he was off The Flash, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife screenwriting duo Michelle and Kieran Mulroney to script a Justice League film featuring Barry Allen, and Shawn Levy to direct a spin-off featuring Wally West. Justice League attached George Miller as director. He cast Adam Brody as Barry Allen. Levy departed from The Flash due to his commitment to Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian and was replaced by David Dobkin. Filming was nearly set to begin for Justice League, but Brody's contract lapsed when the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros. a 45 percent tax credit. Warner Bros. hired Craig Wright to script The Flash and announced a 2008 release date following the collapse of Justice League. The project became delayed by the 2007‚Äì08 Writers Guild of America strike. Warner Bros. brought Batman producer Charles Roven aboard, with comic book writer Geoff Johns serving as a consult and co-writer. Johns created a new film treatment. Dan Mazeau was the screenwriter. In September 2009, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. had launched a new division, DC Entertainment Inc., in order to better expand the DC brand. In October 2009, Charles Roven was asked about the future of the Flash. In the interview, Roven explained that he was involved but that he was removed from the project because The Flash was speeding in the direction Warner Bros. had in mind, leaving the possible film in uncertainty. The day after Dan Mazeau responded to the article by saying, \\"Just to chime in on your latest article: The Flash has not been hobbled. Everything is moving forward as planned‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still writing the script. Geoff Johns is still consulting. Flash fans have no cause for concern, and ‚Äî IMO ‚Äî lots to be excited about.\\" In February 2010, it was reported that Warners was expected to announce its DC slate in the coming months populated by characters like The Flash and Wonder Woman.\\" DC Extended Universe (2016‚Äìpresent) In late February 2010, it was reported that the leading contender to helm The Flash was Greg Berlanti (who subsequently went on to introduce The Flash TV show). Warner Bros. Chairman and CEO Barry Meyer said they are getting close to giving the go-ahead for a movie. On June 9, 2010, Green Lantern writers Berlanti, Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim were hired to pen a treatment of the film.‚Äù The Flash script will apparently be based on the recent run by DC's Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns. Mazeau told Blastr.com that the studio are still actively developing the big screen take on the DC Comics' character and that the project is not dead yet. On July 20, 2013, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that the film was rumored to be released in 2016 but it has not been announced. In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced The Flash would be released in 2018 as the sixth installment of the DC Extended Universe. Ezra Miller was cast to play the title role of Barry Allen. However, the Flash project had been renamed 'Flashpoint' and has tentatively been moved to an unspecified 2020 release date but possibly even later making it, at a minimum, the eleventh installment of the DC Extended Universe instead of the sixth. Miller made a cameo appearance in the Arrowverse's ‚ÄúCrisis on Infinite Earths: Part Four‚Äù. =Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)= The Flash's first appearance in the DCEU happened in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice where the character made two small appearances. He first appears in a nightmare sequence showing up in the Batcave, wearing a futuristic armor version of his classic costume, in order to warn Bruce Wayne of an upcoming threat. Although the scene is left for interpretation, with Flash stating that Lois is the key and that Bruce was right about \\"him\\" mixed in with a frustrated realization that he is \\"too soon\\", it indicates a possible post-apocalyptic future which the character is trying to prevent. He is later seen again, this time in the \\"real world\\" and in the present day when Wonder Woman is going through the recorded footage of several metahuman sightings.

He also has his trademark Flash ring and is more serious than previous animated incarnations of Flash. In the film, Mirror Master is the villain chosen by Vandal Savage to fight Flash. Mirror Master does so by tricking Flash into sticking his hand in a \\"hostage box\\" to save an old woman. Only the woman is a hologram and Flash ends up with a speed sensitive bomb on his wrist.

Professor Zoom later reveals this to have been a trap for the Flash. He intends to kill Flash along with thousands of others, and link Flash's name to the destruction. The Justice League shows up and defuses all the bombs that Zoom set and all the villains are arrested. Shaken by what transpired, and full of thoughts about his dead mother, Flash parts from his Justice League colleagues and chooses to be alone. The next day, Flash wakes up in a universe where history has happened differently. Here, he has none of his powers, his mother is alive, Iris is married to someone else, and a feud between Aquaman and Wonder Woman has triggered an all-out global war. Flash blames Professor Zoom for messing with the timeline. He enlists the help of Batman (Thomas Wayne, Bruce's father) to regain his speed. He does so by recreating the accident that gave him his powers. The first attempt fails, leaving Barry with third degree burns. The second attempt, however, is successful, with him fully regaining his speed. Barry then gathers up a band of heroes including Cyborg (a government agent), and the Shazam Kids (all of whom become one Captain Thunder when they all say the wizard Shazam's name together) to stop the war and restore the timeline. However, during a fight with Professor Zoom, Flash discovers that Zoom did not do anything, and that it was he who altered time by going back and saving his mother. After Batman kills the evil speedster, Flash travels back and prevents himself from saving his mother, but once again fractures time, creating another alternate timeline which differs in subtler ways from the original.

He later appears in a meeting with the Justice League, and talks about his upcoming wedding with his fianc√© Iris West, to which Clark asks him how he is comfortable revealing his identity to her and make her part of his life, to which Barry explains that loving someone is about trust, which encourages Clark to reveal himself as Superman to Lois Lane. The Flash later joins the Justice League against the rampaging Doomsday, whom viciously pummels every member of the League, even as Flash attacks him with Hawkman's mace, he is greatly injured by the monster.

The surviving heroes find him depowered and rescue him, Constantine looks into his mind and learns he was the one who caused the current events. In the end of the film, after Darkseid and his forces are defeated and 31% of Earth's core is damaged, Constantine convinces Flash to create another Flashpoint despite promising Iris, he would never do it again. So Barry goes back in time to reset the timeline. Television=AnimatedThe Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure= The Flash and Kid Flash on The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure In 1967, The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure was produced by Filmation and featured eighteen, seven-minute shorts which starred various DC Universe heroes, including three solo adventures of the Flash (Barry Allen). Wally West, as Kid Flash, appears in two segments starring the Flash (Barry Allen); they are titled \\"Take a Giant Step\\" and \\"To Catch a Blue Bolt\\"; the latter shows Barry and Wally changing into their Flash and Kid Flash uniforms using their rings. Wally's appearance differs from his comic book counterpart. He has black hair, and the red and yellow color scheme of his second costume is reversed, as well as simplified to put him in trunks. Barry was also seen as a member of the Justice League of America, which also included Superman, Atom, Green Lantern, Hawkman, and sometimes Aquaman. Wally additionally appeared as Kid Flash on the Teen Titans segment, which also featured Aqualad, Wonder Girl and Speedy. The Flash and Kid Flash were voiced by Cliff Owens and Tommy Cook, respectively. =Super Friends= Flash (Barry Allen) appeared off and on in the Super Friends series throughout its run from 1973 to 1986. He was voiced by Jack Angel. =DC animated universe= The Flash appeared in Superman: The Animated Series, voiced by Charlie Schlatter, in the second- season episode \\"Speed Demons\\". As in the traditional comic book storylines, the Flash and Superman race to determine who is faster, but the Weather Wizard gets in the way, leading the two of them to work together. He also appears in Batman: Gotham Adventures #25 after a theft in Central City leads him to Gotham. The Flash in the Justice League animated series is voiced by Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor on the television series Smallville). This Flash is eventually identified as Wally West; however, he is an amalgamation of Barry Allen and Wally West (in Justice League Unlimited, Wally is a forensic scientist, which was Barry's profession. Wally in the comics is an auto mechanic). The importance of the Flash as the \\"heart\\" of the Justice League was shown in the episode \\"A Better World\\", when his death in an alternate timeline triggered a series of events which turned that alternate League (the \\"Justice Lords\\") into virtual dictators of Earth. He has also proven key in saving the day in a few episodes, such as \\"Divided We Fall\\", where he defeated the fused Brainiac/Lex Luthor when the other six founding Justice League members could not. In the process, he was drawn into the Speed Force (the first explicit use of the concept in the DCAU), and barely managed to escape. The episode \\"Flash and Substance\\" is centered on the opening of the Flash Museum on \\"Flash Appreciation Day\\" in Central City, and featured many of the Flash's rogues in cameos, while focusing on Captain Boomerang, Mirror Master, Captain Cold, and The Trickster (voiced by Mark Hamill). Linda Park also appears as a reporter covering the museum opening. Mirror Master alludes to the fact that Wally West may not have been the only Flash, saying to the rest of the Rogues, \\"We've all been stopped by a Flash.\\"Justice League Unlimited, episode #31 \\"Flash and Substance\\". Additionally, the episode \\"The Great Brain Robbery\\", saw the Flash and Lex Luthor inadvertently changing consciousness‚ÄîWally West (inside Lex Luthor's body) is tasked with trying to figure out what has occurred, escape, and not be killed by the suspicious members of the Legion of Doom. The Flash, as he appeared in Superman: The Animated Series Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. Wally West is the Flash featured as one of the seven founding members of the Justice League, in both the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited animated series. His personality is more or less the same as it is from his appearance on Superman: The Animated Series, and his flippant attitude is often used to provide comic relief from the often intense nature of his fellow Leaguers. He is the featured hero in several episodes. However, in one episode of Justice League Unlimited, he complains to Elongated Man that he dislikes being viewed as the \\"teenage sidekick\\" even though he was part of the original seven. His super fast metabolism, which results in him eating absurdly and inhumanly large portions of food, was something of a running gag in the series. Even in the episode \\"The Great Brain Robbery\\" Lex Luthor, after possessing Flash's body, defeats Justice League members and before running eats some food. Flash's endorsement of the \\"Lightspeed\\" candy bar (which created controversy fueled by a talk-show host who constantly dissed the League in one episode) was also a sort of running gag, as the bars make many other appearances, in some cases with Flash's picture on the wrapper. He also appears in Static Shock episode \\"A League of Their Own\\" alongside Batman, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl and Martian Manhunter. Barry Allen elements of the JL/JLU animated Flash: he is the only existing Flash in the series, he was never Kid Flash (although in the episode \\"Flash and Substance\\", a Kid Flash costume is briefly seen on display in the Flash museum). He lives in Central City, Barry Allen's hometown as opposed to Keystone City, Wally West's hometown. He is a police scientist, which was Barry Allen's job in the comics. His origin is also that of Barry Allen's. This Flash also fought some of Barry Allen's enemies throughout the series, such as Captain Cold, Mirror Master, Captain Boomerang, Gorilla Grodd, and The Trickster. Wally also has the Flash ring, which was invented by Barry Allen in the comics, to store his Flash costume in. Wally West elements of the JL/JLU animated Flash: he has red hair and green eyes like Wally does in the comics. This Flash also has Wally's girl-crazed, occasionally big-headed manner, paired with a childlike attitude and intelligence. Despite his personality opposing the no-nonsense disposition of his fellow Leaguer, John Stewart (the Green Lantern), the two are shown to be very close friends. Wally also shows a strong friendship with Shayera Hol that is touched on several times through both the JL and JLU series, usually in a sisterly way, including him being the first to hug her after her decision to resign. In Justice League Unlimited third season's debut episode \\"I Am Legion\\", Flash says, \\"She loves me. She's like the big sister I never had. Only, you know... short.\\" Wally appears without the Flash costume twice in the series. The first time is in the \\"Starcrossed\\" episodes when the Justice League decides to remove their costumes and move around as ordinary people to hide and regroup. The Flash appears reluctant to trust his fellow Justice League members with his secret identity, whereupon Batman shows he already knows by revealing his identity saying, \\"Wally West\\" while pointing at the Flash. He then reveals the secret identity of Superman (Clark Kent) and himself (Bruce Wayne). Wally then removes his mask and Wonder Woman tells him that she likes his red hair just before ruffling it. The second time is in the episode \\"Flash and Substance\\", where Wally is shown to be working at the forensics lab before taking a half day off to attend the Flash museum opening. Wally's face is also exposed in one other episode, \\"The Great Brain Robbery\\". When his mind is switched with Lex Luthor's, Lex removes the mask to see if he can at least \\"figure out\\" who the Flash really is by looking at his face in the bathroom mirror, only to state in an annoyed tone, \\"I have no idea who this is\\", although the costume is still kept. This episode is especially written for Rosenbaum, due to his role as Luthor on Smallville. =The Batman= The Flash appeared at the end of The Batman's fourth-season finale \\"The Joining\\" as one of the members of the Justice League. The Flash was properly introduced in the episode \\"A Mirror Darkly\\" to help Batman battle Mirror Master. Also Charlie Schlatter reprised the role of Flash in the Superman episode \\"Speed Demons\\". The creators stated that their version was intended to be Barry Allen, but they would leave it up to viewers to decide for themselves. This Flash is known to speak at an unusually fast pace. =Teen Titans animated series= Teen Titans. Kid Flash debuts in the episode of the Teen Titans animated series entitled \\"Lightspeed\\". While the character's true identity is never revealed, the fact that Michael Rosenbaum voices the character implies that he is intended to be Wally West since Rosenbaum also voices an older Flash/Wally West in Justice League. In the series, he is portrayed in a similar way as Wally was portrayed in comic books. His personality is often considered laid back, and he is known to be comedic and sometimes flirtatious. When Jinx asks Kid Flash who he is working for, he says, \\"I work alone these days\\", implying a previous partnership with the Flash. When the Titans are searching for the Brotherhood of Evil and the Titans East have gone back home to Steel City, Kid Flash decides to help protect Jump City and prevent crimes from being committed. When he interferes with the H.I.V.E. Five's criminal deeds, he flirts with their leader, Jinx, and tries to make her reevaluate her life of crime. Shortly afterwards the H.I.V.E Five attempts to capture him, and after Madame Rouge tires him out, Jinx traps him in an electric field. Jinx nearly hands him over to Madame Rouge, but she frees him when she realizes Madame Rouge does not appreciate her help, and that Kid Flash was the one who truly cared for her well-being. Afterwards, Jinx quits the H.I.V.E. Five and joins forces with him as a Titan; the two quickly form a romantic relationship. He appears briefly in a shot of all the Titans in \\"Calling All Titans\\", where it is revealed the Titans have come in contact with him and he has a Titan communicator. (Presumably, this is why he decided to go to Jump City in the first place, though this is never confirmed on-screen.) In \\"Titans Together\\", he brings Jinx to the Brotherhood's lair as his ally and helps the speedsters M√°s y Menos and the other Titans freeze the Brotherhood's member villains inside cryogenic cases. M√°s y Menos are very impressed by Kid Flash's speed and abilities. Kid Flash is one of the few Titans in the animated series to fully resemble his comic counterpart. However, Wally's eyes in the comics are green. The design of Kid Flash with blue eyes remains consistent with his original appearances, pre-Crisis. Kid Flash is mentioned in issue #28 of Teen Titans Go!, and makes cameo appearances in several other issues. He is featured in a worldwide race against M√°s y Menos in issue #34. Although knowing that Jinx obviously has feelings for him, he inadvertently flirts with Raven, Argent, and several other girls while running the race. This makes Jinx jealous and causes him to lose the race to M√°s y Menos when she shows up at the finish line and confronts him about his flirtatious nature. They remain close, however, and share their first official kiss in issue #53. =Batman: The Brave and the Bold= The Jay Garrick version of the Flash appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Trials of the Demon!\\". In the teaser plot Jay (voiced by Andy Milder) teams up with Batman to stop Scarecrow and Scream Queen. Jay returns in a silent cameo in \\"The Fate of Equinox!\\", allowing Doctor Fate to temporarily give Batman his super-speed for the fight against the god-like Equinox. In \\"The Golden Age of Justice!\\", Jay Garrick is shown to be a long-time member of the Justice Society of America as the team battles their old foe Per Degaton. In \\"Sidekicks Assemble!\\", in a flashback, the Barry Allen version of the Flash appears in a cameo with the Justice League. In \\"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!\\", Jay Garrick, Barry Allen (this time voiced by Alan Tudyk) and Wally West (voiced by Hunter Parrish) all appear, as the three Flashes and Batman take on Professor Zoom. =Young Justice= All versions of the Flash appear in Young Justice. In the beginning, the Wally West version of Kid Flash appears as a main character in the animated adaptation of Young Justice, with Barry Allen appearing as his mentor and a member of the Justice League and Jay Garrick as a \\"retired speedster\\". The character is voiced by actor Jason Spisak. After the first episode, Kid Flash wears a modified outfit that includes goggles and pads on his shoulders and an active camouflage unit. He is usually seen eating something in most episodes, which he attributes to the high metabolism he must maintain for his super speed. Kid Flash has a habit of collecting a souvenir from each battle, including one of Mister Twister's robotic eyes, a Kobra cultist's mask, an arrow fired by Artemis (although at the time he thought it was fired by Speedy), Cheshire's mask, and even the Helm of Nabu. He keeps his souvenirs on a shelf in Mount Justice. It is mentioned that, unlike his mentor, Barry Allen, he does not have the ability to vibrate through solid objects, because he will have a bloody nose. He is shown as having a strict disbelief in magic, believing everything can be explained with science‚Äîthough it is left ambiguous at the end of the episode \\"Denial\\" whether or not he has come to accept the \\"truth\\" about the supernatural after his experiences with Kent Nelson. Later dialogue related to Dr. Fate indicates that he at least accepts that the Helmet of Fate is a powerful and dangerous artifact. The episode \\"Coldhearted\\" centers around Wally making a cross-country dash on his sixteenth birthday to deliver a transplant heart to a young girl in the middle of an artificial snowstorm caused by five floating fortresses. Although Wally initially resents this assignment, as his teammates are working alongside the Justice League to take down the fortresses, he realizes the importance of the mission and manages to reach the hospital in time, despite being attacked by Vandal Savage during the journey. When he arrives he is initially mislead into believing that he arrived too late, due to the time he spent fighting Savage, and the patient had died, but this was revealed to be another misdirection tactic. Wally learns that the girl in question is Queen Perdita of Vlatava, and his distractions were engineered by Count Vertigo. Wally tricks Vertigo into a confession and he is imprisoned. In the episode \\"Insecurity\\", Kid Flash consoles Artemis over her fears of being replaced by Red Arrow, but is later enraged after her selfish attempts to mislead and outperform Red Arrow allow Sportsmaster and Cheshire to escape. In \\"Usual Suspects\\", he appears to forgive her after it is revealed why Artemis allowed Sportsmaster and Cheshire to escape. In the second-season episode \\"Salvage\\" it is revealed that Wally has retired from being Kid Flash and is living with Artemis in Palo Alto (a nod to show creator Greg Weisman who went to Stanford). They have been dating since the end of the first season. His habit of collecting souvenirs is taken over by new Team member Beast Boy. Wally has been shown to be slower than both his uncle Barry Allen, the second Flash, and Bart Allen (Impulse), his first cousin once removed, as seen in the episode \\"Bloodlines\\". Later in the season he, along with Nightwing and Kaldur and Artemis, fakes Artemis' death to allow her to infiltrate Black Manta's organization using the magical disguise of Tigress. In the penultimate episode \\"Summit\\", Artemis is exposed as a mole to Black Manta, the Light and the alien Reach, but is rescued from them by the entire team, including Wally, who has briefly come out of retirement. In the season two finale, Artemis and Wally work together to destroy one of 21 Reach devices which were set to destroy the planet. Flash (Barry) and Impulse (Bart) are required to produce enough kinetic energy to reverse the final device, and Wally joins them to increase their chances of success, but his slower speed leads to him acting as a release valve for the excess energy and he is vaporized. The team is greatly affected by Wally's death, and Bart takes up the mantle of Kid Flash in Wally's honor. This was likely a homage to Barry Allen's death and Wally West succeeding him in Crisis on Infinite Earths. =Mad= The Flashes (Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West with Bart Allen as Kid Flash) appear in Mad where they try to appeal to Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \\"Super Friends.\\" =Teen Titans Go!= Kid Flash appears in the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"Multiple Trick Pony\\", voiced by Will Friedle. In contrast to their relationship in the comics, Robin and Kid Flash have a fierce rivalry in this show. =Vixen= Barry Allen (voiced by Grant Gustin) appears in the animated series, Vixen, which is part of the Arrowverse. =DC Super Hero Girls= The Barry Allen version of the Flash appears as a student at Super Hero High in DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by Josh Keaton. =Justice League Action= The Barry Allen version of the Flash appears in Justice League Action, with Charlie Schlatter reprising his role. Live-action In 1979, the Flash appeared in the live- action Legends of the Superheroes specials, played by actor Rod Haase. =The Flash (1990‚Äì1991)= John Wesley Shipp as the titular protagonist of the television series The Flash. The Flash was a live action television series on CBS that starred John Wesley Shipp and Amanda Pays. The Flash featured in the series was an amalgamation of the silver-age Flash, Barry Allen, and the modern-age Wally West. The only resemblance between the TV Barry Allen Flash and the comic book Barry Allen Flash were his name, his profession as a forensic scientist, and his love interest Iris West played by Paula Marshall (who was very short lived as a love interest in the television series). In this version, while working as police detective, Barry was working in the crime lab at the Central City Police Department headquarters one night when a lightning bolt struck his lab, dousing him in electricity and nearby chemicals which soon gave him the ability to run at superhuman speeds, just like in the comics. The series also included and featured an older brother for Barry named Jay Allen (named after Jay Garrick the original Flash) who was also a police officer and a motorcycle cop. Jay was killed in the line of duty by a criminal gang leader named Nicholas Pike. After that, Barry donned a special red prototype deep sea diving-suit from Russia designed to withstand friction and pressure, and called himself the Flash. By using his new costume and powers, Barry captured Pike and brought him to justice. From then on, Barry used his identity as Flash to help bring down other criminals in Central City. He became a hero full-time. Most of the elements in the television show were taken directly from the main story line in the first Wally West Flash comic books: The S.T.A.R. Labs researcher Tina McGee, she and her husband's research into speed, her husband's allegedly fatal accident with their speed research, the Flash's ravenous appetite, heat problems (which were mitigated by the TV show's Flash suit), and speed limit on the order of the speed of sound were all elements from the main Wally West comic book storyline. The Flash's most famous villain in the series was the Trickster, played by Mark Hamill, who later went on to voice the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series and, later, the Trickster in Justice League Unlimited. Captain Cold, played by Michael Champion, and Mirror Master, played by David Cassidy, also appeared in their own episodes. The complete series was released as a DVD set by Warner Bros. in 2006. The Flash TV Special #1 comic introduced a variation on Kid Flash. This particular version of the character was a teenage thief named Vince Everett. Unlike the Flash, his powers did not require eating to replenish. His speed is pushed to the limit as he chases the Flash through an amusement park, eventually burning out his powers. Shipp later returned to the Flash franchise twenty years after the series' cancellation; first in an episode of Batman: The Brave and the Bold, titled \\"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!‚Äù voicing Professor Zoom, and later in recurring roles as Barry's father Henry Allen and Henry's parallel universe counterpart Jay Garrick in The CW's The Flash. An image of Shipp's Flash appears on an episode of The Flash (2014), as Earth-2 Harrison Wells, Cisco Ramon and Barry travel through the Arrowverse multiverse to get to Earth-2. This makes this series a part of the Arrowverse as a different universe. =Justice League of America pilot (1997)= The Flash (Barry Allen) was in a CBS live-action pilot called Justice League of America, portrayed by Kenny Johnston. The pilot did not air in the United States. Similar to The Flash TV series, this Flash appeared to be Barry Allen in name only, as he reflected Wally's age, ravenous appetite, and personality. In addition, this version of Justice League was inspired by the Keith Giffen-era Justice League, of which Wally was a member. =Smallville= Bart Allen in the Smallville episode \\"Justice\\" The Flash made guest appearances in the television series Smallville, in the fourth-season episode \\"Run\\" (first aired October 20, 2004), and in the sixth season in the episode \\"Justice\\" (first aired on January 18, 2007). He is played by Kyle Gallner. He is portrayed as a self-centered teenager who uses his powers for personal gain. He goes by the name Bart Allen, but he is shown to be carrying multiple ID cards also identifying him as Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West. His speed is depicted as being well in excess of that of Clark. Not only is he able to run backward and match Clark's top speed, but is able to run fast enough that Clark, even moving at top speed, cannot follow his movements. Their mutual respect made it apparent that they had become friends towards the end (as Superman and Flash are good friends in the future), with allusions being made to forming a \\"league\\" one day. It is mentioned that he got his powers through an accident, rather than genetics as in the comics, although at least one of the Flashes has gotten his powers through an accident. This incarnation of the Flash is also one of the few superpowered characters on Smallville who is not a \\"Meteor Freak\\", meaning they have not acquired their powers through Kryptonite-related means via one of Smallville's infamous meteor showers. Although commercials for \\"Run\\" billed him as \\"the Flash\\", he is never called by this name in the episode. Instead, in \\"Justice\\", he has been given the codename \\"Impulse\\". Like in the comics, Bart did not pick this name himself. In his second appearance, Bart has matured somewhat, but he maintained roughly the same personality. However, he is now using his powers to help others. Along with Aquaman, Green Arrow, Cyborg and Black Canary he now works to stop one of Lex Luthor's evil side projects, 33.1. Kyle Gallner reprises his role as Impulse for a final time in the season eight finale, \\"Doomsday\\". The character's presence continues to be felt thereafter, though he does not directly feature. For example, in the ninth-season episode \\"Absolute Justice\\", the Golden Age Flash, Jay Garrick, is seen in flashbacks, getting arrested with the other Justice Society members. Impulse appeared in two additional episodes; a still frame of Kyle Gallner from earlier seasons was used to give the appearance that Bart was attending a Justice League meeting via videoscreen in the season 9 finale, \\"Salvation\\". The character is also present in the season 10 episode \\"Icarus\\" at the funeral of Carter Hall, but his face is not shown. In the series' penultimate episode, villains are assembled and are each given a hero to kill. Bart is given to Captain Cold. The character later features prominently in the comic book continuation to the TV series (2012-). =The Flash (unproduced The WB series)= In 2003, it was reported that The WB was planning a Flash TV series with Todd Komarnicki signed on to write and executive produce it. Inspired by the 1960s science fiction drama The Time Tunnel, the series would have been a loose adaptation of the Flash, depicting him as a fresh-out-of-college Gotham City resident who uses his powers to travel backwards and forwards in time, going on missions. As with Smallville, the series would have eschewed superhero costumes altogether. =Arrowverse= Grant Gustin as the titular protagonist in the television series The Flash, a spin-off of Arrow. On July 30, 2013, it was announced that Arrow co-creators Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg, and Arrow pilot director David Nutter and Geoff Johns, would develop a Flash TV series for The CW. The series would be the origin story of Barry Allen. Kreisberg revealed after the announcement, that Allen would be a recurring character on Arrow in three episodes of season 2, all written by Berlanti, Kreisberg and Johns, and that the last of the episodes will act as a backdoor pilot. On September 13, 2013, Grant Gustin was chosen to portray Allen. In November 2013, it was announced that the third appearance of Allen on Arrow would no longer be a backdoor pilot, with the studio opting to make a traditional pilot instead. By doing so, it allowed the creative team to flesh out the Flash's story and his world on a bigger budget, instead of being constrained to incorporating Arrow characters within a backdoor pilot. The decision was made after CW executives saw material from Barry Allen's first two episodes on Arrow, which were very well received. The pilot was written by Berlanti, Kreisberg and Johns, directed by Nutter, and executive produced by Berlanti, Kreisberg, Nutter and Melissa Kellner Berman. The show would still be tied to Arrow, since that is where Barry Allen made his first appearance. On January 29, 2014, The Flash was officially ordered for a pilot episode. Both Jay Garrick and Wally West later appear in season 2, with John Wesley Shipp as Garrick, from Earth-3. and Keiynan Lonsdale as Wally. Shipp later reprises his role as Barry Allen / The Flash from the 1990 television series in the crossover \\"Elseworlds,\\" retroactively establishing this iteration of the superhero as an Earth-90 counterpart of Jay Garrick and Earth-1 Barry's father Henry Allen. Ezra Miller reprised his role as the DCEU version of Barry Allen in the Crisis on Infinite Earths Arrowverse crossover. =Supergirl= On February 3, 2016, it was announced that Gustin would appear on the Supergirl episode \\"Worlds Finest\\", due to Supergirl existing in the Arrowverse multiverse. In the episode, Barry travels to Supergirl's Earth by accident, allying with her to find a way back to his Earth and defeat the new 'alliance' of supervillains Livewire and Silver Banshee.

Other appearances * Wally West was the protagonist in the novel The Flash: Stop Motion, written by Mark Schultz. In popular culture * In the Simpsons episode \\"New Kids on the Blecch\\", Comic Book Guy dresses up like the Flash and says, \\"No one can outrun The Flash\\" until he falls and gets stuck in an open manhole. In the earlier episode \\"Marge vs. the Monorail\\", Lyle Lanley, is addressing a class of children and is asked whether his monorail can outrun the Flash. After replying in the affirmative, he is asked if Superman can outrun the Flash, to which he replies \\"Sure, whatever...\\" * In 2002, the lead character in the movie Catch Me If You Can a con man, Frank Abagnale Jr. played by Leonardo DiCaprio is shown with a stack of Flash comics in his room. He later uses the alias \\"Barry Allen\\" to elude Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks, a reference to his love for the comic book. Later, at a diner, Carl realizes that Barry Allen is an alias when a waiter asks him if he collects Flash comics after seeing the name, \\"Barry Allen\\". This allows Carl to find Frank's real name. At the end of the film, Carl visits Frank in prison and gives him some Flash comics as a present. * In the 2003 movie Daddy Day Care, Jimmy Bennett plays Tony, a boy who thinks he is the Flash and refuses to take off his costume. A sugar rush actually affords him super speed for a while. He is eventually convinced to stop being the Flash after a conversation with Marvin (Steve Zahn), where Tony sees that he knows nothing else about the Flash. * The band \\"Jim's Big Ego\\" has a song entitled \\"The Ballad of Barry Allen\\", about the Flash.

The Flash, Superman, and Wonder Woman are unable to stop Reverse-Flash which leads to them talking about their reverse opponents. When Wonder Woman mentions her reverse opponent Negative Wonder Woman, a black version of Diana who's costume is the reverse of Diana's (it doesn't cover her breast or pubic area, and only covers the parts of her body which are uncovered for Diana's costume) who rides in a visible jet, she happens to be robbing a nearby bank. Negative Wonder Woman flees and Wonder Woman sarcastically remarks \\"Don't touch her or anything\\", Flash responds to this by telling Superman, \\"I'd touch her till she couldn't walk, Booyah!\\" (indicating he would have sex with her). It was not revealed if this version of the Flash was to be Barry Allen or Wally West. Both the Flash and Kid Flash appear in the episode, \\"They Took My Thumbs\\". They appear in the \\"Take your Sidekicks to Work\\" skit, where the sidekicks visit the Watchtower. During Wonder Woman's speech, Kid Flash uses his super speed to remove Diana's costume rendering her nude in front of the sidekicks and League members. As Wonder Woman takes her clothes back, the Flash admonishes Kid Flash for his actions, but after Diana leaves it is revealed that the Flash secretly is proud of Kid Flash's prank and they celebrate with a \\"Super speed high five\\". Kid Flash and the sidekicks are later teleported over a live volcano and killed by Martian Manhunter's sidekick Martian Boyhunter (though Martian Manhunter takes the fall, as everyone believes that Boyhunter exists only in his mentor's imagination). The Flash joins the other League members in giving a beating to Martian Manhunter (Martian Boyhunter turns visible and proceed to call everyone \\"douches\\"). * In The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Middle Earth Paradigm\\", the four main characters dress as the Flash when they are invited to go to a Halloween party but change as they did not want to go in the same costume. (Although Raj suggests that they \\"Walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.\\") The character of Sheldon is also frequently seen to be wearing a Flash T-shirt. Similarly in the episode \\"The Work Song Nanocluster\\", Sheldon is shown dressed as the Flash and imitating his powers, after drinking coffee. In the episode \\"The Justice League Recombination\\", Sheldon again wears a Flash costume for a New Year's Eve party, though this time the others appear as different DC characters: Leonard Hofstadter as Green Lantern, Howard Wolowitz as Batman, Rajesh Koothrapali as Aquaman, Penny as Wonder Woman and Penny's current boyfriend, Zack as Superman. Later on in \\"The Dependence Transcendence\\", a sleep-deprived Sheldon has a dream where the Flash (portrayed by Brandon Jones) persuades him that energy drinks are beneficial. * A guy dressed as the Flash was one of the superheroes on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. * At Six Flags theme parks, which frequently use DC superheroes around the park, visitors can spend additional money to buy \\"The Flash Pass\\" which allows them speed through lines to certain attractions. Promotions for the pass frequently feature the Flash himself. * On the show Angel, in the fifth season episode \\"Shells\\", when new adversary/future ally Illyria makes her escape from the group, after Spike mentions a glimpse of a blur, Charles Gunn says \\"Yeah, like she was pulling a Barry Allen.\\" This meets with blank stares from the other characters. He continues on with, \\"Jay Garrick? Wally (pauses), like she was moving really fast\\" (In reality, Illyria manipulated the flow of time so that she was moving far too quickly to be seen). * In the show No Ordinary Family when Stephanie Powell finds out she can time travel via super speed, her friend and assistant Katie mentions the Flash. * The Flash fights Quicksilver from the Avengers in the popular ScrewAttack series Death Battle and won. He is also featured in One Minute Melee, another ScrewAttack show, where he fought Sonic the Hedgehog from the eponymous series in season 1 and ends up losing when his opponent turns into Super Sonic.

Mick started his football career with Drogheda Youths and won an FAI Youth Cup medal in 1970 scoring in the replay of the final. At age 18 he played in the 1971 FAI Cup Final with Drogheda who lost to Limerick after a replay. This qualified Drogheda for the Blaxnit Cup where Drogheda lost on penalties to eventual winners Linfield. Mick was bought by Huddersfield Town (who were then in the English Premier Division) in August 1971 and made his first team debut against Wolves in October 1971. He made 20 appearances in the 1971/72 season including games against Arsenal, Chelsea - (see Match Programme) Crystal Palace, Everton, Spurs & Wolves. He also represented Ireland in the International match against the West German Olympic team, and scored the third goal in a 3-0 win. Mick received a serious leg injury against Walsall on 17 September 1973 and this ultimately ended his career prematurely in 1974. He was out of football for 6 years and then made a comeback in the League of Ireland with Dundalk F.C. after receiving treatment from Bobby McGregor the renowned Northern Ireland Physio. His first League of Ireland game in nearly a decade came at Glenmalure Park on 2 March 1980 when he came off the bench and scored the equaliser for the Lilywhites. This goal helped secure second place in the 1979‚Äì80 League of Ireland season which meant qualification for the 1980‚Äì81 UEFA Cup. Fairclough made his European debut against F.C. Porto in the Est√°dio das Antas on 17 September 1980. That season he scored the winner in the semi final of the FAI Cup and scored in the Final against Sligo Rovers. \\\\- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m58go3MB3Kc Mick played for Dundalk for a further 4 years where he was top scorer for 3 consecutive seasons during which time he won FAI Cup and League medals.

Severe intellectual deficit and death within the first decade are typical.  Genetics  CAMFAK syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

He started his own practice after 1888. Conder designed numerous public buildings in Tokyo, including the Rokumeikan, which became a controversial symbol of Westernisation in the Meiji period. He educated young Japanese architects, notably Tatsuno Kingo and Katayama T≈çkuma, earning him the nickname \\"father of Japanese modern architecture.\\" Early career Conder was born in Brixton, Surrey, London, to Josiah Conder, a banker, and his wife, Elizabeth (Willsher). Conder was educated at Bedford Modern School,Bedford Modern School of the Black And Red, by Andrew Underwood, 1981. and then became an architect pupil with Thomas Roger Smith.Thomas Roger Smith in 1871 England Census, Joshiah Conder, servant, age 18, architect pupil, born about 1853 at Brixton, Surrey, Civil Parish at Lewisham, Christchurch, Town Forest Hill. He later studied architecture at the South Kensington School of Art and the University of London. His grandfather, Josiah Conder (1789-1855) was a well known religious bookseller and author, mostly known for his book The Modern Traveller. His uncle, Francis Roubiliac Conder (1815-1889), was a successful civil engineer in railway construction. Francis Roubiliac's son, Claude Reignier Conder, became a Royal Engineer after graduating from the University of London and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He made extensive geographical and archaeological surveys over the Middle East at the end of 19th century. Conder worked for the Gothic Revival architect William Burges for two years.Entry in the ODNB, Olive Checkland, Josiah Conder (1852‚Äì1920), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Published by Oxford University Press, 2004 In 1876 he was awarded the Soane Medal.. Career in Japan Conder was surely interested in the Orient through his relatives' works, in particular of Claude Reignier Conder, but it is unknown how he was appointed as professor for the Imperial College of Engineering, Tokyo. The Imperial College of Engineering started teaching in October 1873 by British instructors led by a principal Henry Dyer, who was looking for an architect-professor in the Department of Architecture. Charles Alfred Chastel de Boinville had been an architect of Japan's Public Works since 1873 and built the main building of the College. Conder arrived in Tokyo in January 1877 and quickly established a reputation as a dedicated and highly skilled teacher. The Calendar of the College was prepared by its principal, Henry Dyer, a 6 year programme, consisting of a basic course, technical course and practice course, 2 years for each. Conder taught both technical subjects and practice including design theory, architectural history, drawing, technical draftsmanship.Henry Dyer, Reports of the Imperial College of Engineering, 1877, p.98.. Most graduates played essential roles in the development of modern Japan's architecture, including Tatsuno Kingo, Katayama T≈çkuma, Sone Tatsuz≈ç and Satachi Shichijir≈ç. Yorinaka Tsumaki and Shimoda Kikutaro, who left the Imperial College of Engineering before graduation, also became successful architects. Conder taught history of oriental architecture using James Fergusson's works which insisted that there was no substantial architecture in the Orient except Mughal architecture,James Fergusson, History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, London, 1876, p.710. \\"It may be, however, that the Japanese do not belong to one of the building races of mankind, and have no taste for this mode of magnificence. It is the same story as in China\\", a kind of Saracenic architectureJames Fergusson, The Illustrated Handbook of Architecture, 1855, p.433.. Conder believed Saracenic based style might be suitable for modern Japan, and utilized it as Pseudo-Saracenic style for his early works including the Tokyo Imperial Museum, the retail shop of the Hokkaido Development Authority and the Rokumeikan.Izumida Hideo, Design as National Identity - Islamic Style in Modern Japan, Proceedings of the SAHANZ Conference Asia- Australinesia, July 1992, pp.131-146.. This style was limitedly accepted by Tatsuno Kingo for his design of the Kokugi-Kan (National Sumo Wrestling Hall),Twin entrance towers were crown by Chhatri, an important motif of Mugal architecture and Conder was very disappointed that most of his students did not understand his intention. Conder was charged with transforming the Marunouchi area into a London-style business district by the Ministry of Industry on a five-year contract. Despite residing in Japan, he kept up a professional affiliation with the Royal Institute of British Architects, becoming an Associate in 1874 and a Fellow in 1884. He became a part-time lecturer until he set up his own practice in 1888. Some of his former students set up the Architectural Institute of Japan and made Conder its first honorary president.Stewart (2002), p36 He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasures (3rd class) in 1894. Conder developed a keen interest in Japanese arts and after a long period of petitioning, was finally accepted to study painting with the artist Kawanabe Ky≈çsai. Ky≈çsai dubbed Conder , incorporating the character from the Japanese name for Britain. Conder also studied Enshu school ikebana. His studies led to a number of publications, among them \\"The Flowers of Japan and The Art of Floral Arrangement\\" (1891), \\"Landscape Gardening in Japan\\" (1893) and \\"Paintings and Studies by Kawanabe Kyosai\\" (1911). He wrote the first after a lecture at the Asiatic Society of Japan. In 1915, the Tokyo Imperial University awarded Conder an honorary doctorate.Stewart (2002), p37 He remained in Japan for the rest of his life. His grave is at the temple of Gokoku-ji in Bunkyo, Tokyo. Notable buildings Former Iwasaki Family House and Garden (1896) Conder's architectural designs incorporated a wide variety of styles, including European and colonial elements.

Admissions It is located on Holly Lane on the middle point between Smethwick and Oldbury, near West Smethwick Park and West Park Road less than a mile from the M5. There are also entrances on Marshall Street and Forster Street. The school has a large percentage (65%) of pupils from Sikh, Hindu and Islamic communities. 23% of the school population are white. The school was expanded in September 1992 when it took in the pupils of Smethwick Hall Boys School, which had closed at the end of the school year that July. The current headteacher is Mr P Shone. Between September 2009 and August 2011, extensive refurbishment of existing facilities and the construction of new buildings occurred on the site as part of the Building Schools for the Future programme. A total of ¬£23 million was spent on improving the facilities. History It was originally a girls' and boys' grammar school. The girls' grammar school at Holly Lodge, formerly the home of the Downing family, opened in 1922, moving to a new building in 1927. The boys' grammar school opened in Holly Lodge, moving to a new building opposite the girls' school in 1932. A more detailed background to these early years can be found in The birth of an industrial grammar school:a study of the origins and early development of the Holly Lodge Grammar Schools in Smethwick (available in the Community History Reserve Collection at Sandwell Libraries). In 1940 the school was evacuated to avoid possible bombing. It settled in Newport Shropshire, sharing Adams Grammar School: AGS in the mornings and Holly Lodge in the afternoons. In 1967, the boys' school was joined with James Watt Technical School (a boys' school) on Crockett's Lane. The girls' and boys' schools were united in 1974 as a high school admitting children of all abilities on the two original sites. A Science and Technology block was built in 1970 prior to the amalgamation of the boys' and girls' schools. For a number of years, a co-educational high school was run on the premises that had once been the girls' grammar school, while the former boys' grammar school premises housed West Park Sixth Form College, which closed in 1992. In September 1992, the modern Holly Lodge officially began when three schools in West Smethwick merged. The school has been rebuilt following the Building Schools for the Future programme. Holly Lodge became a specialist College of Science in the summer of 2004. In 2010 the school received a lot of press coverage due to the remodelling and refurbishing of the building which was provided by BSF 'Building Schools for the Future' and also received attention when Atlantic R&B; Singer Lloyd Polite visited during one of the yearly talent shows where he had a session with a year 11 group giving them tips and advice for the music industry. There is still an active Holly Lodge Grammar & James Watt Technical School Old Boys Association and a separate Holly Lodge Old Girls Association. Academic performance In 2009, 27% of students gained five GCSEs at grades A* ‚Äì C including English and mathematics. This was, however, a 12% improvement on 2008 results. The science specialism is working exceptionally well with 65% of the students gaining grades A* to C. This is above the national average. This was acknowledged by Ofsted in June 2010. The school has gone from strength to strength, in the summer examinations in 2010; 39% of the students gained five A*-C grades including English and mathematics. This rose again in 2011; to 50% gaining 5x A*-C grades including English and mathematics. The school went through another Ofsted inspection in May 2013. The leadership of Ahson Mohammed was having an impact as each category was judged as 'good' with exemplary practice in developing literacy. The school has therefore moved from National Challenge to a good school in four years.

Built in the 1850s, it was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1976 as one of the American South's finest and most lavish examples of Gothic Revival architecture. The house is owned by the adjacent St. John's Episcopal Church, which offers tours and uses it as a meeting and reception space. Description The Green‚ÄìMeldrim House is located on the west side of Madison Square in central Savannah, at the southwest corner of West Harris and Bull Streets. West Macon Street, the house's address, is a spur street off Whitaker Street, which runs behind the property. The house's principal facade faces south, with a porch and garden facing the square. The house is among the best- known examples of the Gothic Revival style in the South, with a stuccoed brick exterior, cast-iron porch, oriel windows, and an imposing front cast-iron fence. The main entrance has an iron portico believed to be unique in the United States, with octagonal posts supported a pair of arches. A crenellated parapet rings the roof. The interior of the house, following a center-hall plan, retains original woodwork, plaster, and ironwork, the latter featuring a freestanding staircase. History The Entrance Hall in 1864, when it was being used as General Sherman's Headquarters. A sketch by left The house was designed and built between 1853 and 1861 at a cost of $93,000 by the architect John Norris. The property's first owner was Charles Green, a wealthy cotton merchant and grandfather of the writer Julien Green. At this time, none of the original furniture is on display at the house. After the Union troops captured Savannah in 1864, Sherman occupied the house and used it as a headquarters until the end of the Civil War. It was in this house in December 1864 that Sherman composed his famous telegram to President Lincoln, in which he communicated his desire to present to the President \\"as a Christmas Gift the City of Savannah, with one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about twenty-five thousand bales of cotton\\"; the cotton belonged to Charles Green, the owner of the House. In 1892, local politician and judge Peter Meldrim purchased the property and lived in it a number of decades.Polk‚Äôs Savannah City Directories In 1943, his heirs sold the house to St John's Church, which is located next door. In the 1950s, Savannah Landscape Architect Clermont Huger Lee provided period appropriate designs and planting plans for the garden.

In its hydrous form, Na4Fe(CN)6 (sodium ferrocyanide decahydrate), it is sometimes known as yellow prussiate of soda. It is a yellow crystalline solid that is soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. The yellow color is the color of ferrocyanide anion. Despite the presence of the cyanide ligands, sodium ferrocyanide has low toxicity (acceptable daily intake 0‚Äì0.025 mg/kg body weight). The ferrocyanides are less toxic than many salts of cyanide, because they tend not to release free cyanide. However, like all ferrocyanide salt solutions, addition of an acid can result in the production of hydrogen cyanide gas, which is toxic. Uses When combined with iron, it converts to a deep blue pigment called Prussian blue. It is used as a stabilizer for the coating on welding rods. In the petroleum industry, it is used for removal of mercaptans. In the EU, ferrocyanides (E 535‚Äì538) were, as of 2018, solely authorised in two food categories as salt substitutes. Kidneys are the organ for ferrocyanide toxicity. Production Sodium ferrocyanide is produced industrially from hydrogen cyanide, ferrous chloride, and calcium hydroxide, the combination of which affords Ca2[Fe(CN)6]. A solution of this salt is then treated with sodium salts to precipitate the mixed calcium-sodium salt CaNa2[Fe(CN)6], which in turn is treated with sodium carbonate to give the tetrasodium salt.

They are both tributaries of Coyote Creek. The upper creek was diverted southwestward, connecting it directly to Coyote Creek ca. 1850 by a farmer to irrigate his fields, permanently splitting Upper Penitencia Creek from Lower Penitencia Creek. Upper Penitencia Creek drains the western slopes of Mount Hamilton of the Diablo Range, and passes through Alum Rock Park, before ending at its confluence with Coyote Creek at Berryessa Road. In December 2018, the San Francisco Estuary Institute published a report commissioned by the Santa Clara Valley Water District to establish a vision for Upper Penitencia Creek's lower four miles focusing on ways \\"to expand flow conveyance and flood water storage from the Coyote Creek confluence upstream to the Dorel Drive bridge in a manner that works with the existing landscape features and supports habitats for native species\\". Lower Penitencia Creek flows along the historic Mission Road between Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Jose. It runs through the city of Milpitas before receiving flows from Berryessa Creek, Piedmont Creek, Arroyo de los Coches, Tularcitos Creek and Calera Creek before entering Coyote Creek near Dixon Landing Road at the southern end of San Francisco Bay. History=Etymology ‚Äì Ohlone linguistics The Ohlone called the creek Shistuk, meaning \\"place of rabbits\\". However, an alternate point of view disputes this name (the Ohlone in all of the documented Ohlone languages the word for rabbit is weren or some variation thereof and therefore, place of rabbits would be Weren-tak); rather the closest word to Shis-tak would be ƒå√©eyi≈° = jackrabbit in Choche√±o, therefore Place of the Jackrabbits (Hares) would be ƒå√©eyi≈°-tak. Reference: Lingusittic Field Notes Northern Costanoan (1925-1934) of John Peabody Harrington The creek was known as Arroyo de las Penitencia, named after the Penitencia adobe house which stood at the highway and was used as a house of confession and penitence in mission times. Earlier, when Pedro Fages and Father Cresp√≠ left Monterey they crossed the Encarnacion Arroyo on November 24, 1769, their mission being to explore up the east side of San Francisco Bay, come round the top below Point Reyes and reach San Francisco. What is now known as Upper Penitencia Creek was known in the 19th century as Arroyo Aguaje (an aguaje is a spring or watering place; locally variably spelled Aguage or Aguague). A form of the name has been retained by Arroyo Aguague, the principal tributary of Upper Penitencia Creek. The name of Penitencia Creek came into existence at least as early as 1840. At that time the Arroyo Aguague (now referred to as Upper Penitencia Creek) terminated in a sausal (willow grove and freshwater marsh) that flowed in turn into Penitencia Creek (now referred to as Lower Penitencia Creek). When the Arroyo Aguague was diverted in the 1850s to Coyote Creek, it became known as Upper Penitencia Creek. Watershed The Upper Penitencia Creek watershed drains an area of and runs approximately from to its confluence with Coyote Creek, the latter being about from San Francisco Bay. The source of Upper Penitencia Creek is on Poverty Ridge in the Diablo Range. It plunges into Cherry Flat Reservoir and then flows through Alum Rock Park, where it is joined by Arroyo Aguague. Arroyo Aguague discharges to Penitencia Creek from the south, but summer inflow is very low; however, the stream flows in the Calaveras Fault zone and does not go completely dry, even in severe droughts. Lower down it forms the rough boundary between the Berryessa and Alum Rock districts of San Jose. Unlike most creeks in the Santa Clara Valley, it follows a mostly natural course and does not have concrete or gabion embankments. Ecology Upper Penitencia Creek remains a steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) stream and according to two reports may have supported coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) historically, based on habitat suitability analysis. The Santa Clara Valley Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Program (SCVURPPP) developed a workplan for watershed analysis in 2006 as the stream was deemed potentially impaired by sediment from anthropogenic activities, this Limiting Factor Analysis reported results from an extensive snorkel sampling effort during spring and fall 2005 which indicated that the watershed supported between 1,300 and 1,500 age 1+ and older steelhead, of which age 2+ and older fish comprised approximately 5 to 10%, from approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) upstream of the confluence with Coyote Creek upstream to natural waterfall barriers in Upper Penitencia Creek and Arroyo Aguague. With the exception of the man-made, historic rock baths confining the stream in Alum Rock Park, significant barriers to spawning runs were not identified. Although the structure on Upper Penitencia Creek in Alum Rock Park presents a significant partial barrier to fish passage, an engineering analysis to modify the barrier was completed in 2011. The City of San Jose, in conjunction with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) are planning to remove this barrier, a concrete weir related to the historic Youth Science Institute bridge, along with three other stream restoration projects with $2.5 million in funding from VTA as mitigation for environmental damages related to other VTA construction. The project is scheduled for completion in October, 2012. In dry summers the creek goes dry about one mile below Alum Rock Park. Flows are diverted by the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) to three off-channel percolation ponds at Noble Avenue, which in turn, recharge creek flows for about two miles below the ponds through the summer. However the diversion is also capable of drying the stream in late spring which may interfere with outmigrating steelhead smolts. A Bay Area-wide study of which watersheds had the greatest potential for restoration for steelhead trout populations identified three streams in Santa Clara County: Upper Penitencia Creek, Stevens Creek and the Guadalupe River. Penitencia Creek Trail and recreation Penitencia Creek Trail follows some of the upper creek: it begins unpaved at Noble Avenue in the east, passes percolation ponds which are open to the public, goes unofficially under Piedmont Road, becomes paved through Penitencia Creek Park, passes under Interstate 680, and ends in the far end of Penitencia Creek County Park at the Berryessa BART station. On October 25, 2008, a dedication ceremony was held to designate the trail as part of the Bay Area Ridge Trail network, where it would provide a gateway to Alum Rock Park and the Boccardo Trail, which are parts of the Ridge Trail. It will someday connect to Coyote Creek, which will provide access to the San Francisco Bay Trail. Upper Penitencia Creek is closed to fishing year-round to protect the trout population.

He later composed and arranged scores for several other early motion pictures, including such epics as D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916), as well as scoring the preview version of The Phantom of the Opera (1925), a score that is now lost. His love theme for \\"Birth of a Nation\\", titled \\"The Perfect Song\\", was published by Chappell & Co. in an arrangement for voice and keyboard. It was later used as the theme for the radio show \\"Amos and Andy\\".M.

(Joseph Sr., a lawyer, was an immigrant from Prussia and his wife was born in Pennsylvania.)1880 United States Federal Census, accessed 20 November 2012 (available through subscription). Breil graduated from Duquesne University (then the Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost) in 1888. He later composed the alma mater for the university, which was first performed in October 1920. He also pursued studies at St Fidelis College (Butler, Pennsylvania) and Curry Commercial College in Pittsburgh before being sent by his family to the University of Leipzig to study law. While in Leipzig he began to study music composition and singing at the Leipzig Conservatory. These were followed by singing lessons in Milan and Philadelphia (with Giuseppe del Puente). He toured as principal tenor of the Emma Juch Opera Company (1891‚Äì1892) before returning to Pittsburgh to teach singing and to direct the choir of St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral (1892‚Äì1897). From 1897 to 1903 he was music director for several theatre companies. An article in The New York Times, dated 12 June 1914, noted that he \\"...will conduct the orchestra at the Illinois Theatre, Chicago, during the engagement of the second presentation of Gabriele D'Annunzio's Cabiria, which opens on Thursday night.\\" Between 1903 and 1910 he was employed by the music publisher Chappell, for whom he composed many instrumental pieces and songs in addition to his role there as a staff arranger and music editor. His first critical success as a composer came in 1909 with his incidental music, including Song of the Soul (recorded by Marguerite Dunlap for Victor Records in 1910), for Edward Locke's three-act play, The Climax, which premiered on 12 April 1909, at Joseph W. Weber's Music Hall, New York City. After this he spent the next decade composing mostly film music. It is his work in this medium that his legacy rests on. He also composed the one-act lyric opera, The Legend, one of the first such works by an American. The Legend, on which Breil had begun work in 1907, premi√®red at the Metropolitan Opera on 12 March 1919, to less-than- favorable reviews. He died of heart disease on 23 January 1926, following a nervous breakdown suffered on account of the failure of his final opera, Der Asra. He is interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

He dedicated his life to the study of the roles of the national movement in the history of modern Egypt. His most prominent work was 15 volumes in which he documented the state of Egypt from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century. He was born in Cairo even though his family was from the Levant countries. He graduated from the Khadawia school of law in 1908. He spent most of his life in Cairo but moved to Alexandria for high school.immediately after his graduation he practiced law for less than a month until Mohammad Farid (a prominent lawyer and historian) asked him to become the editor of the Major General Al-San newspaper and this proved to be the first step in his life as a historian and a politician.  Politics  In 1907 he became a part of Egyptian national party that was led by Mostafa Kamel Pasha who was also a journalist and a political figure. At that point al-Rafai started to become concerned with the relationship of national history in terms of national awareness, and the emergence and development of the modern nation- state.http://www2.sis.gov.eg/Ar/Calender/default1.asp?id=2000000000000000000050&calid;=0208  Contributions  Al-Rafai started writing at an early age. His first book was written in 1912 by the name of The People's Rights . In this book he showed his political views by writing about issues such as constitutional rule and national independence, rule of law and human rights from different aspects of Islam. He also discussed in his book ideas about the European Enlightenment Era. His second book Unions of Agricultural Cooperation was published in 1914. ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßŸÅÿπŸä .. ŸÉÿßÿ™ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÖŸäŸÜ In this book he drew the nation's attention to the importance of development of rural areas is different aspects such as physical, socially and humanly. He also focused on education in this book. Al- Rafai emphasized that education should be guaranteed by the state and should have the priority of improvement over many smaller issues. Al-Rafai wrote his third book in 1922 titled National Societies where he spoke about the relationship between the social and political cohesion and economic growth. His most famous achievement is a 16 volume book that he had started to compose in the 18th century and didn't finish it until his fifties. Numerous historians have agreed that Al-Rafai researched and collected the most data concerning these topic that could have been known during that period in time and in his circumstances which makes is why his work became a strong basis to the history of systematic in Egypt and the Arab world as a whole.

A good part of its course marks the borders between Lincoln and St. Charles counties before emptying into the Mississippi River north of St. Louis. The Cuivre River State Park near Troy has its southwestern borders on the river. The river is considered a navigable stream by the Missouri water patrol. The stream headwaters are the North and West forks which merge just west of US Route 61 about three miles northwest of Troy at and an elevation of 470 feet.Okete, Missouri, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1975 (1984 rev.) The stream flows east crossing under Route 61 and then turns southeast passing under Missouri Route 47 two miles east of Troy. The stream meanders to the southeast passing under Missouri Route C just east of Moscow Mills. The stream continues to the southeast until reaching the Lincoln-St. Charles county line where it gains the major tributary of Big Creek. The stream turns east and forms the Lincoln-St. Charles county line. The stream flows northeast passing south of Chain of Rocks and crosses under Missouri Route 79 southwest of Old Monroe. The stream meanders east to meet the Mississippi at Cuivre Slough which is part of the Mississippi River west of Cuiver Island.Missouri Atlas & Gazetteer, DeLorme, 1998, First edition, p. 40, Winfield, Missouri, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1954 (1983 rev.) The confluence is at at an elevation of 423 feet. At Troy, the river has a mean annual discharge of 699 cubic feet per second. The Cuivre River received its name from French- speaking settlers during the French Louisiana. The name means \\"copper\\", though none is present along the river, and it is thought to have been named after Baron Georges Leopold Cuvier, a French naturalist and paleontologist, who was first to do comparative anatomy and the classification of animals and fossils. When France acquired the territory west of the Mississippi River, Cuvier sent two of his students to America to get specimens of flora and fauna and to assess the climate and topography of the new acquisition. When the young men reached the river in what is now the Lincoln County area, it was known to the local French as Rivi√®re aux Boeufs because of the numerous bison roaming its banks.State Historical Society of Missouri: St. Charles County The two scientists decided a more impressive name for the stream would be \\"Cuvier\\", and labeled it such on their maps. When the English-speaking settlers arrived, the spelling was changed to \\"Cuivre\\" and the pronunciation anglicized to \\"Quiver\\".State Historical Society of Missouri: Lincoln County Variant names for the stream include Buffaloe River, Copper River, Cuvier River, La Quevr, Queevere River, Quiver River, Quivre River, Riviere au Boeuf, Riviere au Cuivre, Riviere aux Boeuf, and Riviere aux Cuivre. The Battle of the Sink Hole was fought near the mouth of the Cuivre at the end of the War of 1812.

It is more generally referred to as \\"Cyclonic Vorticity Advection\\" (CVA). In the Northern Hemisphere this is positive, whilst in the Southern Hemisphere it is negative. Development Vorticity in the atmosphere is created in three different ways, which are named in their resultant vorticity. These are; Coriolis vorticity, curvature vorticity, and shear vorticity. For example, at the base of a trough, there is curvature and shear vorticity. Curvature vorticity is due to the increasing cyclonic turning as an air parcel enters the trough base. The maximum counter-clockwise spin (positive vorticity in the N.H.) is at the trough base. Shear vorticity is caused by the difference in wind speed between air moving through the trough base (typically a jet or jet finger) and slower moving air on either poleward and equatorward side of the faster flow. Consider that slower air to the poleward side will be imparted counter- clockwise spin (picture faster moving air (jet) south and slower air to the north, spin is created). Thus, to the north (poleward) of the trough base an air parcel will experience positive vorticity. Likewise, to the south of the faster flow the air is spun in a clockwise direction (faster air (jet)to the north with slower air to the south, spin is created). Thus, to the south of the faster winds will be an area of negative vorticity. When these areas of negative and positive vorticity are moved (advected) they produce areas of negative vorticity advection (NVA) and positive vorticity advection (PVA) respectively, downstream from the trough base. The positive vorticity advection area is typically associated with divergence and upward motion. The negative vorticity advection area will be associated with convergence and downward motion. This produces convergence because of the way the air gains cyclonic vorticity while entering the base of the trough. The opposite happens when air is exiting the base of a trough. This air has more cyclonic vorticity than the air it is entering and therefore produces CVA. CVA produces divergence as a result of how there is a loss of cyclonic vorticity. Coriolis vorticity in this situation is ignored because it acts about the same on all the air flowing through the base of the trough. Significance in forecasting The divergence with CVA is significant because it creates forced lift in the atmosphere. This forced lift, in the presence of conditions favorable for atmospheric convection, can cause clouds or precipitation. AVA will do the opposite and lead to a stable atmosphere. In combination with a jet streak, CVA can lead to the amplification of a trough which is significant for forecasting many conditions of the atmosphere.

She was the daughter of Tintoretto and is sometimes referred to as Tintoretta. Biography The only known primary source for details of Marietta Robusti's life is Carlo Ridolfi's Life of Tintoretto, first published in 1642, although she is mentioned briefly in Raffaelo Borghini's Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura of 1584.Eric Newton, Tintoretto. (London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1952), 62. These two sources disagree on the year of her birth: according to Borghini, she was born in 1555, but Carlo Ridolfi indicates that she was born in 1560.Carlo Ridolfi, Life of Tintoretto, trans. Catherine and Robert Enggass (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1984), 99. Marietta Robusti was probably born in 1560 and died when she was thirty during child birth. She lived in Venice all her life. She was the eldest daughter of the painter Jacopo Robusti, from whom she inherited her nickname, la Tintoretta (translated as \\"little dyer girl\\", after Jacopo's father's occupation as a tintore, or dyer). She is thus variously known as Marietta Robusti, Marietta Tintoretto, and la Tintoretta. She was followed by three brothers and four sisters.Women, Art, and Society Since conventions of the time dictated that women remained in the privacy of the domestic sphere and were not welcome in the public world of art production and sale, Robusti and her female contemporaries gained access to the art world through their artist fathers or brothers.H.T. Niceley, \\"A Door Ajar: The Professional Position of Women Artists\\", Art Education 45, no. 2 (Mar., 1992): 6-13. Robusti's artistic training consisted of serving an apprenticeship in the collaborative environment of her father's workshop, where she probably contributed to her father's paintings with backgrounds and figure blocking, as was the usual distribution of labor in painting workshops of the time.Newton, Tintoretto, 66. Though Robusti's social and economic autonomy was no greater than other artisan women she had quite a following, changing the ideals of femininity within the arts. After her death, Carlo Ridolfi stated she was one of the most illustrious women of her time, having the same manner of skill as her father while displaying \\"sentimental femininity, a womanly grace that is strained and resolute.\\" While Robusti worked in her father's studio it was also said she worked on altarpieces as an assistant but her achievements were buried under the name of her father. After her death the decline in work produced by Tintoretto was ascribed to grief for his daughter, rather than the loss of a skillful assistant. After Marietta Robusti's death she became a muse for Romantic painters such as L√©on Cogniet who produced Tintoretto Painting His Dead Daughter in 1846 and Eleuterio Pagliano who painted Tintoretto and His Daughter in 1861. The trope of women artists being transformed from creators to subjects for male counterparts made her a motif for male creativity, displaying a dying muse of quietly suffering femininity. Evidence suggests that Robusti received no commissions for major religious works such as altarpieces or other church decorations, and that she was mainly a portraitist.Grove Art Online, s.v. ‚ÄúMarietta Robusti.‚Äù Available from Grove Art, George Mason University Lib.(accessed 10 February 2008). Ridolfi describes Robusti's close relationship with her father at great length. Not only did she learn at his knee, as a child she also liked to dress like a boy so that she could go everywhere with Jacopo. Emperor Maximilian and King Philip II of Spain both expressed interest in hosting her as a court painter, but her father refused their invitations on her behalf because he couldn't bear to part with her. In 1578 he arranged for her to marry a Venetian jeweler and silversmith, Jacopo Augusta, to ensure she would always stay near him. Jacopo also had Marietta instructed in singing and playing the harpsichord, clavichord, and lute. She died of unrecorded causes in 1590, and was buried in Santa Maria del‚ÄôOrto in Venice. Attributions and assessment Portrait of Ottavio Strada (c. 1567-68), attributed to Robusti Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam The only painting that can be conclusively attributed to Marietta Robusti is her Self Portrait (c. 1580; Uffizi Gallery, Florence). This portrait depicts Marietta posed before a harpsichord, holding a musical text that has been identified as a madrigal by Philippe Verdelot, \\"Madonna per voi ardo\\". It has been postulated that the inclusion of this text, whose opening lines are \\"My Lady, I burn with love for you and you do not believe it\\", suggests that the painting was created for a male viewer, possibly Marietta's husband.Katherine A. McIver, \\"Lavinia Fontana's 'Self-Portrait Making Music',\\" Woman's Art Journal 19, no. 1 (Spring-Summer 1998): 3-8. Other attributions include: Old Man and a Boy (c. 1585; Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which was long considered one of Tintoretto's finest portraits and was not revealed to be Robusti's until 1920; Portrait of Ottavio Strada (c. 1567-68; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam); and two small paintings of the Virgin and Child (dates unknown, Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio). Portrait of Two Men (Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden), signed \\"MR\\", is thought to be Marietta Robusti's only surviving signed work.

History The organization was founded in 1756 by Scottish founders in New York City who were looking to \\"relieve the distressed.\\" It was named for the patron saint of Scotland, Saint Andrew. Past presidents of the society include Philip Livingston (the first president), William Alexander (the \\"Earl of Stirling\\"), Andrew Carnegie, Ward Melville, and the Rev. Dr. David H. C. Read. Past members include Alexander Hamilton, Lewis Morris, the Rev. John Witherspoon, and John Stewart Kennedy. In 1897, the organization revised its constitution to expand eligibility for membership to lineal descendant of a Scot, not just a son or grandson of a Scot. In 1966, more than 800 members and guests honored Saint Andrew, the patron saint with its 210th anniversary dinner at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan. In 1993, there were 980 members of the Society. In 2010, the constitution is again revised, this time allowing women to be admitted into membership in the society with Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Macmillan becoming the first woman to be admitted. LeadershipPresent day The society still provides for needy Scots in New York City via its almoners program and has a scholarship program that allows two Scots to attend graduate school in the USA and three American students of Scottish lineage to attend graduate school at a Scottish institution of higher learning. Social events for the Society include the Tartan Day parade in April and an annual banquet in November. The Society sponsors a Kirkin' o' the Tartan service during Tartan Week in April of each year.

The manuscript contains the Vulgate versions of the four gospels plus prefatory matter including the Eusebian canon tables,Apart from the short texts on the tablets carried by angels, there are three prefaces by Jerome, and the Letter of Eusebius, all often found prefacing medieval Gospel books. Metz, 64-65 and is a major example of Ottonian illumination, though the manuscript, as opposed to the cover, probably falls just outside the end of rule by the Ottonian dynasty. It was produced at the Abbey of Echternach under the direction of Abbot Humbert. The manuscript has 136 folios which measure 446 mm by 310 mm. It is one of the most lavishly illuminated Ottonian manuscripts. It contains over 60 decorative pages including 16 full page miniatures, 9 full page initials, 5 evangelist portraits, 10 decorated pages of canon tables, and 16 half-page initials. In addition there are 503 smaller initials, and pages painted to resemble textiles. The entire text is written in gold ink.Walther, 128; Metz has full details Text and miniatures Each gospel is preceded by the following: two pages summarizing the gospel, two pages imitating textiles, four pages of narrative scenes laid out in three registers per page, a full-page evangelist portrait, two pages of decorative text, before a full-page initial, which begins the actual text. As one art historian put it, the planner of the book \\"was in no hurry to bring his reader to the text\\".Review by William C. Loerke of Metz (see references), College Art Journal, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Autumn, 1958), p. 86, JSTOR The narrative scenes cover the Life of Christ, including many of his miracles, and preceding Luke his parables, which by this date was becoming unusual.Dodwell, 144; all are illustrated and described in Metz, see list of plates There are one, two or sometimes three scenes in each register, giving a total of 48 framed images with 60 scenes, an unusually large number for a medieval cycle. Unlike the comparable scenes in the Augustine Gospels, the scenes are arranged to cover the life and ministry of Jesus without concern for whether a particular scene is covered in the gospel it precedes.Metz, 68 Labourers in the vineyard The pages before Matthew take the story from the Annunciation to the \\"Feast in the House of Levi\\", and those before Mark cover miracles from the Wedding at Cana to the Samaritan thanking Jesus after Cleansing ten lepers (Luke 17:11-19). The scenes before Luke show four of the parables of Jesus, each over a whole page: the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard, Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen, the Parable of the great banquet and the Rich man and Lazarus. The pages preceding John cover the final period, from the Passion of Jesus to his Ascension and Pentecost.Metz, plates and the notes on them; all pages are illustrated. Most of the miniatures are attributed to two artists, known as the \\"workshop master\\" and another presumed to be a pupil. A third, cruder, painter contributed some of the narrative scenes, and perhaps other elements which are harder to attribute. For example, the last three pages of the final narrative scenes preceding John are attributed to the master (so from the Crowning with Thorns onwards), and the first page to the pupil. It is likely that the compositions and underdrawings were all by the master, so the changes of painter are not over- conspicuous.Walther, 130 The style has been criticized for excessive interest in decorative effect: it \\"produced some vigorous and cheerful patterns, as in the St Luke, but it could descend to fussiness, as in the Christ in Majesty, where the strength of the composition has been frittered away by the ornamental vagaries of the Echternach artist. This weakness was even more apparent in the evangelist 'portraits', where the ornamental bands of the Sainte-Chapelle Gospels are degraded into decorative garrulity, and there is so little weight and structure under the draperies that they might be covering mere inanimate cushions.\\"Dodwell, 144 A run of four pages preceding Matthew These come after the two textile pages and the four pages of narrative images. File:Codex aureus Epternacensis folio 20 verso.jpgEvangelist portrait (Matthew), folio 20 verso File:Codex aureus Epternacensis folio 21 recto.jpgAngel holding \\"tablet\\", folio 21 recto, with text \\"Ye men, believe the word of the man Matthew, so that He of Whom he speaks, the Man Jesus, may reward ye\\".Metz, 70 File:Codex aureus Epternacensis folio 22 verso.jpg\\"Incipit\\" page *\\"Here begins the Gospel of Matthew\\", folio 21 verso File:Codex aureus Epternacensis folio 22 recto.jpgInitial page \\"Liber\\", the first word of the Vulgate text Cover The front cover The front cover of the manuscript is an Ottonian treasure binding which dates from about 50 years before the manuscript; the metalwork is attributed to the Trier workshop set up by Egbert, Archbishop of Trier. It centres on an ivory plaque showing the Crucifixion of Jesus, which is stylistically different from the other elements, and whose origin has been the subject of much discussion.Metz, 60 sees it as contemporary with the rest of the cover, Lasko, 98 as from 1053-56 (like the text in his view); Beckwith, 133-136 attributes it and other pieces to a workshop active \\"possibly at Tier in the last twenty years of the tenth century\\". The plaque has traces of blue paint on the cross and green paint highlighting some parts of the composition.Metz, 60 Surrounding the ivory plaque are panels, now rather battered, with figures in repouss√© gold relief, and in a very different style than the plaque. These panels are set in a framework whose larger elements are made up of alternating units of gold filigree set with gems, and cloisonn√© enamel with stylized plant decorative motifs. Thinner gold bands set with small pearls run along the diagonal axes, further separating the relief images into compartments, and creating an \\"X\\" that may stand for \\"Christ\\"; an \\"X\\" in ash was traced on the floor of a new church in the ritual of its consecration. The general arrangement of the cover may be compared to others of the period - for example, that of the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram of about 870, which probably forms part of the same tradition descending from the school of Reims in Carolingian art, as shown by the style of the relief figures.Ferber, 14 As in other treasure bindings, the gems do not merely create an impression of richness. They offer a foretaste of the bejeweled nature of the Celestial city, and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various \\"scientific\\", medical, and magical respects, as set out in the popular lapidary books.Metz, 26-30 Many of the original gems and pearls are now lost, but there are replacements in paste or mother of pearl. The reliefs show the Four Evangelists with their symbols and background foliage in the compartments at top and bottom, and two figures each in four compartments on the sides. The lowest figures on each side are (left) the young Emperor Otto III with (right) his regent and mother Theophanu (d. 991). At the top of the sides stand the Virgin Mary (left) opposite Saint Peter; these two were the patron saints of Echternach Abbey. The remaining four figures are saints: Echternach's founder Willibrord; Saints Boniface and Ludger, also early missionaries in Germany; and Benedict, founder of the monastery's order.Lasko, 98; Beckwith, 133; Metz, 59, who astonishingly omits to mention the Evangelists The figures are produced in an elegant, elongated style which contrasts strongly with the forceful and slightly squat figures of the ivory.Ferber, 14; Beckwith, 133-136 It is sometimes thought that the cover was made for the Trier manuscript in Paris known as the Sainte- Chapelle Gospels, illustrated by the Gregory Master, whose style influenced some of the later miniatures in the text now bound with the cover.BnF MS lat. 8851: Dodwell, 144; Beckwith, 133 Despite all the figures shown on the cover having a connection with Echternach, some authors suggest that the original manuscript was not made for that monastery at all; and that Archbishop Egbert presented it to Otto III and Theophanu, perhaps as a peace offering after he initially supported Henry the Quarrelsome as successor to Otto II, rather than his young son Otto III, in 983-984. At a later point the imperial family would then have passed the manuscript on to Echternach.Head, 76 A highly plausible suggestion howeverWestermann-Angerhausen, 217-218 has been made by Gunther Wolf, namely that the front cover was commissioned really for Echternach (to Archbishop Egbert, while meeting him at Christmas 988 in Cologne) by Empress Theophanu (and Otto III) out of religious gratitude for her recovering of the illness that struck her at the end of the summer of 988 at Lake Constance; her adoration for Saint Willibrord, as shown by former gifts to Echternach, in that case was an additional motive in the perspective of the 250th anniversary of his death (November 7, 739 AD).Wolf, 147-151 History Detail of the cover, with Theophanu in the lower right It is thought that this is the manuscript shown to Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor when he visited Echternach with his mother Gisela of Swabia (d. 1043), which so impressed him that he commissioned similar works from the abbey, notably the Golden Gospels of Henry III, which he presented in 1046 to Speyer Cathedral, the burial-place of his dynasty.Beckwith, 122-123 The manuscript was at the Abbey of Echternach in today's Luxembourg until the French Revolutionary wars. During the War of the First Coalition, Luxembourg was conquered and annexed by Revolutionary France, becoming part of the d√©partement of the For√™tsLiterally 'woods', in reference to the Ardennes. in 1795. The monastery was seized and sold, and most of the monks fled, carrying the manuscript and other portable treasures with them. It was one of a group of three manuscripts and five incunabula sold to Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg in 1801.Metz, 11 It remained in the collection of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which was turned over to a foundation after World War I, until after World War II. It was decided to sell it but the then duke was keen to keep it in Germany, and the German Federal government and the provinces or L√§nder contributed the funds jointly, with Bavaria in the lead, as its new home was to be the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, where it remains.Metz, 11-12 NotesReferences *Beckwith, John, Early Christian and Byzantine Art, Penguin History of Art (now Yale), 2nd edn. 1979, *Dodwell, C.R.; The Pictorial arts of the West, 800‚Äì1200, 1993, Yale UP, *Ferber, Stanley, \\"Aspects of the Development of Ottonian Respousse Gold Work\\", Gesta, Vol. 1/2, (1964), pp. 14‚Äì19, JSTOR *Head, Thomas. \\"Art and Artifice in Ottonian Trier.\\" Gesta, Vol. 36, No. 1.

Gideon Mer (, born 1894 in Panevƒó≈æys, died 22 March 1961 in Rosh Pinna) was an Israeli scientist whose work was mostly concerned with the eradication of malaria. He was the father of Arna Mer-Khamis and the grandfather of Juliano Mer-Khamis. Biography This biography largely reproduces the text of the obituary published at his death by the British Medical Journal. Gideon Mer was born in Lithuania, then part of Imperial Russia. He studied medicine in France.Obituary in the British Medical Journal 1961 (29 July 1961), Volume 2, Issue 5247, page 315, doi: 10.1136/bmj.2.5247.315-b He immigrated to Palestine in 1914. During World War I he was a medical officer in the Jewish Legion, a unit of the British Army, and served at Gallipoli, in Palestine, Syria, and Turkey. After the war he returned to Rosh Pinna, a Jewish settlement in the north of Palestine, and his laboratory there eventually became a research station for the study of the bionomics of mosquitoes and methods of malaria control. With the opening of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem he joined the Department of Preventive Medicine. In 1927 Israel Jacob Kligler founded the \\"Malaria Research Station\\" of the Hebrew University in Rosh Pina, where pioneering field work was carried out relating to the eradication of malaria. Two years later he appointed Dr. Gideon Mer as the station manager and together they published a series of articles on malaria. During the Second World War Mer served in the British Forces with the rank of colonel and was malaria adviser to Middle East Command. After the war he joined the staff of the new school of medicine and became chief malaria adviser to the Ministry of Health in Israel, of which he was acting director in 1956 and 1957. As malaria was brought under control Professor Mer investigated the control of other insects, particularly the horse-fly, and the Rosh Pinna research station undertook the testing of insecticides and the training of scientists.

Then at the age of 20, Emperado undertook serious study of Kenpo at the Catholic youth organization in Honolulu. These classes were taught by William K.S. Chow. Emperado trained daily with Chow and soon attained his first black belt. He would later be promoted to fifth-degree black belt by Chow. Later life In 1947, Adriano Emperado (Kosho Shorei-ryu Kenpo and Escrima), Peter Young Yil Choo (Tang Soo Do, Shotokan Karate and Boxing), Joseph Holck (Sekeino-ryu Judo), Frank F. Ordonez (Danzan-ryu Jujutsu), and George \\"Clarence\\" Chuen Yoke Chang (Chu'an Fa Kung-Fu), came together and called themselves the Black Belt Society. They began training together and exploring the weaknesses and developing the strengths of each martial art to create a fighting style that did not suit the ancient warrior but the American citizen to help him or her in their fight against the common criminal. Schools After the other four founders were drafted off into the Korean War, they left Emperado to start the first Kajukenbo school at the Palama Settlement Gym in 1950. Many of the students who trained there were poor, so at the Palama school students could train for $2.00 a month. The workouts that took place there are legendary for their brutality. Kajukenbo train strong to remain strong. Emperado has been quoted as saying that a workout was not over until there was blood on the floor. When a reporter went on to ask him about this he went on to say that \\"you have to experience pain before you can give it. You have to know what your technique can do. We lost a lot of students in those days, but we also got a lot from other schools, including black belts. These students would look at what we were doing and realize that we had a no nonsense effective system.\\" In order to be invincible on the streets they had reasonable, but very serious, full contact training. Emperado died on April 4, 2009.

This was the first remake of Annie. It was directed by Rob Marshall, written by Irene Mecchi, and produced by Walt Disney Television, Columbia TriStar Television, Storyline Entertainment, and Chris Montan Productions. Annie marks the first film collaboration between The Walt Disney Company and Columbia Pictures since Columbia distributed some of Disney's short animated Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphony films from 1930 to 1932. It stars Kathy Bates, Alan Cumming, Audra McDonald, Kristin Chenoweth, Victor Garber, Andrea McArdle (who originated the role of Annie in the musical), and introduces Alicia Morton as Annie and Lalaine as Kate. Annie premiered on ABC November 7, 1999. The program proved to be popular during its initial airing, with an estimated 26.3 million viewers, making it the second-most watched Disney movie ever to air on ABC behind Cinderella (1997). This version earned two Emmy Awards and a George Foster Peabody Award. Plot In 1933, during the Great Depression, 11-year- old orphan Annie Bennett was left on her own at an all girls orphanage when she was an infant. The only two things that she received from her family was half a heart-shaped locket with a key hole, and a note from her parents saying that they would come back for her. The orphanage is run by the tyrannical Miss Hannigan, who starves the orphans, forces them to do slave labor, and even makes them suffer. In the middle of the night, after getting tired of waiting for her parents, Annie tries to escape to find them, but is caught by Miss Hannigan in the process. When Miss Hannigan gets distracted, Annie hides in the dirty laundry bin and she finally succeeds in running away. While out on her own, Annie befriends a dog, whom she names Sandy. But a policeman catches her and returns her back to the orphanage. When billionaire Oliver \\"Daddy\\" Warbucks decides to take in an orphan for Christmas, his secretary Grace Farrell chooses Annie. Annie and Sandy are brought to his wealthy estate and bathe in a grand life. Although at first uncomfortable with Annie, Daddy Warbucks is soon charmed by her. He desperately wants to adopt Annie, but Annie still wants to find her real parents, so he announces on the radio a $50,000 reward for anybody who can prove they are her biological parents. The orphans accidentally tell Miss Hannigan, and her younger con artist brother Rooster, and his dimwitted girlfriend Lily St. Regis cook up a scheme to get the reward by posing as Ralph and Shirley Mudge (Annie's \\"so called\\" parents). Lily is left with the orphans after Miss Hannigan and Rooster leave, but Lily accidentally tells the secret. The orphans make her tell them what is going on, and she realizes that Rooster could leave her hanging as he has done before in the past. She and the orphans come to Warbucks' mansion where Lily demands her part in the cut while the orphans reveal the scheme. While fleeing from the orphans, Miss Hannigan and Rooster are intercepted upon the arrival of President Franklin D. Roosevelt along with his Secret Service. The President reads the papers that identifies Miss Hannigan, Rooster, and Lily. This enrages Miss Hannigan, who soon curses Annie for ruining her minions' chance to bring her back to her so she can punish her for escaping, only to be carted off to a psychiatric hospital for child abuse, followed by Rooster and Lily who are arrested and taken to jail. President Roosevelt then presents the evidence to Annie that her real parents are actually David and Margaret Bennett, but sadly they both had died several years earlier which explains why they never returned for her. Although Annie is saddened that her real parents are dead, she is cheered up when Daddy Warbucks officially adopts her. The President ensures a happy ending for all as he promises that each of the orphans will be adopted by a stable and happy family. Daddy Warbucks and Grace become engaged, and Annie lives happily with her new parents and Sandy.

Although the stage musical Annie had already been adapted as a film in 1982, the film was considered to be a critical and commercial failure. Zadan and Meron saw remaking the musical as an opportunity to rectify the previous adaptation's errors. They enlisted Cinderella's choreographer Rob Marshall to direct and making the orphans ethnically diverse. McDonald recalled in a 2017 interview that there was a reshoot of the final scene that showed her character, a black woman, not engaging with Daddy Warbucks; she suggested the reason for the reshoots was Disney and ABC were \\"a little uncomfortable\\" having a black woman engage with the white man. However, the other members of the cast and crew were not happy about having to do the reshoot, and Garber intentionally performed the scene badly so that it couldn't make it into the final cut. The dancers' costumes and the stage set of the Broadway section of \\"N.Y.C.\\" are taken directly from the \\"Broadway Melody\\" ballet in Singin' in the Rain. Release Annie premiered during The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC November 7, 1999. After its premiere on ABC, Annie has aired on cable channels such as ABC Family, Starz, and the Hallmark Channel. Home media Annie was released on VHS December 14, 1999, and DVD January 24, 2000, by Buena Vista Home Entertainment. This film is not yet been released on Blu-ray via Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.

It is also naturalised in Thailand, in the Indonesian islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and in the Solomon Islands. The tree is a major source of sago starch.  Description  True sago palm is a suckering (multiple-stemmed) palm, each stem only flowering once (hapaxanthic) with a large upright terminal inflorescence. A stem grows 7‚Äì25 m tall before it ends in an inflorescence. Before flowering, a stem bears about 20 pinnate leaves up to 10 m long. Each leaf has about 150‚Äì180 leaflets up to 175 cm long. The inflorescence, 3‚Äì7.5 m tall and wide, consists of the continuation of the stem and 15‚Äì30 upwardly-curving (first-order) branches spirally arranged on it. Each first-order branch has 15‚Äì25 rigid, distichously arranged second-order branches; each second-order branch has 10‚Äì12 rigid, distichously arranged third-order branches. Flower pairs are spirally arranged on the third-order branches, each pair consisting of one male and one hermaphrodite flower. The fruit is drupe-like, about 5 cm in diameter, covered in scales which turn from bright green to straw-coloured upon ripening.Schuiling, D.L. (2009) Growth and development of true sago palm (Metroxylon sagu Rottb√∏ll) with special reference to accumulation of starch in the trunk: a study on morphology, genetic variation and ecophysiology, and their implications for cultivation. (PhD thesis Wageningen University).  Historical Records  Sago was noted by the Chinese historian Zhao Rukuo (1170‚Äì1231) during the Song Dynasty. In his Zhu Fan Zhi (1225), a collection of descriptions of foreign countries, he writes that the kingdom of Boni \\"...produces no wheat, but hemp and rice, and they use sha-hu (sago) for grain\\".  Cultivation and uses  The tree is of commercial importance as the main source of sago, a starch obtained from the trunk by washing the starch kernels out of the pulverized pith with water. This starch is used in cooking for puddings, noodles, breads, and as a thickener. In the Sepik River region of New Guinea, pancakes made from sago are a staple food, often served with fresh fish. Its leaflets are also used as thatching which can remain intact for up to five years.Palm and Cycad Societies of Australia. Palms: Metroxylon sagu. Retrieved 28 February 2012 The dried petioles (called gaba-gaba in Indonesian) are used to make walls and ceilings; they are very light, and therefore also used in the construction of rafts. The sago palm reproduces by fruiting. Each stem (trunk) in a sago palm clump flowers and fruits at the end of its life, but the sago palm as an individual organism lives on through its suckers (shoots that are continuously branching off a stem at or below ground level). To harvest the starch in the stem, it is felled shortly before or early during this final flowering stage when starch content is highest. Sago palm is propagated by man by collecting (cutting) and replanting young suckers rather than by seed. Recent research indicates that the sago palm was an important food source for the ancient people of coastal China, in the period prior to the cultivation of rice.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130508172138.htm  References  External links  * * sagu Category:Crops originating from Asia Category:Non-timber forest products Category:Trees of Malesia Category:Trees of Papuasia Category:Trees of Thailand Category:Plants described in 1783 ","title":"Metroxylon sagu"},{"id":"13407631","text":"Grim Reapers MC is an independent US-based motorcycle club founded during 1965 in Louisville, KentuckyUnderstanding Organized Crime, by Stephen L. Mallory, Jones & Bartlett, 2007, p. 161 The club The Grim Reapers is a Harley- Davidson-only motorcycle club. The club was founded as a three-piece patch in Louisville, Kentucky. In the United States, such motorcycle clubs are considered \\"outlaw\\" as they are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) and do not adhere to the AMA's rules. Instead the Grim Reapers have their own set of bylaws from which the values of the outlaw biker cultureInternational Journal of Motorcycle Studies Club name and patches The Grim Reapers MC takes its name and iconography from the traditional and symbolic personification of death, the Grim Reaper. The club's name is emblazoned on the top rocker of the three-piece patch. The center patch features the Grim Reaper in red holding his scythe, and is referred to as \\"the Ghost.\\" The territory from which the chapter operates appears on the bottom rocker. An \\"MC\\" patch appears to the right of the Ghost, when facing the cut. The cut also features a triangular front patch depicting a scythe over the club's initials, with one letter of the MC's motto, \\"FTW,\\" in each corner of the triangle. History The Grim Reapers MC was founded in 1965 in Louisville, Kentucky. The Kickapoo Creek Rock Festival was held on Memorial Day Weekend in 1970 near Heyworth, Illinois. The Grim Reapers provided the festival security. Approximately 60,000 people attended the festival.Luciano: A Woodstock or laughingstock? - News - Journal Star - Peoria, IL Operation Iron Horse Operation Iron Horse was a four-year state and federal RICO act investigation and prosecution of motorcycle clubs in the Midwest. Eighteen Grim Reapers, including the club's national president, were indicted for selling drugs and dealing in stolen motorcycles. The Grim Reapers had purchased 120 kilograms - more than 200 pounds - of cocaine worth about $3 million total from 1988 to 1998. Chapters According to the Grim Reapers Motorcycle Club website, the club currently has chapters in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, and Illinois. At one point the MC had chapters from North Dakota to Florida but has been knocked down to its current size after Operation Iron Horse. In Iowa, the Grim Reapers were the first Motorcycle Club established in that state. Since then, many clubs now have chapters in Iowa. Other clubs The Grim Reapers name is also used by other clubs, e.g. Canada and the United Kingdom, and was formerly used by motorcycle clubs in New Zealand, Australia and California.

It is designed to be portable and can be run on a variety of platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix-like. Survex is very powerful cave survey software, and is actively developing into a complete cave visualization package. Centreline data is entered using plain text files, which are processed by 'Cavern'. The text files contain a hierarchy of cave surveys, each of which consists of a list of survey legs, which join survey stations. This program calculates the real world coordinates of survey stations, taking into account loop closure errors using least-squares minimization. This processed data can then be visualised using a GUI front end called Aven. Survex has no arbitrary limits, and so is particularly good for large complicated cave systems, or areas where you need to see the relationships between multiple cave systems. Survex was started in 1990 by Olly Betts and Wookey, and more recently Mark Shinwell has developed 'Aven'. Like most cave surveying software, the motivation for its creation arose from a particular surveying project - Cambridge University Caving Club's explorations in Austria. Survex is currently being used in many large scale survey projects, across the world, for example: UK - Ease Gill Caverns Ogof Draenen, Spain - Picos de Europa, China, Austria - Dachstein, Totes Gerbirge, Indonesia, Mulu Software That Uses Survex CaveWhere uses cavern, a program in the Survex package, for loop closure and positioning survey stations to geographical coordinates.

The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964. It was located along the western shore of the V√•gsfjorden in what is now Harstad Municipality. Trondenes included the majority of the island of Gryt√∏ya and part of the eastern coast of the island of Hinn√∏ya as well as some smaller islands. Located just north of the town of Harstad, the village of Trondenes was the administrative centre of the municipality. That village is also the site of the historic Trondenes Church, the northernmost medieval stone church in Norway. The Trondenes Historical Center was built in 1997 near the church to teach about the history of the area. Trondenes Fort is also located on the Trondenes peninsula. History The parish of Trondenes was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The village of Harstad (population: 1,246) was declared a ladested and was therefore separated from Trondenes on 1 January 1904 to become a separate municipality. This left Trondenes with 7,775 inhabitants. On 1 January 1912, part of southern Trondenes (population: 291) was transferred to the neighboring municipality of Evenes (in Nordland county). On 1 July 1926, the municipality of Trondenes was divided into three separate municipalities. The areas east of the Tjeldsundet strait and east of the V√•gsfjorden (population: 2,443) became the municipality of Sk√•nland and the areas on the west side of the Tjeldsundet and V√•gsfjorden were split two ways. The southern part (population: 4,224) became the municipality of Sandtorg and the northern part (population: 3,429) remained as the municipality of Trondenes. On 25 October 1956, a small border adjustment was made between Trondenes and the neighboring Kv√¶fjord Municipality. This resulted in 32 inhabitants becoming residents of Trondenes. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Trondenes municipality (population: 6,567), Sandtorg municipality (population: 7,512), the town of Harstad (population: 3,808) were merged to form a new, larger Harstad Municipality. Name The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old Trondenes farm (Old Norse: √ûr√≥ndarnes), since the first Trondenes Church was built there. The first element is the genitive of √ær√≥ndr which means \\"hog\\" and the last element is nes which means \\"headland\\". The shape of the headland was probably compared with the snout of a hog. Government=Municipal council The municipal council of Trondenes was made up of 29 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the council was as follows: Media gallery Trondenes.jpg 10 Harstad Trondenes Church.jpg Trondenes Historical Center.jpg Harstad Trondenes.jpg Trondenes, Kasgjord, Troms - Riksantikvaren-T432 01 0481.jpg Trondenes - no-nb digifoto 20160511 00163 NB MIT FNR 09399.jpg Kasfjord fra Nupen.JPG Harstad, Norway - panoramio (4).jpg Gryt√∏ya Alvestad Troms Norway.jpg See also *List of former municipalities of Norway ReferencesExternal links * * German Gun Battery on the peninsula Trondenes Category:Harstad Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:1838 establishments in Norway Category:1964 disestablishments in Norway ","title":"Trondenes"},{"id":"13407737","text":"Map of countries that maintain diplomatic missions in the People's Republic of China This is a list of diplomatic missions in the People's Republic of China, excluding Hong Kong and Macau.

Including such favourites as Catbells and Grisedale Pike, they occupy an oval area beneath the Buttermere and Borrowdale valley systems. The North Western Fells are characterised by soaring east-west ridges and an absence of mountain tarns. Partition of the Lakeland Fells The Lake District is a National Park in the north west of the country which, in addition to its lakes, contains a complex range of hills. These are known locally as fells and range from low hills to the highest ground in England. Hundreds of tops exist and many writers have attempted to draw up definitive lists. In doing so the compilers frequently divide the range into smaller areas to aid their description. The most influential of all such authors was Alfred Wainwright whose Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells series has sold in excess of 2 million copies,: The Wainwright Society - The Alfred Wainwright Centenary 2007 being in print continuously since the first volume was published in 1952. Wainwright divided the fells into seven geographical areas, each surrounded by valleys and low passes. While any such division must be arbitrary ‚Äì and later writers have deviated to a greater or lesser extent from this blueprintBirkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994) Richards, Mark: Lakeland Fellranger series: Collins (2002)ff: Mid-Western Fells ‚Äì Wainwright's sevenfold division remains the best known partitioning of the fells into 'sub ranges', each with its own characteristics. The North Western Fells are one of these divisions, covered by volume 6 of Wainwright's work.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6: Boundaries Grisedale Pike from Barrow The North Western Fells form a self-contained unit, its borders being well defined. The only link with other high ground is at the summit of Honister Pass in the extreme south. Across the depression are Fleetwith Pike and the Western Fells. The streams falling east and west from Honister turn gradually northward and flow along roughly parallel courses for around 12 miles. On the west is the River Cocker and its headwaters, passing through the lakes of Buttermere and Crummock Water. The eastern boundary is formed by the Derwent system, including Derwent Water and Bassenthwaite Lake. The Derwent ultimately turns westward and is joined by the Cocker at the town of Cockermouth, completing the circuit. Topography Catbells across Derwent Water Unusually for areas of high fell, the North Western Fells are traversed by two roads. Both cross east to west, connecting the bordering valleys. Newlands Pass runs from Braithwaite village to Buttermere while Whinlatter Pass takes a more northerly route from Braithwaite to High Lorton. These passes divide the North Western Fells into three sectors. The most southerly sector consists of a ridge running broadly north east to south west. Beginning with the family favourite of Catbells, the high ground continues over Maiden Moor, High Spy, Dale Head, Hindscarth and Robinson. An outlier of High Spy in the 'Jaws of Borrowdale', Castle Crag is listed as a separate fell by Wainwright. The central area is based around two parallel east-west ridges. The southerly line begins above Derwent Water with the knobbly outline of Causey Pike and then marches west over Scar Crags, Sail, Eel Crag, Wandope and finally Grasmoor. This is the highest of the North Western Fells at 2,795 ft, standing above a dramatic fall to Crummock Water. Outliers to the south of this ridge are Ard Crags, Knott Rigg, Whiteless Pike and Rannerdale Knotts, while Barrow and Outerside stand to the north. The parallel northern ridge includes Grisedale Pike, visible as a fine triangular pyramid from Keswick, Hopegill Head and Whiteside. The fells to the north of Whinlatter are generally lower and less rugged. They include Whinlatter, Graystones, Broom Fell, Lord's Seat, Barf (with its famous 'Bishop'), Sale Fell and Ling Fell. Access for walkers Causey Pike from Derwentwater The North Western Fells are entirely surrounded by roads, and additionally traversed by two more. Keswick and Buttermere provide good bases to the north and west while the summits of Honister, Newlands and Whinlatter passes all provide parking. The most popular climb in the area is Cat Bells via Hause End, a walk which can be made from Keswick via the Derwentwater launches.

He was the fourth (but second surviving) son of John George I, Elector of Saxony, and his second wife, Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia. Early life On 23 January 1628, at the age of 13, August was appointed administrator of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg by its Chapter to replace the current holder of that title, Christian Wilhelm of Brandenburg. By that time, August had already served three years as coadjutor. Nevertheless, he could not assume his post: on 20 May 1631, after seven months of siege and plundering during the Sack of Magdeburg, the city was taken by the Imperial troops; the Catholic competitor for the diocese, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, assumed the title of archbishop and administrator of Magdeburg. The Peace of Prague (1635) confirmed his rule over the city, but three years later, Swedish troops expelled the Habsburg army and restored August as administrator as of 19 October 1638. August finally took full control of Magdeburg on 31 December 1642 after a neutrality treaty was concluded with the Swedish general Lennart Torstenson. He was then able to begin the reconstruction of the city. In 1643 August was accepted into the Fruitbearing Society at the behest of Louis I, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then. Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels In his will of 20 July 1652, Elector John George I ordered a division of the Albertine territories that was carried out on 22 April 1657 in Dresden. August inherited the towns of Wei√üenfels and Querfurt and became their first duke. August also increased his incomes by taking over the administration of the County of Barby during the minority of Count August Ludwig. On 17 October 1659, however, the young count died shortly before attaining his majority. With him, the line of Barby became extinct. A dispute over his lands was resolved in favor of August seven years later (1666). In his will, the duke left Barby to his son Heinrich. On 25 July 1660, August laid the first stone for his official residence, Schloss Neu-Augustusburg in Weissenfels. This castle was built in the same place as the old one, which had been devastated by Swedish troops. The duke died before the castle was finished. On 15 July 1667, the sons of the late Duke Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar offered August the presidency of the Fruitbearing Society. He accepted the office with its responsibility for fostering the work of artists and scientists. His activities as a patron left considerable debts for his descendants to deal with. Marriages and issue In Schwerin on 23 November 1647 August married Anna Maria of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. They had twelve children: #Magdalene Sibylle (b. Halle, 2 September 1648 - d.

She was a daughter of Kƒôstutis, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Birutƒó. Life Very little reliable information is known about her life. Probably between 1371/73The date of her marriage is confused in many sources. Jan D≈Çugosz in one instance claims that she was married in 1388 together with her cousin Alexandra of Lithuania, daughter of Algirdas. In another instance the historian claims that she was already married in 1382. Danutƒó married Janusz I of Warsaw; two facts that supported this date are: ‚Äîin 1371, Pope Gregory XI sent a letter to Siemowit III of Masovia, father of Janusz I, urging him not to allow his subordinates to help pagan Lithuanians. If the marriage took place by that time, the pope would have certainly condemned the Christian duke for the alliance with the pagans; and ‚Äîin 1379 Kƒôstutis, while negotiating with the Teutonic Knights, called G√ºnter von Hohenstein, komtur of Ostr√≥da, godfather of Danutƒó. It means that by that time she was already baptized and married, although is probably that she was already baptized before her wedding. The marriage between Danutƒó and Janusz I was notorious as the longest among the members of the Piast dynasty. In occasion of her wedding, Danutƒó received from Janusz I as a dowry the towns of Drohiczyn, Mielnik, and Brze≈õƒá with their surrounding villages. She bore her husband four children, all of whom predeceased them both: * Daughter (Olga?) (1373/76 - ca. 8 December 1401), who married firstly in 1388 to Voivode Petru I of Moldavia and secondly with the Moldavian magnate Wilczƒô.Historian Ilona Czama≈Ñska believes that Petru I's wife was a member of the Gediminid dynasty, and placed the marriage between 1382-1385. See also J. Nikodem: Jadwiga kr√≥l Polski, Wroc≈Çaw 2009, p. 245. * Janusz the Younger (1376/81 - ca. 18 October 1422), who married Katharina of Melsztyn, daughter of Spytek. * Boles≈Çaw (1385/86 - ca. 4 May 1424), married Anna Feodorovna, granddaughter of Algirdas. * Konrad (ca. 1400 - 9 December 1412/13). In 1382, after escaping from Kreva, Vytautas the Great first asked his sister Danutƒó and his brother-in-law Janusz for help in the Lithuanian Civil War against his cousin Jogaila. However, he did not receive any assistance and had to turn to the Teutonic Knights. In older historiography was believed that Danutƒó survived her husband on the basis of records from the Calendar of P≈Çock, who dated her death on 25 May 1448. Currently, it's believed that this was a mistake with the death date of her daughter-in-law Anna Feodorovna, who died in 1458.J. Grabowski: Dynastia Piast√≥w mazowieckich, Krak√≥w 2012, pp. 446‚Äì448. Danutƒó died between 17 October 1422 and 20 December 1425, probably on 26 November 1424.Danutƒó appears for the last time mentioned in a charter dated 17 October 1422. On 20 December 1425, when Janusz I asked Pope Martin V to allow him to choose a confessor, he didn't mention his wife, which probably was already dead. The information who supposedly mentioned her alive in 1440 is based on the reports of the Bychowiec chronicle. An entry in the obituary of the Czersk monastery dated 26 November who mentioned certain Anna ducissa probably refers to Danutƒó. See J. Grabowski: Dynastia Piast√≥w mazowieckich, Krak√≥w 2012, pp. 448‚Äì450. She was probably buried at St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw.The information who reports that Danutƒó was buried in the Dominican monastery of Warka was doubtful. See J.

Vasily Petrov was born in the town of Oboyan (of the Belgorod Province, currently Kursk Oblast of Russia) in the family of a priest. He studied at a public school in Kharkov, and then at the St. Petersburg Teacher's College. In 1788, he gained a position as mathematics and physics teacher at Kolyvansko- Voskresenskoe College of Mining, in the town of Barnaul. In 1791, he was transferred to Saint Petersburg to teach mathematics and Russian at the military Engineering College, in the Izmailovsky regiment. In 1793, Petrov was invited to teach mathematics and physics at the St. Petersburg Medical and Surgery School, at the military hospital. In 1795, he was promoted to the rank of 'Extraordinary Professor'. During the next few years, he built up a comprehensive physics laboratory. His first published book, \\"A collection of new physical-chemical experiments and observations\\" (), was published in 1801. The bulk of this work was dedicated to the description of experiments related to combustion, as evidence against the then-popular phlogiston theory. The chapters, describing luminosity of phosphors of mineral and organic origins have elicited vivid interest in scientific circles. Petrov was able to detect the maximum temperature when phosphorus ceases to glow in open (atmospheric) air, by his numerous experiments with fluorite he was able to prove it glows due to a different reason than phosphorus. An electric arc. In 1802, Petrov discovered the electric arc effect, thanks to his building the world's largest and most powerful Voltaic pile at the time, which consisted of around 4,200 copper and zinc discs. In \\"News of Galvanic-Voltaic Experiments\\", 1803 (), Petrov described experiments performed using the voltaic pile, detailing the stable arc discharge and the indication of its possible use in artificial lighting, melting metals for smelting and welding, obtaining pure metallic oxides, and reduction of metals from oxides mixed with powdered carbon and oils.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830903379.html Petrov was forgotten soon after his death and his works fell into oblivion.S.

A copy of \\"News of Galvanic-Voltaic Experiments\\" was discovered by chance in a library in the town of Vilna near the end of the 19th century. The book was the first time in world literature that a series of important physical phenomena related to electricity were described in detail. It was not until the late 1880s that technology based on Petrov's experiments was developed with the goal of industrial usage.

A progressive who once had been a member of the Communist Party USA, Levin was an unreconstructed radical throughout his academic career. In addition to teaching a popular core course on political science, Levin specialized in teaching Marxist political theory to both undergraduate and graduate students. Long before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Levin eventually came to the conclusion that Marxist theory was not a science, let alone a viable system of economics, but was a powerful propaganda tool to mobilize the masses against capital. Class consciousness would be obtained ultimately when the masses finally revolted against the oligarchy. Early influences The progeny of a wealthy business family, Murray Levin took his bachelor's degree at Harvard College, the family's undergraduate alma mater, after completing his military service with the United States Navy, serving as a military attach√©' to a vice admiral during World War II. (Levin remained an excellent tennis player until late in life, and his primary duty was playing tennis with the admiral. At Harvard, he was vastly influenced by the ideas of professor Louis Hartz. Hartz believed that the lack of feudalism in America had created a situation in which only one creed, liberalism (in the classic sense), could be tolerated. Since there was no tolerance for collectivist-oriented systems like socialism, if the U.S. economic system were ever again to suffer a catastrophic failure such as that of the Great Depression, the U.S. might be imperiled by the lack of a viable, legitimate alternative such as socialism. Hartz's theories, as articulated in his 1955 book The Liberal Tradition in America, served the basis for Levin's own ideas. Levin took his master's and Ph.D. degrees at Columbia University. The \\"B.U. Five\\" At Boston University, Levin was a close associate of Howard Zinn, whose office was located next to his in the political science department building. Both Levin, Zinn and fellow poli-sci faculty member Frances Fox Piven became part of the \\"B.U. Five\\" when they refused to cross union picket lines during a 1979 strike by clerical and custodial workers at the university and were targeted for retaliation by B.U. President John Silber. Silber had earlier rejected a labor contract already negotiated by the American Association of University Professors and the University, which forced the professors out on strike in the fall semester of 1979. The clerks and custodians soon followed. When the university settled with the AAUP, the vast majority of professors went back to work teaching, but Levin, Zinn, Piven and two others refused to cross the other unions' picket lines. Levin and Zinn were two of the harshest critics of Silber's top-down \\"industrial\\" paradigm of university administration, in which Silber equated an institution of higher learning to a car factory. For their opposition, Silber had \\"merit\\" pay increases continually denied them. (Piven eventually left B.U. for a position at City University of New York.) Talk radio and the American Dream With a keen eye for the alienated voter, Levin was one of the first political scientists to notice the role talk radio was playing in American politics. Talk radio shows were articulating the rage of what President Richard M. Nixon called \\"The Silent Majority\\" and others eventually described as \\"Joe Six-Pack\\" and \\"Reagan Democrats\\": the alienated working class that once made up the New Deal-Fair Deal-New Frontier-Great Society coalition. Levin realized that by the late 1970s and early 1980s, this once reliable base of support for the Democratic Party were ripe pickings for reactionaries who could articulate their rage. Edward M. Kennedy Levin said that Edward Kennedy became a United States Senator at the age of 30 \\"with one year of frantic campaigning and 30 years of experience as a Kennedy\\". He was a topic of several of Levin's books. As a progressive, Levin could be scathing about Kennedy, but he did concede in 1980 that he was the most effective person in the pre-1980 Presidential election Senate. (The Democrats lost their majority in the Senate for the first time since the 1950s.) However, he felt that this situation was an indictment of American democracy rather than an endorsement of Kennedy. Murray B. Levin Legacy Fund In the Spring of 2006, Boston University announced the formation of the Murray B. Levin Legacy Fund to honor the late professor. Most of the fund, a $250,000 endowment, came from the Lawrence and Lillian Solomon Fund, Inc. Lawrence Solomon, a real estate attorney, was very much influenced by Levin while a B.U. undergrad. B.U. Board of Trustees Chairman Alan Leventhal is matching 50% of the endowment with a grant, and other B.U. professors and alumni are making financial contributions to the fund, which will provide scholarships to students majoring in political science or related disciplines. This is a development welcomed by many alumni of B.U., which has the lowest alumni giving rate of any major American university, and was only possible with the waning of John Silber's power at B.U.

In a sense, being healthy or active about one's health is a precondition for becoming a subject of the study, an effect that can appear under other conditions such as studying particular groups of workers. For example, someone in ill health is unlikely to have a job as manual laborer. As a result, studies of manual laborers are studies of people who are currently healthy enough to engage in manual labor, rather than studies of people who would do manual labor if they were healthy enough.

It is somewhat an extension of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) which just describes the low-energy interactions of pions. In a richer theory one would also like to describe the interactions of baryons with pions. A fully relativistic Lagrangian of nucleons is non-predictive as the quantum corrections, or loop diagrams can count as \\\\mathcal{O}(1) quantities and therefore do not describe higher-order corrections. Because the baryons are much heavier than the pions, HBChPT rests on the use of a nonrelativistic description of baryons compared to that of the pions.

It was in existence from 1658 to 1852. It is located in the present-day municipality of Bindal. History The ancient district of Bindalen belonged to Namdalen. However in 1658, when the county (l√§n) of Trondheim was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde, the status of the border district was ambiguous, with residents paying some taxes to Helgeland, in Nordland, and some to Namdalen. The decision was then made to redraw the county boundary to run down the fjord, assigning the northern part, Nord-Bindalen, to Nordland county, which remained in the Kingdom of Denmark- Norway, while the larger part remained in Trondheim county and became S√∏r- Bindalen and part of the Kingdom of Sweden. The two remained separate after Tr√∏ndelag county was reunited with Norway in 1660. In 1815, a single parish of Bindalen was created from the larger parish of Br√∏nn√∏, despite the secular division of the community. Although the 1838 formannskapsdistrikt law divided the country into municipalities which were supposed to correspond to the church parishes, the parish of Bindalen (which straddled the county border) remained as the two separate municipalities of Nord-Bindalen and S√∏r-Bindalen.

It was intended initially as a monastery for women; then its reputation for great learning grew, and with the afflux of men wishing to follow the monastic life, a parallel male community was established, creating a double monastery. The abbey stood in the Val-de- Marne near Paris (in modern Meaux) until it fell victim to the disestablishment of the Catholic Church in 1792 during the French Revolution and was dismantled.David Coxall, 'Chelles', in Andr√© Vauchez (ed.), Encyclopaedia of the Middle Ages The abbey housed an important scriptorium and held the advantage of powerful royal connections throughout the Carolingian era. History Before its religious designation, the site of the abbey, Cala (Gaulish \\"a collection of pebbles\\"; modern Chelles, Seine-et-Marne) had held a royal Merovingian villa. Queen Clotilde, the wife of Clovis I, had previous built a small chapel there dedicated to Saint George circa 511. King Chilperic I and his wife, Fredegund, frequently resided at Cala; Chilperic was assassinated in 584 while hunting there. The Queen-Saint Balthild, wife of King Clovis II (639-657/658), an Anglo-Saxon aristocrat who had been taken to Gaul as a slave, founded the abbey in 658 on the ruins of the Clothilde's chapel as a monastery for women. She gave the first of two great endowments to its construction, enabling the abbey and a large new Church of the Holy Cross to be built. Though no charters survive, in \\"Life of Saint Balthild\\", there are references to the gifts she made to the abbey. Balthild and the abbesses quickly established an impressive reputation for encouraging learning, which attracted monks to Chelles and resulted in its conversion to a double monastery by the end of the 7th century. Balthild herself retired to Chelles in 664, bringing with her a second endowment, and died there in 680, where she was also buried. Her possessions were treated as relics at Chelles, including a chasuble, a vestment embroidered with a pectoral cross and an image of a beautiful necklace, which is currently displayed in the museum at the site. Her hagiography was written soon after her death, probably by a nun at the abbey. Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc's reconstruction of the 13th-century dormitory at Chelles Balthild is reported to have established the monastery first under the Rule of Saint Columbanus, then later adopted the Rule of Saint Benedict, although recent scholars, including Moyse and Dierkens, have warned against assumptions that the Rule was a firmly entrenched system. According to the New Catholic Encyclopedia, the abbey represented a step in the progress of Celtic Christianity into Burgundy, especially in its admittance of monks.H. Tardif, 'Chelles, convent of' in New Catholic Encyclopedia, 2nd ed. (2003), p.463. In any case, Balthild exerted control by appointing her own choice of abbess, Bertila. After the apparent shift to the Benedictine Rule from that of Columbanus, the abbey was often governed by Carolingian princesses who continued this tradition. Holy women and royalty Chelles was founded during a century in which an unprecedented number of women were entering monasteries. There was a dramatic increase in the number of such institutions providing for these women, particularly in France, Britain and the Low Countries. According to Paul Fouracre, the rate of monastery building is the best-recorded indicator that Christian culture was successfully flowing through the countryside from urban centers as members of the Frankish elite founded monasteries on their lands, greatly influencing their tenants, and occupied leading posts within the Catholic Church. Royal assent remained crucial to ecclesiastical appointments, which meant that the Merovingian monarchs themselves were usually important patrons of the monasteries. Their support of the religious communities was a means of sanctifying and legitimating their royal power. Chelles‚Äô success as an institution of learning and renown was possibly due to its strong royal and aristocratic connections from its inception: from its construction at the behest of Balthild, the appointment of a daughter of the French nobility, Berthild of Chelles, as its first abbess and the powerful influence of Charlemagne‚Äôs sister, Gisela, Abbess of Chelles, who led the monastery from 800-810. Yitzhak Hen supports this, suggesting that the links to royalty encouraged local inhabitants to attend Sunday Mass regularly, if only to catch a glimpse of the king, queen or their representatives. The abbey was effective in utilising the rituals of communion and confession to establish itself as a powerful agent of conversion in the countryside to the extent that it has been described by historians as a ‚Äòtraining ground for missionaries of monasticism‚Äô, and by extension, Christianity itself. Bertila‚Äôs reputation as a pious member of the nobility and, later, the eminence of Gisela, sister of Charlemagne, drew several foreign princesses to join the nuns at Chelles, including Hereswith of Northumbria. The abbey swiftly became one of the most favored monasteries for English royal princesses in Francia to be sent to for their religious instruction, along with other convents in the Paris basin such as at Les Andelys (built in 511 AD, the first convent in France) and F√©camp Abbey (built by Dux Waningus in 658). Its international reputation was further secured by Bertila‚Äôs gifts of relics, books and tutors to help establish monasteries of nuns in Britain, and accepting several young English women into the monastic community. During her abbacy, Gisela worked to broaden the scope of Chelles and effectively shaped the monastery into a political hub where monarchs and aristocrats came to worship. Janet L. Nelson called it the \\"centre of the monarchic cult\\", indicating a unique prominence for the abbey and firm royal connections. Political contacts met there and information was collected from across the kingdom. Abbess Gisela was the one person to send Alcuin the news at Tours of her brother Charlemagne‚Äôs official coronation. Nelson suggests that the abbess, as well as writing to Alcuin in Latin to request a Biblical commentary, was responsible for writing the Annales Mettenses priores, which recorded a visit from the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne himself in 804. The nuns' scriptorium By the 9th century, the nuns of Chelles were renowned as skilled copyists and authors of manuscripts. Many memoria of monarchs and their family members are emerging from their scriptorium, along with the Lives of several saints. Gis√®la was particularly famous for her intelligence and learning, and for demanding several books and biblical commentaries for the monastery‚Äôs library. The nuns owned, or at least had access to, the Annales regni Francorum and Continuationes Fredegarii, which were and both remain significant sources for history-writing. The monastery housed an important scriptorium, involving a consortium of at least nine nuns as scribes. The manuscripts that survive are not illuminated, yet Chelles Abbey is particularly strongly linked with the creation of a unique script style.Jane Stevenson, Women Latin Poets: Language, Gender and Authority, from Antiquity to the Eighteenth Century (Oxford, 2005), p.90. Jane Stevenson believes there were around fourteen nuns in an ‚Äòatelier‚Äô, working under a nun master-scribe, and describes Chelles as one of the most productive scriptoria of the eighth and ninth centuries and therefore a significant nucleus of intellectual activity.Jane Stevenson, 'Hrotsvit in Context: Covents and Culture in Ottonian Germany' in Phyllis R. Brown and Stephen L. Vailes (eds.), A Companion to Hrotsvit of Gandersheim (fl. 960) (2012), pp.35.62, ref. p.60. The seminal work attributing these nuns to the scriptorium at Chelles is written by Bernhard Bischoff. He compared certain texts to other books written in the same minuscule and located them at Chelles between c.785 and 810, at the time when Gis√®la was abbess. The nuns‚Äô surviving texts include parts of the Cologne manuscripts of Augustine‚Äôs Commentary on the Psalms (Dombibliothek 63, 65 and 67), Eusebius‚Äô Ecclesiastical History, a fragment of Isidore of Seville‚Äôs Etymologiae and various other works by the bishop, as well as a copy of the Dialogues of Gregory the Great and a fragment of his Homilia in evangelium. Many of the manuscripts are signed by women, such as Girbalda, Gislidis, Agleberta, Adruhic, Altildis, Eusebia and Vera, all in a similar script. This indicates the existence of a collective, working at Chelles‚Äô scriptorium. Rosamond McKitterick has suggested that the manuscripts‚Äô high quality indicates that the scribes at Chelles were talented and understood the texts they were copying. The fact that so many of these texts were authoritative works of the Catholic Church, written by early theologians, also lends McKitterick to suggest that the scribes were well-educated. Later history For many years almost all the abbesses were the widows, daughters or sisters of emperors and kings, which over time affected monastic discipline adversely. Stephen of Senlis and Louis de Beaumont de la For√™t, Bishops of Paris, tried in vain to reform the abbey in 1134 and 1483, respectively. Not until 1499, under Bishop Jean-Simon de Champigny, was any success achieved in this regard, through a decree of the Parlement of Paris: from 1500 the abbesses were elected every three years, which included the possibility of re- election. However, as early as 1559 the king abolished the election and resumed the appointment of the abbesses himself. In 1790, during the French Revolution, the abbey was dissolved. In 1796 the abbey complex was sold as a national asset and destroyed. The remains of the abbey are today incorporated in the mairie or seat of local government of modern Chelles.

In each of these years, Ralston Purina authorized the sale of common stock \\"to employees ... who shall, without solicitation by the Company ... inquire of any of them as to how to purchase common stock of Ralston Purina Company.\\" A memorandum sent to branch and store managers advised that the \\"only employees to whom this stock will be available will be those who take the initiative and are interested in buying stock at present market prices.\\" Among those who responded to these offers were employees with the duties of artist, bakeshop foreman, chow loading foreman, clerical assistant, copywriter, electrician, and veterinarian. The buyers lived across the U.S. The lowest salary bracket of those purchasing was $2,700 in 1949, $2,435 in 1950 and $3,107 in 1951. The record shows that in 1947, 243 employees bought stock, 20 in 1948, 414 in 1949, 411 in 1950, and the 1951 offer, interrupted by this litigation, produced 165 applications to purchase. No records were kept of those to whom the offers were made; the estimated number in 1951 was 500. Procedural History Ralston Purina conceded that an offering to all of its employees would be a public offering which would require it to have filed a registration statement under Section 5 the Securities Act of 1933. The company claimed that it was exempted from filing because it offered stock only to key employees' in its organization. Ralston Purina argued on trial was that ‚ÄòA key employee ... would include an individual who is eligible for promotion, an individual who especially influences others or who advises others, a person whom the employees look to in some special way, an individual, of course, who carries some special responsibility, who is sympathetic to management and who is ambitious and who the management feels is likely to be promoted to a greater responsibility.‚Äô Issue Whether offering stock to 'key employees' would exempt Ralston Purina from filing a registration statement under Section 4(1) [Now Section 4(a)(2)] of the Securities Act of 1933. Analysis by the court \\"The natural way to interpret the private offering exemption is in light of the statutory purpose. Since exempt transactions are those as to which ‚Äòthere is no practical need for  (the bill's) application,‚Äô the applicability of [Section 4(a)(2)] should turn on whether the particular class of persons affected need the protection of the Act. An offering to those who are shown to be able to fend for themselves is a transaction ‚Äònot involving any public offering.' \\" Ralston Purina, 346 US 119, 125 (1953). The \\"exemption question turns on the knowledge of the offerees .... The focus of inquiry should be on the need of the offerees for the protections afforded by registration.\\" SEC v. Ralston Purina, 346 US 119, 126-127 (1953). Investors need to be \\"Sophisticated\\" investors. If this requirement is met, the company meets the Section 4(a)(2) exemption. In this case, the employees that were offered the stock option were \\"rank-and-file\\" employees. The employees here were not shown to have access to the kind of information which registration would disclose. Therefore, the offering was found to be a \\"Public Offering,\\" which did not allow Ralston Purina to use the registration exemption. Every single offeree must meet the \\"Ralston Purina\\" requirement or the exemption will not apply. Conclusion No. Offerings must be made to individuals who have access to the kind of information that a registration statement would supply in order to be exempt from the filing requirements of Section 5 the Securities Act of 1933.

He is also a director of two renewable energy companies in Europe and the United States. He is the father of author Antonia Logue. Background Logue first came to prominence as a member of the executive of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ‚Äì the only SDLP member of the executive. He stood as a candidate in elections to the new Northern Ireland Assembly in 1973 and was elected for Londonderry, aged 24, the youngest candidate elected that year.Londonderry election results, Ark.ac.uk; accessed 3 May 2012 With John Hume and Ivan Cooper, Hugh Logue was arrested by the British Army during a peaceful demonstration in Londonderry in August 1971. Their conviction was ultimately overturned by the Law Lords (R(Hume) v Londonderry Justices (972,N.I.91) requiring the then British Government to introduce retrospective legislation to render legal previous British Army actions in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland State Papers of 1980 show that together with John Hume and Austin Currie he played a key role in presenting the SDLP'S 'Three Strands' approach to the Thatcher Government's Secretary of State Humphrey Atkins in April 1980 (Irish Times, 30 December 2010). The \\"Three Strands\\" approach eventually became the basis for the Good Friday Agreement. The Irish State papers from 1980 reveal that Logue was a confidante of the Irish Government of that time briefing it regularly on the SDLP's outlook. He is also known for his controversial comments at Trinity College Dublin at the time of the power-sharing Sunningdale Agreement, which many blame for helping to contribute to the Agreement's defeat, to wit, that: [Sunningdale was] \\"the vehicle that would trundle Unionists into a united Ireland\\".CAIN: Sunningdale ‚Äì Chronology of Main Events, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 30 March 2016. The next line of the controversial speech, said 'the speed the vehicle moved at was dependent on the Unionist community.' In an article in The Irish Times in 1997 Logue claimed that this implied that unity was always based on consent and acknowledged by Unionist Spokesman John Laird in the NI Assembly in 1973. Logue unsuccessfully contested the Londonderry seat in the February 1974 and 1979 Westminster Elections. He was elected to the 1975 constitutional convention and the 1982 Assembly. He was a member of the New Ireland Forum in 1983. In the 1980s he was a member of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, and played a prominent part in its efforts to resolve the 1981 Irish hunger strike. His role was credited in Ten Men Dead by David Beresford,David Beresford, Ten Men Dead, Harper Collins Publishers (1987)Biting the Grave by P. O'MalleyBiting the Grave by Padraig O'Malley, Beacon Press, 1990 and, more recently, in Blanketmen and Afterlives by former Provisional Irish Republican Army volunteer Richard O'Rawe.Blanketmen by Richard O'Rawe, New Island, 1990 Following the New Ireland Forum in 1984 and John Hume's decision to represent the redrawn Londonderry constituency as Foyle and a safe seat, Logue left the Dublin-based, National Board for Science and Technology and joined the European Commission in 1984 in Brussels. Following the 1994 IRA ceasefire, Logue, along with two EU colleagues, was asked by EU President Jacques Delors to consult widely throughout Northern Ireland and the Border regions and prepare recommendations for a Peace and Reconciliation Fund to underpin the peace process. Their community based approach became the blue print for the Peace Programme. In 1997, then EU President Jacques Santer asked the team, led by Logue to return to review the programme and advise for a renewed Peace ll programme. Future programme of Peace III and Peace IV. Papers published by National University Galway in 2016 from Logue's archives indicate that Logue was the originator of the Peace Fund concept within the European Commission. At the European Commission from 1984 to 1998, Logue developed a strong policy like between Eu Regional policy and Eu Research Policy, creating STRIDE (Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe). In 1992 he was joint author with Giovanni de Gaetano, of 'RTD potential in the Mezzogiorno of Italy: the role of science parks in a European perspective' () and with A. Zabaniotou and University of Thessaloniki, 'Structural Support For RTD'. Further publications by Logue followed in 1996, 'Research and Rural Regions' (), and in 1997 'RTD potential in the Objective 1 regions' () was published. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Logue's attention turned to Eastern Europe and in March 1998 published a set of studies 'Impact of the enlargement of the European Union towards central central and Eastern European countries on RTD- Innovation and Structural policies'. Logue convened the first EU seminar on 'Women in Science' in 1993 and jointly published with LM Telapessy 'Women in Scientific and Technological Research in the European Community', highlighting the barriers to women's advancement in the Research world.

Origin  Hamelin is traditionally made son of a Drogo (or Dru) de Ballon, lord of Ballon, today a commune in the department of Sarthe, Pays-de-la-Loire. It was located within the medieval County of Maine, invaded and conquered by Duke William of Normandy in the early 1060s, just before his invasion of England.  Rewards and duties  Hamelin de Ballon and his brother Wynebald de Ballon appear first to have come to England during the reign of William II. Wynebald was granted lands in Gloucestershire and Somerset out of those forfeited by Turstin FitzRolf, and was made seneschal of Caerleon, referring to himself as one of Henry I's most important noblemen. Hamelin was given lands in south east Wales, in what was to become the Welsh Marches, and in Wiltshire, where he held Castle Eaton, Cheverel and Sutton. He sited the early motte and bailey version of Abergavenny Castle and organised the early Norman protection of the settlement of what became the town of Abergavenny. Together with his brother Wynebald, he also founded the Benedictine Priory in the town as an alien cell of St Vincent, Le Mans, ca. 1100. He was already a benefactor of the latter foundation.

Early years and family Nathan was born in Richland County and, for almost two decades, has worked, lived, and raise his family in the community named after his ancestors. Nathan and his wife Karen are involved in Riverland Hills Baptist Church. He has a step-daughter, Sarah Katherine, son Jonathan Carroll, Jr., and daughter Emma Logan. Before his election to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 2004, Nathan had been involved with and supported community groups such as the Lake Murray/Irmo Rotary, home owners associations, the District Five Government Relations Committee, the Community Leadership Council and the Northwest YMCA Advisory Council. He was a member of Leadership Columbia and the University of South Carolina Young Alumni Council and the University's Richland/Lexington Alumni Council. Nathan has worked for the same company since graduating from the University of South Carolina in December 1992 and is Vice President and Branch Manager for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage in Columbia, South Carolina. South Carolina House of Representatives On June 8, 2004, Nathan defeated the 16-year incumbent, Rick Quinn, who served as the House Majority Leader. After the upset in the Republican primary, the Ballentine easily defeated the Green Party candidate in November 2004 general election. Ballentine was elected Vice Chairman of the Medical, Military, Public and Municipal Affairs committee during his freshman year (2005). He worked to get the first bill he filed to become law. In three months, H.3741 became law and the Palmetto State (and senior citizens in particular) soon benefitted from an increased focus on geriatric medicine. In just his 2nd year in office, Nathan again focused on healthcare; this time focusing on autistic children. Even though H.4351 ultimately died in the Senate; Nathan‚Äôs hard work enabled similar legislation to pass the following year. Another re-election (2007‚Äì2008) provided an opportunity to push fiscal issues that led to the passage of H.3008 (reduced tax burden on non-profits) and a House Rule change banning hidden earmarks. During 2009 and 2010, Nathan was the chief cosponsor, with then-Representative Nikki Haley, pushing for more accountability with On-The-Record Voting. That bill ultimately died in the Senate; but not before the House made a rule change and passed the bill with no dissenting votes. In 2011 at the request of Governor Haley, Nathan became lead sponsor for the On-The-Record Voting Bill and is hopeful for passage of one of the Governor's top issues to improve accountability in the SC General Assembly. In the 2010 session, Nathan‚Äôs Campaign Finance Disclosure Bill became law. The bill requires every elected official (from school board, to county office holders, etc.) to file their campaign disclosure report on-line. During his career in the South Carolina General Assembly, Ballentine has served on the Education and Public Works Committee, the House Ethics Committee, the Joint Transportation Review Screening Committee, and has been named a Friend of the Taxpayer and Taxpayer Hero every year he has served in Columbia. He receives high grades from Business and Industry groups as well as the SC Club for Growth and the NRA. Nathan is the Chairman of the Regulations Subcommittee in the House Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environmental Affairs Committee. Nathan does not keep his State House salary, donating it to community groups and organizations. In 2006, he designated funds for scholarships for deserving seniors. In his six years in office he has returned over $40,000 to his community.

It was in existence from 1658 to 1852. It is located in the present-day municipality of Bindal in Nordland county. History The ancient district of Bindalen belonged to Namdalen. However, in 1658, when the county (l√§n) of Trondheim was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde, the status of the border district was ambiguous, with residents paying some taxes to Helgeland, in Nordland, and some to Namdalen. The decision was then made to redraw the county boundary to run down the fjord, assigning the northern part, Nord-Bindalen, to Nordland county, which remained in the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway, while the larger part remained in Trondheim county and became S√∏r-Bindalen and part of the Kingdom of Sweden. The two remained separate after Tr√∏ndelag county was reunited with Norway in 1660.

It was the first to use a separate vapourising combustion chamber and is the forerunner of all hot-bulb engines, which are considered predecessors of the similar Diesel engine, developed a few years later. Early internal combustion engines were quite successful running on gaseous and light petroleum fuels. However, due to the dangerous nature of petroleum and light petroleum fuel, legal restrictions were placed on their transportation and storage. Heavier petroleum fuels, such as kerosene, were quite prevalent, as they were used for lighting, but posed specific problems when used in internal combustion engines: Oil used for engine fuel must be turned to a vapour state and remain in that state during compression. Furthermore, the combustion of the fuel must be powerful, regular, and complete, to avoid deposits that will clog the valves and working parts of the engine.  Early oil engines  The earliest mention of an oil engine was by Robert Street, in his English patent no. 1983 of 1794, and according to Horst O. Hardenberg there is evidence that he built a working version. Other oil engines were subsequently built by Etienne Lenoir, Siegfried Marcus, Julius Hock of Vienna and George Brayton in the 19th century. In 1807 Nic√©phore Ni√©pce built a working moss and coal powder powered engine. the Pyreolophore, which powered a boat upstream on the River Sa√¥ne. All of these engines with the exception of Brayton's were non- compression. Others made refinements to the oil engine; William Dent Priestman and Emile Capitaine are some of the more notable. However, it was Herbert Akroyd Stuart's design that was the most successful.  Herbert Akroyd Stuarts engine  Diagram of early vaporizing oil engine Herbert Akroyd Stuart's first prototype engines were built in 1886. In 1890, in collaboration with Charles Richard Binney, he filed Patent 7146 for Richard Hornsby & Sons of Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. The patent was entitled: \\"Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion of Mixtures of Combustible Vapour or Gas and Air\\".  Vapourising combustion chamber  Stuart's oil engine design was simple, reliable and economical. It had a comparatively low compression ratio, so that the temperature of the air compressed in the combustion chamber at the end of the compression stroke was not high enough to initiate combustion. Combustion instead took place in a separated combustion chamber, the \\"vapouriser\\" (also called the \\"hot bulb\\") mounted on the cylinder head, into which fuel was sprayed. It was connected to the cylinder by a narrow passage and was heated either by the cylinder's coolant or by exhaust gases while running; an external flame such as a blowtorch was used for starting. Self-ignition occurred from contact between the fuel-air mixture and the hot walls of the vapouriser. By contracting the bulb to a very narrow neck where it attached to the cylinder, a high degree of turbulence was set up as the ignited gases flashed through the neck into the cylinder, where combustion was completed. As the engine's load increased, so did the temperature of the bulb, causing the ignition period to advance; to counteract pre-ignition, water was dripped into the air intake.  Four-stroke oil engine  The Stuart engine is of four cycle design. During the intake stroke (1), fresh air is inducted into the cylinder through a mechanically operated intake valve. Simultaneously, oil is injected into the vapouriser. The vapour of the oil is almost entirely confined to the vapouriser chamber. This cloud of hot oil vapour is too rich to support combustion. On the compression stroke (2) of the piston, the fresh air is forced through the narrow neck and into the vapouriser. Just as compression is completed, the mixture is just right to support combustion and ignition occurs to push the piston during expansion stroke (3). Exhaust gas is released then during stroke (4).  Two-stroke hot-bulb engines  Some years later, Akroyd-Stuart's design was further developed in the United States by the German emigrants Mietz and Weiss, who combined the hot-bulb engine with the two-stroke scavenging principle, developed by Joseph Day to provide nearly twice the power, as compared to a four-stroke engine of same size. Similar engines, for agricultural and marine use, were built by J. V. Svensons Automobilfabrik, Bolinders, Lysekils Mekaniska Verkstad, Pythagoras Engine Factory and many other factories in Sweden.  Comparison to the Diesel engine  Akroyd-Stuart's engine was the first internal combustion engine to use a pressurised fuel injection system and also the first using a separate vapourising combustion chamber. It is the forerunner of all hot-bulb engines, which are considered kind of predecessors of the similar Diesel engine, developed a few years later. However, the Hornsby-Akroyd oil engine and other hot-bulb engines are distinctly different from Rudolf Diesel's design, where ignition occurs alone through the heat of compression: An oil engine will have a decent compression ratio between 3:1 and 5:1, where a typical diesel engine will have a much harder achieved compression ratio ranging between 15:1 and 20:1, making it a lot more efficient. Also the fuel is injected easily during the early intake stroke and not at the peak of compression with a high- pressure Diesel injection pump.US Patent 502837 Engine operated by the explosion of mixtures of gas or hydrocarbon vapor and air, dated August 8, 1893. line 45. Vapourising oil engine  First production oil engine  Akroyd-Stuart's engines were built from 26 June 1891 by Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, a large manufacturer of steam engines and agricultural equipment, as the Hornsby Akroyd Patent Oil Engine under licence and were first sold commercially on 8 July 1892. Other engineering companies had been offered the option of manufacturing the engine, but they saw it as a threat to their business, and so declined the offer. Adaption to compression ignition In 1892, T.H. Barton at Hornsbys enhanced the engine by replacing the vaporiser with a new cylinder head and increased the compression ratio to make the engine run on compression alone pre-dating Rudolph Diesel's engine. This Hornsby-Akroyd oil engine design was hugely successful: during the period from 1891 through 1905, a total of 32,417 engines were produced. They would provide electricity for lighting the Taj Mahal, the Rock of Gibraltar, the Statue of Liberty (chosen after Hornsby won the oil engine prize at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893), many lighthouses, and for powering Guglielmo Marconi's first transatlantic radio broadcast.

Palti (or Paltiel), son of Laish, who was from Gallim, was the second husband of Michal, Saul's daughter. Where other versions read \\"Palti\\" (1 Samuel 25:44) and \\"Paltiel\\" (2 Samuel 3:5), the KJV has Phalti and Phaltiel, respectively. Michal was originally David's wife, but Saul gave her to Palti after she helped David escape from Saul. Later, after David was anointed, but before he succeeded Saul as King of Judah, David demanded of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son (and Michal's brother), that Michal be returned to David as his wife, as a condition of an alliance between them. This Ish-bosheth granted, sending Abner, a military leader, to bring Michal to David. The biblical account says that Palti \\"followed her weeping as far as Bahurim. But Abner said to him 'Go Back!'. And he turned back.\\". According to the Talmud, Palti never consummated his marriage with Michal, but kept a sword between them while in bed to separate them. The Talmud explains his weeping as sorrow over the loss of a good deed, and not as weeping for the loss of Michal herself: > Is it not written (II Samuel 3.16), He went weeping? --This was for losing > the good deed [of self-restraint]. Hence [he followed her] to [the town > called] Bahurim (literally, youths), implying that they both had remained > like unmarried youths and not tasted the pleasure of marital > relations.Sanhedrin 19b British Reform Rabbi Jonathan Magonet has described the episode as 'one of those remarkable subversive moments' when we are forced to confront the dark side of a heroic character (David), to ask what really matters, and what price might be too high to pay for something. Palti loses his wife, 'but for one brief moment he helps turn our perception of the world inside out'.Magonet, Jonathan (1992) Bible Lives (London: SCM), 91 References Category:Hebrew Bible people ","title":"Palti, son of Laish"},{"id":"13408195","text":"Gourin () is a commune in the Morbihan d√©partement of Brittany in north- western France.
