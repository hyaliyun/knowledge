Constructed in 1880, the townhouse is the last Victorian residence on Connecticut Avenue between Dupont Circle and Farragut Square that has not been significantly altered. It features an octagonal tower topped by a dome with cartouche windows. Following a multiyear legal battle to demolish the townhouse, which had been added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1979, the Demonet Building and adjoining lot were sold for what was then a record price for downtown real estate. The adjoining office building, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, was completed in 1984. The namesake of the building, John Charles Demonet, established a confectionery business on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1848. During the next several decades he and his family grew the business into a successful company that included catering services and was a confectionery supplier for the White House. In the early 1900s the business was moved to Connecticut Avenue, a fashionable residential area at the time, and became a commercial pioneer of what was nicknamed the Fifth Avenue of Washington, D.C. After the business was moved a few blocks north in 1927 the Demonet family continued ownership of the building and it was rented to various retailers. The family sold the building in 1979 and since the modern addition was constructed, the property has been owned by several organizations, currently an affiliate of the Qatari royal family. History=Construction and first owner During the 1870s Connecticut Avenue between Dupont Circle and Farragut Square became a fashionable residential area for Washingtonians and a place \\"to see and be seen\\", spurred by the construction of the British Legation at Connecticut Avenue and N Street and Alexander \\"Boss\\" Shepherd's mansion at Connecticut Avenue and K Street. On April 23, 1880, real estate developer John Sherman was issued a building permit to construct four brick houses on the southeast corner of Connecticut Avenue and M Street. There was no architect listed on the permit, but John and his wife Ella are believed to have designed some of the houses they built and sold throughout their careers. The four-story corner building was designed in the Victorian style with Gothic Revival elements. It features a tin roof, wooden cornice with decorative ornaments, and molded brick below the cornice, windows, and on the tower. The alternately projecting bays also feature molded brick. The ribbed tin dome features eight facets, cartouche windows, and is topped with a spire. The corner building might be one that was advertised in the Evening Star from November 1880 to February 1881: The corner house, listed at 1756 M Street NW, was owned by William Warrington Evans from 1882 to 1901. Evans was a dentist who operated his practice in the building. Demonet ownership The original Demonet shop on Pennsylvania Avenue NW. During the first few decades of the 20th century many of the Victorian homes on Connecticut Avenue between Farragut Square and Florida Avenue were converted into high-end shops or replaced with small commercial buildings, resulting in the street being called the Fifth Avenue of Washington. On November 15, 1901, the building was purchased by Jules Demonet. The Demonet family owned a successful confectionery and catering business founded in 1848 by John Charles Demonet, Jules' father. The original shop was located in a three-story brick building at 1714 Pennsylvania Avenue NW and due to its convenient location to the White House, was reportedly visited by President Abraham Lincoln and General Ulysses S. Grant during the Civil War. With help from his wife, Ida, who was also from the Alsace-Lorraine region of France, the business grew in popularity. In 1884 the business was described in Historical and Commercial Sketches of Washington and Environs as \\"one of the leading houses of the kind in the city\\" and \\"has furnished the President's House since President Buchanan with all the confections, creams, pastries used, as well as the best families in the city.\\" An article in The Washington Post from 1893 said \\"Whenever it is desired to make a good impression upon some foreign potentate or distinguished citizen at the White House\\" that Demonet's business would do so. Jules received training in pastry and ice cream making in France and New York City and along with his mother continued the family business following his father's death. Following the building's purchase, it underwent several alterations including partial ceiling removal, building an interior balcony and balustrade, adding show windows, and installing a marquee. In 1904 Jules hired the architectural firm owned by George Oakley Totten Jr. and Laussat R. Rogers to design a three-story brick addition on the south side (facing Connecticut Avenue) of the building. The shop moved from Pennsylvania Avenue to its new location on Connecticut Avenue in 1905 and the business continued to grow. Along with Magruder's Grocery Store at Connecticut Avenue and K Street and the Maison Rauscher catering firm at Connecticut Avenue and L Street, Demonet's was considered a pioneer in the commercial development of the area. In 1911 Demonet's opened a confection factory at 2021-2023 L Street NW to produce its catering and store products. Business continued to grow during the next decade despite sugar shortages during World War I. In 1927 the Demonet family moved their shop a few blocks north to 1520 Connecticut Avenue NW in Dupont Circle. Maison Rauscher, Demonet's main competitor, also moved around the same time to a building less than a block away from Demonet's new location. The Demonet family continued ownership of the corner building for the next several decades as the area continued to develop into a major commercial area. Due to construction of the adjoining Elizabeth Arden Building, Waggaman-Ray Commercial Row, and most notably the Mayflower Hotel, the 1100 block of Connecticut Avenue had the highest assessed property value of any block on Connecticut Avenue in 1929. The Demonet family rented the corner building to various retailers, starting with the Madame Ash dress shop in 1928, followed by tenants selling furniture, clothing, statuary, and makeup. In 1944 there was a fire inside the building when a straw hat was ignited by a customer's cigarette. Due to austerity and sugar shortages during World War II, the Demonet business closed in the early 1940s. The recipes and operations were handed over to the Avignone Freres confectionery and catering business at 1777 Columbia Road NW. Legal battle Entrance to the corner building. In 1979 the Demonet family sold the building to real estate developer Dominic F. Antonelli Jr. who planned to demolish it along with adjoining properties on M Street. The Dupont Circle Citizens Association (DCCA) responded with an application to have the Demonet Building named a historic landmark. Allison Luchs of the DCCA described the building as \\"an obstinate survivor from the past, hanging on as if to celebrate its centennial in 1980\\" and described the building's dome as \\"a scaled down version of the Florence Cathedral dome\\" that \\"appears today as a minor echo of the St. Matthew's Cathedral dome across the street.\\" Wolf Von Eckardt, architecture critic for The Washington Post who had previously written a tribute to the building in 1966, implored local officials to save the building: \\"I hope the Landmarks Committee members will close their eyes for a moment and imagine what that corner of Connecticut Avenue will look like if the mini-Brunelleschi were replaced with a bland 12-story box - or even an interesting 12-story box. It will look like K Street, that's what it will look like.\\" The city's Joint Committee on Landmarks of the National Capital (JCLNC), in partnership with the National Capital Planning Commission, added the Demonet Building, listed at 1149 Connecticut Avenue NW and 1758 M Street NW, to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on November 23, 1979. The committee said the building was \\"an exuberant example of the rich architecture which characterized post-Civil War Washington\\" but declined a request to add the building to the National Register of Historic Places. Following the landmark designation there were legal battles between the committee and Antonelli for two years. In 1980 Antonelli demolished the building behind the Demonet and asked the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to overturn the historic landmark status. His plan was to replace the Demonet and adjoining site with an office building with street-level retail space. In A&G; Limited Partnership v. Joint Committee on Landmarks of the National Capital lawyers for Antonelli argued the JCLNC was not a city agency and it did not have the authority to designate historic landmarks. In 1982 a three-judge panel refused to overturn the historic landmark status. The court said it did not have jurisdiction over the JCLNC because it was not a city government agency. In response to the court's ruling, the president of a local historical preservation group said \\"Generally, we're very pleased with the decision. While it did apply directly to the Demonet building...what it does for the city is to give the Joint Committee a signal to go ahead, and it preserves their effectiveness.\\" Restoration and new office building The Demonet Building and adjoining lot were sold in 1982 to a British subsidiary, Second British American Inc., for approximately $10 million, or around $1,000 a square foot, which was a record price for downtown Washington, D.C. real estate. Viking Property Group, Inc., which was also a subsidiary of a British company, was selected as the project developer. It was the first US project for the group and unlike other real estate develop companies, Viking appreciated the building's historic status. A representative for the company stated: \\"What was a negative to many people in the development community was a positive attribute to the Viking Group. They thought it was worth saving and enhancing.\\" The Dupont Circle Conservancy participated in the design of the new office building to ensure architectural cohesiveness with surrounding properties. A Burberry shop was located in the Demonet Building for almost 30 years before moving to CityCenterDC. Renovation of the original building and construction of the new 12-story postmodern office building, which includes a three-story underground parking garage, was carried out by Omni Construction Inc. for $6.1 million. Richard Giegengack and Robert Larson of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill were selected to design the 134,000 square feet (12,449 sq m) project. To make the old and new buildings architecturally compatible, bricks were incorporated into the design of the new building's fa√ßade. Concrete floors were poured into the 12,000 square foot (1,115 sq m) corner building and once the new building was completed, floor joists were replaced with steel beams. The roof of the corner building was converted into a terrace for the fifth floor of the new building. The sixth through twelfth floors of the new building rise above and behind the corner building and features a beveled tower with a six-story arched window. On the M Street side the building's eleventh and twelfth floors are set back 20 feet (6.1 m) from the first ten floors. A brick four-story historicist section was built between the two buildings to blend the corner building's cornice line. During construction a large beam was dropped on the wall of the original building, resulting in a crack that almost caused the wall to collapse, but the damage was quickly repaired. Soon after the $35 million project was completed, the British owners rented the first floor retail space in the corner building to British luxury retailer Burberry. The Demonet Building was sold to Japanese real estate firm Mitsui Fudosan in 1986. It was later acquired by the Stockbridge Capital Group who sold it to Alduwaliya Asset Management (AAM) in 2017 for $64,250,000. It was the third local real estate purchase by AAM, an affiliate of Qatar's Al Thani royal family. Notes :1. Sources including Alison Luchs and Wolf Von Eckardt speculate the builder, John Sherman, also designed the building.

He grew up in a middle-class family and married Barsita Mikhael Saad (born 1926). They had six children: Bassam, retired Brigadier General, Hanna, a Business Engineer, Samir, who died at a young age due to malpractice, Elias, a Civil Engineer, Noha, an Endocrinologist, Rita, who died in her early twenties after losing a battle with Brain Cancer, and Fouad, an Industrial Engineer.  Education  Saad went to school in the surrounding towns and decided that when he was 18, he would be a monk. To this end, he moved to the monastery in the town of Shebbanieh in Mount Lebanon, but soon after he had arrived, he fell out with the Abbot.After a little while, he returned to Tripoli, where he enrolled at the Coll√®ge des Fr√®res.  Career  He joined the Lebanese Army in 1930 and was stationed in the military barracks of Andaket in Akkar. He was promoted to the rank of 'sergeant' in 1934 when he enrolled at the Aleppo Military Academy.. He finished his post as a warrant officer two years later, in 1937 he was raised to the position of 'Lieutenant.' Saad moved across various sectors during his military service. The Levantine Regiment‚Äìthe nucleus of the Lebanese Army ‚Äìhas been transformed from Sniper Regiment 1. He was appointed the second Sniper Regiment Commander from 1948 to 1950.  Relationship with President Chehab  Antoun Saad sitting with President Fouad Chehab and other military leaders. His meeting and friendship with Fouad Chehab was the path that led Antoun Saad to the Second Bureau. The two met for the first time in 1936 at the Aleppo Military Academy, when Saad passed a shooting test in front of a military commission of which the then Captain Fouad Chehab was a member. Their second meeting took place in the Marjeyoun barracks in South Lebanon following a clash between a Lebanese and a French soldier. Saad, who was in charge, resolved the conflict by sending the former to jail and the latter to the hospital. His racist conduct infuriated Chehab, who begged him to handle the two equally and to put them all in the hospital, but Saad was courageous enough to show Chehab that the French soldier was at fault, and thus deserved to go to prison. This act of boldness placed Saad in high regard for Chehab. The Battle of al-Malikiyah between the Lebanese and Israeli armies in 1948 offered the third occasion for their encounter.  The Deuxi√®me Bureau  Having met and made friends with Saad, Chehab, who had become Commander of the Army, agreed to name him as Head of the Second Bureau by the end of February 1952. During his tenure at the Second Bureau, Saad was an active player in shaping or participating in major events taking place in the region. From 1954 onwards, he set out to formulate a strategy to reform Lebanon 's military intelligence service, seeking the opinion of experienced French intelligence officers. To this end, it expanded its sources of intelligence, which were no longer limited to feedback from its monthly paid personal informants, but extended to include key stakeholders operating in the region. Gradually, he established a wide network of contacts with prominent Lebanese leaders, high-ranking businessmen, merchants, industrialists, bankers, and businessmen. His crucial position in power helped him attract certain individuals who would reveal information to him in return for services and security, particularly after he became recognized as President Fouad Chehab 's closest statesman. It was under Antoun Saad that the Second Bureau started to play an important role. Originally, the military intelligence team consisted of no more than 15 non-commissioned officers, some of whom would be monitoring the Palestinian camps and others would be investigating Israeli-sponsored assassination attempts. Administrative activities were limited to a variety of operations helping pro-Chehab politicians and seeking to increase their influence. But, starting in 1959, Saad began to expand his intelligence personnel. New Second Bureau branches were established in all five Mohafazas to gather information, a mission that had previously been delegated to the leadership of the military regions, in collaboration with an officer stationed in the Second Bureau and responsible for maintaining security. Soon afterwards, the branches were granted considerable rights and enjoyed greater patronage from the social groups and the dignitaries, as they offered help and were versatile in issuing arms licences. Saad recruited highly skilled officers at the intelligence office and entrusted them with the management of the Mohafaza branch. After the failed coup d'√©tat led by Fouad Awad, the Pentagon invited Antoun Saad to Washington D.C in order to ask him how he knew about the coup d'√©tat prior to it happening Following the failure of the coup d'√©tat attempted by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party on the night of 30/31 December 1961, Antoun Saad plotted another coup. The Head of the Second Bureau has agreed to open a new chapter in its intelligence operations by tightening the military's hold on public life and reforming its infrastructure to ensure a higher degree of security and internal stability, with greater access to financial resources. The strategy was to bridge all the gaps between the military and political classes and to enable military intelligence to keep up with the latest political news and developments in Lebanon. He thus created a transformational transition for intelligence work which, until that time, had often concentrated on small and meaningless street news, such as revealing who cursed the President of the Republic or attacked the Second Bureau or complained about the ruling class. Saad changed the role of the Bureau to one concerned with the investigation and collection of information. Nor was its mission limited solely to this: the Second Bureau also engaged in the analysis of the material, the evaluation of its dimensions and the anticipation of developments in order to avoid possible consequences.\\"Absolute Security\\" was a core component of Antoun Saad 's slogan. To him, this meant placing everything associated with the absolute existence of security under close observation, a generalization that could be interpreted in such a way as to place politics, economy, sociology and culture at the core of the definition, requirements and terms of security. Through this way, intelligence strengthened its hold on the state and the nation, which, through turn, had significant consequences and had negative results, which were later transformed into the indictment of intelligence officers following the 1970 parliamentary elections, a move that was criticized by many for exposing Lebanon to threats and contributing to the civil war in Lebanon.  Retirement  Antoun Saad served at the head of the Second Bureau until President Chehab's term of office had ended. He was appointed commander of the Mount Lebanon Military Region on August 27, 1964, and his military service was extended by a further year until his retirement on July 1, 1971. Upon retirement, Saad kept several secrets to himself. Nevertheless, when the Civil War broke out and his asthma worsened, he resorted to burning all the classified documents prior to his death on 26 June 1977 at the age of 67.

The extension of the railway into East Kent in 1871 led to the creation of a number of seaside resorts along the Kent coast to the west of Margate. Westgate-on-Sea was built in the 1870 by the London-based developers Corbett & McClymont. In 1910, a town hall was constructed but within 2 years, the building had been converted into a cinema. Originally named the Town Hall Cinema, it was renamed the Carlton in the 1930s. It remains a, privately- owned, functioning cinema and is a Grade II listed building. History and description The north-east Kent coast had been a popular holiday resort for Londoners since the establishment of Margate as one of England's first seaside resorts in the early 18th century. The 1860s saw the completion of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway with its terminal at Margate opening in 1863. This led to the construction of a number of resorts along the Kent coast to the west of Margate, including Westgate-on-Sea. Developed by the firm of Corbett & McClymont, which had a large property development and construction business in West London, many of the buildings in the town were designed by the company architect Charles Beazley. The town hall does not have a recorded architect but was built in 1910. Within two years, it had been converted to a cinema and it remains a privately-run cinema a century later. John Newman, in his Kent: Northeast and East Pevsner, calls the Carlton as \\"an extraordinary m√©lange of disparate motifs\\". A central, crenellated clock tower is flanked by two- storey, gabled wings with chimneystacks with an \\"outsized\\" Tudoresque appearance. Beneath the clock face is a statue of a trumpeting angel. To the rear is a range of windows in a Moorish Revival style. Margate's Civic society describes the overall architectural effect as \\"Swiss-Gothic\\". The cinema is a Grade II listed building.

She is also known for being the mother of Ram√≥n Mercader, the assassin of Leon Trotsky, and for having personally participated in the operation. Life Caridad Mercader belonged to a wealthy family of ' origin in early 20th-century Barcelona. She married Pablo Mercader, a member of Barcelona's industrial upper class, from whom she took the name, and with whom she had five children. After the end of her marriage to Mercader, she moved away from her family and permanently turned her back on the social class they represented. This decision was motivated in part by an episode of forced institutionalization during which she was subjected to electroshock therapy and her former husband's attempts to change her state of \\"sexual apathy\\" through visits to local brothels. Mercader began to frequent anarchist circles and soon attached herself to the communist ideology. She participated in the fights against the military uprising in Barcelona and joined the groups that left for Aragon, where she suffered severe injuries during an aerial attack. Mercader achieved some notoriety as a member of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya, PSUC). In 1936 she led a propaganda mission to Mexico and later became an agent of the NKVD in Spain. Her son Ram√≥n, also a member of the PSUC and an officer in the Spanish Republican Army, was also recruited by Soviet espionage during the war, likely with the involvement of his mother, and trained to assassinate Leon Trotsky. Caridad, who had settled in Paris some time in 1938, also participated in the operation. When Ram√≥n was arrested after murdering Trotsky, she managed to leave Mexico and escape to the Soviet Union, where she was received with honors. She actively participated in conflicts between the different factions of exiled Spanish communists during her stay there. In 1944 she obtained a permit to leave the country. However, contrary to the agreed upon conditions, she traveled to Mexico, where an undercover operation was being prepared to get Ram√≥n Mercader out of jail. Mercader's presence proved to be counterproductive, as Mexican authorities tightened Ram√≥n's prison conditions, causing the Soviets to abandon their efforts. Ram√≥n, who according to his brother Luis never shared his mother's passion for the communist cause, never forgave her this interference. After the failure of the operation, Caridad once more took up residence in Paris, enjoying a Soviet pension. She occasionally traveled to the Soviet Union to visit her children, Luis and Ram√≥n, the latter of which had settled there after serving his sentence in Mexico. She died in the French capital in 1975.

His parents were both educators: Dr Abraham Hrushovski (Hebrew surname Agasi, Hebrew: ◊ê◊í◊°◊ô), his father, was a history teacher who taught in various gymnasiums In Vilnius and later in Haifa (died in 1973); Dvora Freidkes-Hrushovski (1896-1985), his mother, was a mathematics teacher and school headmistress in Vilnius. He had a younger sister, Eta Hrushovski (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ò◊î ◊î◊®◊ï◊©◊ï◊ë◊°◊ß◊ô), born 1934, who died in 1968 during a trip in Turkey. Harshav studied in a secular Yiddish school and Yiddish gymnasium. In September 1939, under the terms of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, Vilnius was captured by the Red Army, then handed over to Lithuania; but again taken and annexed to the Soviet Union in August 1940. In 1941, as Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, his family fled Eastward to the Ural Mountains. He finished his senior exams in a Russian school in 1945, and in 1945-46 studied mathematics and physics at Orenburg, where he won the first prize for first-year students.

Life  Wetzel was born in Kyritz, Brandenburg, the son of a postal clerk. After his Abitur, which he passed in Potsdam in 1897, he studied biology in Berlin, Marburg and Munich from 1897 to 1901. In Marburg he also studied philosophy with Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp. In 1901 he received his doctorate there with a zoological thesis. He then turned to music and deepened his knowledge with private studies in Berlin. The Friedrich-Kiel-Gesellschaft recorded him as a student of Friedrich Kiel. He made his living as a music consultant for various daily newspapers. From 1905 to 1907 he taught at the Riemann Conservatory in Stettin. In 1910 he finally moved to Berlin, where he first taught at the Klindworth-Scharwenka-Konservatorium and in 1926 he moved to the K√∂nigliches Musik-Institut Berlin in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Although Wetzel lived a relatively secluded life and was hardly committed to his work, a large circle of friends and admirers surrounded him. These included not only musicians, but also visual artists such as Emil Orlik and his pupil Gunter B√∂hmer, the poet Hermann Hesse and Anna Spitteler, the daughter of the Swiss Nobel Prize winner for literature Carl Spitteler, whom Wetzel admired. Wetzel's pupils were the composers Mark Lothar and Friedrich Metzler and the pianist Gerhard Puchelt. On the occasion of Wetzel's 50th birthday, a concert was held on 16 March 1929 in the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, which was dedicated exclusively to his work. In 1937 Wetzel was dismissed from his teaching post because he refused to separate from his Jewish wife Rose n√©e Bergmann. In March 1943 she was among those who were imprisoned in Rosenstrasse, but were released again by the famous Rosenstrasse protest. In 1945 Wetzel became a professor at the Berlin University of the Arts; in 1948, he moved with his family to √úberlingen at Bodensee where he died at the age of 94.  Family  The only child from Wetzel's marriage to Rose Bergmann is daughter Ruth (b. 14 December 1924 in Berlin). She moved to Paris after the war and was married to the Spanish composer Antonio Ruiz-Pip√≥. The marriage remained childless.  Estate  Wetzel's estate was handed over to the archive of the Berlin University of the Arts by his daughter Ruth Ruiz-Pip√≥ in 1999. In 2004 and 2005, it was used for Wetzel exhibitions in Berlin and √úberlingen. Both exhibitions were curated by the art historian Nancy Tanneberger, who also dealt with the estate. The Hesse-Lieder found in the estate were published in 2006 by Klaus Martin Kopitz at Saier & Hug.  Compositions  Wetzel devoted himself almost exclusively to the solo song with piano accompaniment. More than 600 songs have been handed down by him, of which about 100 have appeared in print. Stylistically they have their roots in the Romantic period and tie in with Johannes Brahms and Hugo Wolf. An important source of inspiration was also the folk song. Numerous interpreters have worked for Wetzel, among the most renowned are Emmi Leisner, Heinrich Schlusnus, Paula Salomon-Lindberg, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Peter Sch√∂ne as well as the pianist Sandra Droucker and the song accompanist Franz Rupp. Published in print: * Elf Gedichte mit Musik f√ºr eine Singstimme und Klavier, Berlin, selfpublished, 1911 * Op. 1, Sechs Gedichte f√ºr eine hohe Stimme und Klavier, K√∂ln, Tischer & Jagenberg, 1917 (Digitized) * Op. 2, Acht Volkslieder mit neuen Weisen f√ºr eine mittlere Stimme und Klavier, K√∂ln, Tischer & Jagenberg, 1917 (Digitized) * Op. 3, Sechs Gedichte f√ºr eine hohe Stimme und Klavier, Cologne, Tischer & Jagenberg, 1919 (Digitized) * Op. 4, Sechs Gedichte f√ºr eine hohe Stimme und Klavier, Cologne, Tischer & Jagenberg, 1919 * Op. 5, Sieben Gedichte f√ºr eine mittlere Stimme und Klavier, Cologne, Tischer & Jagenberg, 1919 (Digitized) * Op. 8, Vier Gedichte f√ºr eine hohe Stimme und Klavier, Cologne, Tischer & Jagenberg, 1919 (Digitized) * Op. 9, Drei Gedichte f√ºr eine mittlere Stimme und Klavier, Cologne, Tischer & Jagenberg, 1919 (Digitized) * Op. 10, Vier Gedichte f√ºr eine tiefe Stimme und Klavier, Cologne, Tischer & Jagenberg, 1917 (Digitized) * Op. 11, F√ºnfzehn Gedichte von Hermann Hesse, Berlin, RIes & Erler, 1925; 2nd edition 1960 ** Nr. 5, Fr√ºhlingstag, dedicated to Corry Nera * Op. 12, Verwandlungen eines eigenen Themas f√ºr Klavier, Berlin, Ries & Erler, 1929, dedicated to Sandra Droucker * Op. 13, 21 Gedichte von Joseph von Eichendorff, Berlin, Albert Stahl, 1931 ** Nr. 2, In Danzig, dedicated to Heinrich Schlusnus ** Nr. 4, Morgenst√§ndchen, dedicated to Mark Lothar ** Nr. 18, Der Kehraus, dedicated to Franz Rupp * Im stillen Reich.

The development was completed by 2012 at a cost of $20 million. The facility also contains a shooting range, three armories, decontamination room, volcanic ash remover, reverse osmosis water filtration, and a remote-controlled .223 rifle (with a fully automated mode) in a sniper post atop the facility to defend the bunker.

Ziegler died in 2017. The estate formally demanded the funds, which were in default by late 2018. Shortly after, Hall's LAH Cubed transferred assets to other LLCs in his name. The estate filed in January 2019 to pierce the corporate veil as Hall/LAH Cubed had transferred assets to other LLCs. In a May 2019 response, LAH Cubed stated that there was confusion, that Ziegler owed LAH for $5 million in improvements, so the $3 million was partial payment towards that, which satisfied the note, but he died before actually voiding it. LAH also denied any connection between Ziegler and the asset transfers. The parties settled out of court in August 2019.

Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the Foss River. This peak is set on the divide between the east and west forks of Foss River. The nearest neighbor is Silver Eagle Peak, to the southwest, and Bald Eagle Lake lies in a cirque midway between the pair. The first ascent of this peak was made in 1933 by Hermann Ulrichs and Ben Falkenburg via the North Ridge. This mountain's name and correct location was officially adopted September 8, 1988, by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Some older maps will have this peak erroneously labeled at Silver Eagle Peak's location. Climate Bald Eagle Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Following his 2012 arrest for the 1986 rape-murder of a hitchiker in Ben Lomond, California, Kelley additionally confessed to murdering a couple two years later in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, near Crescent City. For all of his crimes, he received three life imprisonment terms, which he is currently serving at the California Correctional Institution. Sex crimes In September 1986, Kelley was convicted of statutory rape in rural Santa Clara County, for which he spent 90 days behind bars and three years of probation. After he was let go, he married and settled in Ben Lomond. Years later, in May 1995, he was arrested for rape again in Eureka. He had offered a ride to an acquaintance who needed to run some errands, but at one point, they stopped at his house, where he proceeded to rape her. For this, Kelley was jailed for six years, and was required to register as a sex offender. Murders=Annette Thur Annette Kulovitz, who went by her stepfather's name of Thur, was a 16-year-old who lived with her boyfriend and his family in Ben Lomond. Although smart and friendly, she had a history of running away and avoided returning to her parents, who had opted to relocate to Fort Wayne, Indiana because of cheaper living costs. However, Annette decided to stay at Ben Lomond. On December 6, 1986, after attending a party in Boulder Creek, Thur wanted to hitchhike her way back home, and was picked up by Kelley early in the morning. Kelley then drove her to his house in Ben Lomond, where he raped, sodomized and finally strangled the girl to death. In order to get rid of the body, he dumped it on an embankment along the Skyline Boulevard, where it was soon found by a tourist admiring the scenery. Initially, the police considered that she had died from a drug overdose, and that her friends had discarded her body to avoid getting into trouble, but that theory was later ruled out. However, with a lack of viable suspects, the case went cold. Douglas and Rozina Anderson On August 14, 1988, married couple Douglas Neal Anderson, 26, and his wife, Rozina Anne, 31, left their home in Lake Oswego, Oregon to camp out in northern California. They were camping at the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, when John Kelley came across them. Pulling out his .22 caliber gun, he shot at least nine shells into their 1974 Dodge van, killing both on the spot and fleeing afterwards. Not long after, a tourist noticed that the couple's black cocker spaniel was tied up outside the van, and after deciding to check on it, found that the vehicle had been riddled with bullet holes and a foul odor came from it. Like the Thur case, the double murder went cold quickly, as robbery was disregarded as a motive and no suspects emerged. The killing shocked the small community, which had a low homicide rate. Trial and imprisonment In 2012, after being granted funds by federal agents, the crime lab in San Mateo County decided to run the DNA of Thur's killer through CODIS, which matched that of John William Kelley, a convicted rapist who lived in Placerville. Agents were dispatched to interview him, and in the end, he was arrested and charged with killing Annette Thur. Later on, at his trial, Kelley pleaded no contest, and was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. While in jail, he surprised investigators by confessing to two more murders: the August 1988 slayings of the Anderson couple. Kelley explained the crime in great detail, providing information only the perpetrator could've known. Because of this, he was extradited to Del Norte County, where he would later be convicted again and sentenced to two more life imprisonment terms. He is currently housed at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi.

The settlement was attacked by upper caste villagers during the New year celebrations by the Dalit community. Around 80 upper caste villagers damaged Dalit homes, motor-bikes and properties. 8 Dalits were injured and 4 were admitted to the hospital. The attacks led to protests and road blocks by thousands of villagers and political parties across the state to bring the attackers to justice. 6 men from the upper caste community were arrested in the next two days for the violence.  Background  The Dalit villagers reside in the settlement of Kudikadu, in the south of the large village of Ambalapattu. This settlement has an upper caste group consisting of at least 300 Kallar caste families, and a relatively small Dalit Paraiyar population consisting of about 60 households. The villagers are relatively well-off in both areas, with at least one person of each family employed in Singapore. The area is also reportedly known as 'Little Singapore' and it is also reported that Dalit families were well-educated, with many members working in government jobs. And the area has been a Communist heartland for over 6 decades, with inhabitants opposing oppression by Zamindars and supporting relationship and economic development for all classes.  New year celebrations  The Dalit community in Kudikadu had planned for a new year celebration on the mid-night of 31 December 2017. The people festooned the colony's entrance with a balloon arch and celebrated the new year by boiling over milk, a Tamil tradition connected to Pongal festival. They also celebrated the new year by cutting a cake. For a dance program in which the children of the colony took part, a sound system had been set up. Each year, the colony's youth organize this festivities after raising money from the colony's residents.  Scuffle between the villagers  Some Dalit villagers saw a group of youngsters from the upper caste Kallar group standing close to the entrance of their colony at around 12.30am on 1 January 2018. These men were in the northern area of the village, from a settlement about 3 km away. The Dalit villagers asserted that the men damaged the arch which they built for celebration. This led to a scuffle between the two groups which led to injury to one Dalit man. The scuffle was quickly broken up.  Attacks  After an hour, a group of around 80 upper caste members belonging to the Kallar caste, armed with knives, rods and other weapons, reached the Dalit colony in Kudikadu. They also allegedly brought the weapons in a van. The upper caste members reportedly stirred up a quarrel over the sound system which were used for the celebrations. Then they went on rampage, damaging properties and ransacking Dalit houses. They reportedly cut off the power supply to the Dalit colony before their attacks. The upper caste members reportedly screamed ,\\"Why do you have to wear pants and shirts?\\" and Why do you need to celebrate New Year, lower caste dogs? during their attacks. The Dalit men begged the attackers to spare their families while the women locked themselves up in their homes in panic as the mob attacked. The attacks lasted for thirty minutes before the attackers left having taught the Dalits \\"a lesson.\\" Some Dalits locked them up inside their houses while others escaped to the nearby fields. The villagers alleged that the violence ended with very few casualties because the Dalit men refrained from fighting back.  Damages  15 motor bikes and 15 houses belonging to the Dalits were damaged. House hold articles including utensils, furniture, water pipes and Televisions were also destroyed. The sound system was also reportedly destroyed. The attacks left 8 Dalits seriously injured and 4 men were hospitalized.  Protests  The next morning on 1 January 2018, more than a thousand villagers protested to arrest the attackers, to provide compensation to the affected and also demanded the District Collector to visit the spot. The protesters blocked the roads and the traffic was disrupted from 10 am to 1 pm and the vehicles were diverted. High level functionaries of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Communist Party of India and founder of the Adi Dravida Munnetra Kazhakam and members of various parties took part in the road blockade and raised slogans. The Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front made a demonstration in front of the Tiruvallur bus stand condemning the attacks.  Arrests  Two days after the attack 6 men from the kallar community were arrested for the attacks.  Investigations  Kathir, the founder of Evidence, a Non- governmental organization based in Madurai, said caste discrimination is deeply rooted, though in a dormant form, in the social structure of villages in this area. He added that the involvement of many left-wing parties in the area may also have been the explanation for fewer attacks in the recent times. He said these attacks typically occur when Dalits speak up against attacks against them, or when they progress economically. He said that the society was assaulted as this colony has a lot of members in good government positions.

The 18.5 km (11.5 mile) long branch line started where it branched from the Main Western Railway line at Spring Hill.and ended at Cadia. Its main role was to carry iron ore from the quarry at Cadia and for much of its life was privately operated. History and description= Historical context  Although Cadia had been mined for gold and copper, a significant deposit of iron ore also had been identified there. A branch line to Cadia had been advocated for some years, with alternative routes from Spring Hill, Millthorpe or Carcoar being identified. After the blast furnace at Lithgow opened in May 1907, one reason for the iron ore deposit at 'Iron Duke' (Big Cadia) not being mined‚Äîalthough William Sandford had taken out a sub-lease to do so‚Äîwas the absence of a rail connection and the poor state of the nearby roads. Sandford instead opened an ore quarry at Coombing Park near Carcoar, The subsequent owner of the Lithgow Blast Furnace, G & C Hoskins Ltd, let the sub-lease over the Cadia deposit lapse but later took out a new sub- lease, for a payment of ¬£1,000 per year and 6d. per ton of ore.  Agreement  By 1915, Charles Hoskins was proposing that the N.S.W. Government build and operate a line to Cadia from Spring Hill but did not rule out building and operating a private line. The final arrangement agreed was that the N.S.W. Government would own the branch line, and provide rolling stock other than locomotives; G & C Hoskins Limited would provide a locomotive, maintain and operate the branch line, and pay the Government at a rate of 15% of the standard freight rate. Contemporary reports state that G. & C. Hoskins surveyed and constructed the line, at a cost to the company of ¬£118,000. The route of the line was surveyed in early 1916 and work at the Spring Hill end also commenced then. Route and description The line branched off the down track of Main Western Line just past the Orange end of Spring Hill railway station, turning to the west about a quarter of a mile later and passing through the Spring Hill exchange sidings. At the exchange sidings, there was an engine shed, capable of holding one locomotive, possibly later extended to be able to house two, and a water tank fed by a wind-driven pump.. The line then ran along south of the road to Orange, until just past the small village of Spring Terrace, where it continued westward. The elevation of the line increased gradually between Spring Hill and Spring Terrace. There were three private sidings between Spring Hill and Cadia; 'Spring Terrace'‚Äîat a location to the west of the modern-day village, approximately 4 miles along the line‚Äî'Summit' approximately 5.5 miles along the line, and 'Cadia Road', 'Summit' was described as a 'staging siding' and was at the bottom of a relative steep grade towards Spring Hill and before the beginning of the long decline to Cadia. The last five miles to Cadia decreased in elevation at an average gradient of 1 in 55 and had many curves. The line terminated on the eastern side of Cadiangullong Creek and the northern side of Cadia Creek‚Äîabout three-quarters of a mile from the ore quarry and one and a half miles from the town‚Äîat the location of the powerhouse. The line could go no farther due to the steep-sided valley. Ore from the quarry was carried by an aerial ropeway, across the valley to the loading point for the trains. The line was laid in 80lb. rails, most likely rolled by G. & C. Hoskins at their Lithgow steelworks.  Private operation (1918‚Äì1928)  The line was completed in September 1918 and officially opened on 17 February 1919. It was a goods line, with iron ore traffic predominating. From 1918 to 1929, 1,682,000 tons of iron ore was mined from a surface deposit known as 'Iron Duke'. During this period, trains consisting of four-wheeled coal wagons‚Äîeach holding 16 tons of iron ore‚Äîwere hauled by a privately-owned 4-6-4 tank locomotive‚Äîalso 'Iron Duke'‚Äîfrom Cadia to exchange sidings at Spring Hill. From these exchange sidings, the same wagons were hauled by N.S.W.G.R., to Lithgow or‚Äîduring part of 1928‚ÄîPort Kembla. Locomotives could not be turned around at Cadia and ran in reverse toward Spring Hill. In 1921, there were four trains per day operating over the line. As well as the iron ore from Cadia, grain was loaded at the siding at Spring Terrace and wool elsewhere. The line also brought in coal for the powerhouse‚Äîpresumably back loaded from Lithgow‚Äîand goods from Sydney for the town of Cadia and other sidings on the line. Trains could consist of both ore wagons and goods wagons. On at least one occasion, an excursion train carrying passengers ran over the line. Otherwise, if trains carried passengers, it was unofficially. There were at least two accidents on the line, due to runaway wagons.  First closure, wartime reopening, and final closure  Iron ore mining at Cadia ended, around time of the relocation of blast furnace operations from Lithgow to Port Kembla in late 1928, and the branch line also closed. There was insufficient other traffic on the line to justify the N.S.W. Government taking over the operation of the line. The line was abandoned but the rails remained in place. The line was remediated and reopened in 1941. A shortage of shipping, under wartime conditions, made it sensible to mine local sources of iron ore in New South Wales, rather than rely upon ore carried by sea from South Australia. Cadia was among the largest of these local iron ore deposits and the branch line allowed its ore to be transported to Port Kembla. During this second period of operation, all operations were carried out by the N.S.W.G.R. Cadia could not re-enter production immediately; the old aerial ropeway was beyond repair and a new, inclined, cable-hauled skipway and 15-miles of power lines had to be installed. Iron ore production at Cadia recommenced in late 1942. Once mining of iron ore ceased in 1945, the rail line closed in August 1945 and the tracks were lifted.  Remnants  The formation of the old branch line is visible in places, including alongside the southern side of Forest Road near Spring Hill and is discernible in aerial views over most of its route. Although the Cadia line has long closed, gold-copper concentrate from the modern-day Cadia- Ridgeway Mine is still shipped by rail from Blayney on the Main Western Line to Port Kembla, after being pumped as a slurry through a pipeline from the mine site at Cadia.

The first ascent of this peak was made in 1934 by Hermann Ulrichs and three companions. This mountain's name was officially adopted September 8, 1988, by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Some older maps will have this peak erroneously labeled as Bald Eagle Peak. Climate Bald Eagle Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

It is located on the east of the Bulega mining region and the western slope of the Mitumba mountain range. As of 2012, it had an estimated population of 13,995.  History  Gold deposits in the Kamituga region were first discovered in the 1920s with the discovery of alluvial gold in the Luliaba, Mobale, Kahushimira, Kamakundu and Idoka rivers, but no commercial gold exploitation really had started until the 1930s when Belgian company 'Mini√®re des Grands Lacs Africains' or Great Lakes Mining Company (MGL) started commercial gold exploitation. From there MGL started to do a large recruitment campaign in the local Orientale Province and later in 1932 the Costermansville province. Belgian Congo provinces in 1920 Throughout the 1960s artisanal mining started to gradually expand in Kamituga. The company's workers realized they could sell gold in an informal trading system, instead of handing it over to the company for a low salary. For MGL, it was difficult to halt such ‚Äòillegal‚Äô activities as artisanal miners and traders were to a certain extent protected by local political and customary elites. The problem with the artisanal miners only grew bigger, as both the search for economic opportunities and the hope to get access to social services fueled Kamituga‚Äôs population growth. MGL also faced other challenges. In 1965 Mobutu took control of the state in a coup. Throughout the following decade, Mobutu‚Äôs economic policies (Zairianisation and radicalization measures), coupled with the instability of world mineral prices, led to a persistent economic crisis. Making the already existing mining companies restructure their activities. On December 25, 1960, during the Congo Crisis, the town of became under the control of the Free Republic of the Congo until 1962 when the Free Republic of the Congo was brought back into the Republic of the Congo. Though during the short rule of the Free Republic of the Congo in southern Kivu many Europeans were robbed, beaten, and harassed, with many choosing to flee the area, while over 200 Congolese were killed. UN peacekeepers were unable to contain the violence. Then in late 1963, it went under the control of the Simba rebellion up until May 1965 when the Republic of the Congo retook most of South Kivu. In March 1976, MGL merged into SOMINKI (Soci√©t√© Mini√®re et Industrielle du Kivu) with 8 other mining companies. This new company invested a lot in the town, employing about 2,000 to 3,000 workers, constructing local infrastructures, and providing social services at major mining sites. Even with what the SOMINKI did, the informal trade in minerals continued to grow incessantly and boomed after 1982, when Mobutu liberalized the exploitation and trade in minerals. While rural populations were massively drawn towards mining areas, industrial mineral production strongly declined due to a combination of failed economic policies, decaying infrastructure and fluctuating world mineral prices. Just before the first and second Congo war the Canadian mining company Banro started to show interest in taking over SOMINKI‚Äôs failing gold mining sites. In 1997, SOMINKI was liquidated and its 13 exploitation permits for the Twangiza, Kamituga, Lugushwa and Namoya properties, were transferred to Banro. During both of the Congo wars, industrial production came to a standstill, which allowed artisanal mining to continue to expand even more. A sense some security in the town and the hope to find economic opportunities in the informal mineral trade intensified the migration from rural areas to Kamituga, which saw its population more than double over the course of the wars. In the years of turmoil, Kamituga was occupied by several armed groups which benefitted from the informal mineral sector by setting up systems of taxation for artisanal miners and traders. The occupying forces included the Rwandan Patriotic Front in 1996, the AFDL later in 1996, the Congolese Rally for Democracy from 1999 to 2003 and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After coming to power in 1997, President Laurent Kabila chose not to honour the agreement between Banro and SOMINKI. Instead, he created SOMICO (Societ√© Mini√®re du Congo), which replaced SOMINKI and occupied the former offices in Kamituga. Banro tried to reclaim its concessions through legal mechanisms and, in 2002, finally reached a new agreement with president Joseph Kabila, who came to power after his father was murdered. Banro thus regained the right to exploit minerals in the gold concessions of Twangiza, Kamituga, Lugushwa and Namoya. In June 2013, the urban area of Kamituga was given the status of a city, made up of two municipalities: Bitanga and Mobale. Today almost all of Kamituga's economy depends on the money that is generated from the artisanal mining sector. With the large majority of the population in Kamituga being either directly or indirectly dependent on mining the activities.  Geography  It is located on the RN 2 national road, 164 km (101.9 miles) southwest of the provincial capital Bukavu and 45 km (27.9) west of the territorial capital Mwenga.  Climate  According to the K√∂ppen- Geiger climate classification system, Kamituga has the tropical savanna climate (Aw). It is usually very warm, humid and rainy all year round. The summers there has a good deal of rainfall, while the winters have very little.  Education  Kamituga universities: Free University of Mwenga in Kamituga, Kamituga Higher Pedagogical Institute, Kamituga Higher Institute of Buildings and Public Works.  Transportation  Kamituga is served by the Kamituga Airport. It consists of a 750-meter long gravel airstrip and a small building for waiting. Besides the Kamituga Airport, the only convenient way in and out of the city is the RN 2 national road.

Published in 1991, the work considers in depth several scenes and events from the author's life, from his father‚Äôs suicide through to his time spent as a visiting professor at Wheaton College.  Overview  Buechner introduces his third memoir by reflecting on the nature of autobiography. With reference to his first two autobiographical works, The Sacred Journey (1982) and Now and Then (1983), he asks: ‚ÄòAre the events I describe anything like the way they really happened? As I look back over them, I think I seen patterns, causal relationships, suggestions of meaning, that I was mostly unaware of at the time. Have I gotten them anything like right?‚Äô. These first two memoirs, he continues, ‚Äòdealt mainly with the headlines of my life‚Äô.Buechner, Frederick (1991). Telling Secrets: a memoir. New York: HarperSanFrancisco. p. 2. In Telling Secrets, Buechner determines to relate his ‚Äòinterior life‚Äô, which he likens to the ‚Äòback pages‚Äô of a newspaper: ‚Äòlike the back pages‚Äô, he writes, ‚Äòit is in the interior where the real news is.‚ÄôBuechner, Frederick (1991). Telling Secrets: a memoir. New York: HarperSanFrancisco. p. 2. Buechner begins by meditating on the effects of his father‚Äôs suicide in the November of 1936. Concerning the process of grief, the author writes that: ‚ÄòHis suicide was a secret we nonetheless tried to keep as best we could, and after a while my father himself became a such a secret. There were times when he almost seemed a secret we were trying to keep from each other.‚ÄôBuechner, Frederick (1991). Telling Secrets: a memoir. New York: HarperSanFrancisco. p. 8-9. Twenty-two years after the suicide, Buechner recounts his mother‚Äôs ‚Äòfury‚Äô at the ‚Äòbrief and fictionalized version‚Äô of the event that he included in his third novel, The Return of Ansel Gibbs (1958). Remembering his mother, the author proceeds to consider his own experience of parenthood, and the traumas of raising children through difficult circumstances, including a brush with anorexia nervosa. The memoir also includes reflections on the differing pluralistic and Evangelical cultures Buechner experienced while lecturing at Harvard Divinity SchoolBuechner, Frederick (1991). Telling Secrets: a memoir. New York: HarperSanFrancisco. p. 58. and Wheaton College,Buechner, Frederick (1991). Telling Secrets: a memoir. New York: HarperSanFrancisco. p. 78. and his recollection of the process of writing his eleventh novel, Brendan (1987).  Themes  Telling Secrets is replete with the themes often associated with the work of Frederick Buechner: faith and experience, suicide, and the extraordinary nature of the ordinary. The author‚Äôs chief preoccupation, continuing from his first two memoirs, is with cause and effect, and the possibility of the influence of God upon ordinary life. In the introduction, he writes: > This account in full of becauses. The question is, Have I actually > discovered them, or, after long practice as a novelist, have I simply made > them up? Have I concocted a plot out of what is only a story? Who knows? I > can say only that to me life in general, including my life in particular, > feels like a plot, and I find that a source both of strength and of > satisfaction.Buechner, Frederick (1991). Telling Secrets: a memoir. New > York: HarperSanFrancisco. p. 2. Commenting upon Buechner's memoirs, scholar Dale Brown writes that the autobiographical works ‚Äòillustrate Buechner‚Äôs theory of what he calls the ‚Äúsacred function of memory‚Äù ‚Äì the obliteration of the artificial designations of past, present, and future in order to reinhabit and reunderstand the moments of our lives.‚ÄôBrown, W.

The act was intended to \\"modernise and enhance the efficiency of the Scottish criminal justice system\\". Background In October 2010, following the ruling in Cadder v HM Advocate, a Supreme Court judgement ruling the lack of access to a solicitor in law for persons detained by police under section 14(1) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 unlawful, the Scottish Government asked the Lord President to nominate a single High Court judge to lead an independent review of Scottish criminal law and practice. The Lord President of the Court of Session at the time, Lord Hamilton, subsequently nominated Lord Carloway, who was himself appointed Lord President in 2015. The Carloway Review was subsequently published on 17 November 2011, and its recommendations led to the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill before the Scottish Parliament by Kenny MacAskill MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Justice for the Scottish Government on 20 June 2013. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 8 December 2015, and received royal assent on 6 April 2020. The Act came into force in various stages between 2016 and 2019, with subsequent amendments. Contents Part 1 of the Act reforms the powers of the police in Scotland in relation to arrest and detention. Previous common law powers of arrest and separate statutory powers of detention were replaced by section 1 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016, a single statutory power of arrest similar to section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in England and Wales. Section 3 provides that all persons arrested under section 1 are cautioned and told of the reason for their arrest. Part 1 of the act also ensured that all persons in police custody are provided with the right to access a solicitor, after the ruling in the case of Cadder v HM Advocate, which preceded the Carloway Review. Furthermore, section 50 of the Act places a duty onto the police to ensure that a person is not \\"unreasonably or unnecessarily held in police custody\\". Part 2 of the Act introduces new legislation in relation to the use of stop and search by police in Scotland. It abolishes a 'voluntary stop and search', where a person was able to voluntarily submit themselves to a stop and search by police. This police power had proved controversial in its use, particularly on children, in the years leading up to its abolition. The Act provides that police only have the power to stop and search any person in accordance with a legal power to do so or a warrant enabling them to do so. This was enshrined in the Code of Practice on the Exercise by Constables of Powers of Stop and Search of the Person in Scotland, brought into force by section 77 of the Act on 11 May 2017. The Act also fulfilled a promise by the Scottish Government to increase the maximum sentence for possession of an offensive weapon, as well as having an article with a blade or point, under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995.

The first international conference of carvers was held on 5 June 1895 in Nuremberg. It was attended by representatives of unions from Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, the Netherlands and Switzerland, while a French union sent a letter of support. The meeting resolves to campaign for a maximum eight-hour working day, for the abolition of piecework, and for each union to establish a fund to support industrial action. However, the unions decided against financially supporting each others' strike action, except in extreme circumstances. The Hungarian union proposed a system whereby representatives would be elected in each workplace, who would elect local committees, which in turn would elect national committees, who would select the members of a new international federation. This was voted down, as being too bureaucratic, and the proposal of the Central Union of Carvers of Germany was accepted, to have an international bureau it would host in Berlin, funded by correspondence commissions in each country, their fees in proportion to the number of members they represented. An international commission was established, led by Paul Dupont. It was unable to achieve much, hampered in particular by low membership in Switzerland, and disagreements with the French union, which did not join. In 1919, the German union merged into the German Wood Workers' Union, and the international commission similarly merged into the International Federation of Woodworkers.

( 1835-1924) was a noted British soldier. Born in Cartrun, County Roscommon, Ireland. In 1852 he was first commissioned into the 62nd Regiment and transferred into the 21st Regiment in 1854. He served in the Crimean War where he saw action at the battles of Alma, Balaclava and Inkerman and at the Siege of Sevastopol. In 1855 he became a Captain and served in the 99th Regiment of Foot in India. It was with this unit that he participated in 1860 in the notorious Second Opium War with China. As part of the plunder gained during the ransacking of the Summer Palace five lapdogs were seized. In April 1861 Captain Hart Dunne gifted one of these dogs, Looty, to Queen Victoria for the Royal Collection of dogs.. Hart Dunne thus became credited with the introduction of Pekinese dogs into Britain. A picture of Looty was painted for the Queen by Friedrich Wilhelm Keyl. Hart Dunne also received a replica of the picture. Promotions followed; In 1865 Lieutenant-Colonel, 1881 Major-General, 1889 Lieutenant-General in 1889, and 1893 General.

Preparation and structure  2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole has been known since the 19th century. It is readily prepared in at least 85% yield from o-phenylenediamine by reaction with two equivalents of thionyl chloride in pyridine. The by-products are sulfur dioxide and HCl. :400px There are a number of alternative methods used to make this heterocycle and these have been reviewed. The crystal structure of the compound was determined in 1951, when it had the common name piazthiol(e).  Reactions  The extent of the aromaticity of the compound was examined by a study of its proton NMR spectrum and comparison with naphthalene, which allowed the conclusion that it and related oxygen and selenium heterocycles did behave as 10-electron systems in which the 2-heteroatom contributed its lone pair to the ring current, in accordance with H√ºckel's rule. As a result, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole undergoes the standard chemistry of aromatic compounds, for example readily forming nitro and chloro derivatives. The chemistry of this heterocycle and its simple derivatives has been reviewed. Under reducing conditions, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles can be converted back to the 1,2-diaminobenzene compounds from which they were prepared. This can be a useful way to protect a pair of reactive amino groups while other transformations are performed in the benzene ring to which they are attached. Applications 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole has been of interest as a redox-active organic component in flow batteries owing to its favourable solubility, low reduction potential and fast electrochemical kinetics. Such properties in derivatives containing this heterocycle have made it of growing interest in dyestuffs, white light-emitting polymers, solar cells, and in luminescence studies.

It is about elemental beings and their place in a Christian cosmology. Background Paracelsus, portrait from 1540 by Augustin Hirschvogel A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on the Other Spirits was written by Paracelsus (1493/1494 ‚Äì 1541) late in his life, but it is not known what exact year it is from. The descriptions of elemental beings are based on various ancient and traditional sources, which the author adapted and reinterpreted. Summary Paracelsus argues from his reading of the Biblical creation narrative that man needs to use philosophy to gain knowledge about the natural world, or he will not be able to understand Christ and appreciate the Bible. The natural world contains many strange things, including elemental beings corresponding to the four classical elements: nymphs (water), sylphs (air), pygmies (earth) and salamanders (fire). He dismisses the conventional Christian view that elemental beings are devils, instead arguing that they are significant parts of God's creation, and studies them like he studied the rest of the natural world. Publication Like Paracelsus' other theological works, A Book on Nymphs was published posthumously, first appearing as a separate print in 1566 and the year after in a collection of the author's philosophical writings. After that it has appeared in a number of collections of Paracelsus' works. An English translation by Henry E. Sigherist appears in Four Treatises of Theophrastus von Hohenheim Called Paracelsus, published by Johns Hopkins University Press in 1941 and republished in 1996. Legacy The fairy-tale like quality of the treatise has made it a popular source of inspiration for poets and fiction writers. It was the main source for the descriptions of elementals in the 1670 work Comte de Gabalis, which in turn has influenced writers such as Alexander Pope, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√©, Charles Baudelaire and Anatole France. The dramatist Jean Giraudoux explicitly states his debt to Paracelsus in the preface to his 1938 play Ondine.

History  In 1930‚Äì1932, Harvard Professor William Ernest Hocking led the Commission of Appraisal, which studied the foreign mission work of six mainline Protestant denominations in India, Burma, China, and Japan. Their missionaries had been at work in Asia for a century but now were experiencing falling donations and nationalistic resistance. The Commission's report, Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's Inquiry After One Hundred Years (1932) reflected changing ideas about the wisdom of a reduced role for western missionaries, which generated fierce debate. Commission members traveled to Asian cities to meet missionaries and local people. While in China, Hocking consulted with the famous writer Pearl S. Buck, who was developing a similar critique of missions and who threw her support behind the Commission's report. The Commission recommended a greater emphasis on education and welfare, transfer of power to local groups, less reliance on evangelizing, with respectful appreciation for local religions. A recommended related goal was the transition of local leadership and institutions. The Commission also recommended reorganization in the US to coordinate and focus missionary efforts by creating a single organization for Protestant missions.

The bulk of the collection, the Papers of Patrick Leigh Fermor, was purchased by the National Library of Scotland (NLS) in 2012 from Fermor's estate, using funds donated by the John R. Murray Charitable Trust, and is housed at the Library's main building on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was made available to the general public in November 2014.  History  Leigh Fermor had many careers and interests over the course of his life, and left behind a vast collection of papers, many of which are now held within the Archive. He played a prominent role behind the lines in the Cretan resistance during World War II and it was widely regarded as Britain's greatest living travel writer during his lifetime, based on books such as The Broken Road (2013) and A Time of Gifts (1977).  Composition of the Papers of Patrick Leigh Fermor  The Patrick Leigh Fermor Archive contains materials dating back to 1934, the year Fermor purchased his first passport, to 2011 when he died. It consists of various papers relating to his life and travels, including letters between him and poet Sir John Betjeman. Correspondence between Fermor and his publisher John Murray VI is also included within the archive, as is the only surviving notebook from his trek across Europe in 1933. Cataloguing the collection took over a year and it has been arranged into nine categories by its curators.  Correspondence  This series is mostly made up of correspondence between Patrick Fermor and his wife, Joan Leigh Fermor (5 February 1912 - 4 June 2003), though there are also several personal letters to and from Fermor. The 500 letters written between him and Mairi Bostanzi from 1988 to 2010 can also be found in this section. Bostanzi helped to provide Fermor with new ideas for his writing in a similar way his friend and writing advisor Rudolf 'Rudi' Fischer (17 September 1923 - 18 February 2016) did. There are around 400 letters between Fischer and Fermor in the Archive, some of these include postcards and other miscellaneous materials. Financial and literary correspondence make up a small section of this series and includes items like bank statement and letters to his publishers. Fermor wrote letters to many politicians, military officials and state figures, such as Prince Charles and Virginia Tsouderou, these too are included in this series.  Literary manuscripts and typescripts  The literary manuscripts and typescripts in the Archive include both major published works and minor published and unpublished works, many of which have been annotated and corrected by Fermor himself, significant as it is demonstrative of his writing process. Bound manuscripts of Fermor's now published books are included here too, The Traveller's Tree (1950) being one of them. The minor works sub-series of this part of the Archive are further divided into Articles, Speeches and contributions to books, Book reviews, Forewords and introductions, Translations of works by others, Obituaries, memoirs and eulogies, Poems and jeux d'esprit, Translations of Patrick Leigh Fermor's works, and Other works by Patrick Leigh Fermor. There are various press cuttings and other printed materials to be found in this series as well.  Works by others concerning Patrick Leigh Fermor  This series contains mainly of articles and reviews in various languages about Fermor and his works. Also included here are fragments of an interview he had with Ben Downing along with some letters exchanged between the two (2000 - 2008) and a copy of Downing's Philhellene's Progress: Patrick Leigh Fermor written in 2001. Fermor's Curriculum Vitae can be found here as well.  Research files  The research files have been divided into three subseries entitled Other authors' works, Patrick and Joan Leigh Fermor family and personal history research files, and Friends and personal interests research files. Contained within each of these are manuscript and typescript drafts and printed items, though of particular note are the 'India letters' - correspondence written from the family to Amy Ambler, Fermor's maternal grandmother. Obituaries and memoirs by other writers can also be found in this series, as well as a wide range of miscellaneous printed items, press cuttings and photocopies.  World War II  This series contains many manuscripts and typescript drafts, as well as printed items, by Fermor and those who knew him. Much of the material found within this section is in Greek. There are many items here which concern the abduction of General Kreipe, including annotated manuscripts and typescripts of Fermor's Abducting a General. Abducting a General was an article commissioned in 1966 by Barrie Pitt and was initially only meant to be 5000 words in length. It ended up growing to over 32000 words and was published posthumously in 2014 as Abducting a General: The Kreipe Operation and SOE in Crete. Also included in the World War II series is a notable amount of materials relating to Ill-Met by Moonlight which include the film itself, related press cuttings, a video cassette tape of its original broadcast, plus interviews with Fermor and other people who worked on the film. This section also contains war reports and articles and speeches by Fermor to do with the war in Crete.  Personal papers of Patrick Leigh Fermor  Personal effects such as passports and diaries can be found in this series of the Archive. Ten of Fermor's passports are included here dated from 1934 (his first passport) until 2013, two years after he died. There are over twenty diaries in this section two, spanning nearly fifty years. His journals, address books and notebooks are located here as well, as are other miscellaneous items such as award certificates and a map of Romania and North Bulgaria (1913), used by Fermor on his trek from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople (1934) with annotations made later.

She was a large cruiser submarine that entered service in 1935 and served in the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. During the latter conflict she operated in support of the attack on Pearl Harbor, torpedoed the aircraft carrier , conducted anti-shipping patrols in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, and took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign and New Guinea campaign before she was sunk in June 1944. Design, construction, and commissioning I-6 was the only Junsen II- (or \\"J2\\"-) type submarine. After the four Junsen I-type submarines (, , , and ), the Japanese had built as a modified Junsen I, introducing an aviation capability to the Junsen type with the inclusion of a hangar that allowed I-5 to carry and operate a floatplane. I-6 represented the next step in the evolution of this aviation capability, as she had both a hangar and a catapult for a floatplane. The next and last Junsen-type submarines, and , the only Junsen III-type submarines, also each had a hangar and catapult for a floatplane. Built by Kawasaki at Kobe, Japan, I-6 was laid down on 14 October 1932. She was launched on 31 March 1934 and was completed and commissioned on 15 May 1935. Service history=Early service Upon commissioning, I-6 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District. She was taking part in maneuvers off Ise Bay on 1 August 1935 when she collided with the destroyer at 14:27. She suffered damage to her periscopes and proceeded to Yokosuka for repairs. In July 1936, I-6 embarked a Watanabe E9W1 (Allied reporting name \\"Slim\\") reconnaissance seaplane for testing purposes. Second Sino-Japanese War On 7 July 1937 the first day of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. In September 1937 Submarine Squadron 1 was reassigned to the 3rd Fleet,Boyd and Yoshida, p. 54. which in turn was subordinated to the China Area Fleet for service in Chinese waters. The squadron, consisting of I-6 and her sister ships , , , , and , deployed to a base at Hong Kong with the submarine tenders and in September 1937. From Hong Kong, the submarines began operations in support of a Japanese blockade of China and patrols of China‚Ä≤s central and southern coast. From 21 to 23 August 1937, all six submarines of Submarine Squadron 1 operated in the East China Sea as distant cover for an operation in which the battleships , , , and and the light cruiser ferried troops from Tadotsu, Japan, to Shanghai, China. Submarine Squadron 1 was based at Hong Kong until the autumn of 1938. In an effort to reduce international tensions over the conflict in China, Japan withdrew its submarines from Chinese waters in December 1938. 1939‚Äì1941 In mid-1940, I-6‚Ä≤s hangar and catapult were removed, and thereafter she did not operate aircraft. Submarine Squadron 2, including I-6, was resubordinated to the 6th Fleet on 15 November 1940. On 10 November 1941 ‚Äî by which time I-4, I-5, I-6, and the submarine made up Submarine Division 8 in Submarine Squadron 2 in the 6th Fleet, with I-7 serving as squadron flagship ‚Äî the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Mitsumi Shimizu, gathered the commanding officers of the fleet‚Ä≤s submarines together for a meeting aboard his flagship, the light cruiser , which was anchored in Saeki Bay. Shimizu briefed them on the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor, which would bring Japan and the United States into World War II. As the Imperial Japanese Navy began to deploy for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, I-4, I-5, I-6, and I-7 got underway from Yokosuka at 13:00 on 16 November 1941, bound for the Hawaiian Islands. The submarines received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. World War IIFirst war patrol= On 7 December 1941, the submarines of Submarine Squadron 2 took up patrol stations across a stretch of the Pacific Ocean from northeast to northwest of Oahu. The submarines had orders to conduct reconnaissance in the area and attack any ships which sortied from Pearl Harbor during or after the attack, which occurred that morning. I-6‚Ä≤s patrol area was between those of I-4 and I-5 and was located off the northern entrance of Kaiwi Channel between Molokai and Oahu. At 08:40 on 9 December 1941, I-6 sighted the United States Navy aircraft carrier ‚Äî which she misidentified as a ‚Äî and two heavy cruisers north of Molokai steaming northeast at . She attempted to attack Enterprise, but was forced to go deep before she could. Several hours later she managed to transmit a sighting report, which resulted in the Japanese ordering nine submarines to attempt to intercept Enterprise, which they assumed was bound for the United States West Coast. Out of position to participate in the pursuit of Enterprise, I-6 was ordered to take up a new patrol area south of Oahu in waters between the Kauai Channel and an area southeast of Pearl Harbor. Later in December, one of her torpedomen was injured during a routine torpedo inspecton; he died several days later of sepsis on 27 December 1941 and was buried at sea. On 9 January 1942, the submarine reported sighting a Lexington-class aircraft carrier northeast of Johnston Island, and the 6th Fleet ordered a number of submarines including I-1 to form a picket line northeast of Johnston Island to find the carrier. When I-1 developed engine trouble, I-6 received orders to replace her in the picket line. During the daylight hours of 10 January 1942, I-6‚Ä≤s lookouts sighted planes from the carrier on five separate occasions, and her navigator plotted their courses and used the information to estimate the carrier‚Ä≤s position. While on the surface northeast of Johnston Island at 18:41 on 11 January 1942, she sighted a U.S. Navy destroyer and submerged. Not long afterwards, the aircraft hove into view at , steaming southeast at and accompanied by a heavy cruiser and another destroyer. I-6 fired three Type 89 torpedoes at Saratoga at a range of , and at 19:15 one of them hit Saratoga amidships on her port side, killing six firemen and flooding three boiler rooms. Taking on 1,100 tons of water, Saratoga heeled to starboard and then to port and lost headway. I-6 went to a depth of , and when the escorting destroyers began a counterattack at 19:58, they could not locate her. Her sound operator reported hearing two large explosions followed by a number of smaller ones which suggested that Saratoga had sunk and was breaking up on her way to the bottom, and after 22:00 I-6 transmitted a report claiming two hits on, and the probable sinking of, a Lexington-class aircraft carrier. In fact, Saratoga survived, but the damage I-6 inflicted kept her out of combat for the next six months. On 12 January 1942, I-6 departed her patrol area bound for Kwajalein, which she reached on 22 January 1942 with only of fuel left. She got back underway on 24 January 1942 bound for Yokosuka, which she reached on 2 February 1942. She was drydocked in early February 1942 and began a refit and overhaul. =Second war patrol= While I-6 was at Yokosuka, Submarine Squadron 2 ‚Äî consisting of I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-6, and the squadron flagship, I-7 ‚Äî was assigned to the Dutch East Indies Invasion Force in the Southeast Area Force on 8 February 1942. On 13 February, the staff of Submarine Division 8 transferred from I-6 to I-4, and I-6 departed Yokosuka on 14 February 1942 bound for the Netherlands East Indies. She arrived at Staring Bay on the Southeast Peninsula of Celebes just southeast of Kendari on 22 February 1942. At 07:00 on 23 February 1942, she got back underway in company with I-4 and I-5 to begin her second war patrol, bound for a patrol area in the Indian Ocean west of Sumatra. While I-5 and I-6 were on the surface west of Timor en route their patrol areas on 25 February 1942, an Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi C5M (Allied reporting name \\"Babs\\") reconnaissance aircraft escorted by nine Mitsubishi A6M Zero (Allied reporting name \\"Zeke\\") fighters sighted the vessels at 12:30 Japan Standard Time and misidentified them as Royal Netherlands Navy submarines. The Zeroes made repeated strafing attacks that forced I-6 to submerge, but she suffered no damage. Her patrol otherwise was uneventful, and she concluded it with her arrival at Penang in Japanese- occupied British Malaya on 8 March 1942. =Third war patrol= Orders arrived from the headquarters of the Combined Fleet for all the submarines of Submarine Squadron 2 except for I-1 to conduct reconnaissance operations along the coast of Ceylon and western coast of India in preparation for Operation C, the upcoming Indian Ocean raid by the aircraft carriers of the Combined Fleet‚Ä≤s Mobile Force. Accordingly, I-6 departed Penang on 26 March 1942 to begin her third war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Indian Ocean west of Bombay, India, and north of the Maldive Islands. On 27 March, the German naval staff in Berlin asked that Japan begin anti-shipping operations against Allied convoys in the Indian Ocean. At 16:35 on 31 March 1942, I-6 was in the Indian Ocean off Eight Degree Channel when she sighted an Allied steamer. She commenced an approach and was about to fire torpedoes when she identified the ship as a hospital ship ‚Äî probably the British hospital ship on a voyage from Addu Atoll to the Ceylon area ‚Äî and called off the attack. On the afternoon of 2 April 1942, I-6 was in the Arabian Sea southwest of Bombay when she sighted the British 5,897-ton steamer , which was on her way from Liverpool, England, to Cochin, India, carrying 3,655 tons of general cargo and 1,027 tons of explosives. She fired two torpedoes at a range of , scoring one hit amidships on Clan Ross‚Ä≤s port side. Clan Ross sank by the stern at 14:14 at with the lost of 11 crew members killed and three injured. I-6 surfaced and approached the survivors. I-6‚Ä≤s crew interrogated the survivors, provided them with fresh water and biscuits, and gave them the bearing to Bombay, then lined up on I-6‚Ä≤s afterdeck, saluted the survivors, and wished them \\"bon voyage\\" in broken French. While on the surface at around 16:00 on 7 April 1942, I-6 encountered the British 5,424-ton merchant ship Bahadur ‚Äî bound from Bombay to Basra, Iraq, with a cargo of 5,100 tons of government stores and ammunition ‚Äî in the Arabian Sea northwest of Bombay. I-6 submerged and fired torpedoes, but Bahadur‚Ä≤s crew spotted them and Bahadur made a hard turn to starboard, evaded the torpedoes, and attempted to open the range at top speed. I-6 fired two torpedoes from her stern torpedo tubes, but they also missed. She then surfaced and pursued Bahadur, opening fire with her deck gun at a range of . The gun jammed after firing only one round, and I-6 submerged and gave up the chase. Bahadur suddenly stopped, however, and lowered her lifeboats. I-6 closed and fired two more torpedoes from a position on Bahadur‚Ä≤s port beam. Bahadur sank by the stern at 19:20 at . I-6 surfaced in the Arabian Sea southwest of Bombay after 08:15 on 10 April 1942 to attack two 150-ton dhows with her deck gun, claiming both of them sunk. Her patrol ended with her arrival at Seletar, Singapore, on 17 April 1942. She departed Singapore on 21 April 1942 in company with I-5 to head for Yokosuka, which she reached on 1 May 1942. She underwent repairs there until 6 June 1942. =Fourth war patrol= While I-6 was at Yokosuka, the Aleutian Islands campaign began on 3‚Äì4 June 1942 with a Japanese air raid on Dutch Harbor, Alaska, followed quickly by the unopposed Japanese occupation in the Aleutian Islands of Attu on 5 June and Kiska on 7 June 1942. On 10 June 1942, I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-5, I-6, and I-7 were reassigned to the Northern Force for duty in the Aleutians, and on either 17 or 20 June 1942 I-6 set out for Aleutian waters to begin her fourth war patrol. She joined the \\"K\\" patrol line in the Unimak Pass area. On 7 July 1942, she received orders to move to the Kiska area. When the rest of Submarine Squadron was ordered to return to Japan on 20 July 1942, she was ordered to remain behind and operate from Kiska. On 29 July 1942, a Kawanishi H6K flying boat (Allied reporting name \\"Mavis\\") reported an American seaplane tender at Natan Bay on the coast of Adak Island. I-6 went to investigate, but found nothing. She was anchored off Kiska along with the submarines , , and when the cruisers and destroyers of U.S. Navy Task Group 8.6 bombarded the island and harbor on 7 August 1942. All four submarines submerged to avoid damage, and some of them set off in pursuit of the task group after the shelling ceased, but none succeeded in finding the withdrawing American ships. On 15 August 1942, I-6 received orders to return to Japan, and she got underway from Kiska the same day. While she was at sea, both Submarine Squadron 2 and Submarine Division 8 were disbanded, and she and I-5 were reassigned to Submarine Division 7. She arrived at Yokosuka on 23 August 1942 and began an overhaul. =August 1942‚ÄìFebruary 1943= While I-6 was at Kiska, the six-month Guadalcanal campaign began on 7 August 1942 with U.S. amphibious landings on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Florida Island, Gavutu, and Tanambogo in the southeastern Solomon Islands. As the campaign wore on, the Japanese decided to use submarines to supply their forces fighting on Guadalcanal and began fitting the submarines involved in the supply runs with a mounting on their decks that allowed each of them to carry a waterproofed Daihatsu-class landing craft for the discharge of cargo along coastlines in the Solomon Islands. I-6 received a Daihatsu mounting during her overhaul, but was still in Japan when Operation Ke, the evacuation of Japanese forces on Guadalcanal, was completed on 7 February 1943, bringing the Guadalcanal campaign to an end. With her overhaul complete, I-6 departed Yokosuka at 10:00 on 16 February 1943 carrying a Daihatsu. She arrived at Truk at 10:15 on 23 February 1943, and later that day the commander of Submarine Squadron 7 came aboard to inspect her. On 26 February 1943 she debarked her Daihatsu and took on fuel, supplies, and ammunition from Hie Maru. She departed her anchorage at 08:00 on 28 February 1943, made a test cruise off Uman Island, and returned at 15:00. =Fifth war patrol= On 2 March 1943, I-6 got underway from Truk for her fifth war patrol, tasked with laying nine German-made TMC magnetic mines off Brisbane, Australia, and patrolling in the South Pacific Ocean off the east coast of Australia. On 4‚Äì5 March 1943, she transited St. George's Channel off New Ireland southbound. On 8 March 1943, Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne (FRUMEL), an American-Australian-British signals intelligence unit headquartered at Melbourne, Australia, decrypted a Japanese message ‚Äî probably one transmitted on 2 March ‚Äî that revealed I-6‚Ä≤s departure. By 12:00 on 11 March 1943, I-6 was northeast of Brisbane. At 17:15 that day she sighted a 10,000-ton Allied merchant ship ‚Äî probably a Liberty shipPowell, p. 12. ‚Äî and at 18:44 fired two torpedoes at long range, which both missed. The merchant ship apparently did not sight the torpedo wakes and did not report an attack. On 12 March 1943, I-6 conducted a reconnaissance of Moreton Bay, Caloundra Head, and the approaches to Brisbane to determine a good location to lay her mines. At 12:00 on 13 March 1943, she was northeast of Caloundra Head at , and that evening between 18:50 and 19:14, using a device that allowed her to eject mines via her forward torpedo tubes, she laid all nine mines within of the Australian coast along a line at depths of in what her commanding officer believed was a shipping lane. She then withdrew into the open ocean, and later that evening transmitted a report of her activities. FRUMEL intercepted and partially decrypted her message, learning that a Japanese submarine had laid nine mines somewhere along the east coast of Australia, but not the location of the mines because of code words I-6 had used to describe their locations. An attempt to determine the submarine‚Ä≤s position at the time of the transmission using triangulation yielded nothing more precise than a nearly useless circle. FRUMEL's reporting prompted instructions to coastal artillery forces to watch for a Japanese submarine and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) stepped up its patrol efforts along the east coast of Australia, using Avro Anson and Bristol Beaufort aircraft. I-6 was forced to remain submerged during daylight hours by the increased RAAF activity,Powell, p. 13. but she patrolled uneventfully between Fraser Island and Stradbroke Island from 14 to 16 March 1943. At 12:00 on 17 March 1943 she was southeast of Sandy Cape at . At 14:30 she sighted the two-ship Convoy BT-44 ‚Äî which consisted of the armed Liberty ships and escorted by the Royal Australian Navy minesweeper-corvette ‚Äî just north of Point Cartwright. She fired two Type 89 torpedoes at Charles C. Jones at long range at 15:07, and at 15:11 Charles C. Jones sighted their wakes passing astern of her. Charles C. Jones and Joseph Holt, which both turned to avoid the torpedoes, opened fire to alert Gympie. An Anson of the RAAF‚Ä≤s No. 71 (Reserve) Squadron patrolling overhead also sighted the wakes and dropped a sea marker at I-6‚Ä≤s presumed location. Gympie and the Anson then searched for I-6 until 15:30, and the Anson dropped a depth charge at 15:32, but I-6 escaped unscathed. At 20:22, she transmitted a situation report which FRUMEL intercepted and partly decrypted, and as a result two U.S. Navy patrol vessels arrived in the area and searched for her until sunset on 18 March 1943, but without success. I-6 was off Cape Byron on 21 March 1943 when she received orders to depart her patrol area and proceed to Rabaul. She sent a situation report at 19:33 that evening which FRUMEL partially decrypted. The Allied interception of I-6‚Ä≤s enciphered communications had led the U.S. Navy to order three submarines ‚Äî , , and ‚Äî to lie in wait for I-6 during her patrol, but none of them sighted her,Boyd and Yosida, pp. 113‚Äì114. and she arrived at Rabaul at 07:30 on 27 March 1943. Unfortunately for the Japanese, I-6‚Ä≤s comanding officer lacked adequate intelligence on Allied shipping patterns when I-6 laid her mines, which were planted in an area rarely visited by Allied ships. They went unnoticed until 24 March 1943, when the Royal Australian Navy sloop-of-war visited the area to conduct antiaircraft gunnery practice, firing at a target towed by an RAAF Lockheed Hudson. As spent shells and shell fragments fell into the water, Swan observed two large explosions close aboard which reached in height and across their bases. At least two mines clearly had exploded, and the size of the explosions suggested that each of them separately may have represented the detonation of two mines, although Allied forces could not substantiate this possibility. Gympie arrived in the area and began a minesweeping effort that after a number of days detonated another mine, but repeated sweeping found no more by the time minesweeping operations ended in September 1943. The mines were designed to rest on the seafloor and were not fixed in place, meaning that they could slide or roll if laid on sloping surfaces, and the Allies found the mines in a somewhat different location ‚Äî offshore in waters deep ‚Äî than I-6 reported laying them. =New Guinea campaign= While I-6 was on patrol, a Japanese attempt to carry supplies and reinforcements to New Guinea for their forces fighting in the New Guinea campaign in a convoy of eight ships escorted by eight destroyers ended in disaster in the Bismarck Sea when Allied aircraft sank all eight ships and four of the destroyers in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, fought from 2 to 4 March 1943. The Japanese decided to use submarines instead to carry supplies and troops to New Guinea. Accordingly, on 29 March 1943 I-6 was reassigned to the Southeast Area Fleet for duty running supplies to Lae on the coast of New Guinea. She got underway from Rabaul for her first supply run on 3 April 1943, carrying 30 passengers and 77 supply drums containing 3.3 tons of weapons and ammunition, 22 tons of clothing, and 15.4 tons of food. She arrived at Lae on the coast of New Guinea on 5 April 1943, where she disembarked her passengers and discharged her cargo onto Daihatsus. She brought aboard four Imperial Japanese Army soldiers who were taking the regimental colors of the 41st Infantry Regiment to Rabaul and 25 other passengers and departed for Rabaul. Shortly after her departure she sighted Allied motor torpedo boats, but she crash-dived and avoided them and arrived safely at Rabaul on 7 April 1943. I-6 next called at Lae on 11 April 1943, unloading 26 passengers and 77 supply drums containing 4.4 tons of weapons and ammunition, 19 tons of clothing, and food and embarking 42 passengers for Rabaul. On her third supply run, she visited Lae on 17 April 1943, discharging 28 passengers and 77 supply drums containing four tons of weapons and ammunition and 17 tons of clothing. After embarking 39 passengers, she got back underway for Rabaul. She sighted Allied motor torpedo boats near the Tami Islands during the return trip, but submerged and avoided them. While at Rabaul, she was reassigned on 21 April 1943 to the Northern District Force in the 5th Fleet to support the supply and reinforcement of the Japanese garrisons on Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands. I-6‚Ä≤s redeployment to the North Pacific was deferred, and for the time being she continued her supply runs between Rabaul and Lae. On her fourth run, she delivered 20 passengers and supply drums containing one ton of ammunition, 16 tons of clothing, and 16 tons of food on 24 April 1943 and left for Rabaul with 42 passengers aboard. She visited Lae on her fifth run on 30 April 1943 and dropped off 30 passengers and supply drums holding three tons of weapons and ammunition, 19 tons of clothing, and one ton of food. She embarked 41 passengers and put back to sea. At dawn she sighted Allied motor torpedo boats and spent an hour evading them, but she arrived safely at Rabaul. On her sixth run, she called at Lae on 7 May 1943 to deliver 10 passengers and 77 supply drums carrying 2.8 tons of weapons, four tons of artillery shells, and 13 tons of clothing and pick up 12 passengers. I-6‚Ä≤s seventh run was more eventful. She arrived at Lae on 13 May 1943, unloaded 10 passengers and supply drums containing 11.5 tons of weapons, five tons of ammunition, and nine tons of food. After embarking four passengers, she began her return trip to Rabaul. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Navy PT boats and sighted I-6 making on the surface off Lae at a range of . Each PT boat fired two torpedoes at I-6 at long range, but I-6 stopped and the torpedoes missed ahead of her. PT-150 then closed to and fired another torpedo at the stationary I-6, but the submarine suddenly accelerated and the torpedo missed astern. The PT boats then ran parallel to I-6‚Ä≤s course and turned toward her to decrease the range, but she submerged. The PT boats then stopped, and I-6 fired a torpedo at them, which passed under PT-150‚Ä≤s bow without detonating, bringing the action to a close. I-6 proceeded with her voyage to Rabaul, but on 14 May 1943 she diverted from it so that she and I-5 could search for the crews of Mitsubishi G4M (Allied reporting name \\"Betty\\") bombers shot down during a raid on Oro Bay. She rescued two aviators from the water off Buna, New Guinea. On her eighth run, I-6 called at Lae on 21 May 1943 to deliver 5.1 tons of weapons, 5.4 tons of ammunition, 4.6 tons of food, and 31 passengers. She departed for Rabaul after embarking 40 passengers. On her ninth and final run, she visited Lae on 28 May 1943 and dropped off 18 tons of food, 4.3 tons of weapons and medicine, two tons of clothes, a Daihatsu, and 23 passengers. Not scheduled to return to Rabaul, she did not embark passengers. She instead got back underway bound directly for Truk. Reassigned along with I-5 to the 6th Fleet while at sea on 31 May 1943, she stopped at Truk from 1 to 2 June 1943, then proceeded to Yokosuka, which she reached on 8 June 1943. She underwent repairs there. =Sixth and seventh war patrols= In the Aleutian Islands, the Japanese garrison on Attu had been annihilated by invading U.S. forces in the Battle of Attu between 11 and 30 May 1943. On 21 May 1943, with the situation on Attu deteriorating, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decided to evacuate the isolated garrison on Kiska. The evacuation began by submarine on 26 May 1943. Submarine Division 7 was reassigned to the 5th Fleet on 1 July 1943, and on either 1 or 2 July I-6 set out from Yokosuka on her sixth war patrol, bound for Paramushiro in the Kuril Islands. After calling at Paramushiro, she deployed to support the ongoing evacuation of Kiska, patrolling with I-5 in the Bering Sea north-northeast of Kiska. Between 17 and 19 July 1943, the two submarines sighted three U.S. destroyers on three separate occasions, but were unable to attack them. The Japanese completed the evacuation on 28 July 1943, and I-6 concluded her patrol with her arrival at Paramushiro on 4 August 1943. I-6 departed Paramushiro on 16 August 1943 for her seventh war patrol, assigned a patrol area off Kiska. The patrol was uneventful, and she returned to Paramushiro on 3 September 1943. She got back underway on 5 September 1943 and arrived on 10 September at Yokosuka, where she underwent repairs. =New Guinea and Bismarck Archipelago= On 25 October 1943, I-6 was reassigned to the Southeast Area Fleet to resume duties on supply runs to New Guinea and in the Bismarck Archipelago. On 30 October, she departed Yokosuka bound for Rabaul. From Rabaul, she began supply runs to Sio on the Huon Peninsula in New Guinea, calling at Sio on 16 November and 4 December 1943 without incident but coming under attack by Allied aircraft during her third visit on 18 December 1943 while unloading cargo; the attack forced her to depart before she could completely unload, and she returned to Rabaul with some cargo still aboard. She visited Sio for the fourth and final time on 27 December 1943 and early in the morning, just after she began her return voyage to Rabaul, she encountered Allied motor torpedo boats, which depth-charged her. Later that day, Allied aircraft attacked her. She emerged from both attacks unscathed, and on the same day received orders to intercept an Allied convoy. With only two torpedoes aboard, she patrolled in the Dampier Strait from 28 December 1943 to 1 January 1944, but did not find the Allied ships. On 4 January 1944, I-6 began a new series of supply runs, shuttling between Rabaul and Iboki, New Guinea. Her first and second round trips ‚Äî from 4 to 10 January 1944, calling at Iboki on 6 January, and from 17 to 21 January 1944, calling at Iboki on 19 January ‚Äî involved the delivery of supplies. On her third run, in which she departed Rabaul on 28 January 1944, she carried only troops, which she disembarked at Iboki on 30 January 1944, damaging her screws on an uncharted reef in the process. She returned to Rabaul on 1 February 1944, and on that day Submarine Division 7 was attached directly to 6th Fleet headquarters. Her next supply trip saw her depart Rabaul on 3 February 1944 to deliver supplies to Sarmi, New Guinea. She received orders on 5 February 1944 to return to Yokosuka. She got underway from Rabaul on 13 February 1944, called at Lorengau on Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands on 17 February 1944 to deliver a cargo of 12 heavy machine guns and their ammunition, then departed the same day for Yokosuka, which she reached on 29 February 1944 to begin an overhaul. =Loss= On 15 June 1944, the Marianas campaign began with the U.S. invasion of Saipan. Anticipating the invasion, on 13 June 1944 the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi, ordered all available Japanese submarines to deploy east of the Mariana Islands. With her overhaul recently completed, I-6 set out from Yokosuka bound for the waters off Saipan on 16 June 1944. At 22:33 that evening the Japanese 5,123-ton armed cargo ship Toyokawa Maru ‚Äî a member of Convoy 3606, consisting of four merchant ships escorted by three coastal defense ships and a submarine chaser, which had left Ogasawara in the Bonin Islands on 14 June 1944 bound for Yokosuka ‚Äî sighted I-6 surfacing near the convoy. Mistaking her for an enemy submarine, Toyokawa Maru sounded a submarine alert, turned sharply toward I-6, and rammed her on her starboard side just abaft her conning tower. I-6 listed heavily, capsized, and sank a few minutes later, and Toyokawa Maru followed up by dropping depth charges and machine gunning the water where I-6 sank. None of I-6‚Ä≤s crew of 104 survived. On 1 July 1944, the Japanese ordered I-6 to rescue Takagi and his staff from their headquarters on Saipan, which was threatened by advancing American forces. When I-6 did not acknowledge receipt of the message, the Japanese declared her missing. Sixth Fleet headquarters made a final attempt to contact her on 3 July 1944. Alternative accounts of the loss of I-6 claim that Toyokawa Maru sank her off Saipan on 30 June 1944, or that the destroyer escort and high-speed transport sank her west of Tinian at on 19 July 1944. I-6 was stricken from the Navy list on 10 September 1944. References=FootnotesBibliography *Boyd, Carl, and Akihiko Yoshida. The Japanese Submarine Force and World War II.

Early life and education  Curiel was born to Spanish Jewish parents who converted to Catholicism to protect their son. His father was Don Luis Francisco Curiel y Tejada, an influential diplomat and member of the Council of Castile. He received his formal education at the University of Salamanca in Salamanca, Castile and Le√≥n, but it is not known whether he received his doctorate.

On 8 February 1752, he was appointed as \\"Printing Judge\\". In this position, he had complete control of what was allowed to be printed in Spain. In this position, he drew up regulations and kept notoriously tight control over what was published, making sure that books fit into the enlightenment ideals. Whilst making many enemies, he has influential in the publishing of some of the most important books in the Spanish-speaking world.  Political career  On 3 September 1720, he received the Military Order of Calatrava, thanks to the services performed by his father, Luis Curiel. He was appointed head of the Seville Court on 24 March 1722, remaining in this position until his promotion to judgeship on 24 December 24 1729. After seventeen years in Seville, on 24 September 1739, he was appointed by Felipe V mayor of the House and Court. He had to delay his journey to Madrid to swear in the hands of the regent of the Seville Court by a commission entrusted to him by the monarch. He did not serve as mayor for long, becoming prosecutor of the Justice Chamber of the Finance Council on 15 May 1741. On 11 December 1745, he received the honour of councillor of the Council of Castile and, on 13 August 1746, the position of property councilor of Castile.

Description  Lake Galela is the largest freshwater lake on Halmahera. The lake was likely formed over time by various floods, volcanic eruptions, and ash flows. With the exception of a few shallow shores, the lake has a steep coastline surrounding it.Bellwood, P. (2019). Other explored but unexcavated sites. In Bellwood P.

Motorized boat traffic is banned on the lake (canoes and rafts are used instead), resulting in the lake maintaining its clear water. The lake has varying levels of biodiversity, and an environmental impact assessment of the lake showed that human activity has an effect on the local phytoplankton population. One source states that the lake has no shellfish. According to an April 2020 study, the increasing population of the Galela region threatens the lake's biodiversity.

Author Laura Gallego stated that it would cover the entire first volume La Resistencia (The Resistance). EpisodesControversy Laura Gallego, the writer of the books the series is based on, who also contributed in the show's development, wrote a short statement on her personal website objecting to the substitution of previously cast professional voice actors by more popular actors who, save for Michelle Jenner, generally lacked experience in dubbing. Critical reception Upon its debut, The Idhun Chronicles was met with mixed to negative reception among critics. Mikel Zorrilla of Espinof criticized the voice acting, advising readers to switch to the \\"much more consistent\\" English dub: \\"What really makes it difficult to take the story seriously is the disconnect among the voices. It's as if each of [the voice actors] gave it a different approach, without any kind of harmony among them, which makes even the very competent Michelle Jenner seem out of place because none of the other voices fit in, individually or as a whole.\\" He also stated: \\"Its possible grand spectacle nature is presented in a somewhat restrained way. At half throttle.\\" John Serba of Decider advised viewers to \\"skip it\\", claiming that the show doesn't stand out among Netflix's other anime offerings: \\"There are hundreds of anime series out there, many on Netflix, and The Idhun Chronicles seems destined to be no more than yet another one among the many\\". He also criticized a lack of charisma among the characters and the excessive amount of exposition in the pilot.

History The area was occupied in the Viking Jorvik period, and excavations in 1963 found a 10th-century cross shaft. The street itself was not recorded until 1337, but it is believed that the \\"new\\" element of its name refers to a widening or paving of the street around that time, rather than the creation of an entirely new street. Originally, the churchyard of St Sampson, Church Street adjoined Newgate to the north, but in 1337, a row of cottages were built in the churchyard, along that side of the street, some of which still survive. In the 1750s, the early Methodists in the city often met upstairs at number 6 Newgate, and John Wesley preached there twice. In 1813, the room became a British School for girls, with about 100 attendees, but as the downstairs was being used as a slaughterhouse, the accommodation was not suitable, and the school to St Saviourgate in 1816. From 1952, a new marketplace for the city was created immediately south of the street, originally named \\"Newgate Market\\", but now known as Shambles Market, and this entailed the demolition of several buildings on the south side of the road. Architecture and layout The street runs east, from the junction of Jubbergate and Silver Street, east to King's Square, where it meets The Shambles. Halfway along the street, it has a junction with Patrick Pool, while to the south, the Shambles Market can be accessed opposite either Patrick Pool, or Silver Street. Most of the buildings on the street are listed. All the surviving ones with Newgate street addresses lie on its northern side. 6 Newgate was largely rebuilt in 1963, but its ground floor has some Mediaeval masonry, including a Perpendicular window. 11 Newgate is an early 19th-century shop, while 12 to 15 are the surviving cottages of 1337, now converted into shops, with number 12 the best preserved.

The current 19th-century tower is the most recent in a series of lighthouses that have been built in the islands, which have helped to guide shipping around the archipelago and into Belfast Lough. A number of different fuels have been used as a light source including coal gas, paraffin, and diesel to generate electricity. In 2015, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who operate the lighthouse, replaced the hyperradiant Fresnel lens optic with a flashing LED system that uses only solar power. This large optic was then preserved and is now on display in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast as a visitor attraction known as The Great Light. Copeland Island The earliest lighthouse in the Copeland Islands was built on Lighthouse Island in 1711 and used coal burnt in a brazier mounted on a three-storey tower above a keeper's cottage. Other cottage lighthouses were established at Howth Head, Loop Head and the Old Head of Kinsale. The tower was improved in 1796 with the addition of a glazed lantern room, with the light coming from \\"six Argand (circular wick) lamps burning sperm oil. Each of the six lamps was magnified by a parabolic reflector.\\" In 1810 responsibility for lighthouses in Ireland passed from the Revenue Commissioners to the Ballast Board, the predecessor of the Commissioners of Irish Lights. One of the first improvements made by the board was to replace the existing lighthouse with an adjacent higher tower. Designed by George Halpin, it was lit with nearly five times the number of lamps and reflectors, twenty-seven in all, giving a range of . Known as the Copeland Island Lighthouse, it had a tower, at a focal plane of , and was completed in 1815. Despite these earlier lighthouses, the islands, which are known for the strong tidal currents that surround them, have been the location of various shipwrecks, including the Mermaid in 1854, Betsey in 1814, and the Enterprise in 1801. With a steady increase in trade and associated shipping during the middle of the 19th century to and from Belfast Harbour, there was a need for an improved lighthouse to guide shipping around the islands, and into Belfast Lough. Evidence collected by the Royal Commission on Lights, Buoys, and Beacons in 1861, showed that the existing lighthouse needed to be replaced by one at a lower level on the outer Mew Island. Mew Island In 1875 the Belfast Harbour Commissioners asked that the Copeland light be shifted to Mew Island, with the need for a new lighthouse being endorsed by the Board of Trade in 1881. Work on the light began in 1882, to a design by William Douglass. One of the key aspects of the design was to improve on the earlier oil powered light with its simple reflectors, by using gas burners in conjunction with a rotating glass Fresnel lens. The lighthouse was completed in 1884 and consisted of a rubble stone tower, with a large glazed lantern room. This housed a substantial first-order optic, the largest type available at that time, from the French lens maker Barbier and Fenestre. This tri-form lens had three tiers of lenses each with its own set of 108 gas burners. The output from the light could be varied according to the number of jets used. On a clear night just 32 were lit in the lower tier, but in poor conditions such as fog all three tiers could be lit using 324 burners. The contractor for the works was Thomas S. Dixon Co. of Belfast, who also built the adjacent keeper's house on the island; five other houses were built by H. Fulton on the mainland at Donaghadee to act as shore dwellings for the keepers and their families. The gas used in the light and the fog siren engines was generated by burning cannel coal in a gas plant alongside the tower and was stored in gasometers until used. Hyperradiant optic A night time view of The Great Light on the Titanic Walkway Ongoing problems with the first-order optic meant that it needed replacing, so it was decided to use the hyperradiant optic that had originally been designed for the Tory Island lighthouse, where it had been installed in 1887. Made by the same French manufacturer as the first-order lens, the hyperradiant is the largest type ever used for lighthouses, having a focal length or radius of . Like the first-order optic it had a tri-form configuration, consisting of three tiers of lenses stacked above each other, with each tier having six panels, spanning 60 degrees. In the 1920s, it was removed from Tory Island, and re-engineered by Chance Brothers in Smethwick, where it was reduced in size to a bi-form system with two tiers. Two of the six bullseye panels were replaced by metal blanks, producing a light characteristic of four flashes of white light every thirty seconds. To enable the optic to turn freely it was mounted upon a circular bath of mercury known as a mercury float, providing an almost frictionless bearing. The redesigned light was then installed at Mew Island in 1928. It was lit using paraffin, making the coal plant redundant, the last in use at an Irish light. In 1969 generators were installed at the lighthouse, allowing the use of electric light to replace the paraffin burners, and an electric motor to replace the weight driven rotation system. The hyper-radial lens, which weighed , was carefully removed from the lighthouse in 2014 and transferred to the mainland by the ILV Granuaile. After restoration at the Commissioners of Irish Lights workshop in D√∫n Laoghaire, it was shipped back by Granuaile to Belfast to be put on display in \\"a new interpretive structure, made to resemble a lighthouse lantern room\\" on the waterside walkway in the Titanic Quarter. The majority of the ¬£447,000 cost of the new structure was met by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant, with other contributions from Belfast City Council and Ulster villages. LED system The change to the LED light shown here in 2017, has been controversial A temporary light was displayed until 2015, when a solar powered LED system was commissioned that uses flashing illuminants to mimic the characteristic of the rotating lens. Its installation reduced the range from of the hyperradiant apparatus to , and the focal height to . In 2017, it was enhanced with an additional fixed light, changing the light characteristic slightly from four flashes every 30 seconds, with \\"A new low luminous intensity fixed light [that] will be combined with the existing flashing light of higher luminous intensity in order to assist with acquisition of the light during the eclipse period.\\" The change to the LED system and the removal of the optic from Mew Island has been criticised. Campaigners argue that the changes made were unnecessary and that there has been a lack of maintenance since the keepers left, with fixtures and fittings destroyed during the changeover. Protests at other Irish lighthouses marked for changes to LED lighting have also occurred, using Mew Island as an example of what can happen. At St John's Point also in County Down, campaigners argue that the LED beam is too harsh compared to the traditional system. The response from the commissioners is that the changes allow the removal of mercury which is a hazardous substance, and that the LEDs are more energy-efficient, allowing the use of solar power. Fog signal Foggy conditions make the islands especially hazardous; a fog bell at the Copeland lighthouse was added in 1851 after three steam ships had run aground. The need for an improved fog signal was important as further groundings had occurred. A twin fog siren was installed at Mew, with a high and low note sounding at intervals for four seconds. More powerful compressors and engines were added in 1899. The system was replaced by a diaphone fog horn in 1929, which continued in service until 1991. Buildings and operation The lighthouse and the low lying Mew Island Initially painted black, the cement rendered tower was given a broad white band following repairs in 1954. In the 1970s an additional white tower surmounted by a large octagonal watch room was built, connected to the engine room. The lighthouse complex, including the tower and associated buildings, has been protected as a category B+ listed building since 1976. The listing states that the lighthouse \\"is a testament to the ambition of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the skills of the nineteenth century engineers and workmen who built it.\\" Following automation of the lighthouse in 1996, the keepers were no longer required to live on the island, ending a service that had kept the light operating for 112 years. The lighthouse has an automatic identification system transmitter and a radar beacon emitting the letter O as a Morse character (‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî). It is registered under the international Admiralty number A5976 and it has the NGA identifier of 114‚Äì6792.

It is a largely critical book, focusing on his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, his strained relationship with military brass and high-level officials such as Jim Mattis and Dan Coats, his handling of racial unrest, and his relationships with the leaders of Russia and North Korea. As with Woodward's 2018 Fear: Trump in the White House, the title of the book is derived from a conversation that Woodward had with Trump in March 2016. Woodward contended that \\"a lot of angst and rage and distress\\" was present in the Republican Party to which Trump replied that \\"I bring rage out. I do bring rage out. I always have... I don't know if that's an asset or a liability, but whatever it is, I do. I also bring great unity out, ultimately. I've had many occasions like this, where people have hated me more than any human being they've ever met. And after it's all over, they end up being my friends. And I see that happening here\\". Background Trump had told Woodward that he wished that he had been able to speak to him for the book's 2018 predecessor, Fear. White House officials told Politico that Trump's respect for Woodward was rooted in his \\"1980s cultural mindset\\" which prioritised Time magazine covers and The New York Times and made him respect Woodward as \\"an institution\\" as a result of his work in exposing the Watergate scandal which resulted in the resignation of Richard Nixon. Anthony Scaramucci the former White House communications director said that Woodward was the \\"gold standard for 50 years of investigative journalism around the presidency\\" and that Trump was attracted to the New York Times the way \\"a low-IQ small moth would be to a flame\\" and Trump is \\"always convinced that if he talks to the person, he is going to elucidate and enlighten that person and get them to like him\\". Trump urged members of his administration to provide interviews to Woodward for Rage and participants included senior adviser Jared Kushner, his former chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, the national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien, and the deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger. The White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that Trump gave access to Woodward as he was \\"the most transparent president in history\\". Simon & Schuster stated that the book is the result of \\"hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand witnesses, as well as participants' notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents\\". Trump gave 18 digital- tape-recorded interviews lasting 9 hours to Woodward for the book. The interviews took place in the Oval Office and at night on the telephone. Trump reportedly asked his aides repeatedly about when the book would be published. He later denounced the book, describing it as \\"another political hit job\\". Content The book opens with a depiction of the United States' tensions with North Korea, including describing a series of personal letters between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In these letters, Kim describes his initial meeting with Trump in romantic, flowery language, calling the meeting \\"reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film\\". This de- escalation of tensions came immediately following panic about the potential of nuclear war between the two powers. It seems clear that Woodward intended to focus on the tensions with world leaders as the focus of his book, including Trump's impeachment and his alleged collusion with Russian authorities, but it quickly becomes clear that COVID-19 \\"will be the biggest national security threat you [Trump] face in your presidency\\". Trump told Woodward that he was \\"playing it down\\" with regards to the threat to the public health of Americans presented by COVID-19 despite being told that it may be five times \\"more deadly\\" than the common flu and that \\"It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus...This is deadly stuff\\", saying that \\"I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic\\". Rage concludes with Woodward's assessment of Trump as \\"the wrong man for the job\\". Reception Nancy Cook and Alex Thompson wrote in Politico that Trump \\"[believed] he could charm the man who helped take down a president and chronicled half a dozen administrations over the past half-century\\" but that the revelations in the book \\"sent the Trump White House scrambling, with aides blaming one another for the predictable fallout from injecting even more chaos into an already challenging reelection race\\". Woodward was criticised for not revealing Trump's thoughts on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States prior to the imminent release of the book. Woodward said in an interview that the book would have been able to provide more context than a news story and that \\"the biggest problem I had, which is always a problem with Trump, is I didn‚Äôt know if it was true\\" and that if he \\"had done the story at that time about what he knew in February, that's not telling us anything we didn't know\\".

Glover, unaware of what was going on, complimented the food and was subsequently invited to dinner by the director of Shanghai‚Äôs Civil Affairs Bureau, who asked if he would be willing to help them. After some more meetings, they invited Glover to work with them as senior consultant in developing their child welfare system to include foster care. The charity Care for Children was registered in the UK, and Glover signed an agreement to start in 1998. Accompanied by his wife and six children, Glover moved to Shanghai to work moving orphans and vulnerable children from institutional care into foster family care. The fostering project was launched with the objectives of 1) establishing a foster care program for children in the Shanghai state orphanage and 2) setting up a program of childcare training. After a successful pilot project, the Ministry of Civil Affairs asked Glover to move to Beijing to act as advisor to the government and help roll out the foster care program.

Created by writer Jonathan Hickman and artist Pepe Larraz, the group first appeared in Hickman's relaunch of the X-Men franchise House of X #5 (November 2019), although the individual members were first created as far back as 1979. During the storyline, mutants established their own sovereign nation on the sentient island of Krakoa headed by Charles Xavier and Magneto. Xavier brings the group, consisting of Egg, Elixir, Hope Summers, Proteus and Tempus, together after theorizing that this specific combination of mutants, each using their powers in concert with one another, could create life and thus, resurrect fallen mutants at will. Of the group, three members (Elixir, Proteus and Hope) are known Omega-Level Mutants. Publication history The Five were officially formed during House of X #5 which was released on September 18, 2019 though the individual members were all created much earlier. Egg was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Chris Bachalo and debuted as \\"Goldballs\\" in Uncanny X-Men vol 3. #1 (April 2013).Uncanny X-Men vol. 3 #1 (2013) Elixir was created by Nunzio DeFilippis, Christina Weir and Keron Grant and first appeared in New Mutants vol. 2 #5 (November 2003).New Mutants vol. 2 #5 (2003) Hope was created by Mike Carey and Chris Bachalo and first appeared in X-Men #205 (November 2007).X-Men #205 (2007) Proteus was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne and first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #125 (September 1979).Uncanny X-Men #125 (1979) Tempus was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Stuart Immonen and first appeared in All-New X-Men #1 (January 2013).All-New X-Men #1 (2013) Since their debut, the Five have been mentioned or had a significant role in all of Hickman's Dawn of X series including X-Men, Marauders, X-Force, Excalibur, New Mutants and X-Factor. Members *Egg (Fabio Medina): Previously known by the codename \\"Goldballs\\", Egg has the ability to create and project golden ball- shaped objects from his body. It was later revealed by Xavier that these balls were, in fact, non-viable eggs. *Elixir (Joshua \\"Josh\\" Foley): An Omega-level mutant capable of controlling the biological structure of any organic matter.New Mutants vol 2. #12 (2004) Although he most commonly uses this ability to heal others, Elixir's powers can also boost and restore mutant abilities, detect abnormalities in living beings, cure disease and cause pain.New X-Men #38 (2007) *Hope Summers: The Omega-level adoptive daughter of Cable with the power to psychically manipulate and mimic the powers of other mutants. Hope's ability primarily manifests through mimicking the powers of those around her although she has also exhibited telepathic and telekinetic abilities and can \\"jump-start\\" newly emerging mutant powers.Uncanny X-Men #526 *Proteus (Kevin MacTaggert): The supervillain son of Moira MacTaggert who possesses a vast psionic ability to manipulate reality. He is a being of pure psionic energy which enables him to exhibit occasionally telepathic abilities and possess humans, which gives him access to all of their memories even after he has left their body. His reality warping powers allow him to transmute matter and bend the laws of physics. *Tempus (Eva Bell): A mutant who is able to create \\"time bubbles\\" which pause time for those outside of it or can transport its inhabitants into the past or future. Role In order to resurrect a deceased mutant, the Five must channel their powers together in a way that requires a great deal of focus and both physical and psychological strain although, with each successful resurrection, the process becomes easier. To begin, Egg produces a number of nonviable biological eggs equal to the number of mutants the Five are required to resurrect. The eggs are then injected with the DNA of the dead mutants, which is stored in Mister Sinister's genetic catalogue and made viable using Proteus' reality warping powers. Because Proteus' abilities demand a large amount of psionic energy, his body will tend to \\"burn out\\" in a week (or even in a single day following excessive use), meaning the Five always keep a backup replacement Proteus on hand to take over once the current one dies. Elixir then uses his biological manipulation abilities to give life to the eggs, kickstarting cell regeneration and growth. Finally, Tempus uses her powers to rapidly mature the bodies within the eggs to the exact age the mutants were when the died. Hope's role in the process is perhaps the most integral, as her mimicry abilities empower the other members of the Five, allowing their powers to operate at their peak and in unison with one another. Following this, Professor Xavier uses Cerebro to transfer the consciousness of the mutant into their new body. Once the process is complete, the mutant will be \\"reborn\\" with all of their skills, powers and memories. Because the act of resurrection is such an intimate and intense process, the Five are noted to have become very close to one another and are rarely seen apart. On Krakoa, they are treated like celebrities and are both cherished and revered by other mutants for being integral to the survival of their species. Krakoa's Quiet Council sees the protection of the Five as their ultimate priority. In order to avoid duplicates, the Five are not permitted to resurrect a mutant until their death can be confirmed. To help with this, an X-Factor team reporting directly to the Five lead by Northstar and consisting of Polaris, Prestige, Daken, Prodigy and Eye-Boy was formed with the purpose of investigating mutant missing persons. Known resurrections Professor Xavier first tasked the Five to bring back a group of mutants who gave their lives to destroy Mother Mold, an all-powerful super Sentinel created by anti-mutant organization Orchis: *Marvel Girl (Jean Grey) *Cyclops (Scott Summers) *Husk (Paige Guthrie) *Archangel (Warren Worthington III) *Penance (Monet St. Croix) *Mystique (Raven Darkholme) *Wolverine (James \\"Logan\\" Howlett) *Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) Additionally, the Five is also known to have resurrected: *X (Charles Xavier) *Banshee (Sean Cassidy) *Synch (Everett Thomas) *Magik (Illyana Rasputina) *Sophie Cuckoo *Esme Cuckoo *Jamie BraddockExcalibur #1 (October 30, 2019) *Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur)Excalibur #5 (January 2020) *Shinobi ShawMarauders #3 (December 2019) *Kitty PrydeMarauders #11 (August 2020) References Category:Fictional organizations in Marvel Comics Category:Lists of X-Men characters ","title":"The Five (comics)"},{"id":"64881184","text":"Manuel de Soto y Solares (born 1839 in Sevilla, Andaluc√≠a ‚Äì d. 1906) was a Spanish luthier.

It has since its completion in 1817 been home to a glazier's business. The current owner, H. P. Plsem & S√∏n, which has been based in the building since 1938, has replaced all the windows with antique stained glass windows. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1950. History Peter Christian Weinreich Fischer (1772‚Äì1834) established a glazier's business at the site on 20 June 1796. The adjacent building at Klosterstr√¶de 23 was constructed for him in 1811-12. Klosterstr√¶de 21 was constructed for him in 1814‚Äì1817 and he subsequently ran his glazier's business from the premises. Finnur Magn√∫sson, who then worked for the King's private archives, was from 1827 and until his death ten years later also among the residents in the building. The building and firm was, after the founder's death, handed down to his son, Peter Didrik Weinreich Fischer (1813‚Äì1884). He served as alderman for the Glaziers' Guild in 1845‚Äì47 and again in 1851‚Äì53. He had by Frederick VII been commissioned to create four glass paintings for Christian IV's Chapel at Roskilde Cathedral. They were never used as originally intended but two of them can now be seen in Frederiksborg Chapel. The two others were destroyed in the fire of Christiansborg Palace in 1884. In 1871, Fuscher sold the family business to A. W. C. K. Wriedt (1833‚Äì1907). Wriedt's son, Ludwig Wriedt (b. 1879), took over the operations in 1904 . On 1 December 1938, it was acquired by a competitor, H. P. Olsen & S√∏n, a firm founded on 1 January 1891 by 1891 by Hans Peter Olsen (1863‚Äì1935). It has until then been located first at Hyskenstr√¶de 14 and then (from 1932) at Kompagnistr√¶de 2. Olsen's son Robert Hermann Bodholt Olsen (b. 1895) was from 1922 the sole owner of the company. His son, Hermann Arne Bodholt Olsen (b. 1920), was made a partner in 1943. Architecture The gate The building consists of four storeys over a raised cellar and is four bays wide. The facade is dressed in a grey colour on the ground floor and cellar while the rest stands in undressed, red brick. All the windows have by H. P. Olsen & S√∏n been replaced by antique stained glass windows from other buildings in Copenhagen, none of which are identical. The name of the company is written in copper lettering above the windows of the ground flor. Mounted on the facade between the two central windows of the first floor is an old rough iron sign. The gate in the left-hand side of the building opens to a small courtyard. A door in the wall of the gateway provides access to the main staircase of the building. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1950. Today H. P. Olsen & Co. is based in the ground floor and cellar. A single apartment occupies each of the upper floors.

Early life and education  He received his formal education at the University of Salamanca, studying law. On 25 February 1676, he qualified as a lawyer in the Chancellery of Granada. In 1677, he was appointed Poor Lawyer of the city of Seville and given the position of auditor of the Militias of the General Captaincy of the Kingdom of Seville.  Law and public life  In 1683, he was appointed, by the Grand Inquisitor, lawyer for the Royal Treasury of the Holy Office of the Kingdom of Seville. On 3 August 3 1685, he became a lawyer of the city of Seville and on 4 February 4 1687, acted as the lawyer to the Archbishop of Seville. In 1688, he was made lieutenant to Count of Montellano, a position he held until 1693. His next post was as deputy mayor of C√°diz from 18 June 1696. He remained there until 1 October 1699. After this long administrative and legal career, the new king, Felipe V, rewarded him , on 13 December 1700, as chief judge of degrees of the Audiencia of Seville. On 27 August 1703, he received the habit of the Order of Santiago. From 19 February 1704, he became judge of degrees of the Seville Court. The King's need for trustworthy advises during the War of Succession gave Curiel a rise to the position of mayor of the House and Court in 1705, moving to Madrid to take office. Becoming one of the members of the Madrid high judiciary, he was consulted on several occasions as councilor of Castile and the Indies by the Chamber. Finally, on 20 August 20 1707, Felipe V appointed him prosecutor of the Council of Castile, remaining in this position until the remodeling of the Council of Castile in 1713. The restructuring of the Council of Castile, carried out in November 1713, provided him, on 10 November 1713, with a short-lived position as councilor of the Council of Castile. From 17 June 1714, Luis Curiel occupied the S Chair of the Royal Spanish Academy on June 17, 1714, whilst his son Juan Curiel occupied the R Chair. He was one of the first protectors, with his appointment in 1717, of the recently created University of Cervera, the only university in Catalonia after the War of Succession.  Family  Curiel was born to Agust√≠n Curiel Vega, ruler of the noble state of Osuna, while his mother, Catalina Tejada, was part of one of the noble families of Marchena. His son Juan Curiel was a politician. He married In√©s Mar√≠a Luna Delgado on 28 December 1681, with whom he had four sons and two daughters. He died on 27 November 1724 in Madrid, Spain.

Early life  Alonso was the son of a prosperous merchant, Diego de Curiel, who maintained important relations with the Court of Madrid. His uncle, Jer√≥nimo de Curiel, acquired great influence in Antwerp business circles. Diego sent Alonso to Antwerp to ensure the continuity of the family's position, as Jer√≥nimo had no male heir.  Mercantile activity  In August 1577, Jer√≥nimo commended his nephew Alonso de Curiel to the care of the governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, John of Austria. On 9 March 1578, Don John ordered Curiel to participate in an important financial negotiation on behalf of Philip II of Spain to obtain funds from Antwerp, Madrid and Burgos. The king maintained an expectant interest in these negotiations and congratulated Curiel on several occasions. Later, he negotiated trade with the Belgian nobleman Emmanuel de Lalaing and with a number of towns, including Saint-Omer. It has been suggested that Dutch and Belgian historiography underestimates Curiel's role in bringing about the reconciliation of the Walloon provinces to the royal cause in the 1579 Treaty of Arras. On 4 August 1603, Philip III appointed him as Agent of the Spanish Crown for trade with \\"the States of Flanders, Islands of Holland, and Zealand, vassals of Princes and Republics, friends and Neutrals.\\" Publications * Lettres interceptes du Contador Alonso de Curiel, au Prince de Parme (Antwerp, 1579)Lettres interceptes on Google Books. * Relaci√≥n de los servicios que Alonso de Curiel hizo en Flandes a su Majestad, y los recados que en aprobaci√≥n dellos tiene (Valladolid, [1603])  References  Category:Spanish merchants Category:Curiel family Category:People of Spanish-Jewish descent Category:Spanish diplomats Category:16th-century merchants Category:17th- century merchants ","title":"Alonso Curiel"},{"id":"64882059","text":"Alfred Grady \\"Rat\\" Watson (February 10, 1894 ‚Äì June 15, 1894), sometimes referenced as Rats Watson, was an American football player.

From the age of nineteen, she aided the escape of nearly 140 airmen from occupied Belgium into France as part of the Comet Line. She was given the codename 'Monique' by the British War Office - a name she then used throughout her life. Early life Henriette Hanotte lived in the rural village of Rumes in Belgium, close to the French border. Her parents ran a hotel and a farm, where she and her younger brother helped look after the animals. She went to school each day in the nearby French village of Bachy, and thus became known to the officers manning the customs posts. Resistance activities In May 1940, shortly after the German occupation of Belgium, Hanotte and her father assisted two officers who had become separated during the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force to Dunkirk. They were disguised, and led the short distance through a customs post and into France. Hanotte was subsequently recruited by the British War Office section, MI19 to actively participate in the Belgian resistance network called Comet Line, and was given the codename \\"Monique\\". Over the course of the war, she and her family aided the escape of nearly 140 Allied forces airmen, either by accompanying them across the border, or travelling with them by train to cities such as Lille and Paris. In doing so she risked her own life and those of her family, if caught. In 1944, whilst travelling to the safe house she used in Paris she discovered that her network had been revealed by a Belgian collaborator. She was ordered by her British handlers to escape to England by following the same route as that used by the airmen she had assisted. After travelling through France to Spain via the Pyrenees she reached Gibraltar, and from there flew to Britain. Once there, she was taught to parachute and to be a secret agent in advance of being dropped into France as part of the Ardennes Counteroffensive. However, she was never sent, and remained in England until after the war. Post war Hanotte celebrated VE Day in London before returning to her family home in Belgium. In 1945 she married the boyfriend she had known during the war who had been a Belgian border guard. They subsequently had two children. Hanotte continued using the name Monique throughout her life. Honours In May 2015 a hiking circuit was opened to mark the route taken by Monique Hanotte to help airmen escape from Belgium into France. A statue of \\"Monique\\" was installed in Place de la Libert√© in the French commune of Bachy, depicting her assisting American bombardier, Charles Carlson, to escape from Belgium. In 2015 Hanotte was given honorary citizenship of Bachy.< See also * National Museum of the Resistance in Anderlecht, Belgium * Belgium in World War II * Free Belgian Forces * √ñsterreichische Freiheitsfront References Category:French Resistance members Category:Belgian resistance members Category:1920 births Category:Living people ","title":"Monique Hanotte"},{"id":"64882499","text":"Ben Hunt (September 16, 1900 ‚Äì June 1981) was an American football player.

Background and release At a restaurant, after hearing a song that she used to listen to in New York with J. Y. Park when Wonder Girls were touring the United States with him, Sunmi sent a recording of the song to her former boss to reminisce about the past. J. Y. Park answered her message by sending her a demo of his song, asking her \\"if she missed the days [they] worked together\\" and suggesting a collaboration. At this point, he had almost completed writing the lyrics. On July 24, 2020, it was reported that J. Y. Park would release a new song in August and that all recordings had been completed. On August 3, a teaser poster announcing Park and Sunmi's collaboration scheduled to be released on August 12 was posted on JYP Entertainment's twitter account and retweeted by both singers. On August 6, J. Y. Park shared a teaser for the music video on his Instagram account. A second teaser was released on YouTube the following day. On August 10, both singers shared the online cover image for the song. The single was released on August 12. Composition J. Y. Park was inspired by Modern Talking's song \\"Brother Louie\\" which serves as the opening song for the South Korean talk show Radio Star and was stuck in his head at the time; it took him a few hours to complete the song. Park said to have used \\"typical instruments of the European disco genre and recorded with the equipment imbued with 80s vibes to fully recreate nostalgic melody.\\" Music video The song's accompanying music video was released on August 11, 2020 at 6:00 PM (KST), one day prior to the single's release. It was inspired by the American films Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Pulp Fiction (1994) which J. Y. Park loves, as mentioned at the end of the video. Riddhi Chakraborty of Rolling Stone India described the music video to have \\"a late-Seventies, early-Eighties vibe, reviving the Saturday Night Fever era with its multi-coloured dance floor, hazy club setting, glimmering disco ball and glitzy wardrobe and makeup. Park and Sunmi play lovers who are parted in their youth but are fated to meet again 10 years later, fighting gangsters and all odds to be together and celebrate their love for each other and for disco.\\" The music video reached 2.32 million views in 24 hours, a new record for J. Y. Park. It surpassed 10 million views 4 days and 22 hours after its release. Critical reception Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said that the song \\"showcases both of [J. Y.

You remember when the DJ at the end of the evening used to play a slow song? They don't seem to do it anymore. So if you've been in this situation, you'll understand why I wrote this song.\\" Critical reception In a contemporary review of \\"Night and Day\\", Jim Bohen of the Daily Record described \\"A Slow Song\\" as an \\"impassioned ballad\\" which contains an organ solo \\"as eloquent as the lyric\\". Paul Willistein of The Morning Call considered the song to be \\"an exquisite and powerful commentary on much of contemporary pop presented as re- working of the old saw 'Music has charms to soothe the savage beast'.\\" Mike Daly of The Age described the song a \\"gently rocking plea for relief from high-energy music\\" and praised the \\"nice bridging organ\\" and chorus' \\"superb hook\\". George Kanzler of the Newhouse News Service noted Jackson's vocal performance as being \\"delivered in a barely held-back heavy metal singer's tone, as if Robert Plant were trying to cover Dan Fogelberg\\". Brett Milano of The Boston Globe praised Jackson's vocal as being \\"his strongest on record\\" and noted the song's \\"dramatic buildup\\". In 2015, Dave Lifton of Ultimate Classic Rock picked \\"A Slow Song\\" as his number one choice for a feature covering Joe Jackson's top ten songs. Lifton considered the song to \\"owe more than a nod\\" to \\"Unchained Melody\\" and noted the \\"gorgeously cathartic climax\\".

The club was founded in 1880, and currently has sections for cricket, football, lawn tennis, hockey, and table tennis. For each sport except hockey, home games are played at The Paulin Ground in Winchmore Hill. Hockey games now require the use of modern artificial surface pitches and thus are played at locally hired facilities. Club history The club started as Winchmore Hill Cricket Club in 1880 and was originally a cricket club alone. In 1880 the Busk family owned the land in Winchmore Hill known as Ford's Grove. Their head gardener, John Moore, asked Mr. Busk for permission to play cricket in the grounds and Winchmore Hill Cricket Club was formed. The first reported match of the Winchmore Hill Village Cricket Club was against North End Finchley, played at the ground to be known as Ford's Grove, on 21 May 1881. In 1912 the lawn tennis section and four tennis courts were established, two being situated on the site of the present practice wickets (nets). The first recorded club tournament was in 1914, and the ladies singles was won by a Miss Carter and the gentleman's singles by Mr. J.W. Simmons. The four years 1919 to 1922 were important landmarks in the club's development with the addition of two winter sports, football and ladies hockey, thereby completing the constitution of the four main outdoor playing sections as they are today. The football section was formed in the spring of 1920 and the Grange Ladies Hockey Club became a section of the parent club with each section being self- managing. In order to provide better dressing room accommodation for an ever increasing membership, it was during the winter of 1921/22 that a new pavilion was erected. The building itself is a former officers' mess and came from the wartime army camp at Wimbledon and, apart from a new extension built in 1974, is still in use today. The cost of the pavilion, ¬£1,750, was borne mostly from donations and loans by the Club President and members. Mr. W.T. Paulin purchased the grounds when the Ford's Grove estate was auctioned in 1920. His daughter, Irene, became President of the club and secured its future by directing in her will, upon her death in 1960, that a 99-year lease be granted to the club. The club formally changed its name to Winchmore Hill Sports Club in 2013 in recognition of the multi sport nature of the membership. Facilities The club is set in roughly 20 acres of land in Winchmore Hill, London. Surrounding the centrally located clubhouse are four floodlit hard surface tennis courts and five grass courts, a floodlit enclosed artificial surface multi usage games area, and grass fields which allow for cricket in the summer months, and football in the winter. Cricket takes place on three squares (together with practice nets), and there are four full size football pitches plus two small size pitches for youth teams.

Carbon Positive Cities  McDonough, alongside his Charlottesville-based architecture firm, William McDonough + Partners, utilized the New Language of Carbon to develop a framework for designing Carbon Positive Cities. The concept is also closely related to Breathing Cities, which he presented at the Arctic Circle China Forum in Shanghai in May 2019 and focuses on releasing less carbon and fewer toxic chemicals into the air and instead shifts to integrating renewable energy such as geothermal as a solution to air pollution and climate change. Implementing a carbon positive framework for cities is one method of combating climate change. The aim is for cities to embrace carbon as an asset in soil, plants and ‚Äúdurable‚Äù earthbound forms, while eliminating it as a liability in the atmosphere. The goal of carbon positive cities is to reduce the liability of atmospheric carbon while also increasing earthbound carbon as an asset; integrate and celebrate urban development as a unified, productive and restorative ecosystem; recognize beneficial uses of carbon for their short and long-term ecological, economic, and social value; optimize the relationships between a city, its local hinterland, and remote territories and envision agriculture as an organizing element of urban form and operations.  Reception  Since Carbon Is Not The Enemy was first published, numerous outlets such as Scientific American and Fast Company have praised it for reframing the conversation around carbon emissions. Since the first mention of Carbon Positive Cities, several municipalities have used this as an evaluation of their environmental goals. Baoding, China was called the ‚Äúfirst ‚Äòcarbon positive‚Äô city‚Äù by the United Nations.

Trained as a military engineer, during the war Ellice served largely in North Wales, which was strategically important due to ports giving access to Ireland. He was responsible for constructing much of the outer fortifications of Chester, but also served as a colonel of foot in engagements across the region. Life Ellice was born in Denbighshire to a minor gentry family, the son of Gruffydd Ellis ap Risiard of Bersham: the family claimed descent from mediaeval Welsh nobility through an illegitimate line. They were connected with several other landowning families locally, including the Lloyds of Bodidris. Ellice married Mary Lloyd, the daughter of the vicar of Ruabon. They had one son, Peter Ellice, who was born in about 1647 and became a barrister, and at least two daughters. From his uncle, the lawyer and antiquary Peter Ellice, Robert inherited the house and estate of Gwasnewydd near Wrexham, later rebuilt by his son and renamed Croesnewydd. Robert also had a younger brother, Thomas, who became a Commissioner for Barbados. Much information about Ellice's background is unrecorded, including his birth date. He is known to have trained as a military engineer while serving under Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War; this experience meant that during the Civil War he was \\"highly trusted\\" by the Royalist leadership. Canon David Lloyd, a contemporary, described Ellice as a \\"vigilant, sober, active and valiant commander\\". Civil War service In January 1643 Ellice was ordered to seize and garrison Chirk Castle, the home of the Denbighshire Member of Parliament Thomas Myddelton. Myddelton being absent sitting in the Long Parliament, Ellice took Chirk with minimal resistance, taking the estate steward Watkin Kyffin prisoner. On Charles I's orders Ellice also requisitioned Myddelton's plate and money; this was used to fund the establishment of Ellice's regiment of foot. River Dee between Holt and Farndon; Ellice's regiment were defeated here in a skirmish on 9th November 1643 by Sir William Brereton. Leaving Chirk garrisoned by Sir Thomas Hanmer, Ellice helped organise the defences of the strategic port of Chester. On 15th March Ellice and his regiment took part in a night attack on Middlewich under Aston. Initially successful, most of the infantry was trapped in Middlewich church when the Parliamentarian commander William Brereton counter-attacked; Ellice and a number of other officers were taken prisoner. He was eventually exchanged in September 1643. On his release Ellice was made commander-in-chief of Denbighshire and Flintshire under Lord Capell and authorised to raise a new regiment of 1,200 men. Parliament was preparing to mount an offensive into north-east Wales and the regiment was deployed at Holt Bridge in November to guard it against an expected attack by Brereton; on 9th November Brereton's men stormed the bridge gatehouse and entered Holt, scattering Ellice's raw recruits. In the following months Ellice reformed his regiment, operating mainly in Shropshire. On Sunday 24th March 1644, in cooperation with the cavalry officer Sir William Vaughan, he defeated a Parliamentarian garrison at Apley. A Royalist newspaper claimed that Ellice \\"plyed the Rebells so close with shot of all sorts, that in two Howres they took the House\\": the Parliamentarian news-sheet Mercurius Britannicus commented that \\"The truth is, Ellis had rather be doing anything on a Sunday than serving God\\". Later the same month Ellice and Vaughan defeated Thomas Mytton in a skirmish at Longford near Lilleshall, taking 200 prisoners. In May his regiment accompanied Prince Rupert into northern England, taking part in the storming of Bolton on 28th May, and probably fighting in the Royalist defeat at Marston Moor. While most of Ellice's regiment were taken prisoner at Montgomery in September 1644, Ellice himself seems to have spent much of 1645 in North Wales, at Conwy, as the area controlled by the Royalists gradually shrank. He was mentioned by Archbishop Williams of York, a native of Conwy, as \\"but a weak piece, a potter [...] not to be relied upon\\" and as unable to stand up to the town's military governor, Sir John Owen of Clenennau. He was in the besieged Royalist capital Oxford at the time of its surrender in June 1646, as his name appears on the surrender articles. After the war Ellice returned home after the war ended: like many other Royalist officers he was fined, though the relatively small sum of ¬£200, reduced on appeal to ¬£150 shows he was not a wealthy man. He appears to have followed the terms of his surrender and did not take part in any further Royalist rebellions. Ellice died around the time of the Restoration, though the exact date of his death is unknown.

The UAE thus became the third Arab country, after Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994, to agree to formally normalize its relationship with Israel, as well as the first Persian Gulf country to do so. Concurrently, Israel agreed to suspend plans for annexing parts of the West Bank. The agreement normalized what had long been informal but robust foreign relations between the two countries. The agreement was signed at the White House on 15 September 2020. It was approved unanimously by the Israeli cabinet on 12 October Cabinet authorizes Israel-UAE peace treaty and was ratified by the Knesset on 15 October. https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/knesset-debates- israel-uae-deal-645800 On 16 August 2019, Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz made a public declaration about military cooperation with the UAE amidst rising tensions with Iran. Also, on 16 August 2020, the UAE for the first time established telephone links to Israel by unblocking direct dialling to Israel's +972 country code. The first direct commercial flight from Israel to the UAE took place on 31 August 2020, and the first ship carrying cargo from the United Arab Emirates to Israel entered Haifa Port on 12 October. First maritime cargo shipment from UAE enters Haifa Port Background Location of Israel (green) and the UAE (orange) within the Middle East As early as 1971, the year in which the UAE became an independent country, the first president of the UAE Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan had referred to Israel as \\"the enemy\\". The UAE and the United States had a strategic relationship since the 1990 Gulf War, growing to a significant US Air Force presence at Al Dhafra Air Base after the September 11 attacks. In November 2015, Israel announced that it would open a diplomatic office in the UAE, which would be the first time in more than a decade that Israel had an official presence in the Persian Gulf. In the months leading up to the agreement, Israel had been working in secret with the UAE to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. European news media reported that Mossad had discreetly obtained health equipment from Gulf states. Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, reported at the end of June 2020 that the two countries were in cooperation to fight the coronavirus and that the head of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, had traveled numerous times to the UAE. However, the UAE appeared to downplay this a few hours later by revealing that it was merely an arrangement among private companies rather than at state level. The move also comes in the wake of the Trump administration's repudiation of the Iran nuclear deal and following persistent Israeli suspicions that the Iranian nuclear program includes a program to develop atomic bomb capacities, something which Tehran denies. Currently, Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in backing different factions in proxy wars from Syria to Yemen, with the UAE supporting the Saudi-led and US-sponsored coalition against the Iran-aligned forces. In recent years, the countries' informal relations warmed considerably and they engaged in extensive unofficial cooperation based on their joint opposition to Iran's nuclear program and regional influence. The agreement represented a major policy reversal for Netanyahu, who had long pushed for increasing settlements in the occupied West Bank, with an objective of annexing the territory. Netanyahu faced political pressure to demonstrate flexibility, as three recent elections gave him only a plurality in a coalition government and he faced a criminal prosecution in 2021. In 2019, the Trump administration reversed decades of American policy by declaring that the West Bank settlements did not violate international law, a decision that threatened the two-state solution that had long been seen as the key to lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The Trump administration's Middle East policy, crafted by presidential senior advisor Jared Kushner and released in January 2020, approved Netanyahu's plan to annex existing settlements. After Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, wrote a June 2020 opinion piece warning that annexation would threaten better relations between Israel and the Arab world, Kushner saw an opportunity and stepped in to facilitate talks. After negotiators had reached agreement, Trump, Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed held a conference call immediately prior to a formal announcement. Agreement US President Donald Trump announces to the media the agreement from the Oval Office at the White House, August 13, 2020 On August 13, 2020, the UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, announced the UAE's agreement to normalize relations with Israel saying that his country wanted to deal with the threats facing the two-state solution, specifically annexation of the Palestinian territories, and urging the Palestinians and Israelis to return to the negotiating table. He indicated that he did not think that there will be any embassy in Jerusalem until after there is a final agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis. According to US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, \\"Israel and the United Arab Emirates will fully normalize their diplomatic relations. They will exchange embassies and ambassadors and begin cooperation across the board and on a broad range of areas including tourism, education, healthcare, trade and security.\\" A joint statement issued by Trump, Netanyahu, and Zayed, read: \\"This historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to the bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region.\\" The UAE said it would continue to support the Palestinian people and that the agreement would maintain the prospect of a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. Despite the agreement however, Netanyahu stated that Israel's sovereignty claim to the Jordan Valley was still on the agenda and only frozen for the time being. Zayed tweeted that the \\"UAE and Israel also agreed to cooperation and setting a roadmap towards establishing a bilateral relationship.\\" Treaty White House Abraham Accords signing ceremony on September 15, 2020 The treaty was signed on September 15, 2020. The treaty recognizes each state's sovereignty, obliges the two states to exchange ambassadors and conclude bilateral agreements on several topics including visa agreements, and will enter into force upon ratification. The agreement was ratified by the Israeli government on Oct. 12 and was ratified by the Knesset on Oct. 15. Reactions thumb450px Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu said there was \\"no change\\" to his plans to annex parts of the West Bank if it was approved by the US, but added they were on temporary hold. Before the agreement, the plan to annex 30% of the West Bank were already on hold due to a majority of Israelis and the government coalition partner Benny Gantz rejected the plan. Hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers live in the areas, in addition to Palestinians, which were under Israeli control in practice. Gantz thanked Trump, Netanyahu and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for making the peace deal happen, saying it showed an alliance between Middle Eastern nations that wanted stability and mutual cooperation. It also showed Israel's eternal desire for peace with neighboring countries per him, while also enhancing Israel's image on world stage and creating a better future for the region. Netanyahu when questioned by reporters, admitted to keeping the negotiations with the UAE a secret from Blue and White due to the United States requesting him to do so. Foreign minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the deal would pave the way for peace agreements with other nations and welcomed the suspension of unilateral annexation. Yesh Atid's chairman Yair Lapid welcomed the agreement as an \\"important step\\" for normalization with the UAE and said it showed mutual agreements are the path to be followed for Israel's relations with other nations, instead of unilateral steps like annexation. Israeli Labor Party leader Amir Peretz, too, shared the view and said Israel's development as well as safety lay in such agreements. He hoped for a similar agreement with Palestinians. Yamina's Naftali Bennett welcomed the deal but said it came at the cost of annexation which was tragic. His fellow MK Bezalel Smotrich dismissed the deal as insignificant and criticized Netanyahu for reviving prospect of a two-sate solution. Likud MK and Netanyahu's chief rival in the party, Gideon Sa'ar, welcomed the deal but expressed that he will be more joyous with the annexation. Likud MKs Miri Regev and Yuli Edelstein meanwhile opposed the deal because of suspension of annexation. Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality Mayor Ron Huldai, congratulated Netanyahu on the \\"double achievement\\" of peace with the UAE and shelving of plans to annex parts of the West Bank. Huldai also lit up the Tel Aviv City Hall with the flag of the UAE. The head of the Israeli settler group Yesha Council, , accused Netanyahu of \\"betraying\\" some of his most loyal supporters and having \\"deceived half a million residents of the area and hundreds of thousands of voters.\\" , the mayor of Efrat, a settlement of more than 9,000 residents south of Jerusalem, supported Netanyahu, arguing that \\"the Israeli agreement to postpone the application of Israeli law in the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria is a fair price [to pay]\\", and added it might change how settlements are viewed. Beit El settlement's mayor and Shomron Regional Council chairman Yossi Dagan also criticized the deal. United States Kelly Craft, the US Ambassador to the United Nations, celebrated the announcement, calling it \\"a huge win\\" for President Trump and for the world, saying that the diplomatic ties show \\"just how hungry for peace we all are in this world,\\" and how Middle Eastern countries are all understanding the need \\"to stand firm against a regime that is the number one state sponsor of terrorism ‚Äî Iran\\". Longtime New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, who has for decades written about international geopolitics and has been a frequent critic of Trump policies, hailed the agreement as \\"exactly what Trump said it was in his tweet: a 'HUGE breakthrough. Joe Biden, Trump's opponent in the 2020 US presidential election, praised the agreement as it \\"builds on the efforts of multiple administrations to foster a broader Arab‚ÄìIsraeli opening, including the efforts of the Obama‚ÄìBiden administration to build on the Arab Peace Initiative.\\" Jared Kushner, the primary Trump administration official involved in negotiating the agreement, stated while speaking to CBS News that the deal would make the Middle East more peaceful and hopeful, which would mean fewer American troops would need to be deployed in the region. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the deal was an important step toward stabilizing the region and was good for the whole world. Muslim worldGulf states= The treaty was generally viewed with skepticism by Gulf residents outside the UAE, according to the International Business Times. Emiratis who criticized the deal online were less numerous than those who supported it due to a crackdown against dissent, with many of those opposing the deal living outside UAE. An open online signature campaign against the deal set up by the non-governmental organization UAE Anti- Normalisation Association had received 1.7 million signatures as of September 17. Yousef Al Otaiba, the Emirati ambassador to the United States, issued a statement on August 13 extolling the agreement as \\"a win for diplomacy and for the region\\", adding how it \\"lowers tensions and creates new energy for positive change\\". Kuwait's long-standing position on the issue became prominent after the announcement. A joint statement was issued the day of the announcement by seven movements in the Assembly comprising Liberals, Shi'ites, Islamists, and Arabists, among other blocs who condemned the treaty. 41 MPs (out of 50) signed a letter opposing normalization the day parliament was reconvened, and a stand was organised in front of the Palestinian embassy in Kuwait City. Several NGOs also issued similar statements. Jared Kushner, Senior Advisor to the President of the United States, condemned Kuwait's position. However, his condemnation was widely shared online as a positive, according to Al Jazeera. The government of Kuwait itself however remained silent on the deal. 37 Kuwaiti MPs called upon it on August 18 to condemn the agreement. Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas had reported two days earlier that the Kuwaiti government's position was unchanged regarding Israel, citing anonymous government sources. In Bahrain, which was the first Gulf Arab country to comment publicly in support of the deal as a step toward peace, fear of government crackdown prevented activists from voicing their criticism. On August 26, King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa explained to visiting US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the Gulf state is committed to the creation of a Palestinian state, implicitly rejecting the normalization of ties with Israel. The country however later agreed to normalization of ties with Israel, which was announced by American President Donald Trump on September 12. The government of Oman publicly supported the agreement (which it termed \\"historic\\"). The Grand Mufti of Oman, Ahmed bin Hamad al-Khalili, indirectly criticized the treaty. Iraqi government spokesman Ahmed Mulla Talal said Iraq will not interfere in sovereign matters of other countries, but its laws didn't allow normalization of relations with Israel. Despite the lack of official response at first, the hashtag \\"Normalisation is Treason\\" started trending after the announcement, particularly among young Saudi activists. On August 19, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said the deal could be seen as positive, but his country will not normalize relations until peace is signed with the Palestinians, hopefully within the framework of the Arab Peace Initiative. On August 21, in an apparent response to Trump, who on August 19 said he expected Saudi Arabia to join the accord, Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud wrote that the price for normalizing relations with Israel is the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. He added that any Arab country that wants to follow the UAE's footsteps should demand a higher price for peace from Israel in future. =Palestine= Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) official Hanan Ashrawi lambasted the agreement, writing on Twitter that \\"Israel got rewarded for not declaring openly what it's been doing to Palestine illegally and persistently since the beginning of the occupation.\\" Fatah accused the UAE of \\"flouting its national, religious and humanitarian duties\\" toward the Palestinian people, while Hamas said it was a \\"treacherous stab in the back of the Palestinian people\\" and claimed the agreement was a \\"free reward\\" for Israeli \\"crimes and violations against the Palestinian people.\\" , senior adviser to President Mahmoud Abbas, read an official statement in which the Palestinian leadership rejected the agreement, terming it a betrayal against Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Palestinians. The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) recalled its ambassador from Abu Dhabi. Palestinian leaders also stated that Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh called Abbas and rejected the deal, something which Reuters called a \\"rare show of unity\\". Other leaders and factions including the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine unanimously rejected the agreement according to Al Jazeera. Palestinian National Initiative's leader Mustafa Barghouti said they were not surprised because of UAE's recent moves and the fact that the Emiratis never tried to fight Israel. He added that this might encourage other nations to ignore the Palestinian issue. Palestinian Liberation Front leader Wasel Abu Yousef said that the agreement only gave Israel more leverage for its occupation. PNA's minister of social affairs Ahmed Majdalani said they did not know about the deal in advance and the UAE was deceiving others, while unilaterally changing the Arab world's approach to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Ordinary Palestinians took to social media to protest the deal and some also insulted the UAE. Meanwhile, Fatah Central Committee member Abbas Zaki called the agreement a breach of Arab consensus on how to deal with the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. He accused the UAE of betraying the Arabs and the Palestinians, before urging the PNA to withdraw its ambassador from the UAE and also asked the Arab League to cancel the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. Late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's widow Suha Arafat however apologised to the UAE on Instagram for reactions of Palestinians to the deal, stating that she regretted that the flag of the United Arab Emirates was harmed by protestors in West Bank and photos of UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan were burnt, adding that those were not the values of Palestinian people. She asked the younger generation of Palestine to read about how UAE had supported them in the past. The apology was praised by the Emirati media, however met with criticism from Palestinian officials. =Iran= Iran's Tasnim News Agency said the Israel‚ÄìUAE deal was \\"shameful.\\" The Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the deal as a \\"dangerous\\" stab in the back of Palestinians and Muslims, terming it a \\"shameful\\" act of \\"strategic stupidity\\" by the UAE and Israel that would only serve to strengthen the \\"Axis of Resistance\\" in the Middle East. It added that the Palestinians and people of the world would never forgive the UAE, while also warning it against Israel interfering in the Gulf. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned the UAE that it will face dangerous repercussions for the deal. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani termed the agreement a \\"huge mistake\\" and warned the UAE against permitting Israel to have a secure presence in the Gulf. Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called it a betrayal against Arab and non-Arab countries in the Middle East. A group of protesters numbering fewer than 100 gathered in front of the embassy of the UAE in Tehran on August 15, chanting \\"Death to America\\" and \\"Death to Israel\\". The protesters also burnt the flag of Israel. The conservative newspaper Kayhan, whose editor-in- chief is appointed by the Supreme Leader of Iran, warned that the agreement had turned the UAE into a \\"legitimate, easy target\\". The UAE's Foreign Ministry summoned Iran's charg√© d'affaires on August 16 and criticized Rouhani's speech as \\"unacceptable and inflammatory\\" which could impact the security scenario of the Gulf. It also stated that protecting the Emirati embassy in Tehran was Iran's duty. Gulf Cooperation Council's secretary- general also condemned Iran's threats and told it to not interfere in affairs of other countries, adding that the GCC stood by the UAE against any threats to the country. The Chief of Staff of the Iranian armed forces Mohammad Bagheri meanwhile said that their strategy toward the UAE would now shift and the UAE would be held responsible in case of an attack on Iran through the Persian Gulf. Foreign Minister Zarif said on August 24 that the UAE could not buy security from Israel, which itself was not safe. He added that cooperation between countries in the Persian Gulf was the only way to security. Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei warned the UAE on August 26 that it will be held responsible for any threat to their country by Israel and stated that it should keep a watch on anti-Iranian activities by Israel inside it. The Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on September 1 accused the UAE with betraying the Islamic world, the Arab countries and Palestine. Khamenei stated that the normalization will be only temporary, but the UAE will forever have to bear the shame regarding the deal. He accused it of working against the interests of the Muslim world along with Israel and Kushner, hoping the country will soon repent for what it did. =Turkey= The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the agreement, saying history and the people of the Middle East would neither forgive nor forget what the UAE did, and that it was a violation of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. It called the UAE's behavior hypocritical and added that the Palestinians were correct in rejecting the agreement. President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan later stated that Turkey was considering suspending or cutting off diplomatic relations with the UAE in retaliation, as well as recalling its ambassador from Abu Dhabi. Presidential spokesperson ƒ∞brahim Kalƒ±n also expressed concerns regarding the deal to the US National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Brien. The Speaker of the Grand National Assembly Mustafa ≈ûentop condemned the deal, calling it \\"disgraceful\\" and a betrayal of the Palestinian cause. =Pakistan= Rallies and demonstrations were held in many cities across Pakistan to condemn the agreement between the UAE and Israel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs cautiously reacted and in a press statement termed the Israel‚ÄìUAE deal is having \\"far-reaching implications, and that Pakistan's approach will be guided by our evaluation of how Palestinians' rights and aspirations are upheld and how regional peace, security and stability are preserved.\\" The News International reported that Pakistan will give stance on the Israel‚ÄìUAE agreement after consultations and after examining pros and cons of the development on Pakistan's national interests. Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi avoided making comments on the sensitive subject. Prime Minister Imran Khan said on August 18 that Pakistan will never recognize Israel until a Palestinian state is created no matter what another country does, a statement in line with the vision of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Imran Khan added that one needs to think of the injustices suffered by Palestinians before trying to normalize relations with Israel. =Others= The Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi welcomed the deal, saying that he praises the parties' efforts to \\"achieve prosperity and stabilization in our region.\\" He also personally congratulated Emirate of Abu Dhabi's crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for the deal. Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the agreement should be followed up by Israel abandoning any plan to annex parts of the West Bank and if the deal could lead to its withdrawal from Palestinian territories, it would move the Middle East closer to peace. Otherwise, it would only exacerbate the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Mauritania, a member of the Arab League, said in a statement that it trusts the \\"wisdom and good judgment\\" of the United Arab Emirates leadership and highlighted the \\"absolute sovereignty and complete independence in conducting its relations and assessing the positions it takes in accordance with its national interest and the interests of Arabs and Muslims\\". Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah called the deal a betrayal against Islam, Arabism, Jerusalem and the Palestinians. He accused the UAE of doing a favor for Trump in view of the upcoming presidential election in the United States. Lebanese President Michel Aoun, whose Free Patriotic Movement party is an ally of Hezbollah, in contrast said Lebanon would be open to peace with Israel if their mutual problems were resolved and the UAE had the right to normalize its relations with Israel since it was a sovereign nation. In Yemen, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, leader of the Houthi movement's Supreme Revolutionary Committee, criticized the deal as treason against the Palestinians and the cause of pan-Arabism. Yemen's Foreign Minister Mohammad al-Hadhrami opposed the deal, saying the country will continue supporting the Palestinians and their rights. Abdulmalik Al-Mekhlafi, advisor to President of Yemen criticized the deal claiming it was opposed by all Arab nations and was against Arabism. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdelsalam said the deal was a provocation against Arab and Islamic nations, and it also showed that countries like the UAE involved in the Yemeni Civil War were trying to fulfil Israel's agenda. The Government of National Accord of Libya condemned the deal as an \\"unsurprising betrayal from the UAE.\\" The spokesman for Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Haidar Sadig was fired for making comments off his own accord wherein he called the deal a \\"brave and bold step\\", while claiming there were secret contacts between Sudan and Israel. Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok told Pompeo on August 25 that his transitional government had \\"no mandate\\" to establish relations with Israel and such a thing could only be decided after election of a democratic government. Bouthaina Shaaban, political and media advisor to the Syrian President, criticized the deal in her comments that appeared in Al-Watan newspaper, saying secret relations between the UAE and Israel existed for decades but now they revealed it publicly. She stated that there was nothing new in the deal and regretted that the Gulf nations were hostile to Iran, but want peace with Israel that detests the history of Arabs and forcibly takes Palestinian land. The Assembly of the Representatives of the People of Tunisia criticized the agreement and stated it stood in solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Protests were held by scores of people outside the embassy of UAE in Tunis, with people burning Israeli flags and photos of President of the United Arab Emirates Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan while supporting the Palestinian cause for independence. President of Tunisia Kais Saied later said that Tunisia would not interfere in the deal nor oppose it, but it stood with the Palestinians. Prime Minister of Morocco Saadeddine Othmani said that the country rejected any normalization of relations with Israel, which would only embolden it to increase its repression of Palestinians. Hundreds of people held protests against both UAE and Bahrain's peace deal with Israel on September 20 and burned an Israeli flag. The protesters called the two countries \\"treacherous\\" while also criticizing the United States and \\"Zionist allies\\". They also called for any normalization with Israel to be criminalized. In Somaliland, Bashe Omar Awil, envoy to Kenya welcomed the normalisation between the two countries. Stating that it \\"emphasizes eternal aspiration of reaching peace with neighbors\\" and it being a key example of how bilateral cooperation is paramount to regional stability .

The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement in which it stressed that as a member of the United Nations Security Council and Middle East Quartet, it supported the two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It noted that the agreement suspended annexation of parts of West Bank, which it termed as an important element of the deal, stating annexation plans were a major hindrance to resuming Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call with Netanyahu on August 24, said he hoped that the accord would increase the stability and security of the Middle East. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn in contrast doubted that the agreement would bring stability to the region, stating there will be no stability without a two-state solution, and said the UAE had let the Palestinians down with the agreement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs later issued a statement from him in which he stated that he was not being critical of the peace deal, but highlighting that it was important for Arab, especially Gulf states, to support a Palestinian statehood in line with the two-state solution. Others South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation expressed regret that the agreement was struck without any consultation with Palestinians, even though the deal was related to their future, and noted the agreement does not guarantee a permanent suspension of annexation of parts of the West Bank.

Aftermath On August 16, 2020, Israel and the UAE inaugurated direct telephone services. The Emirati company APEX National Investment and Israel's Tera Group signed an agreement to partner in research on COVID-19, making it the first business deal signed between companies of the two nations since normalization of ties. The director of the Mossad Yossi Cohen arrived in the UAE on August 18 to discuss security cooperation, regional developments as well as issues that concerned both countries with the National Security Advisor Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan. This marked the first visit of an Israeli official since the announcement of the deal. UAE formally ended its boycott of Israel on August 29. On August 17, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel was working to start direct flights to the UAE using Saudi Arabia's airspace. Netanyahu's office and other officials later denied reports of approving the United States' sales of F-35 warplanes to the UAE following the deal. Emirati foreign minister Anwar Gargash said in an interview with the Atlantic Council that the peace deal should remove any obstructions in acquiring the jets, though any sale would take years to negotiate and deliver and the UAE had not made a new request for them after the deal. Robert O'Brien, Jared Kushner and delegation of Israeli officials headed by Meir Ben-Shabbat in Abu Dhabi on August 31, 2020 An El Al spokesman announced on August 28 that the company will operate El Al 971, the first ever commercial flight between Israel and the UAE, flying from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport towards Abu Dhabi. Saudi Arabia allowed use of its airspace for the airplane to fly directly towards the UAE and it landed at Abu Dhabi International Airport. The flight carried a delegation of American and Israeli officials which included Jared Kushner, Robert C. O'Brien and Israeli national security advisor . The airplane had the word \\"peace\\" painted in Hebrew, Arabic and English languages painted above its cockpit window and received a red carpet welcome. Both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain later permanently opened their airspace for flights between Israel and UAE. On September 3, El Al announced that it would operate weekly indirect cargo flights to UAE through the Belgian city of Li√®ge, with the first one scheduled for September 16, carrying agricultural and high-tech equipment. On September 10, Israir became the first airline company to announce a direct flight route between Israel and UAE. The company stated that the flights will travel between the Ben Guiron Airport and the Abu Dhabi International Airport, taking three-and- a-half hours to reach their destination. Habtoor Hospitality became the first Emirati hotel group to start serving kosher food as part of its menu, partnering with Elli's Kosher Kitchen for its making. Abu Dhabi Department of Culture & Tourism issued a note to Abu Dhabi hotels, recommending they serve kosher food in menus as well as outlets. The Orthodox Union was selected to certify kosher food. The Emirati airlines Emirates' catering service Emirates Flight Catering announced on September 17, that it will establish a facility to produce kosher food called \\"Kosher Arabia\\" in partnership with CCL Holdings. UAE's first kosher-certified restaurant called \\"Armani/Kaf\\" opened in Armani Hotel Dubai on September 17, located in Burj Khalifa. On September 9, the Arab League refused to condemn the UAE's decision to normalize with Israel after several countries objected to the submitted Palestinian draft resolution. Nevertheless, secretary-general Ahmed Aboul Gheit said, \\"The goal all our Arab countries seek, without exception, is to end the occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.\\" Gheit confirmed rejection of any accords presented on an international stage, which negatively impacted Palestinian rights or the status of Jerusalem. On September 22, United States Secretary of Defense Mark Esper assured Israeli defense minister Benny Gantz during his visit to Washington that Israel's military edge will be protected, a sentiment earlier echoed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel and Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, who, following President Donald Trump saying that he personally had no problem with selling F-35s to the UAE, warned that any such decision would be scrutinized by the United States Congress. Analysis According to at the University of Helsinki, the agreement meant that Palestinians would think that the UAE put its own interests before those of the Palestinians, who had always assumed that Arab countries would not sign peace treaties with Israel before the rights of Palestinians had been guaranteed. Lisa Goldman, co-founder of +972 Magazine, stated that Netanyahu \\"never intended to annex\\" parts of the West Bank, but the UAE is \\"claiming a diplomatic victory in exchange for what's probably a lot of very valuable security cooperation from Israel. All on the backs of Palestinians, as usual.\\" Amira Hass wrote that the agreement is the product of ongoing neglect by the Palestinian National Authority of relations with the UAE. According to Hass, diplomatic relations were severed by the PLO in 2012, in repudiation of the UAE's good relations with Mohammed Dahlan, the political enemy of the PLO's chairman, Mahmoud Abbas. The PNA's animosity toward the UAE continued to June 2020, when the PLO rejected aid sent by the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic, on the grounds that it was sent without prior agreement and through an Israeli airport. Hass depicts a PLO more concerned with internal politics than with governance, contributing to an economic decline and strained foreign relations. On August 16, 2020, the Financial Times editorial board wrote that the accord, rather than delivering peace, is likely to exacerbate Palestinians' sense of hopelessness and produce more problems in the future as the Israeli and US governments have \\"shown no interest in a fair resolution of the Palestinian‚ÄìIsraeli conflict.\\" The New York Times regarded the accord as a timely foreign policy breakthrough for President Donald Trump in the context of the November 2020 presidential election, where opinion polling had him trailing his presidential challenger Joe Biden amidst pronounced social unrest in the United States and an economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Deutsche Welle's journalist Kersten Knipp stated that the Palestinians were looking for new allies post the deals of UAE and Bahrain with Israel, however allying with Iran and Turkey could upset the European Union member states. As such, they were eyeing Russia and Qatar to give support for their cause. Both the countries have some level of contact with Israel.

Situated in a valley, Chipping is approximately two miles (3.2 km) north of Buntingford and six miles (9.6 km) south of Royston. The A10 road (which follows the course of the Roman Ermine Street) passes through the village. Chipping is situated half a mile west of the prime meridian. Prior to 1750, Chipping was referred to as New Chipping, today this name is rarely used. History= Early history  The current settlement of Chipping first emerged along the former Roman Road Ermine Street as the manor of Pope's Hall (now Chipping Hall) then aart of Buckland village, as mentioned in the Doomsday Book. Former earthworks, including a moat (all destroyed in the 1950s) inside Burhill Wood to the west of Chipping, could suggest an earlier Iron Age settlement or hill fort, predating the present-day Chipping. Moat in Burhill Wood (1897) Chipping as an independent settlement to Buckland developed around 1220 as New Cheping (later becoming New Chipping), due to its strategic location along Ermine Street as a final stop-off for passing traffic before confronting several steep hills whilst travelling between London and York, and later, London and Cambridge. Chipping was the site of a market (every Friday) and fair (three days a year) from 1252 until 1360 before its transferal to nearby Buntingford by Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster the lord of the manor of Pope‚Äôs Hall due to its dwindling trade caused by Buntingford's rapid growth compared to Chipping.  After 1700  Chipping, 1905 (including the former Royal Oak public- house) From 1700 until the mid-nineteenth century the main occupation of Chipping's residence was farming, working the dense woodland and farmland surrounding the village, whilst other villages served passing trade along Ermine Street. However, Chipping has always been overshadowed by its larger neighbours of Buntingford to the south and Royston to the north, with its population remaining small, it was never large enough for the construction of a church. Sometime after its abolishment in 1360 the market was re- established, before it was finally aboloished in 1883. Until the late nineteenth-century Chipping was divided between the parish of Therfield, to the west side of Ermine Street and Buckland parish, to the east. A Post mill was formerly situated on Mill Hill to the east of the village from around 1737 until in 1838. The former public house, The Royal Oak, was destroyed by fire sometime in the 1980s, its site now hosts the Cul-de-sac Royal Oak Close. Today=Population The population of Chipping in 1851 was 215, however, with the development of the railway, causing decreased road traffic and growing demand for industrial workers in cities, meant Chipping's population fell to below 100 by 1905. Today Chipping has around 50 houses with a population of around 125 to 150 as of 2011. The parish of Buckland and Chipping has a combined population of 274 as of 2011, with the population roughly split between both villages. Local government Along with its neighbour Buckland, Chipping elects members to the Buckland and Chipping parish council. Chipping is in the Buntingford ward of the Hertfordshire County Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Additionally, Chipping is within the Buntingford ward of East Hertfordshire District Council, having two district councillors. On the national level, Chipping is in the North East Hertfordshire parliamentary constituency. Landmarks Chipping has an array of historic and modern landmarks, with over half of Chipping's current housing being built since the turn of the twentieth century. Chipping also includes several historic buildings, thatched cottages and a public house, many of which date back to the 17th century and earlier. Chipping Hall (Formely Pope's Hall) The Countryman (Inn) (formerly the Red Lion Inn until 1975) is a 17th-century coaching inn, built in 1663, it has operated as a public house since 1760. Situated in the centre of the village, The Countryman has hosted the yearly 'World Sausage Tossing Championship' every August since 2014. Chipping also includes the manor house of Chipping Hall (formerly Pope's Hall), with the current hall dating from the early eighteenth-century, the main hall, dovecot and walled gardens are constructed in early Georgian architecture from red brick. The manor of Pope's Hall was inherited by Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence from his wife Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster after her death in 1363. On the north side of Chipping Hall is a large eighteenth- century farmyard, once apart of Chipping Hall farm, it was sold and converted into housing around 2007. Chipping also includes a former Congregational Chapel which was constructed in 1844 and a former Mission Room constructed in 1878 for a cost of ¬£380, both are now in private ownership. Six houses along Chipping's Brookside lane were some of the UK's first council housing constructed under the Addison Act of 1919. Toponym The name Chipping likely derives from ceapen, an Old English word meaning 'market', referring to the market hosted in Chipping between 1252 and 1360, though it is also possible the name rather derives from the Medieval English word chepynge meaning 'long market square', supported by early references to Chipping as New Cheping. Chipping is a prefix name used by several places in England, however, only Chipping, Lancashire shares the sole use of the name Chipping. Chipping's historic name New Chipping used prior to 1750 (less commonly used until 1900) more specifically meaning 'new market'. The reason why new was dropped from Chipping's name is unknown, though this change was likely gradual, evolving from being New Chipping to just Chipping over several hundred years. Geography=Landscape Bridleway to Capons Wood Chipping is situated at the foot of three hills, to the north Chipping Hill, to the east Capons Hill and the west Mill Hill. Though historically Chipping was surrounded by dense woodland used for graving pigs and sheep, today only Capons Wood to the east and Burhill Wood to the west of the village survive (never have public right of way). College Wood (formerly adjacent to Capons Wood) was removed in the 1950s/60s, alongside the reduction in the size of Burhill Wood (around 80% of its total area) to make way for increased farmland. The River Rib runs through the village, with one bridge (Chipping Bridge) across the A10 and two fords along public footpaths crossing the river. The village of Buckland lies one mile north of Chipping, whilst the prime meridian passes to the east of Chipping. Wildlife The land surrounding Chipping is dominated by farmland growing Winter wheat, Rapeseed, Borage and Broad beans. Such a habitat has meant farmland birds such as the grey partridge, lapwing, skylark, yellowhammer and corn bunting can be found along the many bridleways and public footpaths surrounding Chipping, even though these birds are declining nationally.

Rosenberg (1874-1970) was an American lawyer, artist, humanitarian, and writer. In law, he is remembered for his handling of the collapsed business empire of the so-called \\"Swedish Match King,\\" Ivar Kreuger. In art, he is remembered for two types of pictures, on the one hand, realist landscapes of the Adirondack Mountains in which critics saw a strong feeling for nature and a refined rather than exuberant sensibility, and on the other, dramatic scenes that, as one critic said, \\"recall the Wall Street crash of 1929, the triumph of 'Ironism' in his native Pittsburgh and the potential terror of 'atomism' in the nuclear age.\\" As a humanist, he worked to protect freedom of speech, end the persecution of minority communities, aid refugees, and mitigate conflict among nations. In this work, he is remembered for leading a group of civic, religious, labor, racial, and business leaders whose single goal was the passage and subsequent ratification of the United Nations Genocide Convention. Early life and training Rosenberg was born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania on November 20, 1874. In 1879, his family moved to a building on the Upper West Side in Manhattan. As a child, he attended nearby Ethical Culture School and later became a boarding student at Gunnery Preparatory School in rural Connecticut. Both were known for liberal educational policies. He received his undergraduate education at Columbia College and upon graduating in 1895 entered Columbia Law School from which he obtained an LL.B. degree in 1898. During the summer of 1912, he attended a session of an art school in Woodstock, New York, but, as explained below, left after only two or three weeks. Career in law Rosenberg partnered with other Columbia Law graduates in a career that spanned nearly half a century. His specialty was the law of bankruptcy. After receiving his L.L.B. degree in 1898, Rosenberg joined the New York Bar. In 1900 he formed a law partnership with Joseph Proskauer, an attorney who had received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia College in 1896 and his law degree from Columbia Law in 1899. In the new practice Rosenberg specialized in bankruptcy law. During the years Rosenberg was studying Law at Columbia the United States Congress debated and finally, in 1898, passed a new law, the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, to regulate the dealings of insolvent businesses and their creditors. The law gave federal courts jurisdiction to oversee bankruptcy proceedings and it established a new court-appointed law officer, the referee in bankruptcy to act as the court's agent. One of Rosenberg's earliest court appointments occurred in September 1900, when the New York Supreme Court appointed him receiver in a claim made by a brewing company against a sign painting firm. In June 1901, he was appointed referee in a claim against a life assurance society. A few years later both Rosenberg and Proskauer joined the firm of James, Schell & Elkus. Although the firm continued to use the old name, both James (Edward C. James, 1841-1901) and Schell (Edward Paul Schell, 1836-1901) had by that time died. The firm's remaining partner, Abram Isaac Elkus, had graduated from Columbia Law School in 1888. In 1903 James, Schell & Elkus was named permanent counsel for a merchants' association that pooled its resources in order to take legal action against bankrupts who attempted to defraud their creditors. In that year Rosenberg was attorney for the creditors in the bankruptcy of a company that manufactured boilers and other steam appliances. His investigation showed that before the bankruptcy had been declared the president had taken a large sum of money out of the business for his personal use. In 1912 Rosenberg and another lawyer left James, Schell & Elkus to form a partnership called Rosenberg and Levis. In announcing the new firm the two men said they would be taking over the Elkus bankruptcy department and would continue as attorneys for the merchants' association. Rosenberg's partner, Robert P. Levis (1878-1943) was a lawyer in the Elkus firm who had graduated from Columbia Law School in 1903. He was, like Rosenberg, a bankruptcy specialist who received court appointments to act as receiver of bankrupts' assets. At this time, Rosenberg was named counsel for the receivers in a bankruptcy that was, as he later said, the biggest and best of his young career. The United States Motor Company was a large conglomerate of automobile manufacturers. It was deeply in debt and at the end of 1912 became insolvent. Early in 1913, the Maxwell Motor Company survived the breakup of the conglomerate (and would later evolve into the Chrysler Corporation). At this time, the head of the reorganization committee asked Rosenberg to replace Maxwell's retiring president, Benjamin Briscoe, move to Detroit, and manage the company. Rosenberg later said he rejected this \\"tempting proposal to become an industrial leader\\" from his conviction \\"that to accept would have meant farewell to the kind of life I wanted to lead.\\" The following year Rosenberg and Levis accepted Wilbur L. Ball as a partner. Wilbur Laing Ball (1874-1941), then a bankruptcy lawyer and later an insurance specialist, had been a classmate of Rosenberg's in Columbia Law School (LL.B. 1898). Rosenberg remained with Ball after Levis departed in 1917. Not long after this realignment, Rosenberg was named receiver in a stock market scandal. In 1920 a group of influential investors hired Rosenberg to counter an attempt by the head of the Stutz Motor Company to manipulate the price of the company's shares. The investors had all been short-selling Stutz, that is to say they placed bets that the share price would fall by borrowing large blocks of stock for which they promised to pay at a future date. Their gain on the short sale would be the difference between the price of shares when borrowed and the price when the borrowing period ended (and the shares were sold). After the company's president, Allan A. Ryan, used his control over the remaining (non- shorted) shares to drive the price up, the short-sellers were expected to pay a great deal more than they had hoped. Ryan's control over the remaining shares and consequent ability to manipulate their price was called a corner and thus this incident came to be known as the \\"Stutz Corner.\\" The event was later called \\"one of the most sensational operations in market history.\\" Rosenberg helped to engineer a settlement between Ryan and the group of investors through mediation by a committee of bankers (all of whom were to be \\"men of prominence and standing in the community, who would have the confidence of all parties\\"). In 1925, the partnership, now known as Rosenberg, Ball & Marvin, was said to be \\"the firm which did the largest corporation reorganization work in the United States.\\" The new partner was William Glenn Marvin (1892-1932) who had previously headed the legal department at National City Bank. A few years later, Ball and Marvin having left the firm, Rosenberg partnered with Godfrey Goldmark (1881-1968) and Ralph F. Colin (1901-1985) to form a firm that continued to operate from 1930 until Rosenberg's retirement in 1947. Goldmark had previously been corporation counsel for the New York Transit Commission and Colin was hired into the firm after graduating from Columbia Law in 1921. Late in his career, Rosenberg said his favorite case was the collapse of the empire of Ivar Kreuger, the so-called \\"Swedish Match King.\\" Exercising what one reporter called a \\"mysterious fascination\\" over bankers in the United States and Europe, Kreuger was able to build a small Swedish sign-painting business into a global conglomerate of 150 manufacturing plants with more than 60,000 employees that was said to produce 75% of the world's matches. When this empire crashed in 1932, a New York bank, the Irving Trust Company, was named receiver and trustee for the bankrupt firm and it retained Rosenberg, Goldmark & Colin as its attorneys. Over the course of the next 13 years, Rosenberg and his colleagues unraveled the complex affairs of the conglomerate while overseeing the management of the business that it operated. They discovered that the majority of assets listed in company books were fictitious and that Kreuger himself had stolen or squandered the most valuable assets prior to the collapse. Creditors made claims for more than one billion dollars of which about one-tenth was eventually allowed. One investigator provided this summary of Rosenberg's actions in the case: \\"The trustee's representatives, notably the law firm of Rosenberg, Goldmark & Colin, found themselves operating for several years a match business that extended from Norway to Turkey and from Spain to Syria and reached all the way out to the Philippines. The theory held and gradually put into practice by James N. Rosenberg, the senior counsel, however, was that there was no sound basis for Kreuger's match concessions once the depression started and the economic apple cart was everywhere upset. Rosenberg insisted on liquidating the foreign companies as quickly as possible and also disposing of foreign government bonds, and his approach was vindicated in the light of wartime disruption and post-war political developments.\\" The bankruptcy case was closed in November 1945 after $98,000,000 had been paid out to creditors. At Rosenberg's retirement in 1947, the firm, then called Rosenberg, Goldmark, Colin, & Kaye, was succeeded by Rosenman, Goldmark, Colin & Kaye. (Sydney M. Kaye (1900-1979) was an authority on copyright law and specialist in broadcast communications. Samuel Rosenman was a prominent New Deal Democrat and Columbia-trained lawyer. In 2002, following a number of other transitions, the firm of Katten Muchin Rosenman became successor to Rosenman, Goldmark, Colin & Kaye.) Humanitarian Rosenberg began working to benefit humanity while he was still an undergraduate. During those years he participated in amateur theatricals and in 1895 was a member of a group called the Don Quixote Club which gave a benefit show for New York's Hebrew Charities. In 1909 he was elected to the Hebrew Charities board of directors and continued in that role for the next decade. By 1921 he had been elected vice president of the Hebrew Charities' Desertion Bureau, an organization founded in 1905 that helped Jewish immigrant women whose husbands had deserted them. At the age of 46, he might be thought of as settled in his life's work. He was head of a family that included daughters aged 10 and 12 and he owned an apartment on Central Park West in Manhattan and a country home in Far Rockaway, Queens. He had achieved much success in the legal profession and some recognition as professional artist and playwright. Nonetheless, at the request of the banker, Felix M. Warburg, he became a member of the Joint Distribution Committee, of which Warburg was a principal leader, and, as its European director, took charge of efforts to help the hundreds of thousands of Jews who had become destitute during the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. Rosenberg agreed to devote a year of full-time work on the project and to contribute as much time as he could after returning to his normal life. At first, Rosenberg coordinated with the American Relief Administration, headed by Herbert Hoover, and later directed a separate organization, the American Jewish Joint Agricultural Corporation, known as Agro-Joint. By means of this organization and a subsidiary called the American Society for Jewish Farm Settlements in Russia, Rosenberg worked within the Soviet political system to help direct $8,000,000 of donated aid in order to resettle some 300,000 displaced Jews from Russian ghettos into farms, mainly in the Crimea. During a decade and a half the operation was a qualified success. Many many urban dwellers were able to transition to factory farming but others were at best reluctant to adopt the new way of life; the Soviet government gave both funds and cooperation, but was unwilling to cede necessary authority to the project. Agro-Joint ended tragically after the Soviets withdrew support in 1939 and the subsequent Nazi invasion resulted in the eastward displacement of most settlers and the extermination of the rest. During the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, Rosenberg was an energetic fundraiser for charitable causes. He was elected vice-chairman of the Joint Distribution Committee, headed fundraising drives in New York City, and took the lead in the city's fundraising for the Allied Jewish Campaign. In the early 1930s he became alarmed at the rise of Nazism. He participated in the JDC's German Relief Campaign and, calling the treatment of Jews an \\"unspeakable catastrophe,\\" urged influential German Jews to take antisemitic outrages seriously. On reading horrible antisemitic slanders in German newspapers he approached Jewish leaders in Berlin asking them to do everything they could to stop \\"the spreading of such poison.\\" Writing in 1935, he said, \\"A few of them assured me that such efforts were being attempted. But for the most part, the thing was looked on as a passing phase which would fall of its own weight.\\" In 1939 he helped found an umbrella organization via the merger of the Joint Distribution Committee with two other philanthropic groups. Called, United Jewish Appeal, its immediate objective was support of Jews who escaped Germany and Nazi-held territories. In 1940, after the United States and other industrialized democracies refused to admit more than small numbers of Jewish refugees, Rosenberg led a program to resettle Jews in the one country that declared it would welcome large numbers of them. This was the Dominican Republic, then ruled by a vicious dictator, Rafael Trujillo, and the program, called the Sosua Settlement, was a direct descendant of the Crimean settlement effort. The Nazi regime was at first amenable to Jewish emigration, but war conditions quickly made mass action impossible as travel through Europe and across the Atlantic became increasingly perilous. In the end, relatively few settlers made the journey and, as in the Crimea, some of them were reluctant to take up farming. He maintained his connection with the Joint Distribution Committee throughout the 1920s and 1930s. During that time he was named Chairman of the National Council, Chairman of the Executive Committee, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. In 1946 he was named its Honorary Chairman. Rosenberg also supported resettlement of refugees in Palestine. In 1929, he was one of the non-Zionist founders of the Jewish Agency for Palestine and was a director and co-founder of the Palestine Economic Development Corporation. During 1950, he traveled in Israel, meeting with Israeli leaders and the U.S. ambassador as part of an effort to increase Americans' private investment in the country. In 1937, Rosenberg had become a director of a newly formed group called the Better Understanding Foundation, a national organization of Christians and Jews that worked to promote understanding among people of different races and creeds. At the end of World War II, he resumed this aspect of his philanthropic work as a member of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. As chair of the conference's Committee on Human Rights, he pushed for adoption of an international bill of rights as essential to establishing a just and lasting peace at the close of World War II. In 1946 he became a vocal advocate of for the Genocide Convention being debated by the newly-formed United Nations. In 1948, he was elected chair of the newly-formed United States Committee for a United Nations Genocide Convention, a group formed to urge U.N. passage of the convention and, in 1950, he led the group in urging the U.S. Senate to ratify it. Composed of leaders from more than 45 civic, religious, labor, racial, business, and legal groups, the committee helped to achieve support for ratifying the convention from President Truman and key members of his administration. However, the elections of 1950 brought about a change in the composition of the U.S. Senate that made ratification impossible. At the time, Rosenberg ascribed the change to a resurgence of isolationism in the United States. In 1925, Rosenberg had published a law review article on the League of Nations World Court in which he advocated compulsory jurisdiction enforceable by moral suasion and public opinion but not force of arms. By this rule, states would agree to accept the court's jurisdiction but could not be forcibly compelled to abide by its judgments. The League of Nations did not adopt this rule. In 1965, Rosenberg made the same argument with respect to the United Nations World Court. The United Nations charter allowed for member states to accept that court's compulsory jurisdiction and many of them have done so. Rosenberg argued that the United States Senate should abandon its long-standing refusal to join this group of nations. Although Rosenberg had joined Grenville Clark in founding an organization that was devoted to the cause of world peace through law, he did not share Clark's passion for giving the United Nations power to enforce judicial decisions through force of arms. Deeming that impractical and undesirable, he said that while the policy he proposed would not be able to ensure compliance in all circumstances, it would probably do so in the great majority of them.

In 1910, he signed up for a summer session of art study in Woodstock, New York, but left after two or three weeks when it became obvious to him that the students were all trying to copy the instructor. He later said he preferred being Rosenberg to being a parrot. In 1911, he told an interviewer that he made sketches when he traveled, both on his daily commute from Far Rockaway to Manhattan and back and on his trips for vacations or business meetings. In 1921, he told another interviewer that although he was a professional artist, he did not exhibit in commercial galleries for the money he could earn from sales but rather \\"for the fun of it,\\" and in 1928 he added, \\"I certainly want people to buy [my paintings].\\" In 1911, he achieved a feat that was out of reach for most beginning artists when Louis Katz gave him a solo exhibition at his eponymous commercial art gallery on West 74th Street in Manhattan. An equally unlikely outcome was a long and appreciative review of this exhibition in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Crediting Rosenberg with a \\"poetic sense,\\" the paper's critic said the 40 pastels in the show were \\"sensitive and quietly impressive rather than bold and big in style, color,\\" and added, \\"the subtle handling of themes are important points in the work.\\" This critic went on to give favorable appraisals of many works by name, writing, for example, that \\"'Jamaica Bay, Emerald and Mauve,' shows a remarkable scenic effect, with its green-shot water and mauve areas. There are some evening effects with lights of big hotels along the shore, piercing the remembrance of sunset in the sky.\\" A critic for the New York Times was also impressed by the show, saying the pastels were \\"refined in color and show[ed] a vision sensitive to beauty.\\" Of two of them, this critic wrote, \\"'Wet Street,' is a poetic transcription of a scene many times noted by the artists of the city, and 'Steam and Mist' is another successful version of the mysterious and exquisite effects with which New York clothes her medley of architecture.\\" In 1913, Rosenberg received a second solo exhibition of pastels, this time at the Arlington Art Galleries in Brooklyn, and, once again, the works displayed received favorable critical notice. One critic praised a \\"refinement and practiced hand\\" and another said the pictures had \\"refined color and much feeling for nature.\\" A third critic was almost effusive, writing, \\"Many men aim at poetry through the medium of pictorial art, but it is not often they achieve the lyric bays so truly as this painter has done in this little group of pastels.\\" In 1916, he contributed a painting to the annual exhibition of the New York Water Color Club. In 1917, he exhibited in the first group exhibition held by the Society of Independent Artists. The following year he showed pastels at the Anderson Galleries with all proceeds from sales to be donated to the Red Cross. The show included landscapes and still lifes. A critic for the New York Tribune praised one of the former, \\"Scattering Clouds,\\" as a \\"strong piece of work\\" revealing \\"deep blue mountains\\" against an \\"exquisite turquoise sky.\\" In 1921, he showed with Marsden Hartley at the Anderson Galleries. The following year Rosenberg helped found a gallery called The New Gallery (and was called one of the gallery's \\"leading spirits and godfather\\"). The gallery was financed in part by an innovative scheme, the New Gallery Club, begun in February 1923. The club supported the gallery through its membership fees and it raised funds and publicized exhibitions by means of entertainments, teas, and receptions. Many club members were amateur artists whose work the gallery showed in special exhibitions. In 1924, Rosenberg showed three paintings in a group exhibition at the gallery. Four years later, he held a solo exhibition of Adirondack Mountain landscapes at the Erich Galleries. At that time he told an interviewer that he painted simply for the joy of it. He said, \\"I have no suppressed longing to live in the South Seas and do nothing but paint. And I have no 'message' to give the world. I happen to be very fond of the Adirondacks, and my summer home is located among them.\\" His painting, \\"Adirondack Cloudburst,\\" of 1946 (shown at right) is one of many mountain landscapes he made in the course of his career. In 1928, he contributed two paintings to a group exhibition of the Salons of America at the Anderson Galleries. In 1929, Rosenberg departed from the style of painting and subject matter of his earlier work when he produced what turned out to be his best- known piece, a lithograph called \\"Dies Irae\\" (Day of Wrath), showing the October 29, 1929, Wall Street Crash as a horrific scene of destruction. On January 12, 1930, the New York Times put a reproduction of the lithograph on the front page of its Sunday magazine. \\"Dies Irae\\" is shown at left. Later that year, he was given a solo exhibition of Adirondack Landscapes at the 56th Street Galleries in Manhattan. In 1943, 15 years after a Red Cross benefit in the First World War, Rosenberg showed watercolors and pastels at the Ferargil Gallery with proceeds from sales once again to benefit the American Red Cross. Reviewing the show in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, the critic, A.Z. Kruse said, \\"Mr. Rosenberg holds his own admirably, even in this hectic week filled with proficient exhibitions.\\" He wrote that the paintings showed \\"creative realism\\" and a \\"basic charm\\" and praised the show's watercolors as among the best then being produced. \\"Spring Valley,\\" shown at right, illustrates his watercolor technique at this time. Rosenberg showed at Ferargil again the following year. The show featured paintings that differed greatly from his usual serene landscapes. Some depicted what a critic called the \\"smoke and flame\\" of Pittsburgh's steel mills and others the horrors of war and oppression. At that time a feature writer for the New York Post interviewed him for a lengthy profile in which he admitted that while he painted for the pleasure of it, the impetus for these paintings came from a necessity to express his feelings about the state of the world in the midst of the Second World War. When Rosenberg retired from his law practice in 1947, he began a practice of donating works from his collection and proceeds from exhibition sales to charitable causes. In that year, he was given a solo exhibition at the Wildenstein Galleries. Howard Devree, a critic for the New York Times, who had briefly criticized Rosenberg's 1943 exhibition as \\"earnest\\" but \\"not very impressive,\\" gave this show a long and quite favorable review. He noted that some of the paintings had been loaned by private collectors and others by prominent museums, including the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and that W. G. Constable of the Boston Museum had written the foreword to the accompanying catalog. Devree said \\"Mr. Rosenberg's painting is never pretentious or sensational. The play of light, the fleeting mood of a landscape, always such challenges to the artist, he strives to capture simply‚Äînot by literal transcription but with a warmly understanding interpretation.\\" On passing the age of 80 in 1954 he continued to paint and exhibit, including a show of work made during the trip he made to Israel to meet with Ben Gurion and others. Regarding one of these shows, a New York Times critic, Stuart Preston, praised the emotional power of his mountain landscapes and his landscapes showing the devastation that he imagined would result from atomic war, but he was less enthusiastic about their artistic value. He wrote, \\"The very humanity of Rosenberg's feelings goes far to excuse the esthetic shortcomings of the paintings.\\" When Rosenberg was 85, in 1959, he showed 40 of his paintings in Baltimore. The show coincided with the publication of a memoir, A Painter's Self-Portrait (New York, Crown Publishers, 1958). The conjunction of the show, the publication, and his birthday was the impetus for a lengthy profile of his career in art that appeared in the Baltimore Sun in which the interviewer said Rosenberg's age was deceptive. Rosenberg, he said, was \\"timeless.\\" A few years later, when he turned 87, he was again interviewed, this time during a benefit exhibition of oils and pastels given in honor of a spiritual mentor and friend, the Rabbi, Jonah Wise. The interviewer, John W. Stevens of the New York Times, summarized both Rosenberg's charitable intentions and the contrasting visions reflected in his art: \\"Although hundreds of paintings he has given to hospitals and to the State Department for display abroad reflect 'peace, joy and beauty,' Mr. Rosenberg has not turned his back on tragedy. In colleges and universities, in the homes of friends and art collectors, and in art centers on three continents, his paintings and lithographs dramatically recall the Wall Street crash of 1929, the triumph of 'Ironism' in his native Pittsburgh, and the potential terror of 'atomism' in the nuclear age.\\" \\"Pastel Trees,\\" shown at left, is an example of his pastel technique at this time. In 1964, on his 90th birthday, when Rosenberg prepared an exhibition benefiting the Westchester Art Society, he was again accorded an extensive interview. In it, he said he had never sold a painting for more than $1,000 but had given away thousands until he had denuded his home. A year later, presented President Johnson with a large montage to celebrate passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Labeled \\"Birth of the Great Society,\\" it contained clippings from newspapers and magazines and photos that Lady Bird Johnson had sent him. Artistic style and critical reception Rosenberg's art is representational. Called a \\"romantic realist,\\" he adopted Paul C√©zanne as his model and explicitly rejected the New York art world's shift toward abstraction in the late 1940s. In a 1959 interview he acknowledged that his style was no longer fashionable and said he was content to serve the needs of his art in his own way. More than that, he disdained the \\"contemporary avalanches of abstract paintings\\" and said abstract artists had \\"nothing new to communicate.\\" He made pastels and oils throughout his career. Beginning in the 1920s he made lithographs and late in his career he made at least one montage. He made landscapes, particularly of scenes from the Adirondack Mountains, where he owned extensive property, but also of scenes from places where he traveled on vacation or business. These paintings were said to show a strong feeling for the natural environment and were seen as refined rather than exuberant. He made cityscapes. One example of the latter is an oil called \\"New York in Snow,\\" shown at right. And he chose current events as his subjects. These include celebrations, such as an early pastel, \\"Victory Parade --Return of the 27th Division, AEF, 1919\\" and a late pastel, \\"March Parade of Colonel John B. Glenn (New York City, March 1, 1962),\\" but they also include the prints he made showing tragic events, both real (such as the 1929 stock market crash) and imaginary such as the devastation that would be caused by atomic warfare). He preferred to paint in a studio using sketches made outdoors. \\"I see too much when I try to paint from the subject itself,\\" he once said. Writer The prep school that Rosenberg attended prided itself on the strength of its English Language and Literature courses and, after graduating from it, he considered whether he might become a man of letters. During his years as an undergraduate at Columbia College, he wrote poetry and performed in a theater group called the Don Quixote Club. He later reported that one of his professors, the critic and poet, George Edward Woodberry, helped to foster this ambition. As a senior in 1895, he helped found and edit a Columbia literary magazine called \\"The Morningside.\\" Poetry In 1897, Rosenberg co-edited a compilation of poetry by Columbia University students called Columbia Verse (New York, W.B. Harison). The other editor was his fellow student and later law partner, Joseph M. Proskauer. Rosenberg contributed poems called \\"Ah, She Lurks,\\" \\"Let Us Love and Laugh To-day,\\" \\"Man,\\" \\"God,\\" \\"Darkness,\\" \\"Fragment,\\" and \\"The Nineteenth Psalm.\\" In 1900 he contributed poems to an alumni-authors issue of the Columbia Literary Monthly. In 1926 he wrote a long poem about antisemitism in Europe called \\"Roman Holiday: Conversation Piece,\\" which was not published until 1947 (New York, T. Yoseloff). His play, Punchinello (New York, Mitchell Kennerley, 1923) was written in free verse. Theater Having already established himself as lawyer, philanthropist, and artist, Rosenberg made a name for himself as dramatist with the publication, in 1917, of a play, \\"The Return to Mutton,\\" and its performance in Manhattan the following year. One critic said the play was witty and clever, having a predictable plot, but interesting situation and characters. Another dismissed its publication as a waste of paper. A Manhattan repertoire company, the Henderson Players, considered the play to be one of its most popular productions during the spring season of 1918. In 1919, Rosenberg joined the advisory group of the Theatre Guild and a few years later published another play, \\"Punchinello, a Ballet,\\" which received positive reviews from book critics but which does not appear in databases of plays that were produced at that time. One critic called it \\"swift, bright, and clever,\\" and another said \\"reading it is an unqualified delight.\\" The play's publisher, Mitchell Kennerley was a gallery owner as well as editor and publisher. President of Anderson Galleries, from 1916 to 1929, he had shown Rosenberg's works along with Marsden Hartley's in a 1921 exhibition. The name, Punchinello, was a variant of Punch from the Punch and Judy puppet shows. In 1927 Rosenberg's play,Wall Street; A Romantic Melodrama, was performed in the Hudson Theatre on Broadway. Starring Arthur Hohl, it portrayed the downfall of fast-rising and double-dealing stockbrokers and the inevitable losses suffered by their customers. Critics gave it mixed reviews, one summarizing the plot as, \\"a group of soulless, money mad, soul withered human animals deliberately try[ing] to beat the oldest and most obvious of natural laws and suffer[ing] the prescribed penalty.\\" Law Rosenberg wrote legal treatises and articles in law journals on bankruptcy and resulting corporate reorganizations. He also wrote on the legal aspects of his humanitarian concerns. The articles appeared mainly in the Columbia Law Review. His book on reorganization is Corporate Reorganization and the Federal Court, written with Robert T Swaine and Roberts Walker (New York, Baker, Voorhis & Co., 1924). Humanitarianism Publications containing interviews, lectures, and newspaper articles flowed from Rosenberg's extensive work to achieve humanitarian goals. Throughout his adult life he wrote articles, books, and opinion pieces aimed at protecting freedom of speech, ending the persecution of minority communities, aiding refugees, mitigating conflict among nations, and preventing the recurrence of genocide. In 1918, he wrote a treatise on President Wilson's proposals for a world court and in 1925 wrote two articles on strengthening the world court that had been set up by the League of Nations, one in the Columbia Law Review and the other in The Nation. In 1938 he wrote an article on freedom of speech in Public Opinion Quarterley. In 1947, he wrote a short work on the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 1928, he wrote Censorship in the United States (New York, Court Press, 1928). Art From 1920 to 1922, Rosenberg spent a brief time as an art critic, writing articles for the profusely illustrated American edition of the British periodical, International Studio. In the issue for December 1920, he reviewed a large exhibition put on by the Society of American Artists. He thought much of the work was complacent and imitative, but praised Rockwell Kent for his \\"inviolability of self\\" in being sensitive to the work of others, but nonetheless completely himself. March 1921 he wrote an appreciation of Edgar Degas in which he said Degas was an aristocrat who saw the world clearly enough to depict it without sentimentality or prejudice. In April 1921, he reviewed the large exhibitions of the National Academy of Design and Society of Independent Artists of that season, deploring widespread imitation of outmoded European styles on the one hand and praising instances of American originality on the other. In the issue of May 1921, he gave a glowing review to a book called Art and I by C. Lewis Hind (New York, John Lane & Co. 1921). In the issue for August of that year he wrote an ironic comparison of engraved stock certificates versus artists' etchings from a collector's point of view. Like all artists, Rosenberg was given credit as author of art exhibition catalogs for the solo shows in which he participated as well as those in which he was a major participant. Some of Rosenberg's prints were also reproduced in a book called 50 lithographs [by] James N. Rosenberg (New York, H.N. Abrams, 1964). Other writings Rosenberg wrote two memoirs and his son-in-law, Maxwell Geismar, edited a compilation of his papers. On the Steppes (New York, London, A.A. Knopf, 1927) recorded his experiences in Eastern Europe and, in particular, Soviet Russia, during the time he spent there as head of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Commission for Europe and as president of the American Society for Jewish farm settlements in Russia. A Painter's Self-Portrait (New York : Crown Publishers, 1958) has a great number of reproductions of his work but gives his life story and is a more balanced account than the title suggests. Unfinished Business (Mamaroneck, Vincent Marasia Press, 1967) is a selection from Rosenberg's personal archives. Like Painter's Self-Portrait it includes many reproductions artworks and recounts his life story. Personal life and family Rosenberg was born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania on November 20, 1874. His father was Henry Rosenberg (born in Bavaria in 1846, died in New York in 1927). During Rosenberg's early childhood his father was an officer with a Pittsburgh insurance company, the Modern Life and Improvement Trust Company. In 1879 the family moved to Manhattan where Henry Rosenberg joined his brothers-in-law, Max and William Naumburg, in a wholesale clothing business called M & W Naumburg. Rosenberg's mother was Henrietta Naumburg Rosenberg (born in 1850 in Maryland, died in 1944 in Manhattan). He had two sisters, Minnie, born in 1876, who did not marry and who lived with her parents and then with her brother, and Florence (1889-1918), who married a physician, Morton E. Hart, and lived in California. In 1905, Rosenberg married Bessie Herman (1875-1979). She was born in Baltimore to Joseph M. Herman (1851-1920), a successful Boston shoe manufacturer, and Hennie (Adler) Herman (1862-1950). The Rosenbergs had two daughters and a son. The elder daughter was Elizabeth Rosenberg Zetzel (1907-1970) who served as a Major in the British Army during World War II and who subsequently became a well-known psychiatrist and early advocate for the use of psychiatric drugs in combination with psychotherapy rather than psychotherapy alone. The younger daughter, Anne (1909-2011) was an editor and author. She is best known for being the supportive wife of Maxwell Geismar (1909-1979). He was a left-leaning literary historian and book critic who became famous for his attack on the literary establishment for its adulation of the works of Henry James. He was also editor of Rosenberg's last publication, Unfinished Business: James N. Rosenberg Papers (Marasia Press, 1967). Rosenberg's son, Robert S. Rosenberg (1923-1995), was a stockbroker who served as a U.S. Army Air Force pilot during World War II. He is remembered for flying 36 strategic bombing missions over Germany between November 1944 and April 1945. Rosenberg's Naumburg relatives were notable for their civic engagement, for their patronage of art and music, and for the extent of their philanthropy. Rosenberg's uncle Max had a daughter, Alice (1881-1959), who, in 1903, married his classmate and law partner, Joseph Proskauer. Alice Naumburg Proskauer became well known in New York as an urban planning specialist, advocate for fair treatment of tenants, and proponent of affordable housing. She was a director of the New York Urban League and of the New York City Housing Corporation. She headed the Housing Section of New York's Welfare Council and played a major role in the construction of the Sunnyside Gardens housing development in Queens. Rosenberg's great-uncle, Elkan Naumburg, created a fund for an annual series of summer orchestra concerts in New York's Central Park and donated the band shell where the performances are held. His sons, George (1876-1970) and Walter (1867-1959), liquidated their successful banking business to devote themselves to charitable causes. They supported the Central Park orchestra concerts begun by their father. In addition, George Naumburg was a founder and vice president of Parents' Magazine and supporter a variety of child welfare organizations. He also supported and helped to direct organizations devoted to resettling refugees who fled Nazi oppression. Walter Naumburg founded the Naumburg Foundation, which sponsors debuts for young classical musicians that are said to be among oldest and most prestigious music competitions in the world. Rosenberg's uncle, Aaron Naumburg (1859-1928), was a wealthy New York hat manufacturer who assembled a collection of old master paintings that his wife left to Harvard at his death along with funds for the construction of a new wing on the university museum and the placement within the wing of the \\"Naumburg Rooms,\\" a Jacobean hall that Aaron Naumburg and his wife had installed within the large apartment where they lived. His aunt, Margaret Naumburg (1890-1983), was a child education specialist who established the first Montessori school in the United States in 1914 and the Walden School in 1915. She was a connoisseur of contemporary art and enthusiastic proponent of art therapy. Rosenberg's maternal grandfather was Louis Naumburg (1813-1902). Coming from a long line of cantors dating back to 1612, he was himself a cantor as well as rabbi. From 1865 to 1870 he led the Rodef Shalom Congregation which was the first synagogue established in Pittsburgh. Louis Naumburg's daughter, Carrie (1849-1947) was a philanthropist and wife of Judge Josiah Cohen (1840-1930), president of Rodef Shalom Congregation and, after Oliver Wendell Holmes, the second oldest jurist in the country. Both the Rosenberg and Naumburg families supported the Society for Ethical Culture in New York. Rosenberg's parents joined the society and he was a student at the Ethical Culture School. His Naumburg cousins also studied there and one of them, Eleanor Naumburg Sanger was one of its teachers. Rosenberg's uncles Max, William, and Edward Naumburg and their wives were enthusiastic supporters. Rosenberg's family and some of his Naumburg relatives lived on the Upper West Side in Manhattan and owned summer homes in what was then the fashionable summer colony of Far Rockaway in Queens. Rosenberg was active in local organizations in that vicinity. Rosenberg died on July 21, 1970, in White Plains, New York. He had been living for many years in neighboring Scarsdale. A tribute from the officers and directors of the Joint Distribution Committee described him as a \\"noted attorney and distinguished artist, above all a great humanitarian, one who devoted more than half his life to the service of needy Jews overseas and at home.\\" External links Notes References Category:1874 births Category:1970 deaths Category:20th-century American painters Category:American realist painters Category:American landscape painters Category:Artists from Pittsburgh Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:American humanitarians ","title":"James N.

It consists of a silver balance coming out of the coat of arms on the left and that holds an ear of grain representing the wealth of the city's cereals. On the canton (corner) of the coat of arms is the of a Tatar tribe, a unique symbol of Cimi»ôlia. The field is blue, representing the sky and other values and elements. Above the coat of arms is a mural crown with three towers. It was proposed to use the coat of arms on the flag of Cimi»ôlia, which was approved for a few months before the flag was changed again to its current form. The process for the adoption of a coat of arms for Cimi»ôlia was long. It began in March 2007 after a request from the mayor. A contest was organized in the city, but the proposals sent were ultimately rejected. The Cimi»ôlia City Council asked the National Heraldry Commission (CNH) and a local painter for assistance. They designed Cimi»ôlia's current coat of arms, and upon its submission, it was adopted on 16 June 2009. Description On a blue field, a Roman silver balance protrudes from the left side of the coat of arms. On its weighing pan is found a golden ear of grain. This reflects the importance Cimi»ôlia had in the past due to its cereal trade. Bread was brought from all neighboring localities and trade exceeded 500,000 rubles. Nowadays, agriculture is still important for the city. In the canton (corner) of the coat of arms is the (a tool for livestock) of the , the Romanian name of a Tatar tribe from which the name Cimi»ôlia originates. This is golden in color and consists of a ring with a line, straight at first and inverted at the end. It is considered the most unique and individualizing element of the city, and its importance is marked by the use of the color gold and its placement in the canton of the shield, a position of \\"maximum honor\\". The coat of arms is \\"stamped\\" by a golden mural crown of three towers. This shows Cimi»ôlia's status as a city and capital of the Cimi»ôlia District. The blue color of the shield represents the sky, infinity, dreams and a peaceful and free life. The flag of Cimi»ôlia was based on the coat of arms, preserving all the meanings of the latter. History The flag of Cimi»ôlia, which was based on the coat of arms and which used it in earlier versions In March 2007, the mayor of Cimi»ôlia, Ion Alexandreanu, requested the collaboration of the National Heraldry Commission (CNH) to create a flag and coat of arms for the city. The preparatory documentation for this lasted a year, and in early 2008, a competition was announced. Participants would send their submissions for a flag and coat of arms, being 12 March 2008 the deadline. Contest winners would win two cash prizes of 1000 lei (almost $100 then) each. On 10 March, the Cimi»ôlia City Council issued a decision setting up a commission to elaborate the city's symbols and approving its working regulations. This commission consisted of ten people. The president was the mayor Gheorghe RƒÉileanu (who had replaced Alexandreanu), while the secretary was Radion Nechit, a specialist in juvenile and sportive problems. Another notable member was the vice mayor Sergiu Ple»ôca, whose actions were decisive during the process in later years. The winner of the contest was the geography teacher Eremei Lavric. He received the award of 1000 lei and became the leader of the process for the adoption of a coat of arms and flag. For the former, he had a proposal: *On the first half of the coat of arms, there would be a blue church raised by a six-armed cross to represent Christianity. In front of it, there would be a golden sun rising from the line that separates both halves of the coat of arms and illuminating the first of them. On this separatory line, there would also be a wavy blue band evoking the Cog√¢lnic river, which passes through the city. The church and the sun were to be surrounded by a green ribbon, symbolizing the \\"labyrinths of the city\\". A stork is also found in this half. *Regarding second half, there would be a bunch of grapes held by the stork in the upper half. This represents the symbol of Moldovan winemaking. Starting from the bunch of grapes, there is a gully with three \\"terraces\\" and deep thresholds to reference the relief of Cimi»ôlia. According to Lavric, it represents the of real estate of the locality, of which have great paleontological value. The lilac color of the field represents \\"the hospitality of the people of Cimi»ôlia, a characteristic of the steppes of Budjak\\", as well as \\"the traditional cosmic color of the Moldovans, the awakening color of each one of us: joy, good humor, greatness, prosperity\\". *Finally, a mural crown with three towers representing Trajan's Wall is found above both halves. Lavric also proposed to write the name of the city in Latin characters in a way similar to the formerly used Cyrillic alphabet. It was also thought to include two ears of wheat surrounding the sun to represent agriculture, as well as an improvised \\"ladle\\" in the frame of the coat of arms representing the of the , but they were dropped from the final result. In addition, the flag he designed included this coat of arms in the middle. Nevertheless, Lavric's proposals presented several artistic, heraldic and semantic problems, and some of the elements he used were not considered sufficiently \\"individualizing\\" by the local authorities. Therefore, at the end of 2008, the Cimi»ôlia City Council requested the assistance of the CNH and the painter Victor Hristov, a native of Cimi»ôlia, to make new designs for a flag and coat of arms. Hristov had already made a coat of arms for the competition. It had a French style, cut in two blue and red halves by a golden line, alluding the Moldovan flag. A silver horse holds with the right front hoof a golden ear and with the left front one a Spanish-like coat of arms with a common grape vine (whose leaves and stem are green and its racemes are blue) on a golden field. The coat of arms is \\"stamped\\" with a silver mural crown with a tower with a golden Christian cross above. Hristov, together with the heraldist and vexillologist Silviu Andrie»ô-Tabac (a member of the CNH), prepared both a flag and a coat of arms in December 2008 and artistically and technically defined them at the end of March 2009. After this, they were presented to the local authorities. The mayor of Cimi»ôlia, with doubts about their quality, requested on 2 June 2009 an examination by the CNH of the two symbols to discuss them later in a city council meeting. The local authorities decided to separate the question of the coat of arms and the flag and on 16 June, they approved the current coat of arms for the city. Subsequently, the CNH approved the coat of arms two days later. The process for the adoption of a flag would take longer. On 4 February 2010, the Cimi»ôlia City Council approved a flag with the coat of arms in the canton, but following disagreements with the CNH, the flag was changed and the current version with nothing in the canton was adopted on 30 June 2010. The adoption of the coat of arms and the flag was ultimately confirmed on 25 March 2015 after the decision nr. 324-IV.01 of the CNH.

Life  Born in Fu√üg√∂nheim (Palatinate), Leibl comes from a family of Bavarian officials and innkeepers and first learned the cooper's trade before he could dedicate himself to music. Leibl first worked as a music teacher at the Bayrischer Hof. In 1826 he became Cathedral Kapellmeister in Cologne and directed the \\"Verein der Dommusiken und Liebhaberkonzerte\\" (Association of Cathedral Music and Lover's Concerts) there. In the same year he also took over the direction of the St√§dtischer Singverein, which in 1827 merged with the Musikalische Gesellschaft to form the new C√∂lner Concert-Gesellschaft, whose choir still exists today as the G√ºrzenich-Choir. This society, under the patronage of wealthy citizens, organized its concerts in the G√ºrzenich Orchestra Cologne from 1857 onwards - from which the G√ºrzenich Orchestra of the City of Cologne, which still exists today, ultimately emerged. Leibl was active at a difficult time of political and social upheaval. As a result of laws passed after the Napoleonic occupation in 1794, the guilds were dissolved and spiritual foundations, monasteries and 42 Cologne churches were closed down in the course of secularization. As a result, supporting elements of the city's musical life were now missing. In 1815 the city of Cologne became Prussian. The following economic upswing favored the development of the musical life, which was professionalized under Leibls leadership. Through Cologne's participation in the Niederrheinisches Musikfest, which was founded in 1817 and was also held in Cologne from 1821, the city became a centre of attraction for foreign musicians. Family grave at the Melaten cemetery in Cologne Leibl's time includes the rise, climax and end of the classical- romantic church music at Cologne Cathedral in the 19th century. In 1863, the reform of the Cecilian Movement ensured that choral music accompanied by orchestra was banned in Cologne as well. The musical participation of women in church services as choir or solo singers was also prohibited. The music of the Cologne Cathedral Chapel is a treasure of the Diocesan Library of Cologne as Musikaliensammlung Leibl. Leibl was married with Maria Gertrud Lemper, daughter of Jakob Lemper, professor at the in Cologne, and Anna Catharina Franziska Blanck. One of the six children of the Leibl couple was the painter Wilhelm Leibl, who was born in 1844. His burial place is on the Melaten cemetery in Cologne.

Biography=Period under German Empire rule Marian Turwid was born on November 28, 1905, in Wrze≈õnia, at the time located in the Province of Posen, Prussia. He was the son of Kazimierz Kaczmarek, a merchant and Julia, n√©e Jakubowska. After graduating from Wrze≈õnia primary school, he studied at the gymnasium and then at the State Male Teachers Seminary () in Gniezno: there he passed the Matura exam in 1926. Interwar period Building of the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow Bydgoszcz old granaries View of Bydgoszcz Venice With his matura, he became in 1926, a teacher at a public elementary school in Borzykowo in Wrze≈õnia County. Then, between 1926 and 1929, Marian studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow at the Faculty of Painting and Sculpture. He learned under the guidance, among others, of the following professors: W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jarocki, Teodor Axentowicz, Xawery Dunikowski or Fryderyk Pautsch. On December 3, 1929, he passed the drawing exam for teachers and completed his studies in October 1930. From 1931 onwards, Marian Turwid was a drawing teacher at High School No. 6 in Bydgoszcz. In 1935, he obtained professional qualifications allowing him to teach drawing in Polish in general secondary schools or as a state/private teacher in training seminaries. Meanwhile, he took an active part in the artistic life of Bydgoszcz and Greater Poland. He was the chairman of the Pomeranian Artists' Union and the secretary of the Artistic and Cultural Council of Bydgoszcz (1937-1939). From 1930, he was a member of the Association of Polish Artists and Designers (as will be in 1945, Bydgoszcz sculptor Piotr Triebler) and Polish Writers' Union. As a writer and artist, Marian made his debut in Wrze≈õnia Spokesman (). In 1926, his first book was published, Legends of Wrze≈õnia, and a year later, the first exhibition of his paintings was held in Wrze≈õnia. From this moment on, Marian started using the nickname Turwid. Later, he will change his name to Turwid-Kaczmarek. Between 1931 and 1937, he has been the chief editor of the artistic and literary monthly Wici Wielkopolskie. In 1931, he published a book of drawings Szkice portretowe (Portrait Sketches) and a portrait of General J√≥zef Haller, which was his diploma work crowning his studies at the Krakow Academy of Fine Arts. In 1932, a volume of poetry was published, Dni Wielkiej Doliny (The Days of the Great Valley). Some of his poems found their way up into national anthologies, such as Morze w poezji polskiej (Sea in Polish Poetry) in 1937 or Antologia 120-u (120th Anthology) in 1939 and 1947. Turwid also wrote articles about culture and literature for several daily newspapers: Kurier Pozna≈Ñski, Dziennik Bydgoski, Gazeta Bydgoska, PrzeglƒÖd Bydgoski. From time to time, he contributed to the Pozna≈Ñ cultural monthly Tƒôcza (Rainbow magazine) and the Kashubian Gryf (Griffin). He made various artistic trips to hone his painting skills: Paris (1936), Vienna, Berlin and Budapest. In 1936, Marian Turwid joined the Grupa Plastk√≥w Bydgoskich, gathering local artists like graphic designer Stanis≈Çaw Brzƒôczkowski, painter W≈Çadys≈Çaw Frydrych or sculptor Teodor Gajewski. The main topic of his works was aiming at the issue of tradition versus present day in the Wielkopolska-Pomeranian region. Many poems were devoted to Bydgoszcz and his symbols: The Archer, the old granaries, Mill Island, the Cathedral, the Bydgoszcz Venice (pl). These places and figures released in him the need for a personal tie with the city's architecture, its nature and its inhabitants. His identity reflects the 1930s local mood towards organizing an environmental culture Bydgoszcz, open to national literary trends. World War II period In the first days of German occupation, Marian was arrested by Gestapo, who confiscated his studio with all his artistic works. In autumn 1939, he moved to his hometown Wrze≈õnia where he worked in his parents' company until 1942. From 1942 till 1945, he was employed by a German firm as a room painter (1942-1945). Post-war period Bydgoszcz School of Fine Arts Pomeranian Arts House in Bydgoszcz In March 1945, Marian Turwid returned to Bydgoszcz, where he was designated head of the Fine Arts Department at the Office of Culture and Art of the Pomeranian Voivodeship. He was the lead editor of the cultural supplement Ilustrowany Kurier Polski, ordering articles from writers and scientists from all over Poland. In 1946, he set up in Bydgoszcz the State School of Fine Arts (renamed in 1947 the State Secondary School of Fine Arts) and was its first director until 1972, when he retired. The school still stands today at 2 Konarskiego street. At the same time, he became director of the State Center for Art and Culture in Bydgoszcz. On his initiative, the Pomeranian Arts House in Bydgoszcz was created, where a permanent art exhibition was established with contributions coming from Pomeranian members of the Association of Polish Artists and Designers. From 1950 to 1972, he led the Central Bureau of Artistic Exhibitions, Bydgoszcz Branch (), together with the Toru≈Ñ branch. Influential cultural and artistic activist, Marian Turwid co-organized in 1945 the Bydgoszcz Literary and Artistic Club, the Pomeranian branch of the Association of Polish Artists and Designers and the Pomeranian Association of Polish Writers. He was a co-founder and cheaf editor of the journal Arkona, one of the first cultural magazine in Poland with the Lublin-based Kamena. For many years (1961-1983), he has been active in the Kujawsko-Pomorskie Towarzystwo Kulturalne (Kuyavian-Pomeranian Cultural Society). Seat of the Bydgoszcz Scientific Society Between 1945 and 1975, Marian Turwid issued nearly 700 original books and works published in local and national magazines. Some of Turwid's poems were brought out in almanacs: Poeci Pomorscy (Pomeranian Poets) in 1962 and in Poeci i morze (Poets and the Sea) in 1969 (Gda≈Ñsk edition). His works often revolved around the people and topics of the region in which he lived and worked. As a citizen of Bydgoszcz, councilor and democrat activist, he coped with themes related to the city: * he wrote the history of the Regional Museum \\"Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski\\" for the opening ceremony; * for the 600th anniversary of the city in 1946, he composed about its history and culture; * he defended Bydgoszcz Venice area against attempts of modernization; * he campaigned for the preservation of Bydgoszcz granaries and the development of the Regional Museum. His articles, prefaces to catalogs and materials, gathered in collective local publications portray his knowledge of the city, in particular its post-war specifics. Marian Turwid's Tombstone As far as his artistic side is concerned, Marian Turwid was rather prolific: out of his 189 works, 125 were displayed at exhibitions in Poland and abroad. After a long period of disinterest towards politics, he joined the Labour Party in 1945, then the Democratic Party () in 1950: in 1955‚Äì1956, Turwid was the vice-president of the Presidium of the Provincial SD Committee in Bydgoszcz, and in 1963 he became the SD chairman of the Provincial Advisory Group for Culture, member of the SD Central Committee Advisory Group for Culture. From 1965 to 1973, he was a councilor of the Bydgoszcz Province and from 1954 to 1961, a member of the Municipal Council of Bydgoszcz. He was a long-time activist in the Front of National Unity and then a member of the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth (). In the late 1950s, Marian co- initiated and managed with Andrzej Szwalbe the Bydgoszcz Scientific Society (). He was also active in a multitude of cultural and scientific organizations and associations. His commitment to culture was assessed by his biographers as follows: He was probably a member of all commissions, teams and committees in Bydgoszcz, if they had any connection with cultural matters. [...] He was almost a cultural institution by himself [...]. Marian Turwid died unexpectedly of a heart attack on November 17, 1987. He had a broadcast on the Polish Radio station of Bydgoszcz a few days prior. He was buried at the Nowofarny Cemetery in Bydgoszcz. He was sincerely mourned by Bydgoszcz artistic circles. Family Marian Turwid married in 1936 Zofia Nowicka, from Bydgoszcz. She was the granddaughter of Dr. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Piorek, a physician, social and national activist. Zophia Turwid was a journalist, passionate about culture and art. The couple had no children. Works Marian Turwid's works are shown in different museum collections: Bydgoszcz, GrudziƒÖdz, Toru≈Ñ, Regional Museum of Wrze≈õnia, the Leo Tolstoy State Museum in Moscow, a museum in Reggio Emilia, as well as in the Polish Theater in Bydgoszcz and at the seat of the Bydgoszcz Scientific Society at 2 Jezuicka Street.

History  The Gold Coast Artillery was formed from security units in the Gold Coast, now Ghana, in 1850. Prior to that, in 1830, the Gold Coast corps was recruited to defend the settlements of the colony. They functioned as police and consisted of small units. Gold Coast Regiment and Gold Coast Corps amalgamated in 1879 and renamed Gold Coast Constabulary, with a military role. The Gold Coast Artillery corps was disbanded in 1863 after its soldiers mutinied. Afterwards many of its members joined local forces which later became part of the Gold Coast Constabulary. In 1893-1894 they were part of the campaign against the Ashanti Kingdom. In 1901, under the direction of the colonial forces, the Gold coast Constabulary was named Gold Coast Regiment as it was inculcated in the newly organized West African Frontier Force. Gold Coast Regiment was the main British force that invaded the German colony of Western Togoland during the First World War. Alhaji Grunshi, Gold Coast Regiment Soldier, as part of the British soldiers, first fired bullets against the Germans during the invasion a week before the first engagement of the war in Europe. The regiment invaded the German colony of Cameroon fighting to gain control and interject radio messages to German warships between the end of 1914 and 1915. In 1916, Gold Coast regiment also campaigned against the Germans in East Africa. They returned to the barracks in Gold Coast in mid 1918 and did not take part in any further campaigns. The regiment remained a part of the West Africa Frontier which was later renamed Royal West Africa Frontier Force until Gold Coast gained independence in 1957. After independence, it was renamed Ghana Army.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents returning to their timeline as they race to stop the Chronicoms from succeeding in their plan. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. \\"The End Is at Hand\\" was written by Jeffrey Bell and directed by Chris Cheramie, while \\"What We're Fighting For\\" was written by Jed Whedon and directed by Kevin Tancharoen. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward. Iain De Caestecker also guest stars in the episode. The episodes originally aired on ABC on August 12, 2020, and were watched by 1.46 million viewers. The episodes received critical acclaim and were praised for the writing, performances, and visual effects. Critics felt the episodes served as a satisfying conclusion to the series and commended the finale for its ambition and lower scale. Plot=\\"The End Is at Hand\\" Following the events of \\"Brand New Day\\", Agents Daisy Johnson, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" Mackenzie, and Daniel Sousa find S.H.I.E.L.D.'s mobile headquarters, Zephyr One, empty as they are beamed into the Chronicom ship. Chronicom leader Sibyl, Nathaniel Malick, and Inhuman Kora imprison Deke Shaw and Jemma Simmons after injecting her with a serum to dissolve her memory implant to locate her husband Leo Fitz. As Simmons' memory is affected, Shaw attempts to help her remember. Johnson infiltrates the ship to save them while Mack and Sousa defend Zephyr One from Chronicoms and work on their escape plan. Aware of their presence, Sibyl orders Malick not to interfere with Johnson and Simmons' reunion as it will increase their chances of finding Fitz. As Sibyl predicted, Johnson reunites with Shaw and Simmons and jogs the latter's memory, but Kora interrupts the process when she confronts Johnson, who refuses to fight her. Conflicted, Kora lets Johnson escape and confides in Malick, who stuns her. Shaw, Simmons, and Johnson return to Zephyr One and successfully escape the Chronicom ship. At S.H.I.E.L.D.'s remaining base, the Lighthouse, Phil Coulson works to decipher a sudden surge of signals while Melinda May and Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez initiate lockdown protocols as John Garrett teleports in and begins setting up explosives around the base. Together, they trap Garrett with a power inhibiting device and contact Malick, hoping to stop the explosives from going off, but Malick detonates them anyway. Garrett is injured in the blast, but Coulson believes he may be an asset to them and saves him. Recovering from Malick‚Äôs betrayal, Garrett decides to join S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson identifies the signal as the location of an 0-8-4, and with Garrett‚Äôs help, he, May, and Yo-Yo teleport to the speakeasy in New York, where Garrett is killed on arrival. There, they meet several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who have also heard the signal and all brought a package containing an 0-8-4, per the late Enoch's instructions. Johnson, Mack, Simmons, Shaw, and Sousa arrive and the team reunite. Despite losing her memory, Simmons subconsciously constructs a portal device with the 0-8-4s and uses her wedding ring to activate it, bringing Fitz to their location, who soon realizes that Simmons's memory has been affected. \\"What We're Fighting For\\" Reunited, Fitz explains that Kora is the key to stopping the Chronicoms and that the team was operating in an alternate timeline. Using the time drive and the portal device, Fitz says they can return to their time and bring the Chronicoms with them. After making preparations, May navigates Zephyr One and the Chronicom ships through the Quantum Realm back to their timeline while Fitz works with Simmons to restore her memory. Choosing to stay behind, Shaw assumes a new role as the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the alternate timeline. Amidst the events of \\"New Life\\", Fitz and Simmons escaped with Enoch onto Agent Piper and Inhuman Flint's quinjet and have the latter recreate a piece of the time monolith before fleeing to the Theta Serpentis system with a Time Stream Enoch stole from the Chronicoms for Fitz to study. During that time, they worked on building the time machine, Coulson‚Äôs LMD, and Simmons' implant, while also living their lives together and raising a daughter, Alya. With the time machine complete, Enoch, Fitz, and Simmons return to the moment they left Piper and Flint, asking them to guard a pod with Fitz and Alya inside while Simmons leaves with Enoch to rescue the others, leading into the events of \\"The New Deal\\". Upon their return, a disguised Fitz, Simmons, Yo-Yo, and Sousa help past Simmons recover the team before retaking the Lighthouse. Meanwhile, Coulson, May, Johnson, and Mack infiltrate the Chronicom ship to save Kora. While Johnson confronts Malick, Coulson tricks Sibyl into sending her Chronicom army to the Lighthouse. After May overpowers Sibyl, she combines her abilities with Kora‚Äôs to magnify a beacon of empathy into the Chronicom army, stopping the assault. Coulson, May, Mack, and Kora escape as Johnson stays behind to destroy the Chronicom ship, killing Sibyl and Malick. The team rescue Johnson and Kora revives her. Fitz and Simmons return to the temple and retrieve Alya. One year later, the team virtually gather at the speakeasy to reminisce about their time together. Mack continues to lead S.H.I.E.L.D., with Yo-Yo as one of his top agents, May is a professor at S.H.I.E.L.D.‚Äôs Coulson Academy with Flint as one of her students, Fitz and Simmons have retired to raise Alya, Johnson explores the cosmos with Sousa and Kora on Zephyr Three, and Coulson travels the world in an upgraded version of his 1962 Chevrolet Corvette, Lola. Production=Development After the sixth season finale of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. aired in August 2019, showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell revealed that the seventh season would feature the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later that month, one of the season's episodes was revealed to be titled \\"The End Is at Hand\\" and written by Bell, while another was revealed to be titled \\"What We're Fighting For\\" and written by Whedon. The two were confirmed to be the twelfth and thirteenth episodes of the season, as well as the series finale, in August 2020. Chris Cheramie was revealed to have directed \\"The End Is at Hand\\", while Kevin Tancharoen was revealed to have directed \\"What We're Fighting For\\". \\"The End Is at Hand\\" was the first time Cheramie directed an episode of the series, after serving as its post-production producer throughout the series. Writing \\"What We're Fighting For\\" returns to the events of the season six finale, \\"New Life\\". Whedon stated the writers knew that the seventh season would deal with time travel, \\"so we planted little stuff that would be easily avoidable if we didn‚Äôt end up tying up those loose ends.\\" For example, the people in hazmat suits during that episode turn out to be members of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team who have returned from the alternate timeline. Whedon added figuring out how the events of the finale intersect with \\"New Life\\" became \\"a brain pretzel-twister\\". Ming-Na Wen had the idea for Melinda May to say \\"the Calvary is here\\", because she wanted the character \\"to finally accept that nickname and all of her emotional baggage that she'd been carrying\\" surrounding it, and \\"revel in it as opposed to being afraid\\". A bittersweet feeling for each of the character was used in the final scene, which was done to differentiate the ending from that of the season five finale \\"The End\\". At the time, \\"The End\\" had been crafted as a series finale, and Whedon noted it \\"had its own feeling and its own flavor, and we felt like we had done a pretty good job with that.\\" Coming up with the episode's ending sequence \\"was just blue sky\\" for Whedon after the first part of the episode had \\"so many moving parts\\" to it. Whedon acknowledged it was \\"just fun to think about\\" as there were \\"tons of great options\\" for the ending, saying, \\"We sort of tried to put everybody in a different-feeling thing and in a different place and separate them as much as possible.\\" Maurissa Tancharoen added, \\"The emotional context of saying goodbye to this experience‚Ä¶is definitely something that‚Äôs reflected in where we leave our characters at the end of the show. So it is very personal to us, and I do think there‚Äôs a sense of hope for what‚Äôs to come for each of them.\\" Having the characters appear virtually, which was thought of by series writers Nora and Lilla Zuckerman, did not break the established rule that the team would not be in the same room together after the final mission. The ending sees a one year time jump with the S.H.I.E.LD. team separated with new lives: * Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie is still a leader within S.H.I.E.L.D., supervising the construction of a new helicarrier, and Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent chasing 0-8-4s. Tancharoen commented the two \\"are still together in a relationship and working with one another ‚Äî and of one another. Yo-Yo actress Natalia Cordova-Buckley liked that the relationship had stabilized, with both being comfortable professionally, individually, and within their relationship. * Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons are retired, spending time with their daughter Alya. Whedon felt \\"for a long time, we had a sense that Fitz and Simmons would be sort of out of S.H.I.E.L.D. and living the simpler life ‚Äî while secretly working with Daisy on the side\\". Simmons actress Elizabeth Henstridge called the couple's ending \\"definitely earned\\", while Fitz actor Iain De Caestecker felt this was \\"a fitting end but a beginning, of another life, as well.\\" * Melinda May has become an instructor at the Coulson S.H.I.E.L.D academy, teaching Flint. This career \\"made perfect sense\\" to the writers, with Tancharoen adding, \\"all of that just sums up her relationship with Coulson [and her as] the reluctant teacher. She has always been the wise teacher amongst the group, the sort of mother figure\\". Wen called this ending for her character \\"very fitting\\" since she had been a superior officer to many of the members on the team and now can \\"continue the S.H.I.E.L.D. legacy for future S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.\\" * Daisy Johnson, her sister Kora, and Daniel Sousa work with S.H.I.E.L.D. aboard Zephyr Three as \\"astral ambassadors\\". Whedon said \\"it felt right\\" to have Daisy in space since \\"it feels vast, and we wanted someone to be out exploring that\\". Additionally, having Daisy work with Kora mimics how Coulson first helped Daisy. * The Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson has taken a sabbatical, seeing various parts of the world. He also receives a restored version of his 1962 Chevrolet Corvette, Lola, from Mack. Having Coulson getting in Lola was \\"the promise for him of a new adventure\\", and as the final shot of the series, was a \\"book end\\" that brought back \\"an iconic image from the pilot\\". * Deke Shaw remains in 1983 in the altered timeline \\"to embrace his inner rock god\\" and become the new S.H.I.E.L.D. leader for the remaining agents. Bell said this was done so Deke's sacrifice would \\"make sense\\" for why it had to be him to stay behind. Actor Jeff Ward called using his rock persona to cover being the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. \\"the ultimate hiding-in-plain-sight tactic\\". Ward revealed that series writer DJ Doyle had pitched a post-credits scene for the episode that was not shot, that featured someone approaching Deke sitting in a S.H.I.E.L.D. office wearing an eye patch. Ward added, since it was unclear if Nick Fury existed in the alternate timeline, Deke would have worn it because it is \\"a power and cool thing\\". The writers also considered showing a S.H.I.E.L.D. mission where Deke is performing \\"Money for Nothing\\" at Madison Square Garden. Casting With the season renewal, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, and Deke Shaw, respectively. Series star Clark Gregg also returns as his character Phil Coulson, portraying a Life Model Decoy (LMD) version of the character. Guest stars in the finale include Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, and returning from earlier in the season, Tamara Taylor as Sibyl, Thomas E. Sullivan as Nathaniel Malick, Dianne Doan as Kora, and Enver Gjokaj reprising his Agent Carter role of Daniel Sousa. They are joined by Stephen Bishop as Brandon Gamble, and Rachele Schank as a young Victoria Hand. Additional guest stars in \\"The End Is at Hand\\" include James Paxton as John Garrett and Bill Cobbs as an elderly S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. When writing the scene in which Cobbs appears, Bell asked for \\"somebody like Bill Cobbs\\" to play the part, and was later told they were able to hire him. For \\"What We're Fighting For\\", Joel Stoffer returns from earlier in the season as Enoch, and returning from earlier in the series, Briana Venskus as Agent Piper, Maximilian Osinski as an LMD of Agent Davis, and Coy Stewart as Flint. Harlow Happy Hexum portrays Alya, Fitz and Simmon's daughter. Filming and post- production To highlight the different dynamic between Nathaniel Malick and Sibyl, when together, Malick was shown moving around constantly \\"like a caged tiger\\", while Sibyl was more stoic, showing her \\"complete control\\". Bell stated the day Cobbs came to film his scene, \\"it was like Elvis was on set\\", with everyone being \\"so respectful\\". Cobbs arrived to set in a wheelchair and a modern-day walker, and director Chris Cheramie was afraid they would not be able to accommodate him with these devices, given his scene is set in the 1980s; a period appropriate walker was procured for him to use, though Cobbs chose not to use it. The ending was not easy to shoot for director Kevin Tancharoen, because \\"everyone [on the crew] was emotionally invested\\" in the lines the actors were saying and the tone created they created on the set, that \\"it made everyone sad\\". Filming wrapped on July 30, 2019. Visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack began working on some of the visual effects sequences in the final episode that would not need actors to be a part of weeks before anything had been filmed or the script had been written, in order to ensure what they wanted to accomplish could be completed on time. However, Kolpack and his team were working on the final four episodes of the season at once, and in order to meet the completion deadlines for the previous episodes, Kolpack requested an additional month to work on \\"What We're Fighting For\\" given the many visual effects in the episode. Visual effects for \\"What We're Fighting For\\" were completed on October 4, 2019, while the remaining post- production work was completed around October 7. 20 additional minutes of footage were cut from the episodes. While most were \\"unforgettable, humorous lines\\", some of the cut content was fight sequences and an origin scene in \\"The End Is at Hand\\" for the quantum machine. Regarding this cut content, Whedon said, \\"We really tried to preserve the end, and that end had to breathe, and have time to sit and be quiet and awkward... That was the thing that we tried most to preserve, and that‚Äôs intact.\\" Music Composer Bear McCreary appreciated the additional month gained in order to completed the episode's visual effects, as he was also realizing the large scope of the episode and would have asked for more time himself had it not already been granted for the visual effects to be completed. He said, \\"it was great because this episode just needed more across the board. We all got to have time to make sure we did our best work.\\" McCreary attempted to give each character a musical send off in \\"What We're Fighting For\\". Writing the music for when Fitz and Simmons are reunited with their daughter was a stand out moment in the series for McCreary, one he said that \\"wrecked\\" him and would be a moment he would always remember. McCreary was \\"terrified\\" of approaching the ending, called it \\"a monster to score\\". He was unsure of how much music should be present, as he did not feel a lot of music was needed given what the actors were doing, yet it was the end of the episode and series. Instead of a steady build throughout the scene to the end, McCreary was \\"really surgical\\", building in moments that needed it, and then returning softer afterwards. Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins Fitz utilizes the Quantum Realm, seen in the Ant-Man films and Avengers: Endgame (2019), to travel to the altered timeline and reunite with the S.H.I.E.L.D. team before bringing everyone back to the main timeline. A line stating how the realm could be used to survive Thanos' snap, as seen in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame, was planned but ultimately cut. Release \\"The End Is at Hand\\" and \\"What We're Fighting For\\" were first aired in the United States on ABC on August 12, 2020. Reception=Ratings In the United States, \\"The End Is at Hand\\" and \\"What We're Fighting For\\" received a 0.3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that they were seen by 0.3 percent of all households in that demographic. The two episodes were watched by 1.46 million viewers. Within a week of release, the series finale was watched by 2.46 million viewers. Critical response The A.V. Clubs Alex McLevy said the finale \\"managed to deliver a spectacle truly worthy of its outsized ambitions\\". For \\"The End Is at Hand\\", he felt the episode was \\"the best- looking, most visually sumptuous episode of the season\\", particularly the hangar interior which felt \\"epic in scale and scope to the story being told\\". Each of the three storylines in the episode \\"adeptly balances action, humor, and heart, and allows for some meaningful discussions without feeling too much like it‚Äôs hitting pause on all the high-intensity, clock-ticking action unfolding.\\" As for the final scene in the bar, McLevy said having a young Victoria Hand and the 0-8-4s allowed \\"for a nice trip down memory lane, evoking memories of this show‚Äôs infancy\\". He gave the episode an \\"A-\\". In \\"What We're Fighting For\\", McLevy enjoyed \\"how all-in this show went making a conclusion so proudly, unabashedly nerdy\\", and while the time-travel was the \\"most entertaining element\\" of the finale, it was \\"also the thing that causes it to be somewhat less impactful in its emotional resonance\\". He noted the episode featured \\"some exhilarating fight scenes and super-powered battles\\", particularly the Daisy and Nathaniel Malick fight, which is what many viewers \\"are hoping for when we sit down to watch a Marvel TV show\\". He felt the ending was \\"a surprisingly quiet, bittersweet note\\" that \\"is a little sad, a little funny, and feels over before it‚Äôs really begun.\\" Speaking more to the ending, McLevy said, \\"there‚Äôs something almost more downbeat about an ending acknowledging the fact that even after world-altering events that forge permanent bonds, life just...goes on, in all its prosaic reality, the day-to- day intimacy that once existed an ever-more-distant memory.\\" He gave \\"What We're Fighting For\\" a \\"B+\\". Trent Moore at Syfy Wire felt \\"seeing Simmons process her scrambled memories and slowly remember her life, and Fitz, was some beautiful acting by Elizabeth Henstridge.\\" Other enjoyable moments for Moore were Mack and Sousa creating the makeshift Chronicom missile with duct tape (\\"a great bit of classic, goofy S.H.I.E.L.D. weirdness\\") and Deke's fart noise interrupting Sousa to say he would stay behind. While Moore felt the final plan was \\"a bit convoluted and McGuffin-y\\", he realized the show went out on a big story to justify that. As for the ending, Moore said it mostly worked, adding, \\"It‚Äôs hard to craft an ending, especially one with so many moving pieces and characters. But there‚Äôs no doubt this is a good one. Fans should enjoy it, and most importantly it leaves the door open to where fans can imagine all the adventures and stories that could still spin out after the series has long-ended.\\" Christian Holub, writing for Entertainment Weekly, called Garrett getting trapped at the Lighthouse \\"delicious\\" since Holub had found the character \\"quite insufferable\\". The fight between Daisy and Nathaniel Malick gave \\"some fun Dragon Ball Z vibes... but ultimately I feel like it pales in comparison to Daisy‚Äôs climactic fight with Graviton from the end of season 5.\\" As for the ending, Holub likened how the characters appeared virtually to a Zoom meeting and said \\"It‚Äôs about as good an ending as you could hope for any of these characters ‚Äî especially FitzSimmons!\\" Giving the finale a \\"B\\", he concluded, \\"despite my many qualms about this season, I think it did wrap up the show (which over seven seasons has spanned multiple eras of Marvel superhero fiction) in a nice little bow.\\" Reviewing the finale for Den of Geek, Dave Vitagliano gave the episode 4 out 5 stars. He said the finale \\"neatly ties up enough loose plot threads to keep even the staunchest critics happy and still leaves plenty of room for requisite fan service. Nevertheless, no one can accuse the writers of leaving any cards unplayed. The awakenings, the sacrifices, the reunions, and the redemptions were all completely earned and worthy of this final installment.\\" The reunion of Fitz and Simmons was \\"one of the finale‚Äôs highlights\\", and given the introduction of their daughter, Vitagliano felt it was \\"hard to be disappointed with the conclusion of their arc.\\" Vitagliano felt the showrunners took \\"extra care\\" with the ending to satisfy the fans, with \\"the most poignant exchange\\" coming when Daisy and Coulson say goodbye. Dominic Patten of Deadline Hollywood called the finale \\"an ambitious and ultimately successful conclusion for the very first live action Marvel television series and its longtime motto that 'not all heroes are super',\\" adding the episodes felt like a feature film opposed to two episodes of television. CNN's Brian Lowry said the finale was \\"an old- fashioned affair tinged with nostalgia\\", aimed at those who had watched the series from the beginning. Regarding the ending scene, Lowry called it \\"inadvertently timely\\", also likening it to a Zoom call, and concluded, \\"While providing some closure, the finale left the door open to utilize some of these characters again, although given Marvel's priorities, that seems less likely.\\" Compared to some of the more extravagant elements that have occurred over the series, Colliders Liz Shannon Miller called the series finale \\"a pretty lowkey affair, focused far more on character than plot\\". She concluded, \\"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was never perfect, but it was special, and the finale managed to nail the one thing we never remember about happy endings ‚Äî no ending is happy forever. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt cherish the moments, while they last.\\" Awarding the finale an 8 out of 10, Matt Fowler writing for IGN called both episodes \\"rollicking affairs filled with action, heart, and humor\\". As for the ending, he felt it highlighted \\"how little the rest of the season meant\\" in that \\"it didn't really matter, overall, who the villains were, or what the threat to the planet was. The series has been these characters for years now and the rest of it's just 'big bad' dressing.\\" Accolades Henstridge was named TVLines \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of August 10, 2020, for her performance in these episodes. The site felt Henstridge \\"mined\\" Simmons' random memory revelations for moments of comedy, highlighting when the character asked Daisy for her own superhero costume, and once Simmons heard from Fitz they had been gone for a long time, the new questions she felt allowed Henstridge to show confusion and frustration that \\"began building to the emotional climax to come\\". Additionally, \\"Henstridge powerfully communicated the rush of feelings\\" Simmons felt once she fully remembered her daughter, as the audience was also learning the truth along side her.

As a footballer, he appeared for Vordingborg IF and Glostrup IC in the lower-tier local divisions and for Skovshoved IF in the higher divisions. After retiring as a player, Sinding decided to continue as a coach and in a span of 25 years he was employed as head coach, youth coach, goalkeeping coach and manager of 10 different Danish football clubs. The culmination of his coaching career took place in the early 1980s, when he led Hvidovre IF to a Danish Cup win in the 1979‚Äì80 season - the club's first cup title. He subsequently helped secure the club's third Danish championship in the 1981 season. Outside football, Sinding has been director and owner of the company W. Johansen ApS. Playing career Sinding's playing career began in the youth department at Skovshoved IF. In his active playing career as a senior player, he represented Vordingborg IF, Glostrup IC and his childhood club Skovshoved IF in the 1960s. There, he appeared both in the lower tier local divisions for Glostrup and Vordingborg, as well as in the higher divisions for Skovshoved. Managerial career=Beginnings Sinding began his coaching career in Glostrup IC. In 1968, Sinding was hired as the new coach in the youth department of Br√∏ndby IF, which was then a lower tier club. Under his management the club's U17 team were promoted to the highest division in 1969, where they ended up in fourth place in the table in their first season. Sinding remained in the position as youth coach at the club for a year and a half. 1970‚Äì1978: Br√∏ndby At the young age of 29, Sinding became head coach of Br√∏ndby's senior team in 1970, which competed in the local divisions under the Zealand FA (SBU). He initially only planned to coach the team for one season, which thus became his first season as a senior coach. After the complete merger of the largest sports clubs in Br√∏ndby√∏ster and Br√∏ndbyvester in 1964 - which resulted in the formation of Br√∏ndby IF - the board of the club from Vestegnen decided that the new football club should aim to compete at a higher level. The first team's final position in the league standings - 10th place in the Sj√¶llandsserien (Zealand Series) - in the 1969 season had been deemed unsatisfactory, and the collaboration with the then head coach Ib Jensen was discontinued and a major overhaul of the first-team squad was made. With his new appointment, Sinding thus set the goal of assembling an almost completely new first team and lead the team to promotion from the Zealand Series, ensuring the club a place in Danmarksserien (Denmark Series) by 1971. The goal was finally fulfilled when Br√∏ndby managed to win in the last matchday of the season which secured the Zealand Series title in the 1971 season which meant automatic promotion to the Denmark Series in 1972 with a squad consisting of players such as Per Bjerregaard, Tom K√∏hlert and Ebbe Skovdahl, who would all go on to become key figures in the club afterwards. This achievement marked the club's second promotion since its foundation where it had been incepted in the Serie 1, the sixth tier of the Danish football league system. In the following season, however, the club's board chose to appoint Mogens Johansen as new head coach and shortly afterwards, former professional player Finn Laudrup took over as player-coach for the first team. After his first stint at Br√∏ndby IF, Sinding continued as head coach of Ballerup IF in the period 1972-1974\\\\. There, he led the team from the Denmark Series to the third highest tier (3rd Division East under the former league structure) in 1974, which was the first time this occurred in the club's history. The team, which in the 1972 season had just missed out on promotion by a single point, won its Denmark Series group by beating Br√∏ndby IF in the decisive match, after which they won the whole division after beating Viborg FF 1-0 in the divisional finals. Sinding returned to the position of head coach at Br√∏ndby IF in 1975 to coach the newly promoted 3rd Division team. The goal from the board's side was this time position in the top six and a continuation of the club's attacking style of play. Sinding's stay at the club this time lasted two seasons, and ended short of the desired promotion.\\"BIF fik rettet op\\" Folkebladet 17 November 1976 p.4 After leaving Br√∏ndby again, Sinding held head coaching positions at Skovshoved IF and the 1st Division (first-tier) club B.93, where he was hired as a new coach to replace the outgoing Erik Gynild. Sinding coached the side for a total of 80 matches (26 wins, 19 draws and 35 losses) between 1977-1979 and for a short period in the 1977 season he also coached the club's 2nd senior team in the Denmark Series together with player-coach Erling B√∏je. At the halfway point of the 1979 season, after two years at B.93 with 13th place and 7th place finishes, respectively, the board of the club decided to dismiss Sinding due to the first team's relegation battle. The team had at that point lost six games in a row and bottom of the 1st Division, after which B√∏je took over as head coach for the remaining 15 matches of the season and managed to heed the club from relegation, which was secured in the penultimate matchday against Slagelse B&I.; 1979‚Äì1987: Hvidovre Subsequently, in 1979, he became head coach of Hvidovre IF, whom he led to the 1979‚Äì80 final of the Danish Cup, which the team won after a 5-3 win over Lyngby Boldklub in K√∏benhavns Idr√¶tspark. The cup win secured Hvidovre IF qualification for the European Cup Winners' Cup in the 1980‚Äì81 season, where the team defeated Icelandic club Fram Reykjav√≠k in the first round, but then suffered a defeat over two legs in the second round against Dutch side Feyenoord. DBU¬¥s Landspokalturnering 1979-1980 Peders Fodboldstatistik, Retrieved 31 August 2008. In the 1981 season, the team also became Danish champions for the third time - a single point ahead of Lyngby Boldklub in second place.Danmarksturneringen 1981 ‚Äì 1. division Peders Fodboldstatistik, Retrieved 31 August 2008. He stepped back as head coach of Hvidovre IF at around the same time as Michael Manniche moved to Portuguese club Benfica from Hvidovre in the summer of 1983. On his favorite coach, Manniche stated: After a short period as head coach of Glostrup IC who competed in the 2nd Division (second-tier), he returned to Hvidovre in the position of manager responsible for tactics, team selection, handling contract negotiations, outreach work and collaboration with the youth department around talent work, whereas Hvidovre's former coach Kurt Stendahl continued as responsible for day-to-day training. This was also taken care of by Sinding himself later on. In October 1985, just over a year after his re-employment at Hvidovre, Sinding was sacked after first-team players threatened the management with a major player flight if Sinding stayed on as manager. Sinding reacted to the dismissal by launching a lawsuit at the √òstre Landsret (High Court) against Hvidovre IF with a compensation claim of DKK 350,000 for unjustified dismissal instead of trying to find a settlement. Hvidovre IF suffered relegation from the top tier after the 1985 season. 1988‚Äì1994: Lower leagues Prior to the 1988 season, Sinding moved to newly promoted 2nd Division (second-tier) club Fremad Amager on a three-year contract. Four months before his contract expired, the board decided to dismiss Sinding with immediate notice on 18 August 1990, which was justified with \\"a lack of tactical abilities\\" - despite the team going through an undefeated stretch of eleven matches. After the 1990 season, the team relegated to the Danish 2nd Division (third-tier),Founded in 1991, the Danish Superliga replaced the 1st Division as the highest league of football in Denmark. This meant that the 2nd Division had become the new third-tier. Source: and his replacement as head coach, who had already been introduced two months before Sinding's dismissal, was former Fremad player Tonni Nielsen. The dismissal of Sinding caused the chairman of Fremad Amager's professional department, Henning Bjerre, to resign the following day due to his dissatisfaction with the circumstances behind the decision to dismiss, which had been made by the three other board members. In the autumn of 1991, Sinding took over as the new head coach of Skovshoved IF, competing in the 2nd Division East (third-tier), for the remaining three matches in the competition. The club had requested his assistance after firing former head coach Leif Staun the week before. Sinding, however, could not prevent the relegation of his childhood club. On 1 July 1993, Sinding was appointed the new head coach of 2nd Division club RB 1906 on a six-month contract. He replaced the outgoing Benny Jensen, who had resigned during the summer break, as he had felt that he could no longer implement his ideas, and had, as a result, moved to Vanl√∏se IF instead. RB 1906, who had lost half of their players from the spring season, ended the autumn season in 1993 in the penultimate place in the 2nd Division East, which meant relegation to the Denmark Series after 18 seasons as a club in the top three divisions. In the spring of 1994, Sinding was replaced by RB 1906's new head coach Carsten Broe, who held the position of head coach for four years. 1994‚Äì2008: Later career In September 1996, then-head coach Kim Brink picked up Sinding at short notice to become a substitute goalkeeper coach for F.C. Copenhagen to train the club's two goalkeepers, Karim Zaza and Finnish international Antti Niemi. This was because the club's regular goalkeeping coach, former Danish international Ole Qvist, was at a four-week holiday in the United States. After two-and-a-half years, Peter Schmeichel ended his involvement in the 1st Division (second-tier) club Hvidovre IF's professional department, Hvidovre Fodbold A/S, on 30 June 2002, whereupon the club was left with no capital (Schmeichel had made sure that the club had no more outstanding debt) or a coach, after the former manager Jan S√∏rensen's departure during the summer 2002. Since the club had to start all over again with no finances and a new squad mainly consisting of lower tier players, their management therefore contacted Sinding and persuaded him to take over as the manager of the team in the autumn season of 2002 in an unpaid / volunteering managerial role with Sten Ziegler as the one responsible for the day-to-day practice. The goal was to stabilize Hvidovre IF's first team in the second-tier and avoid relegation as well as securing a much-needed financial respite. During the winter break of the 2002‚Äì03 season, the club's management dismissed Sinding, in order for new head coach Jan Christensen, coming over from fourth-tier club Gladsaxe- Hero Boldklub, to take over the position as of 1 January 2003. In January 2008, Br√∏ndby IF briefly engaged John Sinding again, in a position as \\"talent scout\\", and in this connection he was sent to Brazil to keep an eye out for attacking-oriented youth players for the youth academy together with the former goalkeeping coach J√∏rgen Henriksen. Outside football Alongside his football career, Sinding, who became self-employed in 1980 after 12 years at offshore supplier Semco, has been director and owner of a private installation company, W. Johansen ApS. A company of more than 33 employees located in Br√∏nsh√∏j, W. Johansen ApS specializes in ventilation, air conditioning and electrical installation. Sinding took over the company in January 1979 and subsequently co-founded W. Ventilation ApS in January 1981 and W. Johansen EL in February 1984, respectively. Since then, Sinding has divested his shares in the company.

It was published in 1953. Warleggan continues the story of the Poldark marriage and family. The previous novel in the series (Jeremy Poldark) ends on an upbeat in June 1791 with the birth of Jeremy Poldark and a reconciliation and partnership between Francis and Ross Poldark. Warleggan closes on Christmas of 1793 with Elizabeth married to George Warleggan, Dwight Enys engaged to Caroline Penvenen and the marriage of Ross and Demelza on the mend. The main developments in the novel are the tragic death of Francis Poldark, a sexual interaction between Ross and Elizabeth that a number of commentators regard as rape,Winston Graham and Rape Elizabeth's marriage to George Warleggan, the near-destruction of Ross's marriage to Demelza, and ups-and-downs in the passionate relationship between Dwight Enys and Caroline Penvenen. These take place against the backdrop of the French Revolution and England going to war. The six big houses The novel opens with the author describing, for the first time in the Poldark series, that in the \\"coastal triangle of Cornwall lying between Truro, St. Ann's, and St. Michael\\" there are exactly six \\"big houses\\" or \\"houses inhabited by gentlefolk\\". These houses, and their occupants, are: * Mingoose House: John and Ruth Treneglos * Werry House: Sir Hugo Bodrugan and his stepmother, Constance Lady Bodrugan. Werry House is said to be, of the six houses, \\"the largest and most disreputable\\". * Place House: Sir John Trevaunance. Place House is \\"an unbecoming Palladian residence\\". * Killewarren: Ray Penvenen. Killewarren is \\"not much more than a glorified farmhouse\\". * Trenwith House: Francis and Elizabeth Poldark * Nampara: Ross and Demelza Poldark. Nampara is described as \\"Georgian and utilitarian and never properly completed but not without a certain individuality and charm\\". Synopsis=Book One Book One covers May through September 1792 in seven chapters. The main incident in Book One is the tragic death of Francis Poldark. France is at war with Austria and this is of considerable interest to the novel's characters, both because they wonder whether France will eventually be at war with England and also because metal needed for munitions in wars might be good for the price of the tin and copper they mine. These are the main developments: * The residents of the \\"big houses\\" receive an unusual invitation to a party at the home of Sir John Trevaunance and suspect that the occasion will be to announce an engagement between his brother, Unwin, who is now a Member of Parliament, and heiress Caroline Penvenen, the orphaned niece of Ray Penvenen. At the Trevaunance party, Elizabeth is seated next to Ross and he is stunned to be told by her that she only loved Francis for a few months and that her enduring love is for him. Demelza, seated at another part of the large table, attracts the focused attention of Captain Malcolm McNeil. Unwin stalks out of the party, scowling, with leads people to believe that his courtship of Caroline is going poorly. Ross concludes from his interactions at the party with Caroline that \\"she is the wrong wife for Dwight. She would wipe her feet on him.\\" * George Warleggan visits Trenwith when Francis is not at home. He asks Elizabeth for her help in bringing about a reconciliation between Warleggan and Francis. George also takes advantage of the opportunity to express to Elizabeth some of his views about her, including, \\"You know, don't you, that you're one of the loveliest women in England\\". * Dwight Enys sees more poor patients including nineteen-year-old Rosina Hoblyn, who has a bad limp. She is being courted by Charlie Kempthorne, a forty-something widower with two children. The day after the Trevaunance party, he encounters Caroline in Truro and learns that she is not, and will not be, engaged to Unwin. Provoked by Caroline's arch verbal sallies, he confesses his strong attraction to her. They arrange to ride together. * Trencom, the smuggler, is asked by Ross to bring back information from France on how Mark Daniel, his close friend and fugitive from the law, is doing. In exchange, Trencom asks Ross for permission to store smuggled goods at Nampara, in addition to their pre-existing arrangement that the smugglers can carry smuggled goods across the property. * Ross discovers that the Warleggan interests have purchased his debt in the amount of ¬£1400, which is due in seven weeks. * Francis, now in partnership with Ross in Wheal Grace, spends more and more time at Nampara and grows close to Demelza. In mid-September, with Ross in Truro, Francis confesses to Demelza that it was he who told George Warleggan the names of the investors in the Carnmore Copper Company. As the conversation enters deep waters, Demelza brings up to Francis her fear that Ross prefers Elizabeth to her. Francis encourages Demelza: \\"Ross was a wise man when he chose you. If he's as sensible as I think he is, he'll realize it. If you're as sensible as you ought to be, you'll make him.\\" Francis shortly leaves Nampara, his heart lightened by his confession. He visits Wheal Grace where in a tragic series of circumstances, he drowns. Book Two Book Two covers November 1792 through February 1793 in thirteen chapters. The major events are the elopement of Dwight Enys and Caroline Penvenen, and Dwight's discovery of the identity of the smuggling informant. * Caroline Penvenen, returning to the area from a several-months-long stay in London, encounters Ross Poldark on the road. He learns that she is returning to the area even though her uncle hasn't invited her. Dwight discloses to Elizabeth the fact that Ross may even up in debtor's prison in short order because of the ¬£1400 note that the Warleggans purchased. She secretly arranges to purchase the note and Ross's banker informs him that a mysterious benefactor has done this. The Warleggans are furious when they learn that the note will be paid off and they have lost their ability to have Ross placed in prison. * Ross's responsibilities in life increase, with weekly visits to Elizabeth at Trenwith to keep an eye on her needs as a young widow, as well as with the expectation that he serve as a magistrate. Demelza is disturbed by Ross's closer connection with Elizabeth. * Having cured Rosina Hoblyn's limp, Dwight now has patients lining up to see him. On his visits to manage the care of her knee, he notes that she is being courted by an older widow, Charlie Kempthorne, who has two children. Charlie is doing well in life financially, which he attributes to the success of his sail making-and-mending business. Rosina accepts his proposal. * Wheal Grace is not yielding enough ore to sustain the operation. Ross remembers that his old friend, Mark Daniels, who fled the country after he killed his wife, spent his last night before his flight hiding out in the mine, and mentioned that he might have stumbled into a rich streak of ore. Ross tries to discover Mark's whereabouts in order to ask him more detailed questions in a last-ditch effort to keep the mine afloat. He learns that Mark is in Ireland and finds a way to course over to visit him only to discover that Mark has no useful information. * Caroline and Dwight agree to elope, with the idea of Dwight setting up a medical practice in Bath, which will support the two pending any possible inheritances she might receive from her two uncles. They both have some uneasiness about the plan: Caroline because she is not sure Dwight is really ready to abandon his life and patients in Cornwall and Dwight because he is not sure Caroline can really manage life at a lower income level. The night of their intended elopement, Dwight is called at the last moment to the home of Rosina Hoblyn, who has reinjured her knee. Circumstances there lead him to understand that Charlie Kempthorne, her fiancee, is the informant. He goes to the home of Kempthorne and confronts him; Charlie confesses. A smuggling run is intended for that very evening at midnight. Dwight has to choose between joining Caroline at their planned meeting spot or speeding to the coast to try to warn the smugglers, and Ross who is with them, not to land. He reaches the coast in time, set a fire in the gorse bush, and the smugglers barely see it in time to reverse course and evade the soldiers. * Caroline, since Dwight doesn't show up for the elopement, leaves the next morning for London with her uncle. She leaves behind a note for Dwight, crisply ending their relationship. Charlie Kempthorne absconds, abandoning his young daughters. Book Three Book Three takes up where Book Two left off, in February 1793. Ten chapters later, it concludes in May 1793. These are the main developments. * Dwight travels to London to explain to Caroline Penvenen why he was unable to meet her the night of their intended elopement. She rejects his overtures. He returns, despondent and irritable, to Cornwall. * Ross confesses to Demelza that when he sold his remaining shares of Wheal Leisure several years earlier, he gave ¬£600 of the ¬£675 he realized from the sale to the impoverished Elizabeth Poldark. He describes this as repaying a debt of honor. * In mid-March, when Ross is on the verge of shutting down Wheal Grace, Captain Henshawe pays him a visit with a small sack of rocks from the mine. Ross refuses to get his hopes up, but agrees to visit the mine. Enough ore is found to barely pay for the mine's continuing operations. In May, part of Wheal Grace collapses. Two men are killed and three are seriously wounded. The promising lode is covered in debris that would take six weeks work to remove. * George Warleggan proposes to Elizabeth, and she accepts his proposal, after experiencing a string of difficulties. She writes Ross a letter notifying him of her decision. He immediately goes to Trenwith and accosts Elizabeth. The scene that occurs is well-known that fans of the Poldark series, resulting in ongoing debates on whether what happens is rape, or not. * Demelza, aware of Ross's infidelity, decides to even the score by finding a sexual partner at a country dance hosted by the Bodrugans. At the dance, she chooses Captain McNeil for these purposes. They flirt. He kisses her. They arrange to meet in her room later on. When that time comes, he is aggressive. She is repulsed and realizes she doesn't want to engage him in this way. She says this and after some additional aggression and anger, he leaves. She weeps. * Verity is pregnant, expecting the child in October 1793. * After spending one night with Elizabeth, Ross doesn't communicate with her or visit her. Unsure of the status of her relationship with Ross -- as is Demelza -- Elizabeth writes to George to call off or postpone their wedding. He visits her, irate. He pressures her to set a date. She does, and thus concludes Book 3. Book Four Book Four covers June 1793 through Christmas Eve 1793 in seven chapters. * Wheal Grace re-opens in early June. It starts producing significant amounts of tin -- enough, if the pattern continues -- for Ross and Demelza to get out of debt and enjoy some of the finer things in life. * Elizabeth and George are married in late June. They honeymoon until August and then take up residence at his family estate, Cardew. Her parents, who can no longer care for themselves, are moved to Trenwith where they, along with Aunt Agatha, are waited on by a retinue of servants paid for by George. Unexpectedly, later in the fall, much to the disgust of Ross, Elizabeth and George move into Trenwith. It is rumored that Elizabeth is pregnant. * Dwight Enys is called to the sickbed of Ray Penvenen. He diagnoses him as having the sugar sickness. Dwight prescribes Theban opium which seems to help. Mr. Penvenen tells Dwight that Caroline is set to be married after Christmas. He reacts to this news by enlisting in the British Navy as an onboard surgeon. * Verity has her child, a boy, at the end of October. She is very happy. * George Warleggan requests Ross's presence at Trenwith to settle some financial matters. Ross is informed by George, Elizabeth's father and various legal attendants that they believe that he engaged in \\"sharp practices\\" when he sold Francis George's half of Wheal Grace in January to himself for ¬£600 to get the money to rescue Elizabeth. Ross protests that Wheal Grace at that time was worth far less than ¬£600. George insists that now that Wheal Grace is producing significant amounts of tin ore, Ross should return half of the ownership of the mine to Francis George. When Ross demurs, he is informed that a lawsuit will follow. * Ross's banker discloses to him that Caroline Penvenen was the mysterious benefactor who purchased his indebtness from the Warleggans a year earlier. With Demelza's blessing, he decides to travel to London to thank her. In this visit, he learns that the news of her engagement was incorrect. He tells her that Dwight joined the navy when he heard the (false) news of her engagement. Ross persuades her to come with him to Plymouth, where Dwight is ensconced awaiting the embarkation of his ship, to talk things over. She initially refuses but then agrees to do this. In Plymouth, Dwight is stunned when Ross brings Caroline into the room where they are dining. A reconciliation occurs. Ross brings Dwight, Caroline and her maid home to Nampara for Christmas. Dwight will have a week before he must rejoin the Navy and the two -- anticipating that Dwight must serve for two years -- plan to marry on his first leave which they expect to occur in about six months. * When Ross is in London, Demelza sets out with her dog, Garrick, to visit a woman in the neighborhood. Garrick is non-fatally shot. He bites Demelza when she tries to comfort him. She confronts the man who shot him. She learns that the man is in the employ and under the instructions of George Warleggan to keep trespassers off Trenwith property. This entirely new policy is confirmed by George directly to Demelza. * Ross, home from London, observes Demelza's dog bite. To prevent him from dispatching Garrick, she tells him what happened, fearing that this will lead to physical violence between George and Ross. Ross goes to Trenwith, where Elizabeth and George are dining. Ross suggests that it is to no one's benefit for the two of them to be engaged in active hostilities. Whether George will accept this overture is not evident. Elizabeth is icy to Ross. Ross suggests to George that unless they are able to live on terms of peace, Ross will incite the local miners into a populist uprising at Trenwith. * On Christmas Eve, seven months after his sexual liaison with Elizabeth -- seven months of extreme strain in his marriage -- Ross tells Demelza they must talk it through. She resists but he tells her that what he learned from the event was that he does not love Elizabeth. Demelza then tells him about her near-affair with Captain McNeil. He says some ugly words. She decides to immediately depart Nampara. Coaxing her from the stable, Ross suggests that they talk in the kitchen for just five minutes. Ross apologizes. He presents her with a ruby brooch and a garnet necklace. He says, \\"If you suppose or suspect that in buying these things, I was hoping to buy myself back into your favor, then you're right. I admit it. It is true, my dear, my very dear Demelza. My fine, my loyal, my very sweet Demelza\\". Matters appear to be headed toward a thawing in their relationship as the novel closes.

As a whaler, Giles traveled in 1707 north of Nordaustlandet in Svalbard and managed to reach a degree farther north of Sju√∏yane without encountering ice. A published abstract in the Royal Geographical Society's proceedings remarked in 1873 that such voyages \\"have never been equalled (sic) up to the present day\\". He then continued his route eastward in an open sea and sighted an unknown high land at 80¬∞ N, the island Kvit√∏ya, which will not be seen again until 1876. The location appeared on charts as \\"Giles Land\\" for a number of years, and it was visited for an exploration in 1898 by Alfred Gabriel Nathorst. Somehow hence, the island came to be considered mythical -- as late as 1935 -- when an expedition by Georgy Ushakov and the icebreaker Sadko was described in the news as seeking \\"a phantom island\\" or \\"the alleged island\\" of Gillis or Giles Island.

The winning sides progress directly to the Quarter Final, with the losing sides moving into Round 3. Round 2B Round 2B sees the eight losing sides from Round 1 compete for a place in Round 3. The losing sides from this round will be eliminated from the competition, and will have to play a relegation play-off to attempt to retain their Senior status for 2021. Round 3 Round 3 is a supplementary round for teams to have a second chance at reaching the Quarter Final. This round features teams that have lost once so far in this year's Championship, either winning in Round 1 and losing in Round 2A, or losing in Round 1 but winning their Round 2B fixture. Losing sides in this round are eliminated from this year's competition. This round is seeded, meaning in each fixture a Round 2A losing side will face a Round 2B winning side. Quarter Final The Quarter Final sees the two brackets rejoin, with the earlier Round 2A winners facing a Round 3 winner for a Semi Final spot. Semi Final The Semi Final will see the four winning sides face off for a place in this year's final. This round is an open draw from the four Quarter Final winners. Final The final was played between the two Semi Final winners, and took place at P√°irc Esler, Newry. Relegation Play-Offs=Relegation Semi-Finals The 4 losers of Round 2B play each other in the Relegation Semi-Finals. The 2 winners will secure their Senior status for 2021, while the 2 losers will face-off in the Relegation Final. Relegation Final The winner of the Relegation Final will maintain their Senior status into 2021, while the loser will be relegated to the 2021 Down I.F.C.

He is the McKinlay Professor of Global Health at the University of Otago and an Adjunct Professor of Medicine, Pathology, and Global Health at Duke University. He served as inaugural Co-Director of the Otago Global Health Institute (OGHI), a flagship research center of the University of Otago. His primary research interest is fever in the tropics, focusing on invasive bacterial diseases and bacterial zoonoses.  Early life and education  Crump was born in Oamaru, New Zealand, raised in on a mixed sheep, beef, and cropping farm at Okaramio, Marlborough, attending Havelock School, Havelock, and Marlborough Boys‚Äô College, Blenheim. He graduated MB ChB in 1993 and received his MD in 2012 for research on clinical and laboratory aspects of HIV in Tanzania from the University of Otago Medical School. Crump trained as both an internist in infectious diseases and as a pathologist in medical microbiology, at Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand; the Royal Free Hospital, London; the Canberra Hospital, Australia; Duke University Medical Center; and as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He is a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (FRACP, 1999), a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (FRCPA, 2004), a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP, 2009) of the United Kingdom, and a diplomate of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (DTM&H;, 1995).  Career and research  Crump is a leading researcher on the diagnosis, management, and prevention of infectious causes of fever in the tropics other than malaria. He has advocated for a comprehensive approach to investigating febrile illness as a necessary progression from the traditional disease-specific approach in tropical medicine. He has contributed to describing the problem of malaria over- diagnosis, and also to appreciation of range of neglected causes of fever including invasive bacterial diseases, as well as bacterial zoonoses such as leptospirosis and Q fever. Much of his research is trans-disciplinary involving close collaboration between human health experts, veterinarians, ecologists, and social scientists, and following the so-called 'One Health' approach. He has led work characterizing the burden of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease that has contributed to diagnosis, management, and prevention efforts for these diseases, including vaccine deployment and vaccine development. He served as expert advisor on invasive Salmonella disease to the World Health Organization (WHO) Foodborne Diseases Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), and as a member of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization Working Group on Typhoid Vaccines. Crump has a research interest in ethics in global health training, spurred by concern for the unintended consequences of expansion of short-term global health training opportunities in low-resource areas. With Dr. Jeremy Sugarman, Crump Co-Chaired the Wellcome Trust-funded Working Group on Ethics Guidelines for Global Health Training (WEIGHT) that developed initial guidelines for responsible global health training programs.  Awards and honors  Crump was awarded the 2005 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention James H. Steele Veterinary Public Health Award for outstanding contributions in the investigation, control, or prevention of zoonotic diseases or other animal-related human health problems. In 2012, Crump received the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Bailey K. Ashford Medal for distinguished work in tropical medicine.  Publications  As of August 2020, Crump had published 250 scientific manuscripts, his work had been cited >42,000 times, and his H-index was 74.

The modern incarnation of the institution re-emerged as the national naval force of the Kingdom of England in 1660, following the Restoration of King Charles II to the throne. However, for more than a thousand years before that there had been English naval forces varying in type and organization. In 1707 it became the naval force of the Kingdom of Great Britain after the Union between England and Scotland which merged the English navy with the much smaller Royal Scots Navy, although the two had begun operating together from the time of the Union of the Crowns in 1603. Before the creation of the Royal Navy, the English navy had no defined moment of formation; it started out as a motley assortment of \\"King's ships\\" during the Middle Ages assembled only as needed and then dispersed, began to take shape as a standing navy during the 16th century, and became a regular establishment during the tumults of the 17th century. England before 1603=The early English kingdoms Some evidence of English ship construction in the Anglo-Saxon period is available from the boat burials at Snape (about 550) and Sutton Hoo (about 625), though warships would probably have been larger than the vessels interred there. There is little evidence of the naval activities of the English kingdoms before the mid-9th century, but King Edwin of Northumbria (616/7-633/4) conquered the Isle of Man and Anglesey, and another King of Northumbria, Ecgfrith, sent a military expedition to Gaelic Ireland in 684.Swanton, p. 39 The threat from Vikings increased significantly in the early 9th century, and invasions became a serious menace from about 835.Savage, p. 84 In 851 an unprecedentedly large force of Danes invaded southern England, carried on about 350 ships. Campaigning inland, this force was decisively defeated by King √Üthelwulf of Wessex at the Battle of Aclea, but a naval action was also won by √Üthelwulf's son √Üthelstan and Ealdorman Ealhere at Sandwich, Kent, capturing nine ships.Savage, p. 86 The Danish \\"Great Army\\" which conquered about half of England during its campaigns in 865-79 operated largely by land, and no naval operations against it by the English kingdoms are recorded. However, in the following years a number of clashes are recorded between Viking raiders and the forces of Alfred the Great, the last remaining English king. These included a victory over four ships by a squadron led by the king himself in 882, and operations against the Danes of East Anglia in 884, which saw an entire Danish squadron of sixteen ships captured by an English force, which was then itself defeated on its way home by another fleet.Savage, p. 93 In 896 Alfred had a number of new ships built to his own design, \\"nearly twice as long as the others, some having 60 oars, some even more\\", to counter raids along the south coast.Savage, p. 107 A clash in the Solent later that year saw nine of his new ships defeat six Danish ships. United England (927-1066) Naval operations are glimpsed again in 934, when King √Üthelstan, now ruler of all England, invaded Scotland with a combined sea and land force.Sarah Foot, √Üthelstan: the first king of England (2011). p. 165 Under King Edgar (959-975) the kings of Scotland, of Cumbria and of four other kingdoms would regularly swear to be King Edgar's faithful allies by land and sea.Swanton, p. 119 The renewal of serious Viking attacks in the reign of √Üthelred the Unready led to a general muster of ships at London in 992 against the fleet of Olaf Tryggvason, but amid confusion and alleged treachery the English fleet suffered heavy losses. In 1008, √Üthelred ordered a new programme of naval construction, under which one warship was to be provided for every 310 hides of land in the kingdom. In 1009 the king took the new fleet out to Sandwich, Kent to guard against the threat of invasion (this port, near the junction of the North Sea and the English Channel and lying within the sheltered offshore anchorage of the Downs, appears frequently in the sources for this period as a position where fleets were stationed on guard). However, this deployment ended in disaster due to internal dissension. Accusations against the great Sussex thegn Wulfnoth (probably the father of Godwin, later Earl of Wessex) led to his flight from the fleet with 20 ships manned by his supporters. A force of 80 ships sent after him was wrecked by a storm and the beached ships burnt by Wulfnoth, after which the remainder of the fleet dispersed in confusion.Swanton, p. 138 English naval forces were supplemented by Scandinavian mercenaries. Directly after the fiasco of 1009 a new invasion force led by the Danish warlord Thorkell the Tall began a devastating campaign in England. When the attackers were finally bought off and dispersed in 1012, Thorkell entered √Üthelred's service with 45 ships. When the King of Denmark Swein Forkbeard conquered England in 1013, the fleet remained loyal to √Üthelred after the rest of the kingdom had submitted to the invader. Swein's death in 1014 led to √Üthelred's brief return to power, but in 1015-16 England was again conquered by Swein's son Cnut, whose invasion force had been joined by 40 ship-loads of Danish mercenaries who defected from √Üthelred's service. Having secured the throne, Cnut dismissed the bulk of his fleet, but maintained a standing force of 40 ships, funded by national taxation. In 1025 Cnut led an Anglo-Danish fleet to campaign against his enemies in Scandinavia, and in 1028 he conquered Norway with a force including 50 English ships. The standing fleet was in time reduced to 16 ships, but increased again after Cnut's son Harthacnut brought a fleet from Denmark to claim the throne in 1040.Swanton, p. 160 The early years of Edward the Confessor's reign saw a series of large naval operations under the king's own command, including in 1045 the deployment at Sandwich of a particularly big fleet to guard against an expected invasion from Norway, and a blockade of Flanders in 1049, in support of a land campaign by the German Emperor Henry III. In 1050 Edward reduced the standing force, then numbering 14 ships, to five. After a political crisis in 1051 saw Earl Godwin and his sons driven into exile, Edward sent out a force of 40 ships to Sandwich to guard against their return. However Godwin, returning with ships from Flanders, eluded them, and he and his son Harold, coming from Ireland, gathered a powerful fleet from the \\"butsecarles\\" (literally \\"boatmen\\") of the Earldom of Wessex. With this fleet and an army also gathered from Wessex, Godwin came to London and confronted the king, who was supported by an army and a fleet of 50 ships. The crisis ended with the negotiated reinstatement of Godwin and his sons to their former possessions and power.Swanton, p. 168 In 1063 Earl Harold Godwinson led a fleet to Wales against Gruffydd ap Llywelyn of Gwynedd, while his brother Tostig invaded by land. Harold put Gruffydd to flight and destroyed his fleet and his residence at Rhuddlan, defeats which led to Gruffydd's murder by his own people in order to end the war. King Edward installed Gruffydd's half- brothers in his place, and they swore to serve him \\"on water and on land\\", suggesting that England's native naval forces could be supplemented by tributary contingents from neighbouring dependent territories as well as by foreign mercenaries.Swanton, p. 190 In 1066, following Edward's death and his own election as king, Harold assembled a powerful army and fleet in the Solent to guard against the invasion being prepared by William of Normandy. However, having waited all summer without the Normans appearing, their provisions were exhausted and Harold was forced to dismiss them; many of the ships were wrecked on the way back to London. William was then able to cross unopposed.Swanton, p. 196 House of Normandy (1066-1135) English naval power seemingly declined as a result of the Norman conquest.Rodger, Safeguard, pp. 35‚Äì49. Following the Battle of Hastings, the Norman navy that brought over William the Conqueror seemingly disappeared from records, possibly due to William receiving all of those ships from feudal obligations or because of some sort of leasing agreement which lasted only for the duration of the enterprise. There is no evidence that William adopted or kept the Anglo-Saxon ship mustering system, known as the scipfryd. Hardly noted after 1066, it appears that the Normans let the scipfryd languish so that by 1086, when the Doomsday Book was completed, it had apparently ceased to exist. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in 1068, Harold Godwinson's sons Godwine and Edmund conducted a \\"raiding-ship army\\" which came from Ireland, raiding across the region and to the townships of Bristol and Somerset. In the following year of 1069, they returned with a bigger fleet which they sailed up the River Taw before being beaten back by a local earl near Devon. However, this made explicitly clear that the newly conquered England under Norman rule, in effect, ceded the Irish Sea to the Irish, the Vikings of Dublin, and other Norwegians. Besides ceding away the Irish Sea, the Normans also ceded the North Sea, a major area where Nordic peoples travelled. In 1069, this lack of naval presence in the North Sea allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of King Svein Estridsson) and his sons Harald, Cnut, and Bjorn. In addition to the ravaging of the English townships of Dover, Sandwich, Ipswich, and Norwich, the Danes connected with the aetheling (Anglo-Saxon Heir to the crown) Edgar and rebels in Northumbria. William chased Edgar and the rebels to Scotland, but could not defeat the Danes, causing him to resort to the old Anglo-Saxon practice of paying them off. Though William the Conqueror caused a massive decline in English naval practices, he did occasionally assemble small fleets of ships, but only for limited activities. Most of these limited actions also did not involve direct combat at sea. An example of this was when the rebellious Anglo-Saxon Earl Morcar and his ally Bishop √Üthelwine of Durham sought refuge on the Isle of Ely in 1071. According to Florence of Worcester reported, \\"The king [William the Conqueror] hearing of this, blocked up every outlet on the eastern side by means of boatmen [butescarls], and caused a bridge two miles long to be constructed on the western side.\\" The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also confirms these events. Though William used ships for blockading purposes and for important strategic engagements, his infrequent use of an established navy promoted a damaging practice of infrequent maritime operations, which his successors would practice on a frequent basis. House of Anjou (1154-1216) In 1141 Henry II invaded Ireland while a fleet of 167 ships sailed from Dartmouth on a crusade to capture Lisbon from the Moors. A further fleet was raised for the Third Crusade in 1190. The Norman kings had a regular need for cross-Channel transport and raised a naval force in 1155, with the Cinque Ports required to provide a total of 57 ships crewed by 21 sailors apiece. However, with the loss of Normandy by King John (who even so had a fleet of 500 sail in an attempt to regain it), this had to become a force capable of preventing invasion and protecting traffic to and from Gascony. In the first years of the 13th century William de Wrotham appears in the records as the clerk of a force of galleys to be used against Philip Augustus of France. In 1206 King John ordered 54 royal galleys to be constructed and between 1207 and 1211 ¬£5000 was spent on the royal fleet. The fleet also started to have an offensive capability, as in 1213 when ships commanded by the Earl of Salisbury raided Damme in Flanders, where they burned many ships of the French fleet. When King John‚Äôs campaign to recover Normandy from the French was at a breaking point, the northern barons of England began to rise in revolt. Forced by the insurrection, John signed the Magna Carta on 15 June 1215, in hopes of satisfying the barons to buy time for Pope Innocent III to excommunicate the rebellious barons and condemn the Magna Carta. From this, the barons revolted, commencing the First Barons' War with the capture of Rochester Castle. Grasping, however, that they (the barons) were outmatched by royalists and King John, the barons decided to turn to France for assistance. Realizing the baron's intentions, John attempted to assemble a Navy, to prevent the arrival of the French. France, who saw this as a fortunate opportunity, decided to assist the barons, with Phillip II's (King of France) son Dauphin Louis, later known as Louis VIII of France, to invade England. With John unable to swiftly build up his navy, due to the adopting of infrequent maritime operations from William the Conqueror, the French Navy under Louis invaded and landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216. With Louis near London, John fled to Winchester, where he would stay until his death on 19 October 1216, having his nine-year-old son Henry III as heir to the throne. House of Plantagenet (1216-1399) Paradoxically, John's death turned the tide against Louis, the rebellion in England, and the development of the English navy. William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who became regent to the son of the recently deceased English king, began to regain the loyalties to the royalist cause through a regimen of compromise. Among these were the Cinque Ports, who had substantial amounts of maritime ships. With the English now having a substantial number of vessels, Louis returned to France to gather reinforcements and more maritime vessels. Though he succeeded, English vessels began to blockade and harass French shipping, trade, and blockaded multiple French-controlled English ports. By mid-1217, English royalists began to gain the advantage over the rebellious Barons and their French allies. Again needing more troops, Louis requested from his wife Blanche of Castile to assemble more troops for him. Up to the task, Blanche assisted in gathering forces for her husband, with a massive French force being assembled by August 1217, at the port of Calais. At the head of the French transports was Eustace the Monk, Louis‚Äô best naval commander, who had helped Louis escape many English blockades, such as the one in Winchelsea in January 1217. The subsequent encounter between the two fleets came in the Downs off Sandwich, known as the Battle of Sandwich. For the first time in northern waters a decisive naval battle was fought on the open sea. The battle was dominated by the English, with French losing almost all of their ships, including Eustace the Monk who was killed in the action that took place. With the death of Eustace the Monk and the defeat of the French at Sandwich, William Marshal was able to isolate Louis in London, compelling him to renounce his claim to the English throne and force him to return to France. Later in the 13th century ships begin to be mentioned regularly as support for various campaigns under Edward I, most notably in Luke de Tany's capture of Anglesey in 1282. Edward II of England attempted to blockade Scotland, but this was ineffective. Naval expenses were considerable, with twenty 120-oared galleys being ordered in 1294 because of a fear of French invasion. In 1224 the first Admiral of England is recorded in charters: Henry III granted the title to Sir Richard de Lucy. Four other men were granted the same title but styled differently: in 1263 Sir Thomas de Moleton as Captain and Guardian of the English Seas and in 1286 Sir William de Leybourne, as Admiral of the English Seas; both of these offices were granted by King Edward I. In 1321 Sir Richard de Leyburn was granted the title Admiral of England, Wales and Ireland by Edward II and in 1360 Sir John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp de Warwick, as High Admiral of England was appointed by Edward III. Although each of these held the title of Admiralis Angliae, the civil jurisdiction of their offices was never used, nor did they officially receive letters patent from the monarch. In 1321 Sir John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp de Warwick was also appointed Admiral of the South, North and West, effectively the English Navy's first Admiral of the Fleet. The first Admiral to be granted a patent by the monarch was Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel as High Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine given by King Richard III in 1385. In the early 13th century English admirals tended to be knights or barons, and their role was essentially administrative, not operational. In 1294 Edward I divided the English Navy into three geographical 'admiralties' each assigned a fleet and each of them administered by an admiral: they were the Admiral of the Northern Fleet, the Admiral of the Western Fleet and the Admiral of the Southern Fleet; they were each responsible for managing and enforcing admiralty jurisdiction in their respective areas and raising and administering the ships. It also allowed Edward I to mount expeditions to Brittany, Flanders or Scotland with greater ease. The English and French navies at the Battle of Sluys in 1340 The Hundred Years' War (1337‚Äì1453) included frequent cross-Channel raids, frequently unopposed due to the lack of effective communications and the limitations of naval organisation. The navy was used for reconnaissance as well as for attacks on merchantmen and warships. Prize ships and cargoes were shared out. The Battle of Sluys in 1340 was a significant English victory, with Edward III of England's 160 ships (mostly hired merchant vessels) assaulting a French force in the Zwyn estuary and capturing 180 French ships in hand-to-hand combat. Les Espagnols sur Mer, fought in the Channel off Winchelsea in 1350, is possibly the first major battle in the open sea in English history; the English captured 14 Spanish ships. The 14th century also saw the creation of the post of Clerk of the King's Ships, who appears from 1344 on as in charge of some 34 royal vessels. At one point in the mid-14th century Edward III's navy had some 700 ships in service overall.Graham Cushway, Edward III and the War at Sea: The English Navy, 1327‚Äì1377 (Boydell Press, 2011) In 1364 the Northern and Western admiralties and fleets were combined commanded by the Admiral of the North and West, and remained so on an ad hoc basis until 1414. Houses of Lancaster and York (1399-1485) Henry V of England revived the navy, building a number of balingers and \\"great ships\\", increasing the fleet from six in 1413 to 39 in 1417/8. These included the 1,400-ton Grace Dieu (which still exists, buried in the Hamble estuary), and won victories in the Channel, reaching a high point in 1417 when the French fleet was destroyed. An invasion of France took place in 1415 which led to the capture of Harfleur and the victory at Agincourt. A second invasion, beginning in 1419, led to the conquest of the Channel coast of France, almost eliminating any seaborne threat to England and enabling the running down of Henry's naval forces.Wagner, p. 322 Dealing with the matter of naval administration during the 15th century the most significant development was the establishment of the first Admiralty of England. This was brought about in 1412 when the remaining geographic 'admiralties' (the Northern Admiralty and Western Admiralty) were abolished and their functions were unified under a single administrative and operational command, the Admiralty Office, later called the Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office. There was no significant new construction until the 1480s, by which time ships mounted guns regularly; the Regent of 1487 had 225 serpentines, an early type of cannon. Henry VII deserves a large share of credit for the establishment of a standing navy. Although there is no evidence for a conscious change of policy, Henry soon embarked on a programme of building larger ships than previously. He also invested in dockyards, and commissioned the oldest surviving dry dock in 1495 at Portsmouth.Arthur Nelson, The Tudor navy: the ships, men and organisation, 1485‚Äì1603 (2001) p. 36 House of Tudor, 1485‚Äì1603 Henry Gr√¢ce √† Dieu, from the Anthony Roll. \\"Peter Pomegranate\\" sister ship of the \\"Mary Rose\\" Mary Rose, from the Anthony Roll A view of the second roll of the Anthony Roll, showing the layout used throughout the document.

Salamander, a galleass captured from the Scots and one of only three ships in the Anthony Roll which has an identifiable figurehead. The Galley Subtle, a Mediterranean-type galley which formed the centrepiece of the three combined rolls and the illustration that displays the highest artistic quality. The fleet began to increase in size under Henry VIII, from five ships in 1509 to thirty in 1514, including the Henri Gr√¢ce a Dieu (\\"Great Harry\\") of 1500 tons and the Mary Rose of 600 tons. Most of the fleet was laid up after 1525 but, because of the break with the Catholic Church, 27 new ships, as well as forts and blockhouses, were built with money from the sale of the monasteries. A detailed and largely accurate contemporary document, the Anthony Roll, was written in 1540. It gave a nearly complete account of the English navy, which contained roughly 50 ships, including carracks, galleys, galleasses and pinnaces. The carracks included famous vessels such as the Mary Rose, the Peter Pomegranate and the Henry Grace √† Dieu. In 1544 Boulogne was captured. The French navy raided the Isle of Wight and was then fought off in the Battle of the Solent in 1545, before which Mary Rose sank. In the year following the battle, Henry VIII ordered the creation of a standing \\"Navy Royal\\", a major expansion of the fleet, and the origin of the modern institution. For the first time, it had its own secretariat, dockyards and a permanent core of purpose-built warships, emerged during the reign of Henry VIII.Rodger, Safeguard, pp. 221‚Äì237. In 1546, to support the Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office in the civil administration of the Royal Navy, Henry VIII established a second organisation, the Office of the Council of the Marine. This consisted of the Chief Officers of the Admiralty who acted as advisers to the Lord Admiral of England. In 1576 it moved to Deptford Strand, where it became part of the Navy Office. In the 1550s English gentlemen opposed to the Catholicism of Philip and Mary took refuge in France and were active in the English Channel as privateers under letters of marque from the French king. Six of their vessels were captured off Plymouth in July 1556.David Loades, and Charles S. Knighton, eds. The Navy of Edward VI and Mary I (Ashgate, 2013). In 1580 Spanish and Portuguese troops were sent to Ireland, but were defeated by an English army and naval force. =Spanish Armada (1588)= Sir Francis Drake While Henry VIII had launched the Royal Navy, his successors Edward VI and Mary I had neglected it, and it was little more than a system of coastal defence. Elizabeth made naval strength a high priority.Julian S. Corbett, Drake and the Tudor Navy, With a History of the Rise of England as a Maritime Power (2 vol 1898) online She risked war with Spain by supporting the \\"Sea Dogs\\", such as John Hawkins and Francis Drake, who preyed on the Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. The Navy yards were leaders in technical innovation, and the captains devised new tactics. Parker (1996) argues that the full-rigged ship was one of the greatest technological advances of the century, and permanently transformed naval warfare. In 1573 English shipwrights introduced designs, first demonstrated in the Dreadnaught, that allowed the ships to sail faster and manoeuvre better, and permitted heavier guns.Geoffrey Parker, \\"The 'Dreadnought' Revolution of Tudor England\\", Mariner's Mirror, Aug 1996, Vol. 82 Issue 3, pp 269‚Äì300 Whereas before warships had tried to grapple with each other so that soldiers could board the enemy ship, now they stood off and fired broadsides that would sink the enemy vessel.Rodger (1997), pp. 312, 316 Under Elizabeth I England became involved in a war with the Spanish Empire, at the time Europe's superpower and the leading naval power. Spain threatened England with invasion to restore Catholicism in England, at a time when England supported Dutch rebels, and raided Spanish commerce and colonies.Rodger, Safeguard, pp. 238‚Äì253, 281‚Äì286, 292‚Äì296.. In 1588, Philip II of Spain sent the Spanish Armada against England to end English support for Dutch rebels, to stop English corsair activity and to depose the Protestant Elizabeth I and restore Catholicism to England. Preparations, under the command of the Marqu√©s de Santa Cruz, began in 1586 but were seriously delayed by a surprise attack on C√°diz by Sir Francis Drake in 1587. By the time the expedition was ready Santa Cruz had died, and command was given to the Duke of Medina Sedonia. The Armada consisted of 130 ships, including transports and merchantmen, and carried about 30,000 men. It was to go to Flanders and from there convoy, the army of the Duke of Parma, to invade England. It set out from Lisbon in May 1588 but was forced into A Coru√±a by storms and did not set sail again until July. 16th-century painting of the Spanish Armada in battle with English warships The Armada was first sighted by the English off Lizard Point, in Cornwall, on 19 July, and the first engagement took place off Plymouth on 21 July. In four hours the Spanish fired 720 round shot and the English 2,000 rounds, but little real damage was done to either side.Clodfelter, p. 19. In fighting off Portland Bill on 23 July, some 5,000 shots were discharged by the rival fleets. Spanish casualties were about 50 killed and 70 wounded.Clodfelter, p. 20. After another engagement off the Isle of Wight on 24 July, in which the Armada lost another 50 men slain, Medina Sedonia steered for Calais to replenish his empty powder and shot stocks from Parma's ammunition depots. Parma, however, blockaded in Bruges by 60 Dutch ships, was unable to come to the Armada's assistance. After an indecisive engagement with the English off Gravelines, the Armada ran out of ammunition. The Spanish had expended 125,000 cannonballs against the English. Consequently, the Spanish commander decided to retreat to Spain by going north around Scotland and Ireland. The Spanish ships were dispersed by storms; their provisions gave out, and many of those who landed in Ireland were killed by English troops. Only about half the fleet reached home. An English Armada sent to destroy the port at A Coru√±a in 1589 was itself defeated with 40 ships sunk and 15,000 men lost.Fern√°ndez Duro, Ces√°reo (1972). Armada Espa√±ola desde la Uni√≥n de los Reinos de Castilla y Arag√≥n. Museo Naval de Madrid, Instituto de Historia y Cultura Naval, Tomo III, Cap√≠tulo III. Madrid. p.51 In October 1596, another Armada left Lisbon. The invasion fleet numbered 126 ships and carried 9,000 Spaniards and 3,000 Portuguese. The Royal Navy was unprepared, but England was saved by stormy seas that wrecked 72 ships and drowned 3,000 sailors and soldiers.Clodfelter 2017: 21 The following year, in October 1597, yet another Armada was sent out, but this also was blown back. The destruction of the Spanish Armada marked the high point of Elizabeth's reign. Technically, the Armada failed because Spain's over-complex strategy required coordination between the invasion fleet and the Spanish army on shore. But the poor design of the Spanish cannons meant they were much slower in reloading in a close- range battle, allowing England to take control. Spain and France still had stronger fleets, but England was catching up.Geoffrey Parker, \\"Why the Armada Failed\\", History Today, May 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 5, pp 26‚Äì33Hutchinson, The Spanish Armada (2014). Scotland before 1603 Scottish Red Ensign, flown by ships of the Royal Scots Navy The Royal Scots Navy (or Old Scots Navy) was the navy of the Kingdom of Scotland until its merger with the Kingdom of England's Royal Navy in 1707 as a consequence of the Treaty of Union and the Acts of Union that ratified it. From 1603 until 1707, the Royal Scots Navy and England's Royal Navy were organised as one force, though not formally merged.Winfield, xviii There are mentions in medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including William the LionP. F. Tytler, History of Scotland, Volume 2 (London: Black, 1829), pp. 309‚Äì310. and Alexander II. The latter took personal command of a large naval force which sailed from the Firth of Clyde and anchored off the island of Kerrera in 1249, intended to transport his army in a campaign against the Kingdom of the Isles, but he died before the campaign could begin.J. Hunter, Last of the Free: A History of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (London: Random House, 2011), , pp. 106‚Äì111.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 147. Viking naval power was disrupted by conflicts between the Scandinavian kingdoms but entered a period of resurgence in the 13th century when Norwegian kings began to build some of the largest ships seen in Northern European waters. These included king Hakon Hakonsson's Krists√∫√∞in, built at Bergen from 1262‚Äì63, which was long, of 37 rooms.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain 660‚Äì1649 (London: Penguin UK, 2004), , pp. 74‚Äì75. In 1263 Hakon responded to Alexander III's designs on the Hebrides by personally leading a major fleet of forty vessels, including the Krists√∫√∞in, to the islands, where they were boosted by local allies to as many as 200 ships.P. J. Potter, Gothic Kings of Britain: the Lives of 31 Medieval Rulers, 1016‚Äì1399 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2008), , p. 157. Records indicate that Alexander had several large oared ships built at Ayr, but he avoided a sea battle. Defeat on land at the Battle of Largs and winter storms forced the Norwegian fleet to return home, leaving the Scottish crown as the major power in the region and leading to the ceding of the Western Isles to Alexander in 1266.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 153. English naval power was vital to King Edward I's successful campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland and his allies in the Islands to transport and supply his armies.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain. Volume One 660‚Äì1649 (London: Harper, 1997) pp. 74‚Äì90. Part of the reason for Robert I's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea. The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing King Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314. Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318. After the establishment of Scottish independence, King Robert I turned his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign, he supervised the building of at least one royal man-of-war near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde. In the late 14th century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers.J. Grant, \\"The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710\\", Publications of the Navy Records Society, 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913‚Äì14), pp. i‚Äìxii. King James I of Scotland (1394‚Äì1437, reigned 1406‚Äì1437), took a greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424, he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith, a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429. The office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period. It would soon become a hereditary office, in the control of the Earls of Bothwell in the 15th and 16th centuries and the Earls of Lennox in the 17th century.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 10. King James II (1430‚Äì1460, reigned 1437‚Äì1460) is known to have purchased a caravel by 1449.Rodger Command, pp. 166‚Äì167 Around 1476 the Scottish merchant John Barton received letters of marque that allowed him to gain compensation for the capture of his vessels by the Portuguese by capturing ships under their colours. These letters would be repeated to his three sons John, Andrew and Robert, who would play a major part in the Scottish naval effort into the 16th century.E. P. Statham, Privateers and Privateering (Cambridge University Press, 2011), , pp. 19‚Äì20. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III (r. 1451‚Äì88) received assistance from his two warships the Flower and the King's Carvel also known as the Yellow Carvel, commanded by Andrew Wood of Largo. After the king's death Wood served his son James IV (r. 1488‚Äì1513), defeating an English incursion into the Forth by five English ships in 1489 and three more heavily armed English ships off the mouth of the River Tay the next year.N. Tranter, The Story of Scotland (Neil Wilson, 2012), . James IV put the Royal Scots Navy on a new footing, founding a harbour at Newhaven in May 1504, and two years later ordering the construction of a dockyard at the Pools of Airth. The upper reaches of the Forth were protected by new fortifications on Inchgarvie.N. Macdougall, James IV (Tuckwell, 1997), , p. 235. Scottish ships had some success against privateers, accompanied the king in his expeditions in the islands and intervened in conflicts in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea. Expeditions to the Highlands to Islands to curb the power of the MacDonald Lord of the Isles were largely ineffective until in 1504 the king accompanied a squadron under Wood heavily armed with artillery, which battered the MacDonald strongholds into submission. Since some of these island fortresses could only be attacked from seaward, naval historian N. A. M. Rodger has suggested this may have marked the end of medieval naval warfare in the British Isles, ushering in a new tradition of artillery warfare. The king acquired a total of 38 ships for the Royal Scottish Navy, including , and the carrack or Great Michael, the largest warship of its time (1511).T. Christopher Smout, Scotland and the Sea (Edinburgh: Rowman and Littlefield, 1992), , p. 45. The latter, built at great expense at Newhaven and launched in 1511, was in length, weighed 1,000 tons, had 24 cannon, and was, at that time, the largest ship in Europe.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , pp. 33‚Äì34. It marked a shift in design as it was crafted specifically to carry a main armament of heavy artillery. Barbary ship and two galleys in Tripoli in 1676 During the Rough Wooing, the attempt to force a marriage between James V's heir Mary, Queen of Scots and Henry VIII's son, the future Edward VI, in 1542, Mary Willoughby, Lion, and Salamander under the command of John Barton, son of Robert Barton, attacked merchants and fishermen off Whitby. They later blockaded a London merchant ship called Antony of Bruges in a creek on the coast of Brittany.M. Merriman, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, 2000), p. 181. In 1544, Edinburgh was attacked by an English marine force and burnt. Salamander and the Scottish-built Unicorn were captured at Leith. The Scots still had two royal naval vessels and numerous smaller private vessels.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 50. When, as a result of the series of international treaties, Charles V declared war upon Scotland in 1544, the Scots were able to engage in a highly profitable campaign of privateering that lasted six years and the gains of which probably outweighed the losses in trade with the Low Countries.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 181‚Äì182. The Scots operated in the West Indies from the 1540s, joining the French in the capture of Burburuta in 1567.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 172. English and Scottish naval warfare and privateering broke out sporadically in the 1550s.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain 660‚Äì1649 (London: Penguin UK, 2004), , p. 197. When Anglo-Scottish relations deteriorated again in 1557 as part of a wider war between Spain and France, small ships called 'shallops' were noted between Leith and France, passing as fishermen, but bringing munitions and money. Private merchant ships were rigged at Leith, Aberdeen and Dundee as men-of-war, and the regent Mary of Guise claimed English prizes, one over 200 tons, for her fleet.John Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol. 3, part 2 (Oxford, 1822), p. 81. The re-fitted Mary Willoughby sailed with 11 other ships against Scotland in August 1557, landing troops and six field guns on Orkney to attack the Kirkwall Castle, St Magnus Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace. The English were repulsed by a Scottish force numbering 3000, and the English vice-admiral Sir John Clere of Ormesby was killed, but none of the English ships were lost.John Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol. 3 part 2 (Oxford, 1822), pp. 67‚Äì69, 86‚Äì87, and G. Buchanan, History of Scotland, trans Aikman, vol. 2 (1827), 396, bk. 16, cap. 19: R. Holinshed, Raphael, Chronicles: Scotland, vol. 5 (1808), p. 585. The Scottish Reformation in 1560 established a government that was friendly to England and this resulted in less military necessity to maintain a fleet of great ships. With the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the incentive to rebuild a separate royal fleet for Scotland diminished further since James VI now controlled the powerful English Royal Navy, which could send ships north to defend Scottish interests, and which now opened its ranks to Scottish officers.Wills, pp. 27-28 After Union of the Crowns, 1603-1707 Sovereign of the Seas After 1603 the English and Scottish fleets were organized together under James I but the efficiency of the Navy declined gradually, while corruption grew until brought under control in an inquiry of 1618. James concluded a peace with Spain and privateering was outlawed. Notable construction in the early 17th century included the 1,200-ton , the first three-decker, and in 1637, designed by Phineas Pett.Lavery, Ships of the Line vol. 1, p. 158. During the early 17th century, England's relative naval power deteriorated, and there were increasing raids by Barbary corsairs on ships and English coastal communities to capture people as slaves, which the Navy had little success in countering.Rodger, Safeguard, pp. 349‚Äì363. Charles I undertook a major programme of warship building, creating a small force of powerful ships, but his methods of fundraising to finance the fleet contributed to the outbreak of the English Civil War.Rodger, Safeguard, pp. 379‚Äì394, 482. However, by the end of the century the Royal Navy completed the transition from a semi-amateur Navy Royal fighting in conjunction with private vessels into a fully professional institution. Its financial provisions were gradually regularised, it came to rely on dedicated warships only, and it developed a professional officer corps with a defined career structure, superseding an earlier mix of \\"gentlemen\\" (upper-class soldiers) and \\"tarpaulins\\" (professional seamen, who generally served on merchant or fishing vessels in peacetime).Rodger, Safeguard, pp. 395‚Äì398; Rodger, Command, pp. 33‚Äì55, 95‚Äì122 Ollard, 1984, ch.16; Operations under James I did not go well, with expeditions against Algerian pirates in 1620/1, Cadiz in 1625, and La Rochelle in 1627/8 being expensive failures.Fissel, p. 126-127 Charles I (1625-1649) In the 1620s, Scotland found herself fighting a naval war as England's ally, first against Spain and then also against France, while simultaneously embroiled in undeclared North Sea commitments in the Danish intervention in the Thirty Years' War. In 1626 a squadron of three ships was bought and equipped, at a cost of least ¬£5,200 sterling, to guard against privateers operating out of Spanish-controlled Dunkirk and other ships were armed in preparation for potential action. The acting High Admiral John Gordon of Lochinvar organized as many as three marque fleets of privateers.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 169. It was probably one of Lochinvar's marque fleets that was sent to support the English Royal Navy in defending Irish waters in 1626.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 168. In 1627, the Royal Scots Navy and accompanying contingents of burgh privateers participated in the major expedition to Biscay.R. B. Manning, An Apprenticeship in Arms: The Origins of the British Army 1585‚Äì1702 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , p. 118. The Scots also returned to the West Indies, with Lochinvar taking French prizes and founding the colony of Charles Island. In 1629, two squadrons of privateers led by Lochinvar and William Lord Alexander, sailed for Canada, taking part in the campaign that resulted in the capture of Quebec from the French, which was handed back after the subsequent peace.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 174. Charles I levied \\"ship money\\" from 1634 and this unpopular tax was one of the main causes of the first English Civil War from 1642‚Äì45. At the beginning of the war the navy, then consisting of 35 vessels, sided with Parliament. During the war the royalist side used a number of small ships to blockade ports and for supplying their own armies. These were afterwards combined into a single force. Charles had surrendered to the Scots and conspired with them to invade England during the second English Civil War of 1648‚Äì51. In 1648 part of the Parliamentary fleet mutinied and joined the Royalist side. However, the Royalist fleet was driven to Spain and destroyed during the Commonwealth period by Robert Blake. Commonwealth (1649-1660) The Interregnum saw a considerable expansion in the strength of the navy, both in number of ships and in internal importance within English policy. The execution of Charles I forced the rapid expansion of the navy, by multiplying England's actual and potential enemies, and many vessels were constructed from the 1650s onward under a reformed institution. The Commonwealth of England (as a republic), officially removed or changed most names and symbols (including heraldry) associated with royalty and/or the high church. This affected the Commonwealth Navy. As early as 1646, vessels were renamed, including Liberty (previously Charles), Resolution (ex-Royal Prince) and George (ex-St George); new vessels were often given names associated with institutions or individual officials, including President, Speaker, Fairfax (after Thomas Fairfax), Monck (George Monck) and Richard (Richard Cromwell), or Parliamentary victories in the civil war, such as Worcester, Bristol, Gainsborough, Preston, Langport, Newbury, Martson Moor, Nantwich, Colchester, and Naseby.John Barratt, 2006, Cromwell's Wars at Sea. Barnsley, South Yorkshire; Pen & Sword; pp. (The prefix \\"English ship\\" has normally been used of naval vessels before the late 17th century; \\"His Majesty's Ship\\" was not official usage at the time.) The new regime, isolated and threatened from all sides, dramatically expanded the Commonwealth Navy, which became the most powerful in the world.Rodger, Command, pp. 2‚Äì3, 216‚Äì217, 607. The Commonwealth's introduction of Navigation Acts, providing that all merchant shipping to and from England or her colonies should be carried out by English ships, led to war with the Dutch Republic.Rodger, Command, pp. 6‚Äì8. In the early stages of this First Anglo- Dutch War (1652‚Äì1654), the superiority of the large, heavily armed English ships was offset by superior Dutch tactical organisation and the fighting was inconclusive.Rodger, Command, pp. 12‚Äì16. English tactical improvements resulted in a series of crushing victories in 1653 at Portland, the Gabbard and Scheveningen, bringing peace on favourable terms.Rodger, Command, pp. 16‚Äì18. This was the first war fought largely, on the English side, by purpose- built, state-owned warships. It was followed by a war with Spain, which saw the English conquest of Jamaica in 1655 and successful attacks on Spanish treasure fleets in 1656 and 1657, but also the devastation of English merchant shipping by the privateers of Dunkirk, until their home port was captured by Anglo-French forces in 1658.A. P. van Vliet, \\"The influence of Dunkirk privateering on the North Sea (herring) fishery during the years 1580‚Äì1650\\", in J. Roding and L. Heerma van Voss (eds.), The North Sea and Culture (1550‚Äì1800) (Leiden 1996), 150‚Äì165, esp. 156. The Battle of Scheveningen, 10 August 1653 Restoration (1660-1688) The Restoration of the English monarchy occurred in May 1660, and Charles II assumed the throne. The Restoration Monarchy inherited this large navy and continued the same policy of expansion, focusing on large ships in order to provide a strong defence under Charles II. At the start of the Restoration, Parliament listed forty ships of the Royal Navy (not of the Summer's Guard) with a complement of 3,695 sailors. One of his first acts was to officially name the Royal Navy, The prefix HMS was also officially attached to its vessels for the first time. Nevertheless, the navy remained a national institution, rather than the personal possession of the reigning monarch, as it had been before the civil war. The administration of the navy was greatly improved by Sir William Coventry and Samuel Pepys, both of whom began their service in 1660 with the Restoration. While it was Pepys' diary that made him the most famous of all naval bureaucrats, his nearly thirty years of administration were crucial in replacing the ad hoc processes of years past with regular programmes of supply, construction, pay, and so forth. He was responsible for introduction of the \\"Navy List\\" which fixed the order of promotion. In 1664 the English captured New Amsterdam (later New York City) resulting in the Second Dutch War (1665‚Äì1667). In 1666 the Four Days Battle was a defeat for the English but the Dutch fleet was crushed a month later off Orfordness. In 1667 the Dutch mounted the Raid on the Medway, breaking into Chatham Dockyard and capturing or burning many of the Navy's largest ships at their moorings,Rodger 2004, pp. 76‚Äì7 which resulted in the most humiliating defeat in the Royal Navy's history.\\"It can hardly be denied that the Dutch raid on the Medway vies with the Battle of Majuba in 1881 and the Fall of Singapore in 1942 for the unenviable distinctor of being the most humiliating defeat suffered by British arms.\\" ‚Äì Charles Ralph Boxer: The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th Century, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London (1974), p.39 The English were also defeated at Solebay in 1672. The experience of large-scale battle was instructive to the Navy; the Articles of War regularizing the conduct of officers and seaman, and the \\"Fighting Instructions\\" establishing the line of battle, both date from this period.Articles of War, 1661, 1749 and 1866 / (1982) The influence and reforms of Samuel Pepys, the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and subsequently King James II, were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy.Ollard, 1984, ch.16 As a result of their defeat in the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch transformed their navy, largely abandoning the use of militarised merchantmen and establishing a fleet composed mainly of heavily armed, purpose-built warships, as the English had done previously. Consequently, the Second Anglo- Dutch War (1665‚Äì1667) was a closely fought struggle between evenly matched opponents, with English victory at Lowestoft (1665) countered by Dutch triumph in the epic Four Days' Battle (1666).Rodger, Command, pp. 67‚Äì76. The deadlock was broken not by combat but by the superiority of Dutch public finance, as in 1667 Charles II was forced to lay up the fleet in port for lack of money to keep it at sea while negotiating for peace. Disaster followed as the Dutch fleet mounted the Raid on the Medway, breaking into Chatham Dockyard and capturing or burning many of the Navy's largest ships at their moorings.Rodger, Command, pp. 76‚Äì77. In the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672‚Äì1674), Charles II allied with Louis XIV of France against the Dutch, but the combined Anglo-French fleet was fought to a standstill in a series of inconclusive battles, while the French invasion by land was warded off.Rodger, Command, pp. 80‚Äì85. The Dutch Raid on the Medway in 1667 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War During the 1670s and 1680s, the English Royal Navy succeeded in permanently ending the threat to English shipping from the Barbary corsairs, inflicting defeats which induced the Barbary states to conclude long-lasting peace treaties.Rodger, Command, pp. 88‚Äì91. Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, England joined the European coalition against Louis XIV in the War of the Grand Alliance (1688‚Äì1697). Louis' recent shipbuilding programme had given France the largest navy in Europe. A combined Anglo-Dutch fleet was defeated at Beachy Head (1690), but victory at Barfleur-La Hogue (1692) was a turning- point, marking the end of France's brief pre-eminence at sea and the beginning of an enduring English, later British, supremacy.Rodger, Command, pp. 142‚Äì152, 607‚Äì608. In 1683 the \\"Victualling Board\\" was set up which fixed the ration scales. In 1655 Blake routed the Barbary pirates and started a campaign against the Spanish in the Caribbean, capturing Jamaica.Coward 2002, p. 134 The Battle of Barfleur in 1692  Glorious Revolution and capture of Gibraltar 1688‚Äì1707  The Glorious Revolution of 1688 rearranged the political map of Europe, and led to a series of wars with France that lasted well over a century. This was the classic age of sail; while the ships themselves evolved in only minor ways, technique and tactics were honed to a high degree, and the battles of the Napoleonic Wars entailed feats that would have been impossible for the fleets of the 17th century. Because of parliamentary opposition, James II fled the country. The landing of William III and the Glorious Revolution itself was a gigantic effort involving 100 warships and 400 transports carrying 11,000 infantry and 4,000 horses. It was not opposed by the English or Scottish fleets. Louis XIV declared war just days later, a conflict which became known as the War of the Grand Alliance. The English defeat at the Battle of Beachy Head of 1690 led to an improved version of the Fighting Instructions, and subsequent operations against French ports proved more successful, leading to decisive victory at La Hougue in 1692.Pemsel, p. 59 By 1697 the English Royal Navy had 323 warships, while Scotland was still dependent on merchantman and privateers. In the 1690s, two separate schemes for larger naval forces were put in motion. As usual, the larger part was played by the merchant community rather than the government. The first was the Darien Scheme to found a Scottish colony in Spanish controlled America. It was undertaken by the Company of Scotland, who created a fleet of five ships, including Caledonia and St. Andrew, all built or chartered in Holland and Hamburg. It sailed to the Isthmus of Darien in 1698, but the venture failed and only one ship returned to Scotland.A. I. MacInnes and A. H. Williamson, eds., Shaping the Stuart World, 1603‚Äì1714: The Atlantic Connection (Brill, 2006), , p. 349. In the same period, it was decided to establish a professional navy for the protection of commerce in home waters during the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì1697) with France, with three purpose-built warships bought from English shipbuilders in 1696. These were Royal William, a 32-gun fifth rate and two smaller ships, Royal Mary and Dumbarton Castle, each of 24 guns, generally described as frigates.J. Grant, \\"The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710\\", Publications of the Navy Records Society, 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913‚Äì14), p. 48. The Battle of Cape Passaro, 11 August 1718 Naval operations in the War of the Spanish Succession (1702‚Äì13) were with the Dutch against the Spanish and French. They were at first focused on the acquisition of a Mediterranean base, culminating in an alliance with Portugal and the capture of Gibraltar (1704).

The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1950. History Peter Christian Weinreich Fischer (1772‚Äì1834) established a glazier's business at the an adjacent site on 20 June 1796. The two properties at Klosterstr√¶de 23 and Klosterstr√¶de 21 were constructed for him in 1811‚Äì12 and 1814‚Äì17. He subsequently ran his glazier's business, which would later be continued by his son, Peter Didrik Weinreich Fischer (1813‚Äì1884), from No. 21. The military officer C.

She lives and maintains a studio in Shelter Island, New York with her husband, the composer and pianist Bruce Wolosoff. She has two daughters, the singer- songwriter Juliet Garrett and the sculptor and mixed media artist Katya Wolosoff.  Biography  Margaret Garrett, born in North Carolina and raised in Pennsylvania, began her artistic career as a dancer. At 16 years old, she left home to join the Pennsylvania Ballet company; two years later, she joined the Cleveland Ballet as a soloist. By the time she was 21, Garrett was seeking other career options and avenues for expression as she experimented with theater, film, and choreography. Visual art, however, held the greatest appeal. Garrett undertook private study with the artist Thorpe Feidt and studied drawing at the Art Students League in New York City. Dance and movement inform Garrett‚Äôs work to this day: In an artist talk for the Parrish Art Museum, Garrett explained, \\"A lot of my painting is influenced by my background as a dancer. I see line as movement. I‚Äôm interested in the musicality of a piece ‚Äî I almost see [artworks] choreographically.\\" Other influences include music, the natural environment (particularly the one surrounding Garrett‚Äôs studio, which is located on a beach), calligraphy and even Italian friezes. Her work has been compared to the artists Joan Mitchell, Cy Twombly, and Mark Tobey. Many of these influences are evident in Garrett‚Äôs series Tuning Fields, a collection of textural paintings that the artist began in 2008 and which includes over 300 individual works. In 2014, selections from Tuning Fields were exhibited at a solo show at the Birnam Wood Galleries in New York City. \\"When I started the series, I was thinking of fields of vibration and how they interact and create harmony with one another,\\" Garrett said after the show. \\"And I liked the musical idea behind 'tuning' because they are sort of physical fields of movement and vibration.\\" The series has drawn critical praise. For Artsy, Alexxa Gotthardt wrote that \\"[e]n masse, the series feel likes the arc of a jazz or dance arrangement, with quiet moments and big crescendos.\\" ARTnews described \\"Tuning Fields 302\\" as \\"among the most compelling of the works[.] ‚Ä¶ The little lines behind all the color could evoke both language and a musical score. They might also conjure a mass of rose petals. Therein lies the poetry of these paintings.\\" In 2017, Garrett returned to dancing as a way to inspire new works: She began filming herself dancing and using the video clips to create moving collages. This approach has informed much of her recent work and earned her a fellowship at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts. Garrett took this approach to dance-informed visual work one step further in the project The19, which includes a video, two groups of collages, and a suite of seven woodblock and chine coll√© prints. For these works, Garrett was inspired by the Martha Graham Dance Company‚Äôs \\"The 19 Poses,\\" created in honor of the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. For the latter project, the Martha Graham Dance Company selected 19 photographs of the dancer and choreographer Martha Graham \\"in evocative moments from various performances from her long career.\\" Garrett first learned these poses \\"to get them in my body. It helped me to sort of understand the essence of the shape of each pose.\\" Filming this work led to the creation of the video collage, \\"19,\\" in which Garrett, in a red dress, performs the poses against a white background. Garrett then translated the abstract gestures of the poses to a painted collage. Another painted-and cut-paper collage make up \\"Improvisations 1-9.\\" In a final iteration, the gestural shapes were overlaid onto woodblock prints. Garrett‚Äôs paintings, prints, and videos have been exhibited in galleries and museums across the United States, including Danese/Corey, the FLAG Art Foundation, Birnam Wood, the Parrish Art Museum, and Planthouse. Her work has also been included in the Armory Show, Art on Paper, the Dallas Art Fair, and the Contemporary Print Fair at the Baltimore Museum of Art. In addition to her fellowship at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, she has held a residency in Assisi, Italy, and collaborated on two projects with Flatbed Press in Austin, Texas. Her work is held in numerous private and corporate collections in the United States and Europe, as well as in museum collections at the Parrish Art Museum and Guild Hall museum of East Hampton.

Biography  Viktor Balikhin (second row, first from the left) with fellow architecture students at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, 1914 Viktor Balikhin was born in Moscow in 1893. He studied architecture at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture and at Nikolai Ladovsky's United Workshops (OBMAS) at the VKhUTEMAS, from which he graduated with a project for an airport in 1924. From 1923 to 1929, Balikhin taught the propaedeutic course \\"Space\\" at the VKhUTEMAS. Balikhin was one of the founders of the Association of New Architects (ASNOVA, 1923-1932), alongside Nikolai Ladovsky, Vladimir Krinsky, Nikolai Dokuchaev, and others. Konstantin Melnikov joined the association between 1923 and 1924. El Lissitzky designed the only issue of the association's journal Izvestiia ASNOVA (News of ASNOVA) in 1926.For an English translation of Izvestiia ASNOVA, see After Ladovsky broke away from ASNOVA and formed the Association of Architect-Urbanists (ARU) in 1928, Balikhin became ASNOVA's de facto leader until 1932 when all artistic associations were dissolved. Balikhin worked collectively with other members of ASNOVA on submissions to architecture competitions, including for a monument to Lenin on the site of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow (with Georgy Krutikov and others, 1924), the All-Union Palace of the Arts in Moscow (with Vladimir Krinsky, Viktor Petrov, Irina Tikhomirova, and others, 1930), and the Palace of the Soviets (with Pyotr Budo, Militsa Prokhorova, Mikhail Turkus, Romuald Iodko, and Flora Sevortian, 1931). In July 1932, Balikhin and Ladovsky were elected to the board of the newly created Union of Soviet Architects. Balikhin worked at the Academy of Architecture of the USSR during the 1930s. Balikhin died in 1953. Balikhin's works were shown at the Paris-Moscou exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1979. The Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal holds the V.S.

He wrote for Arabic and Hebrew newspapers in Palestine, Egypt, and Lebanon and was employed by the Zionist Office in Jaffa under Arthur Ruppin.  Biography  Malul was born in Safed in 1892 to a family of Tunisian descent. When Malul was 8 years old, his father Rabbi Moses Hayyim, was appointed rabbi of the Jews of Tanta and Cairo. Malul was educated in Jewish schools in Cairo and Tanta and attended the American College of Tanta, studying Arabic literature, journalism, and philosophy. Malul began writing for the Egyptian newspaper al- Muqattam and worked to promote the status of Hebrew in Egyptian higher education. The Egyptian University (today known as Cairo University) appointed Malul as Hebrew lecturer in 1909, making him the first person to teach Hebrew at a university in Egypt.Amy Jacobson, ‚ÄúMalul, Nissim Jacob‚Äù, Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World, (Brill, 2010, ed. Norman A. Stillman). In 1911 Malul returned to Palestine and wrote for Hebrew and Arabic journals. Malul also began working for the Zionist Office in Jaffa, where his chief responsibility was to respond to anti-Zionist articles in Arab-Christian Palestinian newspapers such as Filastin and al-Karmil. Malul tried to establish a Jewish newspaper in Arabic, called Sawt al-‚ÄòUthmaniyya (The Voice of the Ottomans), an initiative he believed would help quell Arab anti- Zionism. He partnered with his friend, fellow journalist, and Zionist thinker Simon Moyal.Moshe Behar, and Zvi Ben-Dor Benite. Modern Middle Eastern Jewish Thought : Writings on Identity, Politics, and Culture, 1893‚Äì1958. (Waltham, Mass: Brandeis University Press 2013). With Moyal and his wife Esther Azhari Moyal, Malul founded Ha-Magen (the Shield), an organization of Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews whose goal was to respond to anti-Zionist arguments in the Arabic press and translate them into Hebrew. The association claimed one of its goals was the creation of greater understanding between Jews and Arabs in Palestine, and the promotion of peaceful relations with Arabs. During World War I Turkish authorities suspected Malul of anti-Ottoman activities he was expelled to Damascus. From there he escaped to Egypt where he remained until the end of the war, serving as an officer of the Hebrew Battalion and a translator for the British. He returned to Palestine under the British Mandate. There, with funding from the Zionist Organization, Malul founded two Arabic newspapers, al-AkhbƒÅr and al-SalƒÅm. From 1922 to 1925 he was a member of the Zionist National Committee, and later he published in Itti·∏•ƒÅd al-  øUmmƒÅl, a Zionist-supported Arabic workers‚Äô newspaper that attempted to raise class consciousness among Arab workers. From 1927 to 1929 he left Palestine for Iraq with his wife, Aliza, where he taught Arabic and Hebrew in a Jewish elementary school in Hila, Baghdad supported by the Anglo-Jewish Association. Malul authored several books in Hebrew and Arabic, including two plays and a Hebrew-Arabic/Arabic-Hebrew dictionary, and he translated works between Arabic and Hebrew. He died in Tel Aviv in 1959.  Views on Arabic Language in Zionism  Malul published articles in the Hebrew newspaper Ha-Herut (Freedom), where he argued for the place of the Arabic language and culture within Zionism. He believed knowledge of Arabic was vital to the Zionist cause of fostering understanding with the Arabs of Palestine. He also advocated for Semitic Jewish nationalism, believing Arabic to be inseparable from Jewish culture, as they were both Oriental in origin.Abigail Jacobson. ‚ÄúJews Writing in Arabic: Shimon Moyal, Nissim Malul and the Mixed Palestinian/Eretz Israeli Locale,‚Äù in Late Ottoman Palestine: The Period of Young Turk Rule, ed.

History In the Roman period, the south-eastern gate of Eboracum lay on the site of what is now King's Square. This was built in about 108, as recorded on a surviving inscription, now in the Yorkshire Museum. The area was mentioned by Egil Skallagrimsson in the 10th-century as \\"Konungsgarthr\\", and this has led to a belief that this was the location of the royal palace of the Danelaw, and possibly of its predecessors, the Kingdom of Northumbria and the Kingdom of Deira. By 1430, the west side of the square was occupied by a row of mercer's shops, with a building named \\"Hellekeld\\" to their south. In 1627, Duke Gill Hall lay on the north-east side of the square, on its corner with St Andrewgate, and it was recorded that the hall was formerly known as \\"the King's Court\\". Until the 18th-century, the square covered only a small area, and was often regarded as the southernmost part of Low Petergate, immediately north of the churchyard of Holy Trinity, King's Court. The churchyard was reduced on several occasions, and from 1780 the area became known as \\"King's Square\\". In 1937, the church itself was demolished, and the square reached its current extent. 19 of the remaining gravestones were used to pave part of the square, although many are now illegible. The square absorbed the northern part of Colliergate and the whole of the street of King's Court, although those street names are retained by the properties on the extended section of the square. Some Mediaeval buildings on King's Court were demolished as late as the 1950s. Looking north from King's Square, in the 1960s In 2013, the City of York Council spent ¬£490,000 renovating the square. It is popular with tourists, who are often entertained by buskers and street performers. Nikolaus Pevsner notes that \\"the square has trees, which distinguishes it\\". The York's Chocolate Story attraction lies on the western side of the square. Architecture and layout The square is triangular in shape. From its northern point, Low Petergate leads north-west, Church Street to the south-west, and Goodramgate to the north-east. From its south-western point, Newgate leads west, and The Shambles to the south, while from the south-eastern point, Colliergate leads south. St Andrewgate runs north-east from the middle of the north-east side of the square. On the south-west side, number 5 King's Square was built in 1587 by Richard Hutton, while 4 King's Court is 15th-century, but was rebuilt in 1963. Pump Court is also Mediaeval in origin, but was largely rebuilt in 1755, and again in and 1951. In between is Refuge House, built in 1963. On the south-east side is St Trinity House, which was originally three houses hidden behind the church, dating from the 15th-century or earlier. On the north-east side, 2 King's Court is an early-19th century shop.

The industry grew modestly until the release of Taito's Space Invaders in 1978 and Namco's Pac-Man in 1980, creating a Golden Age of arcade games that lasted through 1983. At this point, saturation of the market with arcade games led to a rapid decline in both the arcade game market and arcades to support them. Since then, there has been a steady recovery with novel games, including the birth of the fighting game genre with Capcom's Street Fighter II in 1991. The arcade industry continues to sustain itself on providing more immersive experiences in contrast to console and computer games, with the market having the most success in Japan and southeast Asia regions. Timeline=Precursors Game of skill amusements had been a staple of fairs since the 19th century. Coin-operated Pinball machines that included electric lights and features were developed in 1933, but lacked the user-controlled flipper mechanisms at that point; these would be invented in 1947. Though the creators of these games argued that these games were still skill-based, most governments still consider them a game of luck and ruled them as gambling devices, banning them as well. Beyond this, pinball machines drew the younger generation to the games, making morally-concerned elders across the generation gap fear what the youth were doing and considering the machines \\"tools of the devil\\", furthering these bans. These bans were slowly lifted in the 1960s and 1970s; New York City's ban, placed in 1942, lasted until 1976, while Chicago's was lifted in 1977. Where pinball was allowed, pinball manufacturers carefully distanced their games from gambling, adding \\"For Amusement Only\\" among the game's labeling, eliminating any redemption features, and asserting these were games of skill at every opportunity. By the early 1970s, pinball machines thus occupied select arcades at amusement parks, at bars and lounges, and with solitary machines at various stores. Electro-mechanical games Alternatives to pinball were electro-mechanical games that clearly demonstrated themselves as games of skill to avoid the stigma of pinball. These overlapped with the introduction of arcade games, and in some cases, were prototypical of the experiences that arcade games offered. In 1966 Sega introduced an electro- mechanical game called Periscope ‚Äì a submarine simulator and light gun shooterBrian Ashcraft (2008) Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers, p. 133, Kodansha International which used lights and plastic waves to simulate sinking ships from a submarine.Steve L. Kent (2001), The ultimate history of video games: from Pong to Pok√©mon and beyond: the story behind the craze that touched our lives and changed the world, p. 102, Prima, It became an instant success in Japan, Europe, and North America, where it was the first arcade game to cost a quarter per play, which would remain the standard price for arcade games for many years to come. In 1967 Taito released an electro-mechanical arcade game of their own, Crown Soccer Special, a two- player sports game that simulated association football, using various electronic components, including electronic versions of pinball flippers. Sega later produced gun games which resemble first-person shooter video games, but which were in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection in a manner similar to the ancient zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. The first of these, the light-gun game Duck Hunt, appeared in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had volume-controllable sound-effects. That same year, Sega released an electro-mechanical arcade racing game, Grand Prix, which had a first-person view, electronic sound, a dashboard with a racing wheel and accelerator, and a forward-scrolling road projected on a screen. Another Sega 1969 release, Missile, a shooter and vehicle-combat simulation, featured electronic sound and a moving film strip to represent the targets on a projection screen. It was the earliest known arcade game to feature a joystick with a fire button, which formed part of an early dual-control scheme, where two directional buttons are used to move the player's tank and a two-way joystick is used to shoot and steer the missile onto oncoming planes displayed on the screen; when a plane is hit, an animated explosion appears on screen, accompanied by the sound of an explosion. In the same year, Sega released Jet Rocket, a combat flight-simulator featuring cockpit controls that could move the player aircraft around a landscape displayed on a screen and shoot missiles onto targets that explode when hit. In the course of the 1970s, following the release of Pong in 1972, electronic video-games gradually replaced electro-mechanical arcade games.Brian Ashcraft (2008) Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers, p. 134, Kodansha International In 1972, Sega released an electro-mechanical game called Killer Shark, a first-person light-gun shooter known for appearing in the 1975 film Jaws. In 1974, Nintendo released Wild Gunman, a light-gun shooter that used full-motion video-projection from 16 mm film to display live-action cowboy opponents on the screen. One of the last successful electro-mechanical arcade games was F-1, a racing game developed by Namco and distributed by Atari in 1976; this game appeared in the films Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Midnight Madness (1980), as did Sega's Jet Rocket in the latter film. The 1978 video game Space Invaders, however, dealt a yet more powerful blow to the popularity of electro-mechanical games.Brian Ashcraft (2008) Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers, p. 136, Kodansha International Arrival of arcade games (1971‚àí1978) Computer Space, the first commercial arcade game While early video games running on computers had been developed as far back as 1950, the first video game to spread beyond a single computer installation, Spacewar!, was developed by students and staff at MIT on a PDP-1 mainframe computer in 1962. As the group that developed it migrated across the country to other schools, they took Spacewar!s source code to run on other mainframe machines at those schools. It inspired two different groups to attempt to develop a coin-operated version of the game. At Stanford University, students Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck used a PDP-11 mainframe to build two prototypes of Galaxy Game, which they demonstrated at the university starting in November 1971, but were unable to turn into a commercial game. Around the same time in 1969, Nolan Bushnell was invited by a colleague to see Spacewar! running on Stanford University's PDP-6 computer. Bushnell got the idea of recreating the game on a smaller computer, a Data General Nova, connected to multiple coin-operated terminals. He and fellow Ampex employee Ted Dabney, under the company name Syzygy, worked with Nutting Associates to create Computer Space, the first commercial arcade game, with location tests in August 1971 and production starting in November. More than 1300 units of the game were sold, and while not as large of a hit game as hoped, it proved the potential for the coin-operated computer game. Bushnell got the idea for his next game after seeing a demonstration of a table tennis game on the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console that was based on the designs of Ralph H. Baer. Decided to go on their own, Bushnell and Dabney left Nutting and reformed their company as Atari Inc., and brought on Allan Alcorn to help design an arcade game based on the Odyssey game. After a well-received trial run of a demo unit at Andy Capp's Tavern in San Jose, California in August 1972, Pong was first released in limited numbers in November 1972 with a wider release by March 1973. Pong was highly successful, with each machine earning over a day, far greater than most other coin-operated machine at the time, and over 4000 units shipped by the end of 1974. With Pong success, numerous other coin-operated manufacturers attempted to capitalize on the success of arcade games. Most took to trying to copy the games that Atari had already made with small alterations, leading to a wave of clones. Bushnell, having failed to patent on the idea, considered these competitors \\"jackals\\" but rather than seeking legal action, continued to have Atari devices new games. Separately, Magnavox and Sanders Associates, through which Baer had developed the basics of the Odyssey, sued Atari, among the other manufacturers, for patent violations of the basic patents behind the electronic game concepts. Bushnell opted to settle out of court, negotiating for perpetual licensing rights to Baer's patents for Atari as part of the settlement fee, which allowed Atari to pursue the development of additional arcade games and bringing Pong in a home console form, while Magnavox continued legal against the other manufacturers. It is estimated that Mangavox collected over in awards and settlements from these suits over the Baer patents. Death Race was one of the first video games to be criticized for its violence. By the end of 1974, more than fifteen companies, both in the United States and Japan, were in the development of arcade games. A key milestone was the introduction of microprocessor technology to arcade games with Taito's Gun Fight (Western Gun as released in Japan), which could be programmed more directly rather than relying on the complex interaction of integrated circuitry (IC) chips. Video games were still considered to be adult entertainment at this point, and treated as with pinball machines as games of skill, \\"For Amusement Only\\", and placed in locations that children would likely not be at such as bar and lounges. However, the same stigma that pinball machines had seen in the prior decades became to appear for video games. Notably, the release of Death Race in 1976, which involved driving over gremlins on screen, drew criticism in the United States for being too violent, and created the first major debate on violence and video games. The Golden Age (1978-1982) In 1978, Taito released Space Invaders, first in Japan followed by its North American release. Among its novel gameplay features that drove its popularity, the game was the first to maintain a persistent high score. and though simplistic, used an interactive audio system that increased with the pace of the game. The game was extremely popular in both regions. In Japan, specialty arcades were established that featured only Space Invaders machines, and Taito estimated that they had sold over 100,000 machines in the country alone by the end of 1978, while in the United States, over 60,000 machines had been sold by 1980. The game was considered the best-selling video game and highest-grossing \\"entertainment product\\" of its time. Space Invaders led to a string of similar games over the next five years that are considered the \\"Golden Years\\" for arcade games. Among these titles include: * Asteroids (Atari, 1979) * Galaxian (Namco, 1979) * Berzerk (Stern Electronics, 1980) * Defender (Williams Electronics, 1980) * Pac-Man (Namco, 1980) * Missile Command (Atari, 1980) * Rally-X (Namco, 1980) * Centipede (Atari, 1981) * Donkey Kong (Nintendo, 1981) Of these, Pac-Man had even a larger impact on the popular culture when it arrived in 1980; the game itself was popular but people took to Pac-Man as a mascot, leading to merchandise and an animated series of the same name in 1982. The game also inspired the Gold-certified song \\"Pac-Man Fever\\" by Buckner & Garcia. Pac-Man sold about 400,000 cabinets overall by 1982. These games, along with numerous others, created video game arcades around the world. The construction boom of shopping malls in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s gave rise to dedicated arcade storefronts such as Craig Singer's Tilt Arcades. Other arcades were featured in bowling alleys and skating rinks, as well as standalone facilities, such as Bushnell's chain of Chuck E. Cheeses pizzerias and arcades. Time reported in January 1982 that there were over 13,000 arcades in the United States, with the most popular machines bringing in over in profit each day. Twin Galaxies, an arcade opened by Walter Day in Ottumwa, Iowa, became known for tracking the high scores of many these top video games, and in 1982, Life featured the arcade, Day, and several of the top players at the time in a cover story, bringing the idea of a professional video game player to public consciousness. The formation of video game tournaments around arcade games in the 1980s was the predecessor of modern esports. Arcade machines also found their way into any area where they could be placed and would draw children or young adults, such as supermarkets and drug stores. The Golden Age was also buoyed by the growing home console market which had just entered the second generation with the introduction of game cartridges. Atari had been able to license Space Invaders for the Atari 2600 which became the system's killer application. Licensing of arcade hits became a major business for the home markets, which in turn spurred further growth in the arcade field. By 1981, the arcade game market had an estimated global value of . The decline of the arcade (1983-1990) Though 1982 was recognized as the height of success of the video game arcade, many in the industry knew the success could not last too long. Walter Day had commented in 1982 that there were \\"too many arcades\\" by that point for what was really needed. Additionally, players required novelty and new games, and thus required older games to be discontinued and replaced with new ones, but not all new games were as successful as those at the height of the Golden Age. Knowing that players were seeking more challenge, game manufacturers designed the newer games to be harder, but this caused less- skilled mainstream players to be turned away. Coupled with this was increased pressure on possible harmful impacts of video games on children. Arcades had taken steps to make their venues as \\"family fun centers\\" alleviate some concerns, but parents and activists still saw video games as potentially addictive and leading to aggressive behavior. The U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop spoke in November 1982 about the potential addiction of video game by young children, as part general moral concerns around youth in the early 1980s. These fears not only affected video game arcades, but other places where youth would normally be able to hang out without adult supervision such as shopping malls and skating rinks. There were also reports of increased crime associated with arcades due to lack of adult supervision. Many cities and towns implemented bans on arcades or limiting businesses to only a few machines by the mid-1980s. Further impacting the arcades, the rising popularity of home consoles threatened the arcades, since players did not have to repeatedly spend money to play at arcades when they could play at home. But with the 1983 video game crash which drastically affected the home console market, the arcade market also felt its impact as it was already waning from oversaturation, loss of players, and the moral concerns over video games, all stressed by the early 1980s recession. For about eight years, arcade games were relatively dormant. Arcades still existed, and new games were released but with little novelty in gameplay and without the financial success of the Golden Age. Competition from the new consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System that had revitalized the home console industry were drawing players away from the arcades. Home consoles also kept children at home and under parental supervision, keeping them away from arcades. By 1991, the arcade game market has fallen to . Arcade game manufacturers still brought in technology improvements that were being made in computer technologies. Sega AM2's Hang-On, designed by Yu Suzuki and running on the Sega Space Harrier hardware, was the first of Sega's \\"Super Scaler\\" arcade system boards that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, and considered one of the first 16-bit arcade games.IGN Presents the History of SEGA: World War, IGN Hang-On also used of arcade cabinet that included a mounted motorbike-like control unit on a hydraulic system, which the player used to control the game by tilting their body to the left or right. This game began the \\"Taikan\\" trend, the use of motion-controlled arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on consoles. SNK also launched its Neo Geo line in 1990 to try to bridge the arcade and home console gap. The launch consisted of the Neo Geo Multi Video System (MVS) arcade system and the Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System (AES). Both units shared the same game cartridges, with the MVS able to support up to six different games at the same time selectable by the player. Further, players could use a memory card to transfer save game information from the MVS to their home AES and back. Ongoing technological improvements (1991‚àí1999) Arcade games gained a resurgence with the introduction of Street Fighter II by Capcom in 1991. The original Street Fighter in 1987 had already introduced the beat 'em up game that allowed two players to challenge each other, but the characters were generic combatants. Street Fighter II introduced modern elements to the genre and creating the fundamental one-on-one fighting game, featuring numerous characters with backgrounds and personalities to select from and a wide range of special moves to use. Street Fighter II sold more than 60,000 cabinets worldwide and drew other arcade manufacturers to make similar fighting games, including Mortal Kombat in 1992, Virtua Fighter in 1993, and Tekken in 1994. In 1993, Electronic Games noted that when \\"historians look back at the world of coin-op during the early 1990s, one of the defining highlights of the video game art form will undoubtedly focus on fighting/martial arts themes\\" which it described as \\"the backbone of the industry\\" at the time. Mortal Kombat, however, led to further controversy over violence in video games due to its gruesome-looking finishing moves. When the game was ported to home consoles in 1993, it led to U.S. Congressional hearings on violence in video games, which resulted in the formation of the Entertainment Software Ratings Board in 1994 to avoid government oversight in video games. Despite this, fighting games remained the dominate style of game in arcades through the 1990s. Daytona USA 3D polygon graphics were popularized by the Sega Model 1 games Virtua Racing (1992) and Virtua Fighter (1993), followed by racing games like the Namco System 22 title Ridge Racer (1993) and Sega Model 2 title Daytona USA, and light gun shooters like Sega's Virtua Cop (1994)Virtua Cop , IGN, 7 July 2004. Retrieved 7 February 2009 and Mesa Logic's Area 51 (1995), gaining considerable popularity in the arcades. By 1994, arcade games in the United States were generating revenues of Around the mid-1990s, the fifth-generation home consoles, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64, began offering true 3D graphics, improved sound, and better 2D graphics, than the previous generation. By 1995, personal computers followed, with 3D accelerator cards. While arcade systems such as the Sega Model 3 remained considerably more advanced than home systems in the late 1990s, the technological advantage that arcade games had, in their ability to customize and use the latest graphics and sound chips, slowly began narrowing, and the convenience of home games eventually caused a decline in arcade gaming. Sega's sixth generation console, the Dreamcast, could produce 3D graphics comparable to the Sega NAOMI arcade system in 1998, after which Sega produced more powerful arcade systems such as the Sega NAOMI Multiboard and Sega Hikaru in 1999 and the Sega NAOMI 2 in 2000, before Sega eventually stopped manufacturing expensive proprietary arcade system boards, with their subsequent arcade boards being based on more affordable commercial console or PC components. In 1997, Konami began releasing a number of music-based games that used unique peripherals to control the game in time to music, including Beatmania and GuitarFreaks, culminating in the 1998 release of Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) in Japan, a new style of arcade game that used a dance pad and required players to tap their feet on appropriate squares on the pad in time to notes on screen in synchronization to popular music. DDR later released in the West in 1999, and while it did not enjoy the same popularity in Japan initially, it led the trend of rhythm games in arcades. Regional divergences (2000‚àípresent) Worldwide, arcade game revenues gradually increased from US$1.8 billion in 1998 to US$3.2 billion in 2002, rivalling PC game sales of US$3.2 billion that same year. Arcade video games continue to be thriving industry in both Japan and China, where arcades are widespread across the country. Since the 2000s, arcade games and arcades in the United States have generally had to continue as niche markets to adapt to remain profitable, competition against the allure of home consoles. Most arcades were unable to sustain on operating arcade games alone, and have since added back redemption systems for prizes along with non-arcade games for these, such as Dave & Busters. Arcade games were developed to try to create experiences that could not be had via home consoles, such as motion simulator games, but their expense and space required was difficult to justify over more traditional games. The US market has experienced a slight resurgence, with the number of video game arcades across the nation increasing from 2,500 in 2003 to 3,500 in 2008, though this is significantly less than the 10,000 arcades in the early 1980s. As of 2009, a successful arcade game usually sells around 4000 to 6000 units worldwide. Since around 2018, arcades specializing in virtual reality games have also become popular, allowing players to experience these games without the hardware investment in VR headsets. The relative simplicity yet solid gameplay of many of these early games has inspired a new generation of fans who can play them on mobile phones or with emulators such as MAME. Some classic arcade games are reappearing in commercial settings, such as Namco's Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga: Class of 1981 two-in-one game, or integrated directly into controller hardware (joysticks) with replaceable flash drives storing game ROMs. Arcade classics have also been reappearing as mobile games, with Pac-Man in particular selling over 30 million downloads in the United States by 2010. Arcade classics have also begun to appear on multi-game arcade machines for home users. A man playing a drumming arcade game (Drummania) in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 2005. Girls playing The House of the Dead III in an amusement arcade in Japan, 2005. However, in the Japanese gaming industry, arcades have remained popular since the 2000s. Much of the consistent popularity and growing industry is due to several factors such as support for continued innovation and that developers of machines own the arcades. Additionally, Japan arcade machines are notably more unique as to US machines, where Japanese arcades can offer experiences that players could not get at home. This is constant throughout Japanese arcade history. As of 2009, out of Japan's US$20 billion gaming market, US$6 billion of that amount is generated from arcades, which represent the largest sector of the Japanese video game market, followed by home console games and mobile games at US$3.5 billion and US$2 billion, respectively. According to in 2005, arcade ownership and operation accounted for a majority of Namco's for example. With considerable withdrawal from the arcade market from companies such as Capcom, Sega became the strongest player in the arcade market with 60% marketshare in 2006. Despite the global decline of arcades, Japanese companies hit record revenue for three consecutive years during this period.https://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/printing_annual/2008/e_2008_annual.pdf Page 16: \\" The domestic market has continued to expand for five years and has set new records for three consecutive years.\\" However, due to the country's economic recession, the Japanese arcade industry has also been steadily declining, from ¬•702.9 billion (US$8.7 billion) in 2007 to ¬•504.3 billion (US$6.2 billion) in 2010. In 2013, estimation of revenue is ¬•470 billion. The layout of an arcade in Japan greatly differs from an arcade in America. The arcades of Japan are multi-floor complexes (often taking up entire buildings), split into sections by game types. On the ground level the arcade typically hosts physically demanding games that draw crowds of onlookers, like music rhythm games. Another floor is often a maze of multi-player games and battle simulators. These multi-player games often have online connectivity tracking rankings and reputation of each player; top players are revered and respected in arcades. The top floor of the arcade is typically for rewards where Players can trade credits or tickets for prizes. In the Japanese market, network and card features introduced by Virtua Fighter 4 and World Club Champion Football, and novelty cabinets such as Gundam Pod machines have caused revitalizations in arcade profitability in Japan. The reason for the continued popularity of arcades in comparison to the west, are heavy population density and an infrastructure similar to casino facilities. Outside of Sega Arcade, a famous arcade located in Akihabara, Japan Former rivals in the Japanese arcade industry, Konami, Taito, Bandai Namco Entertainment and Sega, are now working together to keep the arcade industry vibrant. This is evidenced in the sharing of arcade networks, and venues having games from all major companies rather than only games from their own company.

The group's founder was the conservative Druze politician Farid Hamadeh who opposed Kamal Jumblatt, leader of both the left- wing Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) and the LNM coalition. Closely linked to the Christian Lebanese Front coalition, the VMA (MJD)' s own manifesto claimed that their main goal was to rid Lebanon of the Palestinians and the 'communists' ‚Äì meaning the Lebanese leftist parties and militias of the LNM, in addition to their allies of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrilla factions and the Palestinian refugees living in the country.

He was one of the two chief designers, along with Carl Almquist, for the Lancaster firm of Shrigley and Hunt, producers of stained glass windows and church-fittings. In recent years his work has begun to be studied and admired, though claims that he was a genius have not gone uncontested.  Ancestry and youth  Edward Jewitt's grandfather, Arthur Jewitt, authored books on the subjects of local history, perspective and geometry. One of his uncles, Llewellynn, was a wood-engraver, art historian, journalist and antiquary; another, Orlando, was also a wood- engraver, specialising in the illustration of works on Gothic architecture. A third brother, Henry, was an employee of Orlando, and Henry's son Edward was thus brought up in a family of working artists well-versed in church history and church architecture. His childhood was spent in Headington, Oxfordshire, and after the age of eight in London. Nothing is known of his formal education or initial employment, but in September 1877 he was taken on as a stained- glass designer by Arthur William Hunt of the Lancaster firm of Shrigley and Hunt.  Career  The firm already had a chief designer in the young Carl Almquist, but Jewitt was given equal status with him. Hunt, Almquist and Jewitt worked as a close team, using Aesthetic techniques derived, in Almquist's case, from Edward Burne-Jones via Henry Holiday, and in Jewitt's case from Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. For the first few years they usually worked separately; later they worked out a system by which Jewitt either supervised or himself painted a watercolour from which Almquist could produced a more detailed cartoon. The qualities Jewitt brought to the partnership included a sensitivity to the qualities of the stained-glass raw materials, a thorough knowledge of iconography, and a psychological realism in drawing biblical figures. Together, Almquist and Jewitt developed a house style of subtle colours (becoming richer in later years) and delicate drawing which defined Shrigley and Hunt until well into the 20th century. Jewitt designed many windows for locations in the Home Counties, the East Midlands, Yorkshire, and above all the north-west of England, and there are scattered examples elsewhere. There are also examples of painted tiles, murals, reredoses and patternwork by him, and on at least one occasion he restored medieval wall-paintings.  Personal life  Jewitt married Edith Maria Pike in Lancaster Priory in 1878. Their children included Austin Jewitt, who worked for Shrigley and Hunt on design projects from 1900 to 1902; Edward's nephew, the sculptor Clement William Jewitt, also executed one commission for the firm. Edward Jewitt at first lived in Lancaster, before moving first to Morecambe and then to the coastal village of Hest Bank, five miles north of Lancaster, from where he used to walk to work every day, much to the annoyance of his employer who would have preferred him to spend more of the day at his desk. He was still working for the firm at the time of his death, in 1929.

Jewitt designed many windows for locations in the Home Counties, Yorkshire, and above all the north-west of England, and there are scattered examples elsewhere.  Works  Because of the destruction by fire of most of the company's records in 1973 many Shrigley and Hunt windows can be attributed to individual designers only on stylistic grounds, if at all.

Geography  The Gamache River draws its source from Lac Claude (length: ; altitude: ) located in the western part of Anticosti Island. Lac Claude is bordered by marshes: north side, southwest side and west side. The mouth of Lac Claude is located at the end of the bay on the west shore, at: * north of one of the runways at Port-Menier airport; * north of the town center of the village of Port-Menier; * south-east of the north shore of Anticosti Island. From its source, the Gamache River flows south between the Diane Creek (located on the west side); and the Trois Milles River (located on the east side). From the mouth of Claude Lake, the course of the Gamache River descends on towards the south with a drop of , according to the following segments: * first to the northwest, crossing an area of marsh, then south, forming a large curve to the west, crossing another area of marsh, to the road passing north of Port-Menier airport; * towards the southwest almost in a straight line, cross on Lake Saint-Georges (altitude: ) resembling an olive, then descends on this last channel, to its mouth. Note: Lake Saint-Georges also receives water from the Trois Milles River. The Gamache River flows into the heart of the village of Port-Menier, on the north side of the wharf, at the end of Gamache Bay (length: ; width: at the entrance to the bay), on the south shore of Anticosti Island, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This confluence is located at east of the Pointe aux Pointe-Ouest point of Anticosti Island, at to the southeast of the shore north of the island. Gamache bay includes Jolliet bay (located in the north-west) and Navots bay (located in the north- east).  Toponymy  The toponym \\"Baie Gamache\\" where the village of Port- Menier developed and ‚ÄúRivi√®re Gamache‚Äù are linked. The toponymic designation \\"Gamache River\\" evokes the life work of Louis-Olivier Gamache, who settled on Anticosti Island. He is an almost legendary character who has faced the miseries of the island, despite the elements and men. He is recognized as the Robinson Crusoe of French Canada. Gamache was reputed to be intelligent, skillful, gifted, daring, formidable and feared. Gamache died in 1854 at Ellis Bay, where he had built a house, precisely on the site where Louis Jolliet had once built a fort.

She graduated from Montgomery Blair High School and began her career as a fashion model in New York City for the Conover Agency before transitioning to writing about fashion for the Washington Times-Herald. In 1951 she began hosting, writing, and producing her own show, Inga's Angle (later changed to Today with Inga) which ran for 16 years, the longest running early program of that time. She interviewed many famous people including John F. Kennedy, Bette Davis, Lyndon B. Johnson, Hubert H. Humphrey, Milton Berle, Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Kim Novak, and Arthur Schlesinger among others. Her on-air persona was warm yet glamorous and she was known for deftly switching quickly from one conversation topic to the next. Besides interviewing political and celebrity guests, the show also had beauty, exercise, and commercial product segments. Rundvold retired from her show in 1967 and focused her career on travel writing. She produced Let's Go Places a 30-minute show about foreign travel, and freelanced for the New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, and others.

Since 2015, the brand has been owned by Bluestar Alliance, LLC after being dormant for six years after the store bearing its name converted to Justice (store).Our Brands - Justice (accessed 15 December 2012) Limited Too sold apparel, underwear, sleepwear, swimwear, lifestyle, accessories, and personal care products for girls age 5‚Äì15. At its peak in 2007, Tween Brands operated over 600 Limited Too stores. Three times a year, spring, fall and holiday, Limited Too offered \\"Too Bucks\\", which are received with a $50 purchase, and are worth $25 off every $50 purchase (as of 2008) and \\"Bonus Too Bucks\\", which are worth $15 off every $40 purchase. On August 12, 2008, Tween Brands announced that the nearly 600 Limited Too stores would convert to the lower-price Justice brand in early 2009, discontinuing the use of the Limited Too name; however, some Limited Too stores retained the old name into 2010.  History  Limited Too was created by The Limited, Inc. in 1987 as an infants, toddlers and younger girls' version of The Limited selling products similar to their adult oriented brand. From 1987 to 1995, the number of stores increased from two to 288 different retail locations. In 1996, a new senior management team refocused Limited Too into a preteen girls fashion store. In 1999, Limited Too, Inc. spun off to establish a strong and independent brand identity. From 2001 to 2003 the company operated the Mishmash chain that targeted 15- to 20-year-old women and sold apparel, accessories, and gifts and competed head-to-head with chains like Gadzooks, Wet Seal, and the women's businesses of Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister Co., and American Eagle Outfitters. The chain folded in 2003 because Too Inc. felt that they knew and understood the preteen customer better. Committed to this focus, Too Inc. launched the first Justice: Just for Girls stores in January 2004; many of the early Justice stores were converted Mishmash stores. On July 10, 2006, Too Inc. completed its name change to Tween Brands, Inc., and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol, 'TWB'. In February 2008, there were 582 Limited Too stores in 47 states and Puerto Rico as well as 25 franchised stores in the Middle East. At its peak, Limited Too had over 600 stores; however, in August 2008, Tween Brands announced that it would discontinue its Limited Too line of 586 stores, although select stores would still offer a line of higher-quality Limited Too clothes in Justice locations. Between December 2008 and June 2010, 26 of these stores closed and 560 others were re-branded as Justice.Tween Brands Company Profile on Wikinvest After being dormant for several years, the Limited Too IP and trademarks were acquired by Bluestar Alliance, LLC and revived as an online store with select clothing being sold at Amazon.com and other websites.  Criticism  While operating as The Limited Too, stores were proved to practice vanity sizing, leaving inaccuracies in clothing sizes, leading girls who shop there to feel overweight (example: a girl who would wear a size 12 at other stores would wear a 16 or even a 18 at Limited Too stores). In 2007, Slate published an article by Emily Yoffe that was critical of the clothing offered for pre-teen girls at several shops, including Limited Too. When she took her eleven-year-old daughter shopping for school clothes, the range available at Limited Too ran to clothing \\"encrusted with rhinestones or sparkling with glitter\\", a category Yoffe called \\"Nitwit Wear\\" (she mentions a T-shirt with the slogan \\"I Left My Brain In My Locker\\"), push-up bras for pre- teens, and boyshort underwear emblazoned \\"Buy it now!

Sarpong works on natural product synthesis to better understand biological systems and allow for the development of novel therapeutics. He was awarded the 2019 Mukaiyama and A.R. Katritzky Awards.  Early life and education  Sarpong was born in Bechem and spent his early childhood in Bolgatanga, Ghana. His father is a medical doctor who worked with the World Health Organization. It was in his childhood in Africa that he first became interested in a career in chemistry, when he saw how effective ivermectin was in combatting river blindness (onchocerciasis). The drug had been taken to Africa for free by Merck & Co., and Sarpong got his hands on the Merck index, an encyclopaedia of chemicals and spent his free time imagining how chemistry could change people's lives. Alongside Ghana, Saprong grew up in Zambia and Botswana, where he saw the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Intent on studying medicine, Sarpong moved to the United States in 1991. He completed his undergraduate studies at Macalester College, where he was an undergraduate research scholar with Rebecca Hoye. He was a graduate student with Martin Semmelhack at Princeton University, where he worked on enediyne functional analogues. Sarpong moved to the California Institute of Technology where he joined the laboratory of Brian Stoltz and worked alongside Guggenheim Fellow Neil Garg. There he was part of the team who first synthesised the phosphate inhibitor dragmacidin D.  Research and career  In 2004 Sarpong started his independent scientific career at the University of California, Berkeley. The Sarpong laboratory specialise in the synthesis of bioactive organic molecules, with a focus on the natural products of flora and fauna. He has developed new synthesis strategies for alkaloids, a family of natural medicines that includes quinine and morphine. In particular, Sarpong is interested in natural product synthesis for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In 2017 Sarpong delivered a TED talk The face of disease in Sub-Saharan Africa, where he encouraged his audience to reevaluate the face of disease in Africa. He serves on the editorial boards of Organic Syntheses, Accounts of Chemical Research and Synlett. Sarpong is committed to improving diversity within the chemistry community, and has supported many scholars in the early stages of their academic careers.

Maria Schauer was an Austrian recognized by Yad Vashem as a Righteous Among the Nations, after rescuing three Jews from deportation and possible death after Nazi occupation of Austria during World War II.  Rescuer  Schauer was living in Vienna when Nazi Germany took control of the city in 1938 and began persecuting Jews there. Max Arnold who was a Jewish tailor living in the Pressbaum district, outside Vienna, Austria, received a message in 1942 from the Nazi authorities saying that he was required to move to Vienna and register at the offices of the Jewish community. Max did move to Vienna but chose not to register as required. While in Vienna, Arnold married his partner, Johanna. The Encyclopedia of the Righteous Among the Nations: France. Israel, Yad Vashem, 2003. p 26. When the city-wide order was given to deport the Jews from Vienna, the couple chose instead to hide in the city along with Max's sister, Leopoldine Stern. They turned to Luci Pollreis (also spelled Lucia Pollreiss), a seamstress and businesswoman, who agreed to hire Max Arnold as a tailor, and help the three find a safe sanctuary. The three Jews moved between hiding places in Vienna from 1942 until the end of the war in 1945. From September to April of each year, the three Jews hid successfully in Maria Schauer's home, but it was impossible for them to stay there during the summer months because of the presence of Schauer's regular house guest, who was a prominent Nazi. So, in the summertime, the refugees stayed with Pollreiss, who not only gave them a place to stay, but also supported them financially. Pollreiss‚Äô husband, who served in the German army and only lived at home on vacations, demanded that she stop helping the Jews, but, despite his arguments, Pollreiss continued. One day while the Jews were hiding in Schauer‚Äôs home, the authorities arrived at the door, and asked if anyone else lived in the house with Schauer.

The order contains provisions restricting the behavior of troops and was intended to show respect to the laws of Saudi Arabia where many US troops were deployed. The order, for the first time in the US Army, prohibited the possession, manufacture, sale or consumption of any alcoholic beverage. It also restricted the possession of \\"sexually explicit\\" material, which was broadly defined and led to relatively innocuous documents such as underwear catalogues and bodybuilding magazines being banned. A ban on the taking of war trophies from Iraqi prisoners was later amended to permit US troops to retain captured bayonets as souvenirs. The order influenced those issued in later campaigns, many of which also include bans on alcohol consumption even where US troops are not deployed in Muslim countries.  Background  Schwarzkopf and Ruppert in Iraq, March 1991 Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait on August 2, 1990. United Nations Security Council Resolution 660 called for the withdrawal of Iraqi forces but this was not forthcoming. The United States and other nations rushed troops to defend Saudi Arabia from a potential attack as part of Operation Desert Shield. US forces in Saudi Arabia were part of United States Central Command and commanded by General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. Schwarzkopf issued General Order No. 1 on 30 August 1990, which was intended to implement measures to avoid insulting their Saudi hosts. The order was the first of a series intended to guide US troops during the upcoming operations and Schwarzkopf considered them essential to preserve good relations with the Saudi government. The Saudi Government had legal restrictions on some activities such as the drinking of alcohol, public nudity and gambling (activities that were acceptable in the United States) which it justified on the grounds of the country's Muslim faith. General Order No. 1 restricted some of these activities for the duration of the operations. Schwarzkopf ordered the Staff Judge Advocate to Central Command, Colonel Raymond C. Ruppert, to produce the order. It was drafted by Ruppert and his sub-ordinate Lieutenant-Colonel William J. Camp, in August 1990 whilst in Florida, awaiting deployment to Saudi Arabia. Subtitled \\"Prohibited Activities for US Personnel Serving in the USCENTCOM A[rea] O[f] R[esponsibility]\\", the order laid out the restriction in nine categories: firearms and ammunition, entry into mosques, alcoholic beverages, pornography, other \\"sexually explicit\\" imagery, gambling, archaeological artifacts, exchanging currency, and war trophies. The order applied to all US miliary personnel and to US civilians serving with, employed by or accompanying the US armed forces in the area of responsibility. All infractions would be punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for serving personnel and by administrative sanctions for civilians. An amnesty period of 72 hours was permitted for personnel to dispose of any items prohibited by the order. The US Army XVIII Airborne Corps intended to establish a military prison in Saudi Arabia for those convicted of offenses under the general order but permission was denied by Schwarzkopf who wanted to retain military police personnel for the processing of Iraqi prisoners. Instead, Schwarzkopf ordered that offenders be returned to the United States for court-martial. Alcohol  Earlier American troops, such as this marine in Korea in 1951, had been allowed to drink alcohol. General Order No. 1 prohibited all US personnel from possessing, making, selling or consuming any alcoholic beverage; the first time such an order had applied to the US Army. Though this was considered a radical step it was considered necessary for continued good relations in a country which prohibited alcohol to any of its citizens. Although not its intention, the order led to a reduction in alcohol-related incidents and an improvement in order and discipline among the troops. The positive benefits of the order led to it being broadly applied to later US operations, whether in Muslim countries or not. The US Air Force General William R. Looney III disagreed with the broader application of alcohol bans and, when commanding in Puerto Rico after the war, successfully lobbied for permission for his troops to ignore a similar order. The future Secretaries of Defense Robert Gates and Leon Panetta inadvertently violated the order by bringing liquor with them on an August 2007 visit to Baghdad during the Iraq War.  Religious restrictions  The order prohibited gatherings for non-Muslim acts of worship outside of US-controlled sites. Although not prohibited by the order, Jewish military personnel were ferried to ships offshore to take part in religious services. Entry into mosques, where not necessary for military purposes, was prohibited by the order. Although not explicitly mentioned in the order proselytising of Muslims was prohibited. Personal bibles were allowed but had to be shipped directly to US bases or else risk confiscation by Saudi customs officials. Soldiers were also ordered not to wear crucifix jewelry on show and chaplains instructed to remove their emblems of faith when outside of US-controlled sites. In a similar manner, at the request of the Saudi government the US military agreed to refer to its chaplains as \\"morale officers\\" and to \\"church services\\" as \\"morale services\\", though this was rescinded in January 1991 by Lieutenant-General Chuck Horner.  Sexually suggestive material  The order defined prohibited pornographic material as that which displayed human genitalia, uncovered women's breasts or any sexual act, including any works of art. \\"Sexually explicit\\" material which was also prohibited was defined as any \\"medium displaying the human anatomy in any unclothed or semi-clothed manner and which displays portions of the human torso\\". This extended to material where the \\"human anatomy\\" was only implied and resulted in items such as bodybuilding magazines, swimsuit photographs and underwear catalogues being banned or censored. Such material was illegal for Saudi citizens to possess.  Other provisions  Ann E. Dunwoody, a female officer of the US Army in Saudi Arabia during the war Other provisions of the order included prohibition of personal firearms and gambling (including pools, lotteries and raffles). The removal of archaeological artifacts was also prohibited as was exchanging money at anything other than the official Saudi government rate. The final provision prohibited the collection of war trophies and noted that all captured Iraqi military equipment was to be considered property of the US government, though exceptions were made for hats, shirts, belts, insignia, canteens, mess equipment, helmets and ammunition pouches. After the liberation of Kuwait led large amounts of equipment to fall into US hands this prohibition was repeatedly questioned and the dissent led to the only change to any part of the general order during the war when Schwarzkopf permitted US personnel to take Iraqi bayonets as souvenirs. Although not part of the general order, female US personnel were required to wear \\"modest\\" dress and avoid walking with or sharing a car with a man other than their husband. Public displays of affection were also prohibited. These restrictions were variable depending on location, they were strictest in urban areas, within the United Arab Emirates and within Oman but were relaxed in areas with few Saudi nationals present. In spite of the restrictions the sight of American women driving military vehicles led to Saudi women holding driving protests against the laws that prevented them from driving.  Legacy  General Order No. 1 remained in place unchanged, but for the exception for bayonet trophies, throughout Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm (the phase of the war January‚ÄìFebruary 1991 that involved the liberation of Kuwait and partial invasion of Iraq). There was some criticism of the order; US Air Force intelligence officer Rick Francona recalled that it was \\"grossly unpopular\\" among the troops. The need for the order led some commentators to ask why American forces were being deployed to protect an undemocratic state which did not permit its people the civil liberties taken for granted in the US. General Order No. 1 influenced similar orders for subsequent campaigns. An alcohol prohibition was ordered for Operation Provide Comfort, the post‚ÄìGulf War humanitarian mission to Kurds in Northern Iraq. An alcohol prohibition and ban on taking trophies was also implemented for American UNITAF forces serving in Somalia 1992‚Äì93, though the fact that it did not apply to American troops under direct United Nations command led to some complaints about unfairness. The troops serving in Operation Uphold Democracy, the 1994‚Äì1995 intervention in non-Muslim Haiti, were also subject to an alcohol ban. The General Order No. 1 issued to American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan both prohibited alcohol and extended the provisions to include prohibitions on adopting stray dogs as pets or mascots.

Life Al-Burini was born in mid-July 1556 in the village of Saffuriya near Nazareth in the Galilee, hence his nisba (epithet) \\"al-Saffuri\\". His father Muhammad was originally from the village of Burin near Nablus hence the nisba \\"al-Burini\\". At the age of 10 he moved to Damascus with his father. Al-Burini learned the Qur'an at the Manjak Mosque in the Midan neighborhood in his adolescence. Afterward, he received an education in Arabic grammar, qanun (secular law) and arithmetic from Damascene ulema (religious scholars) at the Madrasa al- Umariyya in the Salihiyya neighborhood. His studies there were interrupted by a famine, which prompted him to relocate to Jerusalem from 1567 to 1571. In Jerusalem he was taught by Muhammad ibn Abi al-Lutf. He moved back to Damascus in 1571, settling in the Sufi lodge of Samisatiyya where he expanded his education to literature, fiqh (jurisprudence), tafsir (Qur'anic interpretations), and hadith. By 1580 he had mastered Persian, as taught to him by Persian author Hafiz Husayn al-Karbala'i (d. 1588) in Aleppo or Damascus. Later in life, he also learned Turkish. After completing his studies, al-Burini became the head of the Shafi'i fiqh in the Umayyad Mosque in 1580. About the same time he began making sermons at the Sultan Mosque and became a lecturer in a number of Damascus madrasas. He was known by his students for his eloquence, charisma and literary knowledge, while the historians and religious scholars of the period lauded al-Burini for the same qualities, as well as his interest in history and philology. The governors and judges of Damascus trusted and appreciated al-Burini, considering him an accomplished Shafi‚Äôi jurist with independent judgements. He served as the kadi (Islamic head judge) of the Ottoman Hajj pilgrimage caravan from Damascus to Mecca in 1611. On 11 June 1615 he died in Damascus and was buried in the cemetery of Bab al-Faradis. Literary works One of al-Burini's main bodies of work was Tarajim al-A'yan min Abna al-Zaman, a collection of 205 biographies of notable contemporary scholars, rulers and artisans, completed in 1614 after ten years. Fadl Allah ibn Muhibb Allah edited and published the work in 1667 with a supplement. The work was republished in Damascus in 1959. Al-Burini often traveled to different parts of Syria, penning two works about his trips to Tripoli in 1599/1600 and Aleppo in al-Rihlat al-Tarabulusiyya and al-Rihlat al-Halabiyya, respectively. During his visits to Tripoli and its Akkar countryside he was hosted by the chieftain and governor Yusuf Sayfa Pasha. His poetry is mostly found in a diwan located in Istanbul. His epistle to As'ad ibn Muiin al-Din al-Tibrizi al-Dimashqi is located in Gotha, his Marathi poems for the Sufi Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Barakat al-Qadiri is preserved in Berlin and number of his poems are held in the British Museum in London. He penned a commentary on the diwan of Ibn al-Farid in 1591 and a commentary on the latter's al-Ta‚Äôiyya al-Sughra in 1593.

Season After surrendering the league championship to Yale two years running, Harvard was desperate to regain their crown. Early in the season, however, the team didn't perform well. After a less-than- impressive win over MIT the Crimson lost three consecutive games, however, two of those losses were to Canadian schools and the experience from playing tougher squads served Harvard well. When they opened their conference schedule against Princeton Harvard started slow but built up steam after the first to score the final three goals of the game, including an overtime winner from new sophomore star John Chase. The rematch came at the end of the month the Crimson again had to come back from a two-goal deficit to win another 4‚Äì3 match and capture the season series. Harvard began February with a game against an undefeated Hamilton but the Crimson proved superior with a dominating 11‚Äì1 victory. The team then had a 10-day layoff before the long- awaited match with Yale. From the start of the game Harvard assailed the Eli net and scored just five minutes in. Three more goals came from Crimson players with none in opposition giving Harvard the first leg of the series. The following week Harvard faced a dangerous Dartmouth team and downed the Indians 3‚Äì2 in overtime. In doing so the Crimson had essentially erased their early-season loss to Boston University by defeating two teams that had defeated the Terriers (Williams and Dartmouth) while remaining unbeaten against all other colleges. Harvard still, however, had one final game to play and the rematch with Yale was held at the Madison Square Garden, the home of the New York Americans. The game was played before some 11,000 spectators, by far the largest recorded crowd for a college game at the time, and saw Harvard fight a much tougher contest with the Elis than the first game. Harvard scored first but were unable to find the net again and had to carry a slim, 1‚Äì0 lad for most of the game. Captain Cummings did everything he could to keep the Elis from scoring and even with a furious effort in the third period the Yale scoresheet remained empty. Harvard tacked on a second goal just before the end of the game for a sweep of the Triangular League and a claim for the eastern Intercollegiate Championship.

Text and theme  The song begins with the refrain, saying that there is someone, and only one, who is our life, a light on our ways, a hope derived from death, and who frees us. In five stanzas, something that is wrong is contrasted with the model of the (unnamed) Jesus. The first verse looks at the unfair distribution of food, the second at people not recognized and discriminated, the third at weapons and war, the fourth at people blind and afraid to speak up, and the fifth at people with doubts. Every refrain juxtaposes a line beginning with \\"Viele\\" (many) and a line beginning with \\"Einer\\" (one), for example \\"Viele werden verkann und verlacht, diskrimiert. Einer nahm sich der Wehrlosen an und erbarmt sich der Armen.\\" (Many are misjudged and ridiculed, discriminated. One took care of the defenseless and had mercy on the poor.) The viewpoint of the text has been described as a \\"Christology from below\\" (Christologie von unten), looking at aspects of Christ as a person as a model of humanity.

Many townspeople cultivate flowers in nurseries featuring a wide variety of plants such as orchids, laceleaf, azaleas, tulips, daisies, lilies, and sunflowers. The most important flower grown is the poinsettia flower, which is exported worldwide. 4,210 people live in Tetela del Monte. There are 290 commercial establishments that employ 2,000 people. = Tlaltenango = Colonia Tlaltenango is located north of downtown Cuernavaca along Avenida Emiliano Zapata. The Parque Ecol√≥gical Cultural Tlaltenango is located at the Tlaltenango traffic circle located at the junction of Zapata and Calzada de los Reyes. The focus of the cultural center is a house built in the \\"Cuernavaca-style\\" in the 1930s; the park was designed by the architect Dalia Mendoza and opened in 2010. Tlaltenango was originally a Tlahuica settlement; in 1523 it became the site of conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s's first hacienda. The hacienda soon became a comercial center for gold, silver, and cloth along the Mexico City-Acapulco trade route. The Chapel of San Jos√©, built in 1523, is said to be the oldest church on the American continent. Legend has it that on August 30, 1720, a priest and the mayor found a chest belonging to Do√±a Agustina Andrade. When the chest was opened andreturned to its owner, they found a small statue of the Virgin Mary inside. The statue performed several miracles, and the Santuario de la Virgen de los Milagros was built adjacent to the San Jos√© chapel in 1730. The bell tower was built from 1882-1884 and holds one of the largest bells in Morelos. A mural featuring Hernan Cortes, Emiliano Zapata, and the Virgin was painted by Roberto Mart√≠nez in the atrium of the church in 1982. The chapel of San Jos√© was built to serve the religious needs of upper-class Peninsulars and Criollos; further north the church of San Jer√≥nimo was built to evangelize the indigenous people. Since 1720, a street fair has been held from August 30 to September 11; Avenida Emiliano Zapata is closed and hundreds of merchants sell their wares. General Emiliano Zapata donated a silver and gold crown to the statue of Our Lady of Miracles during the fair on September 8, 1914, while the city was under siege. Two years later, troops loyal to Venustiano Carranza stole the crown; Father Nicanor G√≥mez took the statue to Mexico City, where it stayed until 1919. = Vicente Guerrero = 616 people live in Colonia Vicente Guerrero near Avenida Plan de Ayala, east of downtown. There are 95 commercial establishments that employ 900 people. The federal government is the largest single employer in the neighborhood. = Fraccionamiento Universo = Fraccionamiento Universo is located in the Municipality of Cuernavaca, southeast of Cuernavaca. There are 1,862 inhabitants including 5.53% indigenous. Universo is above sea level.Fraccionamiento Universo (Cuernavaca, Morelos) retrieved July 13, 2020 = Vista Hermosa = Colonia Vista Hermosa is a residential community northeast of downtown. It is known for its many schools, restaurants, hotels, medical centers (including two universities) and an active nightlife, especially on Avenidas San Diego and R√≠o Mayo. The Teopanzolco archaeological zone is located in the community. Most of the ruins date from the Middle and Post Classic Periods (1350-1521). The largest structure features unusual twin temples, one dedicated to TlƒÅloc (Aztec god of rain) and the other dedicated to Huƒ´tzil≈çp≈çchtli (god of war). Two phases of construction are visible, one on top of the other; construction of the second temple was most likely interrupted by the Spanish invasion. Adjacent to the pyramid site is the Teopanzolco Cultural Center, built by architect Isaac Broid Zajman in 2017 to enhance the relationship with the archeological site and to generate a significant public space for concerts, plays, and other events. A paved bicycle path extends from Avenida R√≠o Mayo to Avenida San Diego along what was once the city's rail line. The path is popular not only with bicyclists but also joggers, rollerbladers, dog-walkers, and others who want to exercise. The Catholic parish church Mar√≠a Madre de la Misericordia features stained glass and an altar with colorful contemporary designs.

The battalion would see light service during the initial stages of the conflict in the Eastern Pyrenees, but its lineage ended in 1794 after it amalgamated with two volunteer battalions to form a demi-brigade. The battalion's successor, the 86√©me R√©giment d'Infanterie continued to serve in the modern French Army until it was disbanded in 1963.  Formation  The Chasseurs des Ardennes was formed in and was to recruit exclusively from troops of the Ardennes region of France and Austrian Netherlands in 1788. The battalion was formed in Montauban from the four infantry companies of the Chasseurs √† Cheval des Ardennes, where it established its headquarters. The battalion was placed 11th in precedence of the chasseurs, after the Chasseurs du G√®vaudan and before the Chasseurs du Roussillon.Susane, Volume I, pp. 311, 313‚Äì314, 364, 369, 399, 404.Susane, Volume VII, pp. 388‚Äì389. Regimental uniform after the 1791 provisional regulations, showing the new casque helmet. The regiment's first uniform consisted of; black tricone (officers in bicorne), dark green collar, dark green turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, dark green pockets, dark green cuff flaps, crimson cuffs, and white buttons.Lienhart & Humbet, pp. 57‚Äì58.Smith, Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 42‚Äì47. In the later part of 1788, the battalion moved to Monaco, and from there it moved to Antibes in 1790.  Revolution  On 1 April 1791, provisional regulations were announced following the initial stages of the French Revolution, and the regiment renamed as the 11√©me Bataillon de Chasseurs (Ardennes), but they continued to be known as their former title until 1792. In addition to the new title, the regiment adopted a new uniform; peak casque, with stiff black horsehair crest and mock leopard skin turban helmet, dark green collar, dark green turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, dark green pockets, dark green cuff flaps, crimson cuffs, and white buttons.  War of the First Coalition  In September 1791, the battalion moved to Sorgues form Antibes, where it had been garrisoned since 1790. The battalion remained in Sorgues during the Massacres of La Glaci√®re. In 1792, the battalion joined the Army of the Alps and subsequently moved to Barrault, but in the end of 1793 joined Army of the Rhine where it remained until disbandment in 1794. The years following the Revolution saw great changes for the French Army: the old royalist infantry regiments were to serve as the stiffening for the tens of thousands of new volunteers who answered the patriotic Lev√©e en masse. In the First Amalgamation of 1794, each old royalist battalion was put together with two new volunteers battalions to become new Demi-Brigade de Bataille or Demi-Brigade of Battle. Therefore, on 24 February 1795, the battalion amalgamated with the Battalion of Chasseurs of the Cher and Battalion of Chasseurs of the Meuse to form the 11√©me Demi-Brigade L√©g√®re, thus ending the royalist lineage and traditions.

Life  Corina Novelino was born in Delfin√≥polis, Minas Gerais, to Jos√© Gon√ßalves Novelino and Josefina de Melo Novelino in 1912. Her family moved to nearby Sacramento when she was six years old, but Novelino and her four siblings were orphaned shortly thereafter. She was taken in by Edalides Milan de Rezende, the sister of the Brazilian Spiritist leader Eur√≠pedes Barsanulfo, and her husband Jos√© Rezende da Cunha. By age 20, Novelino had become heavily involved in the world of Spiritism, a philosophical and religious movement that became particularly popular in Brazil. She was invited by the prominent Spiritist Maria Modesto Cravo to help run a children's home in Uberaba, but she declined and chose to stay in Sacramento on the advice of Chico Xavier, another prominent Brazilian Spiritist who is credited with popularizing the religious movement in the country. Her charitable work in Sacramento included founding the Clube das M√£ezinhas (Mommies' Club), a group of mothers who volunteered to make clothes for needy children. In 1950, Novelino decided to found a home for abandoned children with a focus on Spiritist teaching, although she initially lacked the means to pursue this goal. However, a massive raffle was held in Sacramento to fundraise for her cause, and she was able to purchase a house, which she named the Eur√≠pedes Home after the late Eur√≠pedes Barsanulfo. Novelino worked for many years as a teacher at the Col√©gio Allan Kardec and the Escola Coronel Jos√© Afonso de Almeida, but she also dedicated herself to the children's home, paying for its maintenance out of her own teaching salary and through sales of her books. As the number of children housed at the Eur√≠pedes Home grew, it became necessary to construct a new, larger building. Again, supporters in Sacramento and neighboring areas raised funds, and a building was constructed that could house over 100 children, who received food and clothing as well as an intellectual and religious education. Novelino continued to largely fund the school herself for many years before it eventually became a public institution that educates both residential and non- residential students. She also focused on continuing the work of Eur√≠pedes Barsanulfo, who founded the Col√©gio Allan Kardec, one of the world's first Spiritist schools. In 1975, along with her cousin Tom√°s Novelino‚Äîhimself a graduate of the Col√©gio Allan Kardec‚Äîshe founded the Escola Eur√≠pedes Barsanulfo in Sacramento, which remains a hub of Spiritist pedagogy in Brazil. As a writer, Novelino contributed to various newspapers in Sacramento, including Tribuna, Estado do Tri√¢ngulo, and Jornal de Sacramento. She also wrote for the Rio-based magazines Fon Fon and Jornal das Mo√ßas, as well as several Spiritist press organs, notably the Araras-based publication Anu√°rio Esp√≠rita and the Portuguese magazine Estudos Ps√≠quicos. Novelino died in 1980 at the age of 67, in Sacramento. The former president of the Sacramento City Council, also a Col√©gio Allan Kardec graduate, said of the late religious and charitable leader: > \\"Here is the gratitude of an entire people who recognized that, through her > humble and quiet work, she was 'Mother Corina' to all of us. ... She was > Mother Corina to the poor, to the suffering, to orphans, to the mentally > ill, to those in need, to those who were abandoned, to the miserables.\\"  Selected works  * Escuta, meu filho * Eur√≠pedes, o homem e a miss√£o (1979), a biography produced ahead of the centennial of the birth of Eur√≠pedes Barsanulfo * A Grande Espera, a mediumistic novel set in the era of Jesus, supposedly dictated by Eur√≠pedes Barsanulfo  References  Category:Brazilian writers Category:Brazilian women writers Category:Spiritism Category:1912 births Category:1980 deaths ","title":"Corina Novelino"},{"id":"64892311","text":"Poor Clare is a 1968 novel by the British writer L.P.

In 1902, James graduated from Hartford's Arsenal Elementary School. Her family then moved to Old Saybrook, Connecticut, where she attended the local high school and graduated in 1905. Her family was one of the few Black families living in Old Saybrook. James graduated from the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy in 1908, as the first African American woman graduate and the first African American women to be licensed as a pharmacist in Connecticut. After the 19th amendment was passed, legalizing women's suffrage, James was one of the first women to register to vote.  Career  After graduating from college, James ran a drugstore in Hartford. In 1911, she went to work with her brother-in-law, Peter Lane, at his Lane Pharmacy in Old Saybrook. After Lane left the pharmacy in 1917, James took over the pharmacy, becoming the sole owner in 1922 and renaming it James Pharmacy.

It was their 16th consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football following their promotion from the Nationalliga B the season 1945‚Äì46. They played their home games in the Landhof, in the Wettstein Quarter in Kleinbasel. Ernst Weber was the club's chairman for the third consecutive season.  Overview  The former Czechoslovak footballer Ji≈ô√≠ Sobotka was appoited as Basel's new team manager. Sobotka had been manager for La Chaux- de-Fonds from 1946 to 1959 and during this time had won the championship twice and the cup competition five times. He was manager for Feyenoord from 1959 to 1961 and had won the Dutch League with them in the season before he was hired by Basel. A number of older players left the squad. But quite a few new youngster were brought in to cover these empty places and Sobotka was well known for his work with the younger players. In fact all the new youngsters that joined the club lived within just a few minutes bus or tram ride from the Landhof stadium: Heinz Blumer lived in Reinach and advanced up from the junior team, local man Peter F√ºri joined the club from La Chaux-de-Fonds, Markus Pfirter joined from Concordia Basel, Otto Ludwig returned from Old Boys, Roland Denicola lived in Allschwil, Ren√© Burri in Birsfelden, Wilfried Fritz in Kandern and Hans-Ruedi G√ºnthardt lived in Basel. Basel played a total of 44 games this season. Of these 44 matches 26 were in the domestic league, four were in the Swiss Cup, six were in the newly formed International Football Cup and eight were friendly matches. Of these eight friendly games four were played at home and four away fom home. Four games ended in a victory, three were drawn and one ended in a defeat. The friendly match against 1. FC K√∂ln at the end of the season was one of the highlights of these test games, it ended in a 4‚Äì4 draw. This was the farewell game for Josef H√ºgi who was moving on to play for Z√ºrich the following season. Ren√© Burri, Roberto Frigerio twice and H√ºgi himself scored the goals for Basel. Karl-Heinz Thielen, Christian M√ºller, Breuer and Helmut Benthaus scored the goals for K√∂ln. 14,000 spectators paid their entrance tickets to see the game, much needed money because the club was suffering under a bad financial situation at that time. An interesting point to note was the contact that was made between the club's chairmann, Ernst Weber, and the scorer of the final goal of the match, Benthaus. This contact would come in handy a few years later. Basel were appointed as one of four Swiss representatives in the newly founded International Football Cup. The 1961‚Äì62 International Football Cup took place during in the summer break. Basel played in Group B4 together with Sparta Rotterdam, IF Elfsborg and SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin but finished the group in the bottom position. Fourteen teams contested the 1960‚Äì61 Nationalliga A, these were the top 12 teams from the previous season and the two newly promoted teams Lugano and Schaffhausen. The Championship was played in a double round-robin, the champions were to be qualified for 1962‚Äì63 European Cup and the last two teams in the table were to be relegated. The team played a mediocre season, but not much more was expected from the young team, manager Ji≈ô√≠ Sobotka was forming the team for the future seasons. Basel finished the season in the mid-field region of the league table in 7th position with 28 points, 12 points behind Servette who won the championship for the second time in a row. Basel won ten games, drew eight and were defeated eight times. Youngster Markus Pfirter was the team's top league goal scorer with nine goals and oldie Josef H√ºgi scored eight times that season. Basel entered the Swiss Cup in the third principal round. They were drawn at home against third tier club SR Del√©mont. Despite being 0‚Äì2 in arrear early in the game, they came back to win 3‚Äì2. In the fourth round they faced fourth tier local club FC Breite, with ex-FCB player Hans H√ºgi (who had retired from active football) in another home game. Older brother H√ºgi (I) defended against younger brother H√ºgi (II), but younger brother won the duel and scored two of the goals as Basel won 3‚Äì0 to continue to the next round. In the fifth round Basel won due to an own goal against Z√ºrich, but in the quarter-final they were defeated by Bellinzona, who continued to the final, but here they were defeated by cup winners Lausanne-Sport after extra time.

Pastoral poets, and later, Virgil and Horace, portrayed the garden as an ideal of rustic aesthetics and abundant fertility. Scholars have compared Alcinous' garden and the island of Calypso; both are a locus amoenus with fresh springs and fruit trees. Some differences are noted; Calypso's garden is lush and endowed with a supernatural aesthetic beauty, while Alcinous' garden is simple and productive. Both have vineyards, but where Calypso's vines are heavy with unharvested grape clusters, Alcinous' vines are harvested by his men. Calypso's trees do not bear fruit while Alcinous' are domesticated. Calypso grows wild violets and herbs, Alcinous kitchen vegetables or useful culinary herbs. Alcinous' fountains provide water to the townspeople, while Calypso's flow freely along their natural course. Her garden gives pleasure only to the gods, and Alcinous tends to mortals. Based on Homer's description of the Garden, known from The Odyssey, Rose Standish Nichols compared the gardens of the Homeric Age to kitchen gardens, \\"characterized by an extreme simplicity\\": > And without the courtyard, hard by the door, is a great garden of four > ploughgates, and hedge runs round on either side.

Roger Warm Spring is part of the North Shore Complex terminal discharge area of the carbonate-rock aquifer system located in western Utah and eastern Nevada. Water profile The hot mineral water emerges from the spring at 82¬∞F / 28¬∞C. On hot days the water temperature in the collecting pond exceeds this temperature. The discharge rate is 1000 gallons per minute. Location The spring is located near the Valley of Fire State Park at the north shore of Lake Mead within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. The GPS coordinates of the spring is N 36 22.680 W 114 26.580. History Local native peoples used the springs for years before the area was settled by immigrants. In 1903 a water diversion canal was built to move water to farmlands south of St. Thomas. The project initially failed due to permeable soils in the area, before failing again due to economic issues. Between the years of 1938 to 1943 a water fowl refuge was planned and begun, but the construction was terminated.

Life and work P√©ter V√°cz was born in Budapest, studied graphic design in secondary school and then attended the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, where he took a puppet animation course. He graduated with a BA and MA in animation, with films titled Streamschool and Rabbit and Deer. The latter is a 16-minute film that uses a mixture of 2D and 3D animation and garnered more than 120 awards at international festivals, including the Junior Jury Award at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival and Best Animated Short at the Nashville Film Festival and Atlanta Film Festival. In 2014, V√°cz was commissioned by Picasso Pictures, who'd noted his Streamschool film, to create a music video for the song \\"All I'm Saying\\" by British band James. The project had a three- week deadline. The resulting stop-motion puppet video premiered on The Quietus, which praised V√°cz's \\"excellent, darkly uplifting handiwork\\", and garnered a Best Animation nomination for the 2015 Berlin Music Video Awards. In 2016, P√©ter V√°cz collaborated with Joseph Wallace on another James music video, for the track \\"Dear John\\". V√°cz and Wallace had met as students on the \\"Animation Sans Fronti√®res\\" animation course and have collaborated on a number of projects over the years, as well as teaching stop-motion animation together. \\"Dear John\\" used 3D animation with 2D flashback sequences.

It opened for visitors on February 20, 2020. The first phase of the investment, the tropical water park Suntago, cost 150 million euro and provided 600 work places.  History  Plans to build an amusement park appeared in 2011. It was said that construction would begin in 2013, yet since then the commencing of construction was delayed multiple times. Construction eventually began in May of 2017. Construction of the first phase of the project, Suntago Wodny ≈öwiat (lit. \\"Suntago Water World\\") was completed in 2019. February 20, 2020 marked the opening of the water park.  Complex  When completed, Park of Poland will cover an area of nearly , purchased by the investor Global City Holdings. Currently, only the first part of the complex is in operation, Suntago Wodny ≈öwiat, on an area of (including parking) together with the planned complex Suntago Village (a complex of bungalows, opened in spring 2020). The construction of a 4-star hotel in the vicinity of the Suntago park is also planned.  Suntago Wodny ≈öwiat  Suntago Wodny ≈öwiat (lit. Suntago Water World) is the largest covered water park in Poland and Europe, split into 3 themed zones: Jamango, Relax i Sauntaria. The park is open everyday, Monday to Friday in the hours of 10am - 10pm, and on weekends in the hours of 9am - 10am, and every day it can hold up to 15,000 people. = Jamango Wodna D≈ºungla = In this zone (lit. Jamango Water Jungle) there are 300 palm trees, 4000 deckchairs, 32 water slides spread out over 6 stories, of a combined length of over . The longest water slide, the Jungle Eclipse, measures in length. Also found here are pontoon slides for 1, 2 and 4 people (Neon Torpedo, Tiger's Race, Hunters Raft Race I and Hunters Raft Race II, Mad Octopus, and Green Mamba); trapdoor slides (Jaw Drop, Crazy Drive); the eight- lane water slide Raindbow Race on which rider will have to lay down on dedicated mats facing head first, as well as many others. There is also a wave pool, lazy rivers, the surfing simulator Surf-Air and an indoor and outdoor water park playground. The combined area of the pools is 2000m¬≤. = Relax = This is the zone dedicated to relaxation. Planted here are 400 palm trees mainly from Florida, Costa Rica and Malaysia. Also located here is a thermal pool with an area of 840m¬≤ and a 20,000m¬≤ garden. The retractable roof in this zone allows sunlight to enter on warm, sunny days. It will also be possible to get massages, and 3 \\"Dead Sea\\" polls, as well as sunrooms. = Saunaria = The area of the sauna zone is 2500 m¬≤. Here there will be 12 themed attractions, including the saunas ≈Åa≈∫nia Turecka, Rajska Pla≈ºa, Aromatyczna, Valhalla, Wioska Egipska, Akwarium, and Korea≈Ñska Sala Wypoczynku.  Accommodation and Hotels  Suntago Village = Planned is a complex of 100 bungalows. Its opening is planned shortly after the opening of the Suntago Wodny ≈öwiat. = Hotel = Planned is also a 4-star hotel with 240 rooms with conference rooms, directly connected with Suntago Wodny ≈öwiat.  Transport Links  The complex is located near Mszczon√≥w, about from Warsaw city centre and over from ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Park of Poland is located between the S8 expressway and the A2 motorway. In 2018, the Mszczon√≥w and Radziejowice communes, thanks to grants from the Masovian Voivodeship, built a road linking the water park with the National road 50.  Facts  * During construction of the Park of Poland, more concrete was used than during the construction of the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw. Also used was 5000 tonnes of steel, about half the mass of the Eiffel Tower.

It is a small shrub with variably shaped leaves, depending on subspecies, and single white to pink flowers arranged on the ends of branchlets. Description Philotheca scabra is a shrub that grows to a height of with more or less bristly stems. The leaves are sessile, long and either more or less cylindrical and folded lengthwise or narrow oblong-elliptic and concave on the lower side. The flowers are borne singly on the ends of branchlets on a peduncle long and a pedicel long with two pairs of tiny bracteoles at the base. There are five fleshy, semicircular sepals about long, five elliptical white to pink petals long and ten stamens. Flowering occurs in spring and the fruit is about long with a beak about long. Taxonomy This philotheca was first formally described in 1844 by Joseph Paxton who gave it the name Eriostemon scaber and published the description in Paxton's Magazine of Botany from a specimen \\"in the nursery of Messrs. Henderson, of Pine Apple Place, who received it from the gardens of Baron Hugel, at Vienna, about twelve months back\\". In 1970, Paul G. Wilson described two subspecies of Eriostemon scaber in the journal Nuytsia: * Eriostemon scaber subsp. latifolia (Paul G.Wilson) Paul G.Wilson that has glandular- warty stems and leaves about long and wide; * Eriostemon scaber (Paul G.Wilson) Paul G.Wilson subsp. scaber that has smooth stems and more or less cylindrical leaves. In 1998, Wilson changed the species name to Philotheca scabra and the subspecies to P. scabra subsp. latifolia and P. scabra subsp. scabra respectively, in a later edition of the same journal: The names of the subspecies are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Philotheca scabra subsp. latifolia (Paul G.Wilson) Paul G.Wilson; * Philotheca scabra (Paul G.Wilson) Paul G.Wilson subsp. scabra. Distribution and habitat Philotheca scabra grows in heath and forest on the coast and nearby ranges of New South Wales between Sydney and the Nerriga and Nowra districts. Subspecies scaber occurs in the northern part of the species' distribution and subsp. latifolius near Nerriga and Nowra.

Terrain ranges from wet lowland forest to evergreen hardwood and conifer montane rain forest. There is a short dry season centered on January-February, but fog and dew are common throughout the year and support a lush forest character.  Location and description  There are two general areas. One in the central highlands straddling central Vietnam and southern Laos northeast of the Bolaven Plateau. This northern sector around the Kontum Massif is a complex of granite mountains, and includes Ng·ªçc Linh, the highest peak in Vietnam at . The ecoregion's other area is in the south of Vietnam around the Da Lat Plateau and a highest point of . The southern sector is built more on weathered basalt, which creates fertile soil for agriculture.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical savanna climate - dry winter (K√∂ppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year, and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, and is drier than the average month. In this ecoregion, annual precipition is 1,800-2,000 mm in the Annamites and in the western regions of the Da Lat Plateau, but can reach over 3,000 mm/year on the eastern edge of the Da Lat Plateau.  Flora and fauna  The region is about 75% forested. Most of this is a closed forest of broadlead evergreens, and some needle-leaf evergreen. Wet evergreen forest cover from 600-900 meters elevation is characterized by species of Fagaceae, Myrtaceae, and Lauraceae. Above 900 meters, the wet hardwood forest supports a wide variety of tree species, generally dependent on the geology and soil of the location. The canopy of about 30 meters is lower at higher elevations and with thinner soils. Epiphytes are a common feature of these forests. Khasi pine (Pinus kesiya) is common throughout the region at elevations up to 1,800 meters.  Protected areas  About 11% of the ecoregion is protected in some official capacity, including: * N√∫i Ch√∫a National Park reaches down to the South China Sea in southeast Vietnam, with Nui Chua peak reaching 1,032 meters. It is a relatively intact ecosystem. * B·∫°ch M√£ National Park includes a former colonial hill station above central coastal city of Hu·∫ø. * Kon Ka Kinh National Park covers a biodiverse region in the central highlands of Vietnam, and protects upstream areas of the Ba River. * Ch∆∞ Yang Sin National Park is located in ƒê·∫Øk L·∫Øk Province in the central highlands of Vietnam.

The book takes an epidemiological approach and documents the historical roots of modern health disparities between Canadians and Indigenous peoples living in what is now Canada. In doing so, Daschuk highlights in particular the role of Canadian policy designed to displace Indigenous populations from their traditional territories to make way for the settlement of the Prairies, including policies that amounted to forced starvation. The book implicates numerous government officials, including John A. Macdonald, Canada's first Prime Minister, in advocating for and designing such policies. Daschuk thus builds on the work of scholars such as Sarah Carter who have highlighted the shortcomings of Canadian Indigenous policies in the settlement period, along with scholarship on the social determinants of health. In an article about his research, Daschuk argued that these types of policies were part of a process of genocide and ethnic cleansing.  Contents  The book is effectively divided into two sections, charting developments up to and after 1870. Daschuk begins the book with an examination of the health of Indigenous populations in the prairie region prior to contact with Europeans, helping to demonstrate that those populations experienced a precipitous decline in health in the post-contact period, leading to a 'nadir of indigenous health' around 1885. While Daschuk addresses myths about the region being free of disease prior to contact, the author does highlight the absence of European diseases and provides evidence of how Indigenous populations tended to be exceptionally healthy. Much of the first section charts the spread of European epidemic diseases, including smallpox, through Indigenous populations largely through trading networks, and explores how and why particular populations were especially susceptible to such epidemics. The book also examines the devastating impact of disease on bison, which had significant cultural significance for plains' populations and was an important source of food. The first section of the book therefore documents the changes brought about by contact and the spread of disease, which led to significant losses in prairie Indigenous populations. The second section of the book shifts the focus to politics as the new Canadian state embarked on Treaty negotiations with Indigenous populations and sought to open the prairie region to Canadian settlement. It is in this section that Daschuk demonstrates how Canadian officials used policy to take advantage of already decimated populations in order to restrict and control movement, which had the effect of worsening the devastation of disease and malnutrition. While the state used its power to control food rations, for example, to help force Indigenous hands in Treaty negotiations, it also turned around and failed to honour many provisions of the treaties it did negotiate and wielded tainted meat and medicine to continue to subdue populations. Daschuk highlights that such actions could not be justified even under Canadian law, arguing that this research demonstrates that \\"the foundation of western society is based on... illegal actions on the part of the state\\". Daschuk thus offers a critical assessment of the Canadian government broadly, but does not withhold judgement of specific people like Macdonald. For example, Daschuk shows evidence of Macdonald speaking in Parliament about keeping Indigenous peoples on the edge of starvation.  Awards  Clearing the Plains has been highly acclaimed. The Canadian Historical Association awarded the book its 2014 Clio Prize for the best book in Canadian Prairie history. It also won four separate Saskatchewan Book Awards in 2014, including the non-fiction and scholarly writing book awards. Clearing the Plains was awarded the 2014 Governor General‚Äôs History Award for Scholarly Research as the best book in Canadian history.  Influence  Clearing the Plains has been an influential book in re-assessing the treatment of Indigenous peoples in Canadian history broadly, as well as the actions of figures like Macdonald specifically. Historian Elizabeth A. Fenn, who has written extensively about colonialism and the impacts of epidemic diseases, wrote that the book \\"dismantles and destroys the view that Canada has a special claim to humanity in its treatment of Indigenous peoples.\\" The irony of Clearing the Plains winning the Canadian Historical Association's Sir John A. Macdonald Prize was widely noted given how the book exposed the role of Macdonald in the so-called politics of starvation. Daschuk became a vocal advocate of changing the prize's name as the Association engaged in conversations on the re-assessment of the namesake of the prize, established in 1977. At the 2018 annual meeting in Regina, CHA members voted overwhelmingly in favour of changing the name, re-branding the award the CHA Best Scholarly Book in Canadian History Prize.

He was appointed to a series of imperial offices, including praefectus annonae, (overseer of the grain supply for Rome), and praefectus vigilum (commander of the night watch of Rome). Based on an inscription found in Lepcis Magna to Divus Pius Severus Augustus, led Henriette Pavis d'Escurac to believe Dioga was a native of that African city and \\"Septimius Severus was responsible for making the fortune of his compatriot, as he had for many others.\\"d'Escurac, La pr√©fecture de l'annone, service administratif imp√©rial d'Auguste √† Constantin (Biblioth√®que des √âcoles fran√ßaises d'Ath√®nes et de Rome, 226) (Rome: Ecole fran√ßaise de Rome, 1976), p. 356  Career  When d'Escurac wrote in 1976, Marcius Dioga was known to have held only one office: praefectus annonae sacrae Urbis, previously known as praefectus annonae; Dioga was the first to hold that appointment by that title. The De officio praetoris tutelaris of Ulpian refers to him in that office.Theodor Mommsen, Juris antejustiniani fragmenta quae dicuntur Vaticana (Berlin, 1890), p. 7 But subsequent work has provided more information about this man. A fragmentary inscription recovered from Ostia Antica was restored by M. C√©beillac Gervasoni and F. Zevi to show Dioga was also praefectus vigilum.C√©beillac Gervasoni & Zevi, \\"Q. Marcius Dioga, pr√©fet des vigiles\\", M√©langes de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 88 (1976), pp. 620-637 The dates of these appointments was for a long time in doubt: experts long considered praefectus annonae to be the senior appointment to praefectus vigilum, and dating Dioga's tenure as praefectus annonae between 212 and 217. However, there were no gaps in the known fasti of the prefects of the vigiles to fit Dioga's tenure. Robert Sablayrolles proposed this solution: noting that under the Severian emperors, prefects of the vigiles enjoyed exceptional favor with the emperors, one could think that during this period it took precedence over the praefecti annonae; Sablayrolles dates his tenure as starting in 215 or 216, succeeding Lucius Valerius Datus who held the office from Summer 213 to no later than 216; Dioga's tenure would have extended no later than 217, when Valerius Titanianus is attested as holding it.Sablayrolles, Libertinus miles. Les cohortes de vigiles (Rome: √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1996) (Publications de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 224), p. 501 Information for the earlier appointments Marcius Dioga held comes from two acephalic inscriptions that had previously identified as referring to the same man, one found in Ostia Antica, = ILS 9501 the other in Rome, which Michel Christol identified as pertaining to Dioga.Christol, \\"Un fid√®le de Caracalla: Q. Marcius Dioga\\", Cahiers du Centre Gustave Glotz, 2 (1991), pp. 165-188 The earliest appointment known for Dioga was as military tribune assigned to Legio XII Fulminata, stationed at Melitene in Cappadocia; he could have served during the reign of Commodus This was undoubtedly the second step in the tres militiae that equestrians with military commissions advanced through. The first, commander of a cohors of 500 men was described on a lost line on the two inscriptions. The next known appointment was his commission as praefectus of the Classis Pannonica, a fleet of river boats that patrolled the Danube above the Iron Gates, whose headquarters is believed to be at Taurunum.Graham Webster, The Roman Imperial Army (New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1969), p. 161 There is no mention of Dioga commanding a cavalry ala, the expected third step of the tres militiae; Sablayrolles speculates that the line listing this may have been lost from both inscriptions.Sablayrolles, Libertinus miles, p. 502 Or command of the Classis Pannonica may have served as the final step of his tres militiae. Nevertheless, this was Dioga's last military commission. From there, Marcius Dioga was appointed procurator ab alimentis, or overseer of provisions, then procurator ad census accipiendos trium civitatum Ambianorum, Murrinorum, Atrebatium, or commissioner of the census of the Ambiani, the Morini and the Atrebates in Gallia Lugdunensis. Christol dates this census to 197-199, following the defeat of Clodius Albinus. Over the next decade Dioga held a series of appointments with increasing importance: procurator of the imperial properties in Alexandria; ab epistulis graecis; a libellis; and last a rationibus. Sablayrolles dates these last four appointments during the reign of Caracalla. Marcius Dioga's life after he stepped down from the praefectus vigilum is unknown. Considering that at this point his career spanned at least 30 years, and our knowledge of mortality rates of the period, it is likely he died soon after.

When Harris endorsed Joe Biden in March 2020, the Biden campaign released a video in which Biden asks Harris if the #KHive will support him. The organization is expected to be helpful to the 2020 Biden- Harris campaign.

His identity was revealed through his participation in the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. One of Colligan's repeated memes is the phrase \\"Hitler did nothing wrong\\", which he has said in radio, tweets, and videos.  Unite the Right rally attendance and doxing  Colligan participated in the torchlight tiki rally at Charlottesville in 2017. Shortly following the rally, one of Colligan's former Boston neighbors and friends noticed Colligan in the evening's most infamous photograph. His identity was later verified through social network posts, including a cropped driver's license photograph that contained a photo appearing to be Colligan along with his correct birthday. Following Colligan's doxxing, Colligan initially responded with jabs, such as posting his \\"real\\" home address as what was in fact a Jewish temple in Boston. Shortly thereafter, Colligan deleted his account. On Friday August 11, 2017, the day of the tiki rally, Colligan and Baked Alaska were ejected by a black Uber driver who said they had said racist things, calling the country \\"white America\\" and making her feel unsafe.  Social media  Colligan spent several years leading up to the Unite the Right rally posting white nationalist advocacy and neo-Nazi slogans such as \\"Hitler did nothing wrong\\". He was friends with and often interacted online with Baked Alaska. During one 52-minute video, Colligan questioned the history of the Holocaust, suggesting that his viewers search for \\"revisionist histories\\" instead. Following Unite the Right, Colligan joined The Gateway Pundit's Lucian Wintrich and Ali Akbar on the outlet's podcast, reports Right Wing Watch. During this podcast, the group discussed Unite the Right, Richard Spencer, and the distinction between the New Right and the alt-right. During the show, Colligan described white nationalist Richard B. Spencer as a \\"good guy\\", showed Nazi flags and \\"Hitler did nothing wrong\\" memes, and argued that he himself was not a member of the alt-right. Akbar described Colligan as \\"a little bit racist\\" but \\"so funny\\" in a now-deleted Periscope video promoting the dialogue. Nick Fuentes, a far- right podcaster and figurehead of the Groypers, listed Colligan as having a TikTok account affiliated with \\"America First\\", a TikTok-based movement described as white nationalist by Right Wing Watch. The social video app TikTok suspended Colligan's account in May 2020 during a crackdown on hate speech.  Post-Charlottesville events  In June 2020, Colligan joined two other groypers, leader Nick Fuentes and far-right student organizer Jaden NcNeil at a George Floyd protest in Queen Creek, Arizona. After the group asked two black men to take a picture with them while holding a sign labeled 'I can't read', they escalated tensions. One demonstrator tried to take the sign away, and another removed Colligan's glasses, at which point Colligan called the police saying he had been \\"physically assaulted.\\" Fuentes told one demonstrator the police would \\"kneel on that guy's neck for taking my friends glasses\\", referencing the manner in which George Floyd was killed. Following the event, several protesters were harassed online, leading them to delete social media accounts. Indian-American scientist and conspiracy theorist Shiva Ayyadurai appeared with Colligan on a livestream during his 2018 Massachusetts election campaign against Elizabeth Warren. Colligan requested that Ayyadurai bless a small statue of the Kek, the green frog that came to prominence as a symbol of the alt-right during the 2016 United States presidential election.

It was probably the first successful independent facility established for the integrated treatment of gasworks waste, and manufactured the residues of the Edinburgh gasworks into useful products for over half a century. History Gas lighting was introduced in Edinburgh in 1818. The production of coal gas generated considerable residues of coal tar and ammoniacal liquor which were further processed at the Bonnington Chemical Works. The Bonnington facility was located on Newhaven Road in Bonnington (between Edinburgh and Leith) near the south bank of the Water of Leith. George Dixon Longstaff recorded that the chemical works began in 1822 for the purpose of distilling coal tar to separate naphtha. This was supplied to Charles Macintosh for him to make waterproof fabrics, as epitomised by the Mackintosh. Longstaff was at that time assistant to Dr John Wilson Anderson, who taught practical chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. When Anderson resigned from the university to concentrate on his growing chemical plant, Longstaff took his academic post. By 1830 the factory was making and selling naphtha, pitch oil (later called creosote), pitch, and lampblack (carbon black) from the coal tar, while the ammoniacal liquor was processed into sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride). Anderson also made the sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid he needed in processing and sold the associated products magnesium carbonate and sodium sulphate. Anderson believed he was the first in Britain to commence making black ash and soda ash (sodium carbonate) using the Leblanc process when the salt tax was repealed in 1823. For some years he also made soap. Macintosh remained a special customer until at least the late 1830s, and probably well beyond, receiving a significant discount on his large naphtha orders. When Anderson died in 1835, his brother-in-law Thomas Astley (son of chemical manufacturer Joseph Astley) took on the management of the plant and introduced the further products ammonium sulphate fertiliser and asphalt road surfacing. In 1847 the works was taken over by John Tennant and John Tennent, who had both been close associates of Macintosh. Tennant was the eldest son of industrialist Charles Tennant, and Tennent was of the Tennent family who ran Wellpark Brewery. The firm became one of the Tennant group of companies. They added to the product line sodium sulphite and sodium thiosulphate (which they sold as antichlor) and copper sulphide marine anti- fouling paint. The large scale of processing precipitated the construction of a pipeline to pump the gasworks residues directly from Edinburgh to Bonnington over Calton Hill. Tennent's brother-in-law Dr Edmund Ronalds took over the management of the plant in 1856. He retained most of the existing products and conducted further distillations to make benzene and also coke oil and coke. Products were shipped as far as Russia and America. He commissioned a new acid plant in which sulphuric and hydrochloric acids and sulphurous acid gas were made and introduced waste gas capture equipment and a large new chimney to reduce emissions. The facility now occupied close to three acres. The plant was closed in 1878 after Ronalds had suffered chronic ill health for some years.

It includes a bronze sculpture by Richard Reginald Goulden portraying Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child. It became a Grade II listed building in 2017. The surrounding buildings of the bank are separately listed at Grade I. Background A memorial committee of long-serving bank staff was established in November 1918 to raise funds for a war memorial. Suggestions were made to spend the funds on a variety of different projects, such as a memorial chapel, a memorial library and hall, almshouses, the endowment of university scholarships, or a stained glass window at a nearby church. The committee decided on three memorials: a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 12 April 1919, endowing a bed at Guy's Hospital, and commissioning a memorial cross at the bank. These plans were approved by the bank's court of directors. After initially donating ¬£1,000 in June 1919 to fund a bed at Astley Cooper Ward, a surgical accident ward at Guy's Hospital, the bank continued to raise funds for the hospital from 1919 to 1944, providing over ¬£30,000 to endow an entire ward of 26 beds, Christopher Ward. The bank's St Christopher Health Fund still continues to fund medical treatment for bank staff. Successful fundraising allowed the committee to recommend a more ambitious memorial structure than the intended memorial cross. The committee approached Sir George Frampton, and he introduced them to Richard Reginald Goulden as a promising sculptor. Goulden was commissioned to design and make the memorial sculpture. Goulden's first design was approved by the committee but rejected by the bank's court of directors, but his second design, portraying St Christopher carrying the Holy Child, was accepted. The design reflected the location, as the bank's garden was the site of the church of St Christopher le Stocks until it was demolished in 1781, and Saint Christopher is the bank's patron saint; and it also reflects the spirit of service and self-sacrifice embodied by Saint Christopher. The materials for the sculpture cost ¬£750, with a payment to Goulden of ¬£105. A further fundraising gathered ¬£300 to inscribe the names of the war dead at the base of the statue. Description Goulden's lifesize bronze statue portrays a man standing on a rock, carrying a child on his shoulder. They man and child are holding hands, with the man wearing only a loincloth, and the child similarly naked. The group represents Saint Christopher at the edge of a stream, carrying the Christ Child. An inscription around the bottom of the rock reads: TO THE COMRADES / WHO, AT DUTY'S CALL, CROSSED THE DARK WATERS TO / THE FURTHER SHORE 1914-1919. The sculpture is mounted on a large rectangular block of Portland stone as a plinth, on three stone steps. Set into the front of the plinth is a bronze cross, and the other three sides of the plinth each bear a bronze plaque listing the 71 names of the bank's war dead. The statue on its plinth stands around tall. The sculpture was unveiled by the Governor of the Bank of England Montagu Norman in a prominent position in the Bank's garden, in an open internal courtyard, at a short ceremony at 4pm on 11 November 1921, at which it was dedicated by the Archdeacon of London Ernest Holmes, with two bandsmen from the Grenadier Guards playing the Last Post and Reveille. A new committee was established in 1945 to commission elements to commemorate the war dead from the Second World War, again using funds raised from the staff donations. Rather than commissioning a new monument, modest elements were added to the existing memorial by Alexander Scott: set into the paving before the sculpture is a circular raised bronze plaque about in diameter, inscribed with a wreath around the words: TO THE / MEMORY / OF THOSE WHO / CROSSED THE / SAME WATERS / 1939-1945. The memorial was rededicated on 20 October 1948 at a ceremony attended by the Bank's Governor Thomas Catto, 1st Baron Catto, the Bishop of Stepney Robert Moberly, and by the former Governor Montagu Norman. It is visible from the Bank's entrance hall, and the offices that surround it. The names of the bank's staff who served in the First World War are also inscribed in the entrance hall, with the dead marked with red crosses, opposite the names of the 65 war dead from the Second World War. Several of the bank's war dead are also commemorated by bronze plaques in other buildings that were Bank of England offices, in Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle, The memorial became a Grade II listed building in 2017.

Goodman became a local celebrity after the quality of his artwork gained recognition. He was also known as a distance runner who competed in local marathons. Goodman‚Äôs character, artwork and biography which appeared in newspapers, Runner‚Äôs World magazine and documentaries, helped humanize the homeless crisis in San Francisco. Goodman died in his encampment in the Mission District of San Francisco on August 7, 2020, aged 60.  Biography  Goodman was born in Los Angeles and moved to San Francisco when he was a baby. He grew up in a low income San Francisco housing project near Jefferson Square Park. Goodman had a difficult childhood and suffered from drug and alcohol addiction. Eventually, he was sentenced to prison for burglary. While serving between 6 to 8 years in San Quentin Prison, he rediscovered running and he developed his art. Though he ran track as a child, he stopped around the age of 14. While in prison, Goodman joined San Quentin State Prison‚Äôs 1,000 Mile Club inmate group that runs around a quarter-mile loop in the prison yard. He credited running with eventually helping him to break his alcohol and drug addictions. After being released from prison, Goodman continued to run long distance. After organizers of the San Francisco Marathon read a profile of Goodman in the San Francisco Chronicle Homeless S.F. marathoner doesn't run from his problems, marathon organizers reached out to Goodman to help. Goodman made a painting for the cause and they sold raffle tickets to win the painting. For every $10 donated to Hospitality House Community Arts Program, donors got a chance to win a piece of Goodman‚Äôs art. Goodman‚Äôs raffle raised almost $10,000 for Hospitality House Community Arts Program. Also while in prison, Goodman developed his portrait drawing. He attended San Quentin Arts in Corrections Program taught by Art Hazelwood. When he was released from prison, Goodman took classes at City College of San Francisco and created work at the Hospitality House. Goodman's son, Ronnie Jr, was a graffiti artist known as Papa Mire and worked on the murals in the Mission district. Ronnie Jr was stabbed to death in 2014.  Appearances and profiles  Goodman was profiled in the book Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration written by Nicole R. Fleetwood, Professor of American Studies and Art History at Rutgers University. Goodman‚Äôs artwork was also included in the Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration exhibition curated by Fleetwood and presented at the MoMA PS1. His work was presented at the Georgia Museum of Art: Art Hazelwood and Ronnie Goodman: Speaking to the Issues. A documentary short by David Swope about Goodman titled Good Man - A Prison Arts Project Story was an Official Selection for the Mill Valley Film Festival.

Her work includes combinations of painting, installations, sculpture, and choreography, inspired by traditional Korean methods and arts.  Life  Kang was born in Seoul, South Korea. She studied Oriental painting at Ewha Womans University and painting at the Royal College of Art, London. She is a professor of Korean painting at Ewha Womans University.  Work and themes  As a painter, Kang focuses on Korean landscapes, leveraging traditional methods. Kang's multimedia work often takes the form of immersive installations. Her 2017 project Black Mat Oriole incorporates sculpture, painting, and video. The colors of the objects in the installation are based on colors from her paintings. The work also included performers who carry and arrange objects, and sit and drag their bodies on the floor. Kang's installations all include objects that are liftable by the artist and any performers, and have sizes and weights that are at most as large as a standard human body. This technique has been a catalyst to convey themes relating to the subjects of her work. For example, the shape of the sculpture Grandmother Tower was inspired by the posture of her grandmother. She has also incorporated traditional hand-woven reed mats that she had commissioned. Among the themes of Kang's work are the coming together of individuals, and how they both form community and experience their own histories. She is also inspired by classical Korean poetry and dance. Her installation work explores concepts relating to grids and their aesthetics, and how objects are arranged within a room. Her style has influence from Jeongganbo, a form of Korean musical notation. Kang has a studio in Seochon. She paints a gouache painting every day as part of her work.  Exhibitions  Kang's exhibitions have included the following: ; 2019 * Land Sand Strand, Venice Biennale (Central Pavilion Arsenale) * Square See Triangle, Buk-Seoul Museum of Art Children's Gallery ; 2018 * Black Mat Oriole (solo exhibition), Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia * Land Sand Strand, Liverpool Biennial ; 2016 * The Eighth Climate * Gwangju Biennale * As the Moon Waxes and Wanes, National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Gwacheon * Group Mobile, Villa Vassilief, Paris ; 2015 * Foot and Moon, Audio Visual Pavilion, Seoul ; 2013 * Grandmother Tower, Old House, Seoul  Awards  Kang was a recipient of a 2018 Baloise Art Prize.

Geography=Location Pathra is located at . Area overview Paschim Medinipur district (before separation of Jhargram) had a total forest area of 1,700 km2, accounting for 14.31% of the total forested area of the state. It is obvious from the map of the Midnapore Sadar subdivision, placed alongside, is that there are large stretches of forests in the subdivision. The soil is predominantly lateritic.Around 30% of the population of the district resides in this subdivision. 13.95% of the population lives in urban areas and 86.05% lives in the rural areas. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Demographics According to the 2011 Census of India, Pathra had a total population of 3,356, of which 1,726 (51%) were males and 1,639 (49%) were females. There were 495 persons in the age range of 0‚Äì6 years. The total number of literate persons in Pathra was 1,921 (67.14% of the population over 6 years). .*For language details see Midnapore Sadar (community development block)#Language and religion Culture Pathra is a village of temples with hundreds of small temples. Unfortunately, many of the temples are in bad shape because of lack of preservation, damage by the Kangsabati and vandalizing by the locals. There are 34 temples with ‚Äúenriched terracotta artwork‚Äù. Those deserving a special mention are the naba-ratna temple, kachari mahal, rasmancha, dalan of Kalachand, Durgeswar temple and Pancha Shiva temple. Most of the temples were built by the Ghosal (later changed to Majumdar) and Banerjee families. The decline started when the rich families shifted base. However, with the persistent efforts of a small group of enthusiasts, Pathra has turned the tide. The Archaeological Survey of India has taken charge of 28 temples and have repaired 18 temples. Pathra Archeological Preservation Committee, a non-government organization, also looks after the structures. A major attraction is the 250-year old, 40 feet high Nava-ratna temple. There is a small at-chala temple in the same compound. Located nearby are three at- chalas and a pancha-ratna temple. Behind the cluster is a Durga dalan. Some distance away is another group of pancha-ratna temples. The Sitala temple (also known as Burimar than) is also 40 feet high. Other important temples are Sarbamangala, Kalachand, Das Mahavidya and Hansa. Therasmancha built in 1832 has nine small towers. David J. McCutchion mentions a ruined temple at Pathra as a char-chala on an elongated base, the nava-ratna as having smooth rekha turrets, the Kalachand temple as a flat roofed temple with a porch on five arches, and the Sitala temple as having a shallow porch projection.McCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, pages 32, 53, 62, 68.

She is a Professor in the Psychobiology of Appetite at the University of Birmingham and editor-in-chief of the journal Appetite. Early life and education Higgs earned her Bachelor of Arts and Master's degree from the Somerville College, Oxford in 1989 before receiving her PhD in psychology from Durham University. She completed her post-doctoral research at Oxford before earning an academic position at the University of Birmingham in 1999. Career Higgs' research at Birmingham focused on the link between memory and food addiction. In 2002, she published Memory for recent eating and its influence on subsequent food intake, which found that when participants were reminded of when they previously ate they were less likely to overeat. She followed up this research a few year later by publishing Memory and its role in appetite regulation in the journal Physiology & Behavior. As a result of her academic input, Higgs was appointed editor-in-chief of the journal Appetite. In 2013, Higgs received a ¬£333K Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant to research ways social norms can promote healthy eating. This resulted in the publication of Social norms and their influence on eating behaviours in 2015, which concluded that social norms influenced food choices and intake due to fears of social judgement. Due to the impact she had on her field, Higgs was appointed President-Elect of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior. Following this, she was the co-recipient of a ¬£800,000 project grant from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council to explore how the pleasure of eating is affected by cognitive functions. In 2017, Higgs collaborated with Jeff Brunstrom and Lenny Vartanian to explore how eating with other people affects appetite using funding from a ESRC grant.

It covers the period 1187‚Äì1196, but is centred on the expedition of 1189‚Äì1190. It appears to be a composite work, compiled from pieces written while the expedition was underway with a preface and an appendix added. Very early manuscript copies survive, but it is only a later 13th-century notice that first gives an author's name, Ansbert. This may in fact be the name of the author or perhaps the compiler. The work is associated with Bavaria and Austria. It provides a nearly day-to-day account of the expedition as it crossed the Balkans and Anatolia before the sudden death of Frederick I in a swimming accident. It is the most detailed surviving account of the expedition and it relies mainly on eyewitness reports. Date, authorship and manuscripts The History is a contemporary account, having attained its finished form no later than about 1200. An early draft appears to have existed before 1195. The final form cannot be earlier than the summer of 1196. Frederick's son and successor, the Emperor Henry VI, who died in September 1197, is referred to throughout as living. Parts of the work appear to have been written contemporaneously with events, as shown by references to certain persons as still living (e.g., Count Philip of Flanders, who died at the siege of Acre in 1191). The earliest surviving copy was made around 1200 in the Benedictine abbey of Saint Lambrecht in Styria. This incomplete copy contains only a third of the text. Another very earlier surviving copy was made at the Praemonstratensian monastery of Milevsko (M√ºhlhausen) in Bohemia before 1221. It is also incomplete. The full text is only known from two copies commissioned in the 18th century by the Moravian antiquarian and abbot Josef Piter. These copies were not made from either of the known earlier manuscripts. In the Milevsko manuscript, Abbot Gerlach added a notice of the work's title and authorship: \\"The History of the Expedition of the Emperor Frederick, written by an Austrian cleric who was present on this same\\". Later in the 13th century, somebody added the authors name: \\"called Ansbert\\". Since neither notice is particularly late, some scholars have taken them at face value. Others have questioned the name or even the implication of Gerlach's notice that the work was the product of a single author. The hands of multiple authors have been seen in the variations of cursus employed in different sections. It is possible, given the distribution of references to Austria, that only the last part was written by an Austrian cleric, who may also have been the compiler of the whole. The earlier parts appear to have been written in the diocese of Passau. Structure and sources The History is composed of three distinct parts: a preface concerning the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 and the planning of the crusade, the long central account of Frederick's crusade and what amounts to an appendix about the reign of Henry VI down to the summer of 1196, when he left Germany on his planned crusade. This last part is a quarter of the length of the middle section. The preface of the History includes Pope Gregory VIII's bull Audita tremendi, calling for the Third Crusade; an anonymous letter to the master of the Hospitallers in Italy, Archembald, describing the Battle of Hattin; a letter of the steward of the Hospitallers in Jerusalem, Hermengar, to Duke Leopold V of Austria, detailing Saladin's conquests in northern Syria in 1188. The central section of the History shows evidence of having been composed in parts out of reports sent back to Germany by the army. It covers the period from the setting out in May 1189 until Frederick's death in June 1190. Anton Chroust suggested that there are three sections composed separately. The first would end in November 1189, when Frederick is recorded as sending back reports to Henry VI and King B√©la III of Hungary, and the second at Easter 1190, when a report seems to have been sent back to the Empire with some Pisan merchants. The third section, beginning from 29 March 1190, quotes extensively from an eyewitness account, the diary of the Bavarian cleric Tageno. The period from 16 May to 9 June 1190 is drawn almost verbatim from Tageno. It has been argued that Ansbert may have been a participant in the crusade and the author of the three reports on which the main sections were based. Uses The History was used by Gerlach, who quotes it in his own continuation of the chronicle of Vincent of Prague. An early draft of the History was also used by Magnus of Reichersberg, who died in 1195, for his chronicle. The anonymous author of the History of the Pilgrims, another account of Frederick I's crusade, also had access to the History of the Expedition around 1200. The History is weak on background. It provides an account of the preaching of the crusade and of the Curia Christi (27 March 1188), but little on the political or diplomatic preparations. For the expedition itself, it provides an almost day-to-day account that is much more detailed than any preceding crusade chronicle. In contrast to the History of the Pilgrims, it names dates and places, allowing the reader to trace the army's march and even to calculate its speed ( per day in hostile territory). It also lists 70 participating noblemen and churchmen, a more thorough list than exists for most crusades. Besides Duke Frederick VI of Swabia and Duke Berthold of Merania, there were eleven bishops from Germany and one from Hungary, two margraves and twenty-six counts. The History is the best source for Frederick's relations with the Greeks, superior to the main Greek source, Niketas Choniates.
