It is estimated from the molecular structure before the substance is even synthesized and tested. A druglike molecule has properties such as: *Solubility in both water and fat, as an orally administered drug needs to pass through the intestinal lining after it is consumed, be carried in aqueous blood and penetrate the lipid-based cell membrane to reach the inside of a cell. A model compound for the lipophilic cellular membrane is 1-octanol (a lipophilic hydrocarbon), so the logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient, known as LogP, is used to predict the solubility of a potential oral drug. This coefficient can be experimentally measured or predicted computationally, in which case it is sometimes called \\"cLogP\\". *Potency at the biological target. High potency (high value of pIC50) is a desirable attribute in drug candidates, as it reduces the risk of non-specific, off-target pharmacology at a given concentration. When associated with low clearance, high potency also allows for low total dose, which lowers the risk of idiosyncratic drug reactions. *Ligand efficiency and lipophilic efficiency. *Molecular weight: The smaller the better, because diffusion is directly affected. The great majority of drugs on the market have molecular weights between 200 and 600 Daltons, and particularly <500; they belong to the group of small molecules. A traditional method to evaluate druglikeness is to check compliance of Lipinski's Rule of Five, which covers the numbers of hydrophilic groups, molecular weight and hydrophobicity. Since the drug is transported in aqueous media like blood and intracellular fluid, it has to be sufficiently water-soluble in the absolute sense (i.e. must have a minimum chemical solubility in order to be effective). Solubility in water can be estimated from the number of hydrogen bond donors vs. alkyl sidechains in the molecule. Low water solubility translates to slow absorption and action. Too many hydrogen bond donors, on the other hand, lead to low fat solubility, so that the drug cannot penetrate the cell membrane to reach the inside of the cell. Based on one definition, a drug-like molecule has a logarithm of partition coefficient (log P) between -0.4 and 5.6, molecular weight 160-480 g/mol, molar refractivity of 40-130, which is related to the volume and molecular weight of the molecule and has 20-70 atoms. Substructures with known toxic, mutagenic or teratogenic properties affect the usefulness of a designed molecule. However, several poisons have a good druglikeness. Natural toxins are used in pharmacological research to find out their mechanism of action, and if it could be exploited for beneficial purposes. Alkylnitro compounds tend to be irritants, and Michael acceptors, such as enones, are alkylating agents and thus potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic. Druglikeness indices are inherently limited tools. Druglikeness can be estimated for any molecule, and does not evaluate the actual specific effect that the drug achieves (biological activity). Simple rules are not always accurate and may unnecessarily limit the chemical space to search: many best-selling drugs have features that cause them to score low on various druglikeness indices. Furthermore, first-pass metabolism, which is biochemically selective, can destroy the pharmacological activity of a compound despite good druglikeness. Druglikeness is not relevant for most biologics, since they are usually proteins that need to be injected, because proteins are digested if eaten.

He was also confessor to the previous patriarchs Alexy I and Pimen. Biography Ivan Dmitrievich Pavlov was born September 8th, 1919 in Makovskiye Vyselki, Ryazan Oblast, to a peasant family. After finishing at a polytechnical college, he worked as a technician at a metallurgic plant. Pavlov served in the military during World War II, active for six years, starting in the Soviet-Finnish War; he also took part in the Battle of Stalingrad. He was awarded the medal and title of \\"Hero of the Soviet Union\\" for his part in the defense of Stalingrad. As a soldier, Pavlov reached Austria and participated in the battles at Lake Balaton. In 1946 he was demobilised in Hungary and came to Moscow.  Conversion  In one of the most bloody days lieutenant Pavlov found among the ruins the Gospel, opened, started reading and took it as a sign from above. He collected all the pages of the Gospel and never abandoned them. In one of the interviews he recollected, \\"When I started reading the Gospel ‚Äì my eyes got opened upon everything surrounding me, upon all the events... I walked with the Gospel and was not afraid. Never. Such was the inspiration! Simply God was next to me and I was not afraid of anything...\\". In 1946 Pavlov went to Yelokhovo Cathedral and, after asking for any theological institute, he was sent to the newly opened theological seminary at Novodevichy monastery. He arrived there in the military outfit and was gladly met by pro-rector Father Sergius. Thus the sergeant became the seminarian. Having finished the seminary, he studied at the Moscow Theological Academy and in 1953 took postrig becoming a monk, refusing the glory and awards. He completed the academy in 1954, by now not Ivan Dmitrievich Pavlov but hieromonk Cyril. Father Cyril lived at Trinity- Sergius lavra and became brotherly spiritual guide to the monks. Later life and death Until his death father Cyril lived in Peredelkino, in the residence of the Holy Patriarch of all Russia Aleksy II. Archimandrite Cyril died on 20 February 2017 at the age of 97. Teaching Pavlov encouraged people to work on perfecting themselves, studying, working on themselves as long as Lord gives time one needs to fight with one's own sinful inclinations, one's own vices, removing from one's soul all what is evil, bad, viceful as no one knows neither day or time of Christ coming.

It was released on March 6, 2001, through the record label RCA Nashville. 3 of Hearts is a teen pop and country music album, though according to some music critics, it leans more towards pop music. The album was managed by American producer Byron Gallimore; its marketing focused on the group's crossover appeal to target a teenaged and young-adult audience. 3 of Hearts performed on two national tours sponsored by Seventeen magazine and Walmart respectively, and the singers were featured in several marketing campaigns. Reviews of 3 of Hearts were mixed; some critics praised the group's vocals and public image, but others criticized the songs as generic and lacking an authentic country sound. The album peaked at number 45 on Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Two singles and \\"Arizona Rain\\"were released and made appearances on the . The album's low sales and lack of appeal to country radio audiences led to RCA dropping the group.  Background and recording  3 of Hearts members Blaire Stroud, Katie McNeill, and Deserea Wasdin first performed together at a funeral, where they sang the hymn . They had each performed independently at various venues and aspired to pursue music as a career. At the suggestion of their family and friends, they recorded a demo tape and video. The tape was composed of four songs: cover versions of works by Shania Twain and Martina McBride, a gospel song, and \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". McNeill's mother sent the cassette to record promoter Peter Svendsen. While organizing unsolicited demos and materials, Svendsen's daughter recommended he should listen to the tape. Stroud, McNeil, and Wasdin received offers from four Nashville-based record labels, including RCA Nashville, with whom they signed their record deal shortly after graduating from high school. RCA executive vice-president Butch Waugh said the record company was immediately drawn to the group because of their wholesome image and work ethic. Steve Hochman of Los Angeles Times associated 3 of Hearts with a trend towards younger country performers, connecting them with singers Jessica Andrews, LeAnn Rimes, and Lila McCann, and the band Marshall Dyllon. The record label marketed 3 of Hearts and their album to a younger listener; the group's manager Ken Kragen said that he hoped the group could revive interest in country music from a teenaged and young-adult audience, as the genre had fallen out of favorite with these demographics. Kragen has said that before he signed the trio, he almost retired from music, after being fired by singer- songwriter Kenny Rogers. In 2001, Rogers sued Kragen for allegedly poaching 3 of Hearts and other musical acts from his company, Rogers' Dreamcatcher Management Co.; Kragen responded by saying Rogers' company had rejected . A settlement was reached in 2003, and the terms of the agreement were not disclosed to the public. American producer Byron Gallimore worked as the executive producer for the group's debut album; in the later half of 2000, the trio recorded the songs in the Tennessee studios Essential Sound and Ocean Nashville. The music was mixed at the Emerald Sound Studios in Nashville, and mastered in Hollywood. Prior to the release of the album, song \\"Just Might Change Your Life\\" was featured on the soundtrack for the film Where the Heart Is (2000).  Composition and sound  3 of Hearts is a teen pop and country music album that consists of eleven tracks. The instrumentals include fiddles and drums, which Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has noted are commonly used in country music. Malcolm Mayhew, writing for the Fort Worth Star- Telegram, identified the trio's sound as \\"country sprinkled with pop\\". He wrote that the album has a focus on a style of country music similar to that of American band the Dixie Chicks, with \\"pop touches\\" and \\"an occasional nod to Latin\\". Several music critics said that 3 of Hearts features more pop compositions than country ones; a writer for Billboard wrote: \\"even with the most loose, liberal translation, no way is this anything close to country music.\\" The same writer noted that the trio's music and style did not fit with the more \\"edgy\\" scene of their home state Texas. Songs include \\"peppy-squared, nearly interchangeable midtempos\\" (\\"Love Is Enough,\\" \\"It Happened to Me\\", \\"The Hard Way\\", and \\"Sugar and Daisies\\") and \\"note-bending, (\\"6, 8, 12\\", \\"Wash Away This Kiss\\", and \\"Over the Edge\\"). The album's opening trackthe uptempo \\"Love Is Enough\\"features lyrics about the importance of love, and an instrumental provided by a fiddle. The subject of romance is also explored in \\"Baby, That's The Way\\"which interprets true love through the message, \\"you'll know it's the real thing when you see it\\"and \\"Sugar and Daisies\\". \\"6, 8, 12\\" is a cover of American singer Brian McKnight's 2000 single of the same name.  Release and promotion  3 of Hearts was initially scheduled for release on various dates in 2001June 5, June 6, and July 24 ‚Äì before being pushed forward to March 6 that year. It was released as an audio CD, cassette, and digital download. Jon Elliot, a senior director of marketing and artist development for RCA, said the promotional strategies for the album and the group focused primarily on \\"get[ting] their names out there and their faces visible\\". 3 of Hearts performed as part of a 2001 tour sponsored by Seventeen magazine, in which they sang in American shopping malls in 50 cities as part of a showcase of prom fashions. They also participated in the Walmart Across America Tour. To prepare for the tours, the trio were given dance lessons by American singer and choreographer Toni Basil. Lorie Hollabaugh of Billboard praised the group's live performances as defined by \\"tightly woven harmonies\\". Along with the performances, the group members were featured in magazine advertisements from April to July 2001; the features included a contest in which a reader could win a performance from the group at their school. 3 of Hearts was the first country act to partner with Seventeen. The group also participated in a marketing campaign with Gillette, and discussions started with Warner TV on a potential television series based on their lives. To further promote their music, 3 of Hearts visited radio stations. They also had a two-hour interview with Scholastic magazine and appeared on the cover. They were also prominently featured on boxes of Kellogg's cereal; Chet Flippo of CMT described the promotion of 3 of Hearts as \\"a media blitz\\". 3 of Hearts peaked at number 45 on the Top Country Albums Billboard chart on August 11, 2001, remaining on the chart for six weeks. Following the album's release, 3 of Hearts was let go from RCA due to low sales and a lack of connection with the core audience of country radiothe middle-aged woman. In a 2002 interview, RCA chairman Joe Galante said he learned to \\"aim for your natural marketplace\\" from his experiences with 3 of Hearts and he felt marketing a country act for teenagers was not a wise business move.  Singles  \\"Love Is Enough\\" was released as the lead single from 3 of Hearts; it was sent to radio stations in the United States on March 6, 2001. It was further promoted through an \\"enhanced commercial CD single\\", which included the accompanying music video for the song. The group performed \\"Love Is Enough\\" on The Jenny Jones Show as part of \\"nine young acts to watch in 2001\\". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard praised the single as conveying a \\"vibrant feel that evokes a sunny day with the windows down and the radio up\\", but found the lyrics and overall message to be clich√©. \\"Arizona Rain\\" was released as the album's second single on July 23, 2001. The track was featured on the 2001 album Country Heat 2002, which was made available through BMG Music Canada. \\"Love Is Enough\\" and \\"Arizona Rain\\" both made appearances on Billboard. \\"Love Is Enough\\" peaked at number 43 on the Country Airplay chart on May 19, 2001; the single remained on the chart for ten weeks. \\"Arizona Rain\\" reached number 59 on the Country Airplay chart on August 18, 2001, and remained on the chart for a week.  Critical reception  3 of Hearts' vocals and image received praise from music critics following the album's release. Billboard described the trio as \\"possess[ing] angelic voices\\" and praised 3 of Hearts as \\"ear candy\\". D Magazine said the album's pop composition could allow the group to have a crossover appeal, and compared them to the Dixie Chicks. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album as well-constructed and appealing, but criticized several songsspecifically \\"Over the Edge\\"as sounding dated. He positively compared the trio's vocals to those of American band Rascal Flatts, and preferred their wholesome image over the more sexualized one attached to American singer Willa Ford. In a mixed review, Mario Tarradell of the Knight Ridder Tribune described the music as \\"breezy\\" and \\"refreshing\\", but noted that it was not innovative. Commentators criticized 3 of Hearts and the trio's vocals as generic and lacking an authentic country sound. Country Standard Time Dan MacIntosh called the album manufactured, describing its content as \\"impersonal, yet functional, songs\\". He responded negatively to the lack of attitude in the group's voices, which he dismissed as \\"girlishly giddy vocals and pop-ish country backing\\". Editor Tom Roland, writing for the American Bar Association, panned the album's content for its \\"bright, but shallow declarations of puppy love\\". Even though he praised the trio as talented, he said their vocals had \\"none of the life experience that has been a traditional hallmark of country recordings\\".

A castle near the village of Sternberg, today a ruin, was first mentioned in a deed issued at Saint Paul's Abbey about 1170/80. Wernberg itself first appeared in a document dated 17 November 1227 determining the demolition of a Drava bridge and the transfer of Werdenberch Castle to the Carinthian estates of the Bishopric of Bamberg. The castle, situated on arock above the Drava river, was built under the rule of Duke Bernhard of Carinthia, it later passed to the Austrian Habsburgs. Held by the Khevenh√ºller noble family from 1519 onwards, the present-day Renaissance building was erected at the behest of the Carinthian governor George Khevenh√ºller (1533‚Äì1587). Part of the Ossiach Abbey estates from 1672, it is since 1935 a possession of the Catholic Missionary Sisters of the Precious Blood. The municipality of Wernberg was established in 1850.

Cuckoos are not the only brood parasites, however the behavior is more rare in other groups of birds, including ducks, weavers, and cowbirds. Brood parasites and their favored host species are known to coevolve, which means both are likely to possess specific adaptations and counteradaptations. An example of such an evolutionary arms race between a brood parasite and its host, is the phenomenon of egg rejection and egg mimicry, its counteradaptation. Cuckoo eggs have been found in the nests of over 100 different species, of which 11 have been identified as primary host species and a similar number as secondary. Egg patterns and coloring differs greatly between these host species, and the cuckoo eggs vary accordingly. Thus it is important for a female cuckoo to deposit her eggs in a nest corresponding to the same species as her foster parents, because if she were to select a different host species, that would likely entail a higher risk of egg rejection. According to the habitat selection hypothesis, host selection occurs through the means of habitat imprinting in early post-natal development. A female cuckoo retains recognition of certain stimuli, like vegetation, from experience with her natal habitat. Habitats might be defined as dry or wet, shrubby or forested, lakeside, etc. This process has been termed natal habitat preference induction (NHPI) and has been found in many species across different taxa, such as insects (Hopkins‚Äô host selection principle), fish, amphibians, mammals and birds of course. This imprinting of the habitat type in which the female cuckoo was reared may cause her to subsequently return to this habitat type in order to lay eggs and therefore increases the likelihood of encountering the suitable host species, as most host species are known to be habitat specific. Thus, habitat selection is thought to allow for specific host selection by the female cuckoo. In some cases an individual may choose a different habitat from their original imprint based on the reproductive success of conspecific individuals in the vicinity.  Alternative Hypotheses  There are 5 hypotheses for host selection in cuckoos: Inherited preference, host imprinting, natal philopatry (returning to their own birthplace to lay eggs), nest site choice (preference based on egg and nest similarity), and the hypothesis described above, habitat selection. Although the preponderance of evidence seems to be in favor of the habitat selection hypothesis, some evidence for natal philopatry has been observed in cuckoos and the majority of cuckoo eggs are found in nests and among eggs matching their foster species, which supports the nest site choice hypothesis, but does not invalidate any of the other hypotheses. It could also be the case that there is more than one mechanism of host selection at play here. In their 1997 study, Teuschl et al. suggest the possibility of a hierarchal decision process consisting of 3 steps: 1) upon returning from their spring migration the female cuckoos go back to the approximate location of their birthplace, which should increase the likelihood of them finding a familiar habitat, 2) choosing a suitable habitat based on habitat imprinting, 3) choosing a suitable nest within that habitat.

She is the author of several books, including Death Without Weeping: the Violence of Everyday Life in Brazil (UC Press); Saints, Scholars and Schizophrenics: Mental Illness in Ireland (UC Press, in three editions); Commodifying Bodies (UK Sage) with Loic Wacquant; Violence in War and Peace (Wiley-Blackwell) with Philippe Bourgois; and, most recently, Violence in the Urban Margins (Oxford University Press), with P. Bourgois and J. Auyero. Scheper-Hughes has conducted anthropological fieldwork in Northeast Brazil, Argentina, Israel, South Africa, Moldova, the Philippines and the U.S. As founding director of Organs Watch, she is a consultant on human trafficking for organs for the E.U., Interpol, U.N. Office on Human Trafficking and the Vatican. She has testified (pro bono) in several prosecutions of human traffickers. She was a witness to the organ trade that brought Israeli kidney patients from Israel, Europe and New York City to Durban, South Africa and ‚Äòkidney sellers‚Äô from impoverished communities in Recife. In her early investigations of an international ring of brokers and their living organ sellers based in New York, New Jersey and Israel led to a number of arrests by the FBI. Career Scheper-Hughes' first book, Saints, Scholars and Schizophrenics: Mental Illness in Rural Ireland (1979), was a study of madness among bachelor farmers, and won the Margaret Mead Award from the Society for Applied Anthropology in 1980. The book established Scheper-Hughes‚Äô ability to provoke controversy through her writing. Especially in Ireland, many readers took umbrage at her portrayal of the disintegration of rural Irish family life due to the collapse of the agrarian economy. In the 20th anniversary edition of the book, Scheper-Hughes provided an update on the transitions the community was undergoing at the time of her original research. She also discussed the challenges and ethics of ethnography, issues that are pushed to the fore as anthropologists increasingly work in communities that can read and critique their work. In her subsequent book Death without Weeping: The Violence of Everyday life in Brazil (1993), she discusses the violence between mothers refusing to care for their sickly children. Once again, her work had many critics, both inside and outside Brazil, given its depiction of women forced by horrific circumstances to ration their love and favor towards infants and toddlers who seemed to have the best chance of survival, and (even more controversial) her description of mothers \\"collaborating\\" and \\"hastening\\" the deaths of infants thought to be lacking a will (desejo), a knack (jeito), or a taste (gosto) for life. Death without Weeping has become something of a classic within the field of medical anthropology. In addition to her full- length monographs, Scheper-Hughes has published on AIDS/HIV in Brazil and Cuba, human rights, death squads, apartheid and shanty town violence in South Africa, and sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, coining or popularizing such terms as the \\"mindful body\\" (1987, with Margaret Lock), \\"political economy of the emotions\\" (1993a), \\"life boat ethics\\" (1993b), \\"neo-cannibalism\\" (2001), \\"sexual citizenship\\" (1994b), the \\"genocidal continuum\\", \\"militant anthropology\\" and anthropology \\"with its feet on the ground\\" (1995). One of the central themes unifying Scheper-Hughes‚Äô scholarship is how violence comes to mark the bodies of the vulnerable, poor, and disenfranchised with a terrifying intimacy. Her work in Latin America, South Africa, Ireland, and Eastern Europe traces the insidious invisibility of everyday violence, which often makes the vulnerable and exploited into their own wardens and executioners. Besides her own original research she has helped disseminate the work of scholars such as radical Italian psychiatrist Franco Basaglia, Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, and the Brazilian physician and radical ecologist Josu√© de Castro, to a wider North American audience. Special Interests Critical Medical Anthropology, the anthropology of violence, madness and culture, inequality and marginality, childhood and the family, Ireland, Brazil, Cuba, South Africa. International activism Scheper-Hughes served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Brazil in the 1960s. She has worked as an activist and with social movements in Brazil (in defense of rural workers, against death squads, and for the rights of street children) in the United States (as a civil rights worker and as a Catholic Worker Scheper-Hughes, 2017. ‚ÄúAnthropologist as Court Jester: Civil Disobedience and the People‚Äôs Caf√©‚Äù Boom California.

Organ trade In 1999, Scheper-Hughes joined with three other professors to launch Organs Watch, an organization dedicated to research on the global traffic in human organs, tracking the movements of people and organs around the globe, as well as the global inequities that facilitate this trade.Organs Watch (archived)Department of Public Affairs at UC Berkeley, 3 November 1999, press release In October 2008, she appeared on the BBC program HARDtalkBBC, HARDtalk, 28 October 2008, Nancy Scheper-Hughes expressing her strong opposition to the open free buying and selling of organs, even if there were Government oversight through regulation. Her reason for this position is that she feels it will eventually corrupt the entire field because of the inevitability of brokers engaging in satisfying the demands of wealthy buyers for higher quality donors. She is opposed to the Iranian government's regulated organ donor program, involving cash rewards, and predicts it will fail. Her preference is for free voluntary donations from family or friends. She has characterized the efforts of patients waiting for an organ transplant to save their lives through purchasing a replacement organ from a volunteer as just \\"a new form of commodity fetishism.\\"Nancy Scheper-Hughes, \\"Rotten Trade, Millennial Capitalism, Human Values and Global Justice in Organs Trafficking,\\" Journal of Human Rights, vol. 2, p. 198 (2003) She deplores the fact that to the dying patients waiting for a transplant, \\"in the late or postmodern consumer-oriented context, the ancient prescription for virtue in suffering and grace in dying can only appear patently absurd.\\"Scheper-Hughes (2003:200) She recommends instead that the now lethally long waiting lists for organ transplants be trimmed by questioning \\"the rights of infants and those over 70 to be on the waiting list.\\"Scheper-Hughes (2003:221) However, in 2010, Nancy Scheper-Hughes already supported legal compensation for organ donations. She also says that compensations are already paid in the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù sense. Behind this lies the desperation due to shortage of organ donations.Transplantation in the USA: The Shortage of Available Organs and Public Health Policy , Jonathan A. Winston, M.D., Program Chair, April 19, 2010, Kidney & Urology Foundation of America. In the 2000s, Scheper-Hughes investigated an international ring of organ sellers based in New York, New Jersey and Israel. She interviewed several hundred third-world organ donors, and reported that they all felt that they had been taken advantage of, and were often left sick, unable to work, and unable to get medical care. Some of them were tricked into donating organs, and threatened at gunpoint when they tried to resist. Some transplants took place at major New York City hospitals, and Scheper-Hughes said that the hospital personnel knew illegal transplants were taking place. She informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which led to arrests several years later.Michael Daly: Anthropologist's 'Dick Tracy moment' plays role in arrest of suspected kidney trafficker, Michael Daley, New York Daily News, July 24, 2009The Brian Lehrer Show, Illegal Organ Trafficking, Friday, July 24, 2009 When the events became public, she said that much of the world's illicit traffic in kidneys could be traced to Israel. In a 2008 lecture, she is reported as identifying two motivations of Israeli traffickers as \\"greed\\" and \\"Revenge, restitution‚Äîreparation for the Holocaust.\\" She is reported as describing speaking with Israeli brokers who told her \\"it‚Äôs kind of ‚Äòan eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. We‚Äôre going to get every single kidney and liver and heart that we can.

Design and development Fuji Heavy Industries was established in July 1952 as a successor to Nakajima, and undertook licensed production of the Beech T-34 trainer aircraft as its first product. This was used by Fuji for the development of the Fuji LM-1 Nikko which was a four-seat liaison aircraft powered by a 225 hp Continental O-470 engine, with introduction of a more powerful 340 hp Lycoming O-480 engine resulting in redesignation as the LM-2, with both the LM-1 and LM-2 being used by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. The KM was a four-seat civil version of the LM-1, fitted with the more powerful Lycoming engine that was later used by the LM-2.

O'Sullivan subsequently returned to Kenmare and took a part time teaching post in Scoil Ghobnatan in Ballyvourney, teaching Geography to the students and, in recent years, becoming a guidance counsellor. He has also run an award-winning restaurant and a bar in Kenmare town. O'Sullivan married Marian King in 1977 and together they have two children ‚Äì √âamonn (born 1979) and Bryan born (1982). Playing career=Club O'Sullivan played his club football with his local club in Kenmare and enjoyed much success. At underage level O'Sullivan won a Towns Cup title in 1968, before later winning three intermediate county championships in 1968, 1970 and 1972. While O'Sullivan cherished these victories, much more was to follow at senior level. In 1972 O'Sullivan won a Kerry County Football League Division 1 title. Two years later he lined out in his first county championship final. North Kerry divisional side Shannon Rangers provided the opposition on that occasion. Kenmare ended the game as champions and O'Sullivan picked up a county winners' medal. It was also the club's first triumph in this grade. After surrendering their title in 1975, Kenmare were back in the county championship final the following year. O'Sullivan's side were trounced by Austin Stacks on a scoreline of 1‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì7. It was a defeat that would take a large toll on the club's hopes of further county titles. In 1987 O'Sullivan was entering the twilight of his club football career. Nevertheless he was still a key member of the Kenmare team that reached a third county final. Dr. Crokes of Killarney were the opponents. Kenmare triumphed and O'Sullivan added a second and final county winners' medal to his collection. Minor and under-21 O'Sullivan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry minor football team in 1970. That year he lined out in the minor provincial decider against Cork. The Kerrymen recorded a comprehensive victory, giving O'Sullivan a Munster winners' medal in the minor grade. Kerry later booked their place in the All-Ireland final against Galway. In a tense encounter both sides finished level and a replay was required. That game was also a close affair with the result remaining in doubt right up until the final whistle. In the end O'Sullivan's side were defeated by a single point as Galway took the title.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 144 O'Sullivan later joined the Kerry under-21 team where he also enjoyed some success at the highest levels of that grade. In 1972 he missed Kerry's provincial decider triumph, however, he returned in time for the clash against Galway in the All-Ireland final. Both sides gave admirable displays but Galway came away with the victory, scoring two key goals making the final score read 2‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì7 in favour of the Connacht team.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 156 In 1973 O'Sullivan's side reached the provincial under-21 final again. A close 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì12 score line gave Kerry the win and gave O'Sullivan his first Munster winners' medal in this grade.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 162 While he had been captain for the Munster final, O'Sullivan relinquished this position for the subsequent All-Ireland showdown with Mayo. Goals cost Kerry the final the previous year, however, the team had learned from their mistakes. A 2‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì13 score line gave Kerry the win and gave O'Sullivan an All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal. Senior By this stage O'Sullivan had established himself on the Kerry senior team. In 1972 Kerry reached the final of the National Football League and faced Mayo at Croke Park. Kerry had a relatively easy 2‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì9 victory and O'Sullivan claimed his first national title at senior level.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 177 He was later a non-playing substitute as Kerry went on to claim the Munster title but lose the All-Ireland final to Offaly after a draw and a replay. Two more National League titles followed for O'Sullivan in 1973 and 1974, however, archrivals Cork claimed the Munster title in both years. Things began to change in 1975 as Mick O'Dwyer took over as Kerry manager and O'Sullivan was appointed captain for the year. While 'the Kingdom' had played second fiddle to Cork over the previous two years, O'Sullivan's side smashed 'the Rebels' in that year's Munster final. A huge 1‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì7 scoreline gave Kerry the win and gave O'Sullivan his first Munster title on the field of play.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 140 The Kenmare man later lined out in his first senior All-Ireland final. Reigning champions Dublin provided the opposition and were installed as the red-hot favourites over the youngest Kerry team of all-time. On a rain-soaked day John Egan and substitute Ger O'Driscoll scored two goals and 'the Dubs' were ambushed by 2‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì11.The GAA Book of Lists p. 403 In spite of claiming the championship the final was a disappointing affair for O'Sullivan as he became the only All-Ireland winning captain since the Sam Maguire Cup was first presented not to collect the famous trophy. He was knocked unconscious seventeen minutes into the first-half and woke up in a Dublin hospital when the match was long finished. O'Sullivan was awarded his only All Star award at the end of the year. In 1976 O'Sullivan captured his second Munster title following a draw and a replay with Cork. A second consecutive All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed as Kerry faced Dublin once again. New 'Dub' Kevin Moran was causing havoc with the Kerry defence. Immediately after the game started he careered through the Kerry half-back and full-back lines but his shot at goal went wide. This set the pace for the rest of the match. John McCarthy finished a five-man move to score Dublin's first goal of the day. A converted penalty by Jimmy Keaveney was followed by a third goal from Brian Mullins.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 403‚Äì404 Kerry surrendered their All-Ireland title as Dublin prevailed by 3‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì10. Following the 1976 defeat O'Sullivan took a break from the game because of a loss of form. He lived in the United States for a year before returning to Ireland at the end of 1977. By 1978 O'Sullivan was back as a member of the Kerry senior football panel. He played just a few championship games over the next few years because he was unable to hold down a regular place on what was quickly becoming the greatest football team of all-time. O'Sullivan was a non-playing substitute as Kerry won another set of Munster and All-Ireland titles again in 1978. He opted out of the game again in 1979 but returned in 1980 to win another pair of Munster and All-Ireland medals as a non-playing substitute once again. O'Sullivan retired from inter-county football at the end of 1980. Inter-provincial O'Sullivan also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. He was first called up for Munster duty in 1975 and lined out at left wing- forward in the final against Ulster. Munster went on a goal-scoring spree that day and secured a remarkable 6‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì15 victory. It was O'Sullivan's first Railway Cup winners' medal. In 1976 O'Sullivan was appointed captain of Munster for the inter-pro series. A defeat of Ulster set up a clash with Leinster in the final. Once again, the southern province proved too strong and a 2‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì8 score line gave O'Sullivan a second consecutive Railway Cup medal. Managerial career=Kerry In late 1989 O'Sullivan had the unenviable task of succeeding the great Mick O'Dwyer as manager of the Kerry senior football side. Not only that but he also took charge of the Kerry under-21 football team. While under O'Dwyer, Kerry had won eleven provincial titles in twelve years. Cork were the dominant force in the province as they had claimed three Munster titles in succession between 1987 and 1989. In 1990 O'Sullivan guided Kerry to a 25th consecutive provincial final showdown with Cork. In doing so he had the chance to stop the 'Rebels' from completing a record four-in-a-row in Munster. The game turned into a disaster from a Kerry viewpoint. An embarrassing 2‚Äì23 to 1‚Äì11 scoreline resulted in one of Kerry's biggest ever defeats at the hands of Cork.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 141 O'Sullivan's under-21 team fared much better in their championship. A 2‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of Cork gave Kerry the provincial under-21 title after a one-year absence. An All-Ireland final showdown with Tyrone soon followed. A high-scoring game developed over the course of the hour, however, Kerry had far too much firepower in terms of goal-scoring ability. A 5‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì11 scoreline gave Kerry the win and a first All-Ireland under-21 title as manager to O'Sullivan. In 1991 O'Sullivan's senior footballers bounced back after a five-year provincial drought. A narrow 0‚Äì23 to 3‚Äì12 defeat of Limerick gave Kerry the Munster title for the first time since 1986 and restored some respect to the county team. While in other years Kerry would have forged ahead and contested the All-Ireland decider, a two-point defeat by Down in the semi- final saw O'Sullivan's side exit the championship at the penultimate stage.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 124 The dual manager enjoyed a bumper season as the Kerry under-21 team retained their provincial title with a narrow 1‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì10 defeat of Cork. There would be no fairytale ending, however, as the Kerry under-21 team were trounced by Tyrone in the All-Ireland decider. 1992 saw O'Sullivan manage Kerry for the final time. While the Kerry under-21 footballers claimed a third Munster title in a row, they were later beaten in the All-Ireland semi-final. O'Sullivan's senior footballers also reached a third consecutive provincial decider, this time as reigning champions. Minnows Clare provided the opposition as Kerry were installed as the red-hot favourites to retain the title. The form book was torn up, however, as Clare emerged victorious on a scoreline of 2‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì12. It was their second provincial title and a first since 1917. Following this defeat O'Sullivan resigned as manager of both the Kerry senior and under-21 teams. Colaiste Ghobnatan O'Sullivan, who has taught in the school for many years, has also been a coach to the Gaelic football team. He has proven a great asset to the team, and led the 2008 team to glory in securing a place in the All-Ireland Senior Vocational Schools semi-final. Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful in their bid for glory, as they had a close loss against Granard. In 2014 he coached Colaiste Ghobnatan to success in the inaugural All Ireland Post Primary C Final with a victory over Ardee Community School.http://munster.gaa.ie/2014/04/05/masita-gaa-all-ireland-post-primary- schools-dr-eamonn-osullivan-cup-senior-c-football-final-colaiste-ghobnatan- baile-bhuirne-cork-v-ardee-cs-louth/ Limerick In October 2005 O'Sullivan took over as manager of the Limerick senior football team. O'Sullivan's first championship game was a success as his new charges defeated Clare in the Munster quarter-final. The momentum from this game was short-lived as Limerick were subsequently beaten by Cork in what has been described as one of the worst games of football ever played. Limerick's next match was a meeting with Westmeath in the qualifiers. O'Sullivan's side lost narrowly by 0‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì9. O'Sullivan's second season in charge was an unhappy one. The team's opening game in the Munster championship quarter-final resulted in a 2‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì7 trouncing by Cork. The qualifiers beckoned for Limerick once again. Louth provided the opposition, however, for the second year in succession O'Sullivan's side were beaten by a single point and exited the All-Ireland hunt. A third season in charge in 2008 saw the Limerick team improve. A Munster quarter-final win over Tipperary set up a semi-final meeting with Cork. O'Sullivan's side were minutes away from a provincial final as Cork trailed by three points with very little time remaining. The Leesiders somehow grabbed two quick goals which changed the game completely and resulted in another narrow Limerick loss. A remarkable 4‚Äì12 to 4‚Äì3 trouncing of Meath in the qualifiers gave Limerick the chance to advance to the second round of the series where Kildare were next up. Limerick were defeated in a close game as Kildare won by 1‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì11. 2009 saw O'Sullivan enjoy his best season as manager of the Limerick senior footballers. After a disappointing league campaign championship, victories arrived over a fancied Tipperary side and Clare which meant Limerick qualified for a first Munster final since 2005. Cork stood in Limerick's way of a historic Munster championship win. Limerick stifled 'the Rebels' from the very start. For a time it looked as if Limerick would claim a first provincial title since 1896 but Cork, the red-hot favourites, scored key goals which saw them claim a narrow 2‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì11 victory. O'Sullivan's players took heart from this and entered the qualifiers at the final stage. A win in this game over Meath would have allowed Limerick enter the All-Ireland series for the first time in over a century. That game proved to be a difficult assignment. A narrow 1‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì9 victory for Meath saw Limerick exit the championship, however, it was a season to be proud for the Limerick footballers. 2010 saw O'Sullivan enjoy his 5th season in charge of the Limerick Senior footballers. After an impressive league campaign, Limerick qualified for the National League final where they faced Waterford and won by 1‚Äì16 to Waterford 1‚Äì14. They once again opened their championship with a victory over Clare to qualify for their 2nd Munster final in a row where they faced 2009 All-Ireland champions Kerry. It proved to be quite a close match with the result ending Kerry 1‚Äì17 to Limerick 1‚Äì14. They entered the last stage of the qualifiers where they faced the now familiar Cork. Yet once again Cork had the upper hand with the result ending 0‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì11. On 19 August 2010, O'Sullivan resigned as manager. Return to Kerry On 12 July 2011, O'Sullivan was named manager of the Kerry minor team.

Description The patent rolls comprise a register of the letters patent issued by the Crown, and sealed \\"open\\" with the Great Seal pendent, expressing the sovereign's will on a wide range of matters of public interest, including ‚Äì but not restricted to ‚Äì grants of official positions, lands, commissions, privileges and pardons, issued both to individuals and to corporations. The rolls were started in the reign of King John, under the Chancellorship of Hubert Walter. The texts of letters patent were copied onto sheets of parchment, which were stitched together (head-to-tail) into long rolls to form a roll for each year. As the volume of business grew, it became necessary to compile more than one roll for each year. The most solemn grants of lands and privileges were issued, not as letters patent, but as charters, and were entered on the separate series of Charter Rolls. This series was discontinued in 1516, and all charters issued thereafter, mainly for grants of titles, were entered on the patent rolls. The patent rolls run in an almost unbroken series from 1201 to the present day, with a small number of gaps, notably during the English Civil War and Interregnum (1641‚Äì1660). They are written almost exclusively in Latin in the early period. English was used occasionally in the 16th century, but only during the Commonwealth and after 1733 are all the entries in English. Custodial history The medieval rolls were originally stored in the Tower of London, which was the principal repository for Chancery archives. From the end of the 14th century, it became customary for the Master of the Rolls to house the more recent rolls, for convenience of access, in the Rolls Chapel, prior to their permanent transfer to the Tower. These transfers ceased at the end of the 15th century, and so the Rolls Chapel became the permanent place of deposit for all rolls from the reign of Richard III onwards. The rolls from both sites were reunited at the newly built Public Record Office in the 1850s, and they are now held at the National Archives, Kew, London, where their class reference is C 66. As of 2016, there are 5,790 rolls in the series, dating from 1201 to 2012. Patents of invention Letters patent were also issued to grant monopolies over particular industries to individuals with new techniques, and these grants were likewise copied onto the patent rolls. The system became subject to abuse in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I, and was eventually regulated by the Statute of Monopolies of 1624, the first statutory expression of English patent law. In 1853, responsibility for patents of invention was transferred to the newly established Patent Office, and they ceased to be registered on the patent rolls. Publication 3 John (1201‚Äì2), as published by the Record Commission in 1835 using record type All the medieval and early modern rolls to 1625 have been published in some form, although editorial policies and formats have varied. *1201‚Äì1216. The rolls for these years were published as abbreviated Latin texts by the Record Commission in 1835, in a large folio volume entitled Rotuli Litterarum Patentium in Turri Londinensi asservati (\\"Rolls of Letters Patent preserved in the Tower of London\\"), edited by Thomas Duffus Hardy, and later abbreviated as Pat. Roll. T.L. The publication employed a special \\"record type\\" font to produce a near-facsimile of the manuscripts. *1216‚Äì1232. The rolls for these years were published as full Latin texts (with contractions and abbreviations extended) in two volumes published in 1901 and 1903, simply entitled Patent Rolls. *1232‚Äì1509. The post-1232 rolls have not been published as full texts, but in calendar form (i.e. as comprehensive English summaries, with all significant details included). Between 1891 and 1916, 53 volumes of calendars were published, under the title Calendar of Patent Rolls, covering the years 1232 to 1509. *1509‚Äì1547. The rolls for the reign of Henry VIII (1509‚Äì47) have not been published in a stand-alone form. Their contents were, however, incorporated (in calendar form) into the series Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, published between 1862 and 1932. *1547‚Äì1582. The rolls for the years 1547‚Äì1582 were published in calendar form in 19 volumes, under the title Calendar of Patent Rolls, between 1924 and 1986. *1582‚Äì1603. In the late 1980s the Public Record Office suspended its programme of scholarly publication, and the initiative passed to the List and Index Society. Between 1990 and 1994 the Society published five volumes of \\"draft\\" calendars covering the years 1584‚Äì1589; and between 2000 and 2014 it published 30 volumes of full calendars with indexes covering the years 1582‚Äì1603. *1603‚Äì1625. Calendars and indexes of the rolls for the reign of James VI and I (1603‚Äì1625) were published by the List and Index Society in 14 volumes between 1974 and 1989. These are facsimiles (reproduced from photocopies) of contemporary 17th- century finding aids. Although of value, they do not meet modern scholarly standards of comprehensiveness or accuracy.

He played football with his local club Beale, his divisional side Shannon Rangers and was a member of the Kerry senior inter-county team from 1975 until 1987. Biography Denis 'Ogie' Moran was born in Ballybunion, County Kerry in 1956. Born into a family that had a keen interest in Gaelic games, Moran's father instilled a love of the games in his son by bringing him to matches every weekend. In 1962 he was only six years-old when he travelled to Croke Park as the mascot to the Kerry team that captured the All-Ireland title. Moran was educated at the local national school and later boarded at the famous Franciscan College in Gormanston, County Meath. Here his football skills came to the fore and he became a key member of the college senior team that captured three Leinster colleges' titles in-a-row between 1972 and 1974. In 1973, Moran's side reached the final of the All-Ireland series. St. Michael's College from Enniskillen provided the opposition on that occasion and a close game developed. At the end of the hours the Franciscan's had won the day by 1-8 to 1-6 and Moran picked up an All-Ireland colleges' winners' medal. Moran is now based in Tralee and currently works as a regional officer with Shannon Development. His son, David, followed in 'Ogie's' footsteps and, after playing with the Kerry minor team in 2006, he subsequently joined the senior team. Playing career=Club Moran played his club football and hurling with a host of different clubs throughout the 1970s and 1980s. As a footballer he enjoyed much success with his local club Beale and as a member of the Shannon Rangers divisional side. Moran was also regarded as a hurler of note, lining out with the famous Ballyduff side in the northern part of the county. As a key member of the Beale senior football team, Moran helped his team to seven North Kerry divisional titles between 1977 and 1989. This included Beale's very first divisional title in 1977, the first of a famous three-in-a-row. As a hurler, Moran captured numerous North Kerry divisional titles. He also claimed the ultimate honour by winning a county senior championship winners' medal. It was with divisional side Shannon Rangers, however, that Moran enjoyed the ultimate success in terms of club football in Kerry. In 1972, he was only sixteen years-old when he was picked for the team. Rangers reached the final of the County Senior Championship that year, with Mid Kerry providing the opposition. A victory on that occasion gave Moran a county winners' medal. Five years later Moran lined out in his second county final, this time with nearby rivals Feale Rangers providing the opposition. Another victory followed on that occasion, giving the Beale club man a second and final county winners' medal. Minor and under-21 Moran first came to prominence on the inter-county scene in the early 1970s as member of the Kerry minor football team. It was an unhappy time for the Kingdom as archrivals Cork dominated the provincial minor championship for the early part of the decade. Moran's performances at minor level made him an automatic inclusion on the Kerry under-21 team in 1975. He captured a Munster title in that grade that same year following a nine-point trouncing of Waterford in the provincial decider. Moran's side later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Dublin providing the opposition. It would be the first of many battles between the two sides over the course of the next decade. A 1-15 to 0-10 score line gave Kerry the victory and gave Moran an All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal. In 1976, Moran made it two Munster under-21 titles in-a-row as Kerry easily retained their provincial crown at the expense of Cork. He later lined out in a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Kildare provided the opposition on that occasion; however, they were no match for Kerry, as Ogie collected a second All-Ireland winners' medal following a 0-14 to 1-3 victory. Moran captured a third provincial under-21 title in 1977 following a two-goal defeat of Cork. Kerry later qualified for a third consecutive All-Ireland final with Down providing the opposition. A 1-11 to 1-5 score line gave Kerry the victory and gave Moran a third All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal in-a-row. Senior By this stage Moran was also a key member of Kerry's senior football team. In 1975, he captured his first Munster Championship and All-Ireland medals at senior level, under the new management of the legendary Mick O'Dwyer. In 1976, he won his second Munster title; however, Dublin gained revenge for the previous year by defeating Kerry in the All-Ireland final. 1977 was another frustrating year as Kerry won another Munster title but lost out to Dublin yet again, this time in a thrilling All-Ireland semi-final. In 1978, Moran was captain of his native county and Kerry were primed for success. They easily won another Munster title and breezed into the All-Ireland final to face Dublin. The game itself is remembered for Mikey Sheehy's cheeky goal which he scored by lobbing the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen. The final score was 5-11 to 0-9 and Moran had secured a second All-Ireland medal. In 1979, Kerry once again faced up to Dublin in the All-Ireland final. Like the previous year the men from \\"the Kingdom\\" had another emphatic victory over \\"the Dubs\\", and Moran claimed his third All-Ireland medal. Victories for Kerry over Roscommon and Offaly in the respective All-Ireland finals of 1980 and 1981 brought Moran's All-Ireland medal tally up to five. In 1982 he collected his eighth consecutive Munster Championship medal and the scene was set for Kerry to become the first team in the history of the game to win five All-Ireland football titles in-a-row. Once again, Moran‚Äôs side faced Offaly in the All-Ireland final. Kerry had the upper hand for much of the game and were leading by two points with two minutes left to be played. The game, however, was not over as Offaly substitute S√©amus Darby, who had entered the game almost unnoticed, produced possibly the greatest match-winner of all-time when he scored a late goal. Kerry failed to score again to level the match and Offaly went on to win their third All- Ireland title ever. In 1983, Kerry were denied a record-breaking ninth Munster title in-a-row by Cork. Moran's side were down but not out, as they reclaimed the provincial title the following year, before securing back-to-back All- Ireland victories over their old rivals Dublin in 1984 and 1985. In 1986, he collected his third All-Ireland title in-a-row with an 8-point victory over Tyrone. It was his eighth All-Ireland medal overall. Moran also enjoyed playing Railway Cup football with Munster, winning inter-provincial titles in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1982. His honours also include three National Football Leagues in 1977, 1982 and 1984 and one All Stars Awards. Moran also played hurling for a short period with his native county. In 1974, he won a 'Special All-Ireland' hurling medal for weaker counties when Kerry defeated Westmeath in the final. Managerial career ;Kerry Moran was appointed manager of Kerry‚Äôs senior team for the 1993 Championship. His tenure as manager was not a successful one, as Billy Morgan's Cork team were the kingpins of Munster at the time. Moran was replaced as manager by P√°id√≠ √ì S√© at the end of 1995. ;Kerins O'Rahilly's In 2009, Moran took over from Jack O'Connor as Kerins O'Rahilly's manager. Records In all Moran collected eleven Munster Championship medals. He played in ten All-Ireland finals, ending up on the winning side on eight occasions. His record haul of All- Ireland medals is a record that he shares with fellow Kerrymen Pat Spillane, P√°id√≠ √ì S√©, Ger Power and Mikey Sheehy. Moran, however, stands apart as the only player to win these eight medals playing in the one position. Furthermore, Moran was the only member of the Kerry team to have played every single minute in those eight victorious All-Ireland finals. These records have not been equalled since and may never be equalled. Family Ogie's son David Moran played with Kerry in the 2006 All-Ireland Minor Football Championship final, and is a current player with the county in the All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship. He was added to the Kerry senior squad for the 2008 National Football League and appeared in the first three games against Donegal, Tyrone and Derry.

In justifying the boycott, the resolution stated that Israeli academic institutions not only failed to oppose ‚Äúthe occupation and racial discrimination against Palestinians in Israel‚Äù but rather charged that they are ‚Äúdirectly and indirectly complicit in the systematic maintenance of the occupation and of policies and practices that discriminate against Palestinian students and scholars throughout Palestine and in Israel.‚Äù The resolution also claimed that Israeli academic institutions are \\"deeply complicit in Israel‚Äôs violations of international law and human rights and in its denial of the right to education and academic freedom to Palestinians.\\"For first time, US academic group boycotts Israel by Raphael Ahren, Times of Israel, April 25, 2013.

When widespread vaccination is used, the risk for an unvaccinated pregnant patient to be exposed to a related infection is low, allowing for postponement, in general, of routine vaccinations to the postpartum period. Nevertheless, immunization during pregnancy may occur either inadvertently, or be indicated in a special situation, when it appears prudent to reduce the risk of a specific disease for a potentially exposed pregnant woman or her fetus. As a rule of thumb the vaccination with live virus or bacteria is contraindicated in pregnancy. Live attenuated bacterial vaccine BCG vaccine is used against tuberculosis and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Inactivated bacterial vaccine Inactivated bacterial vaccine is used during pregnancy for women who have a specific risk of exposure and disease. Vaccination against pneumococcus or meningococcus infections, or typhoid fever show no confirmed side effects regarding the fetus, however data are limited. Children under 2 or those who spend time in groups of children (for example in day care or nursery) can be at higher risk of catching pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal disease can cause serious illnesses such as pneumonia and meningitis. A review looking at the pneumococcal vaccine in pregnancy found that there was not enough research to say that this vaccination reduced the number of babies developing pneumococcal disease. Pregnant women, babies and infants are at risk of serious problems from the influenza (flu) virus. A review into haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) and viral influenza found one good piece of research that showed the flu vaccine reduced the number of women and babies who caught flu. Hib can cause bacterial meningitis and pneumonia. There was not enough research found in the review to show whether giving the Hib vaccine reduced the number of mothers and babies with Hib. More research is needed. Hepatitis B (Hep B) is a liver infection which can be passed from mother to baby at birth and can often be passed to children under 5 from other infected children. Healthy adults who catch Hep B often recover but babies and children are much more likely to develop chronic (life-long) Hep B. Chronic Hep B can result in liver cancer. It is much more common in low income countries. It has been suggested that vaccinating mothers against Hep B in pregnancy may reduce the risk of the baby becoming infected. At the moment, there is not enough research to show that the Hep B vaccination is safe in pregnancy. More research is needed. Data regarding anthrax vaccination during pregnancy are very limited but show no confirmed effect on the fetus. Toxoids Tetanus toxoids appear safe during pregnancy and are administered in many countries of the world to prevent neonatal tetanus. The World Health Organization(WHO) states more than 180,000 newborns die and over 30,000 women die each year from tetanus. Neonatal tetanus is usually passed to the baby via unsterile instruments being used to cut the umbilical cord or other unclean practices at delivery. The tetanus vaccine (tetanus toxoid) has shown to be successful in preventing babies from developing tetanus and deaths from tetanus. It is recommended by the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists(ACOG) the following schedule for pregnant women to receive the vaccine-- *Schedule if never immunized: three doses in 0, 4, and 6‚Äì12 months *Schedule if unknown immunization: at least two doses** in the late second or third trimester. The National Business Group on Health (NBGH) states an analysis of pregnant women who received at least two doses had 98% effectiveness of the tetanus vaccine(NBGH, 2011). *Not administered in pregnancy: a dose in postpartum period **One of the doses during pregnancy should be the Tdap** (ACOG, 2012).

He took part in the winter Siege of Osaka, assisting the hard-pressed forces of Satake Yoshinobu. In the summer siege the following year, he was defeated in Sanada Yukimura's counterattack. Soon after the siege, Yasukatsu died at 26 of a bad case of hemorrhoids. After Yasukatsu's death his son Tadatsugu succeeded him; Tadatsugu's only son Katsumasa became a hatamoto. Both Yasukatsu and his father Yasumasa are playable characters from the Eastern Army in the original Kessen. References *Naramoto, Tatsuya (1992). Nihon no kassen: Monoshiri jiten.

Simple schematic of the production of cloud streets by horizontal convective rolls. Lines of clouds streets stretch from north-west to south-east in this natural-colour satellite view of New England. Horizontal convective rolls, also known as horizontal roll vortices or cloud streets, are long rolls of counter-rotating air that are oriented approximately parallel to the ground in the planetary boundary layer. Although horizontal convective rolls, also known as cloud streets, have been clearly seen in satellite photographs for the last 30 years, their development is poorly understood, due to a lack of observational data. From the ground, they appear as rows of cumulus or cumulus-type clouds aligned parallel to the low- level wind. Research has shown these eddies to be significant to the vertical transport of momentum, heat, moisture, and air pollutants within the boundary layer. Cloud streets are usually more or less straight; rarely, cloud streets assume paisley patterns when the wind driving the clouds encounters an obstacle. Those cloud formations are known as von K√°rm√°n vortex streets.  Characteristics  Horizontal rolls are counter-rotating vortex rolls that are nearly aligned with the mean wind of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). They can be caused by convection in the presence of a moderate wind and/or dynamic inflection point instabilities in the mean wind profile. Early theory on the features predict that the vortices may be aligned up to 30¬∞ to the left for stably stratified environments, 18¬∞ to the left for neutral environments, and nearly parallel to the mean wind for unstably stratified (convective) environments. This theory has been supported by aircraft observations from several field experiments. The depth of a vortex is usually the depth of the boundary layer, which is generally on the order of 1‚Äì2 km. A vortex pair usually has a lateral to vertical dimension ratio of around 3:1. Experimental studies have shown that the aspect ratio (a ratio of roll wavelength to boundary layer depth) has been found to vary between 2:1 and 6:1, however, in some situations, the aspect ratio may be as large as 10:1. The lifetime of a convective roll can last from hours to days. If the environmental air is near saturation, condensation may occur in updrafts produced from the vortex rotation. The sinking motion produced between alternating pairs of rolls will evaporate clouds. This, combined with the updrafts, will produce rows of clouds. Glider pilots often use the updrafts produced by cloud streets enabling them to fly straight for long distances, hence the name ‚Äúcloud streets‚Äù.  Development and required environmental conditions  The exact process that leads to the formation of horizontal rolls is complicated. The basic stress mechanism in the PBL is turbulent flux of momentum, and this term must be approximated in the fluid dynamic equations of motion in order to model the Ekman layer flow and fluxes. The linear approximation, the eddy diffusivity equation with an eddy diffusion coefficient K, allowed Ekman to obtain a simple logarithmic spiral solution. However the frequent presence of the horizontal roll vortices in the PBL, which represent an organization of the turbulence (coherent structures), indicate that the diffusivity approximation is not adequate. Ekman's solution has an intrinsic inflectional wind profile that was found to be unstable to long waves corresponding to the organized large vortices scale. The nonlinear theory showed that the growth of these finite perturbation waves modifies the mean flow, eliminating the dynamic inflectional instability energy so that equilibrium is obtained. The modified mean flow corresponds well with observations. This solution for the layer containing the PBL-scale roll wavelength requires a modification of the flux transports to accommodate modeling of the advective motion of the large vortices. The most favorable conditions for the formation of the rolls occur when the lowermost layer of air is unstable, but is capped by an inversion-by a stable layer of air. There must be a moderate wind. This often occurs when upper air is subsiding, such as under anticyclonic conditions, and is also frequently found when radiation fog has formed overnight. Convection occurs below the inversion, with air rising in thermals below the clouds and sinking in the air between the streets. Turbulent energy derived from dynamic instabilities is produced from wind shear energy. Higher wind favors this roll development while convective energy modifies it. Convection in the presence of low speed produces rolls as instability growth in shear is suppressed. Convection in very low wind environments generally produce cellular convection. Although this solution has been verified with numerous observations, it is complicated, involving Chaos Theory mathematics, and has not been widely used. However, when incorporated into the NCEP forecast models using satellite surface wind data, it significantly improved the forecasts. The nonlinear solution, with explicit description of the finite perturbation coherent structure rolls constitutes a significant contribution to the theory of Chaos for organization of turbulence.

Coupled with this was Anderson's idea that \\"every fact (which includes every ‚Äúobject‚Äù) is a complex situation: there are no simples, no atomic facts, no objects which cannot be, as it were, expanded into facts.\\" Prominent players included Anderson, David Malet Armstrong, J. L. Mackie, Ullin Place, J. J. C. Smart, and David Stove. The label \\"Australian realist\\" was conferred on acolytes of Anderson by A. J. Baker in 1986, to mixed approval from those realist philosophers who happened to be Australian. David Malet Armstrong \\"suggested, half-seriously, that 'the strong sunlight and harsh brown landscape of Australia force reality upon us'\\".Monash University - A History of Australasian Philosophy  Origins  Australian realism began after John Anderson accepted the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sydney in 1927. His students included philosophers such as John Passmore, J. L. Mackie, David Stove, Eugene Kamenka and David Malet Armstrong. Anderson viewed philosophy historically as a long argument beginning with Thales. Anderson proposed that there was nothing more to being than the spatio-temporal system and that a correct and coherent view of the world involved not only rejecting any sort of deity, but also the extraordinary entities postulated by so many philosophers, from at least the time of Plato to the present day. Independently from the Andersonians, in Adelaide during the 1950s, the mind‚Äìbrain identity theory was being developed by two former students of Gilbert Ryle, J. J. C. Smart (then Chair of Philosophy at the University of Adelaide) and Ullin Place.  Basic tenets  (1) All entities exist in spatio-temporal 'situations'. 'Situations' are all that exist. All situations have the same ontological status. There are no 'levels' of reality. (2) All situations have a propositional form ‚Äî that is, all situations have the form of \\"A is B\\". (3) Reality is infinitely complex and plural. Every fact (which includes every ‚Äúobject‚Äù) is a complex situation: there are no simples, no atomic facts, no objects which cannot be expanded into facts. (4) All situations exist independent of knowledge of them. (5) Determinism: all entities ‚Äî objects, events, situations ‚Äî are caused. (6) Ethics is concerned with establishing and describing what is Good. This is a positive science. It is not normative.Jeffery, Ren√©e, \\"Australian Realism\\", Remembering Hedley, ANU E Press, 2008  See also  *Analytic philosophy *Australian philosophy *Logical positivism  References External links *Australian Realism *D.

He represented the Quebec Liberal Party during all his political career. Despr√©s studied at the Universit√© Laval and obtained a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1982. He would become the director of the Fishing Industry Association of Quebec. Despr√©s jumped into politics in 1985 and became the new MNA for the Quebec City riding of Limoulou as the Liberal Party led by Robert Bourassa defeated the Parti Qu√©b√©cois. He would be re- elected in 1989 before temporarily halting his political career prior to the 1994 elections. Between 1994 and 1998 he was a consultant in management and a councilor at the Department of Canadian Heritage.

The ship was sold to the Victorian Public Works Department at the end of the war, who renamed her Rip and used her as a maintenance ship. In 1984, she was purchased by Whyalla City Council, who put her on display as a landlocked museum ship in 1987. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including Whyalla) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Whyalla was laid down by Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd at Whyalla, South Australia on 24 July 1940. The corvette was launched on 12 May 1941 by Lady Barclay-Harvey, wife of the Governor of South Australia, and commissioned on 8 January 1942. Whyalla was the first ship built by the Whyalla shipyard.Whyalla > History 1940‚Äì1960 Accessed 17 September 2013. The ship was originally to be named Glenelg, for the city of Glenelg, South Australia. That name was later used by another Bathurst-class vessel. Operational history=RAN In 1942, the corvette worked supporting convoys off the south eastern Australian coast, and was in Sydney Harbour during the Japanese midget submarine attack of 31 May 1942. 12 days later, Whyalla was escorting a southbound convoy when the freighter Guatemala was torpedoed and sunk by Japanese submarine I-21, the only ship to be lost in a convoy escorted by Whyalla. In December 1942, the corvette was assigned to New Guinea, where she performed convoy escort, hydrographic survey work, and was involved in the leadup to the battle of Buna-Gona. On 2 January 1943, Whyalla and two small Australian survey ships, Stella and Polaris, were attacked by Japanese dive-bombers while in McLaren Harbour, Cape Nelson, New Guinea. The corvette received minor damage from near-misses, with two crew injured by shrapnel. The corvette continued survey work until relieved by sister ship Shepparton in April 1943. Whyalla proceeded to Milne Bay, and was present when the anchorage was attacked by a force of approximately 100 Japanese aircraft. Again, Whyalla was not seriously damaged, and the corvette assisted sister ships Kapunda and Wagga in the rescue and salvage effort. Whyalla returned to Australia for refits in June 1943, and on completion was assigned to convoy duty off Australia's east coast, where she remained until February 1944. Between February and June, she was involved in anti-submarine patrols off Sandy Cape, then was again assigned to New Guinea. In December 1944, Whyalla was one of nine Australian Bathursts assigned to the British Pacific Fleet's 21st Minesweeping Flotilla. Whyalla spent the rest of the war performing minesweeping, escort, and anti-submarine duties with the British Pacific Fleet, as well as participating in the occupation of Okinawa from March to May 1944, and entering a short refit in June 1944. Following the conclusion of World War II, Whyalla spent a short time operating in Hong Kong before returning to Brisbane in October 1945. She was decommissioned on 16 May 1946. The corvette received three battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì45\\", \\"New Guinea 1942‚Äì44\\", and \\"Okinawa 1945\\". Civilian service Whyalla was sold to the Victorian Public Works Department on 10 February 1947. The corvette was modified for civilian service, renamed Rip, and towed to Melbourne, where she entered service as a lighthouse maintenance vessel at the entrance to Port Phillip Bay. The ship was in service until 1984, and was to be sold for scrap. Maritime museum When the Whyalla City Council learned that the corvette was to be scrapped, they negotiated to purchase the ship. Whyalla was purchased for A$5,000 and sailed back to Whyalla with a volunteer crew of 11 and under her own steam in late 1984. The corvette was located in her launching slipway until April 1987, when she was moved inland to become the centrepiece of the Whyalla Maritime Museum, which opened on 29 October 1988. Whyalla is one of only two Bathurst-class corvettes still in existence as museum ships; the other being HMAS Castlemaine.

The station signed on in 1965; it simulcast and continued the programming of the AM station, a daytime-only outlet. In 1966, WMVR-AM-FM was purchased by the Dean Miller Broadcasting Corporation, owned by Dean Miller, an actor and Ohio native. Before coming to Sidney, Miller had been a television personality and actor in Hollywood. He was best known for the role of Matt Henshaw on the Desilu-produced CBS sitcom December Bride from 1954‚Äì1959, co-starring with Spring Byington, Frances Rafferty, Verna Felton, and Harry Morgan. He later co-hosted the NBC daytime celebrity interview series Here's Hollywood, with Helen O'Connell, in addition to appearances on the NBC game show Your First Impression and as an occasional fill-in host for Art Linkletter's House Party on CBS. A Hamilton, Ohio, native, Miller (born Dean C. Stuhmueller, Sr.,) began his career essentially as a radio broadcaster before a by-chance meeting with some Hollywood executives who agreed to give the young Miller a chance to act. Miller graduated from Ohio State University in Columbus. Miller also hosted a talk and variety show on WLW-C television (now WCMH-TV) in the early 1960s. Miller moved the WMVR stations from their original home in the Taylor Building downtown to their present location in the summer of 1969. At that time, the stations began offering separate programming, with a full service/middle of the road format on AM and beautiful music on FM. In the 1980s, the station switched to hot adult contemporary. The AM station, which had simulcast the FM for most of the period aside from attempts at big band and news/talk formats, was closed in November 2000 after one of the towers was blown down in a storm. Dean Miller died January 13, 2004, at his home in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. His widow, Ida, owned WMVR-FM until her death on May 6, 2014; the remaining members of the Dean Miller family continue to own the station.

The type was ordered into production by the Brazilian Air Force with a more powerful 180 hp (134 kW) Lycoming O-360-A1D engine. Eighty aircraft were built originally designated the U-42 (later changed to C-42) for the utility role. First delivery occurred in February 1975.Mondey, David Encyclopedia of The World's Commercial and Private Aircraft Crescent Books, New York (1981) p. 205 Neiva developed a three-seat Air Observation Post version for the Air Force, designated the Regente 420L. Its tailcone was lowered in order to improve visibility, and it used a more powerful Continental IO-360D 210 hp engine. The aircraft was first flown in January 1967 as the YL-42. Forty were built for the Brazilian Air Force as the L-42. It had provision to carry light bombs or rockets on underwing hardpoints. Neiva also developed a four-seat civil version designated the Lanceiro. The prototype (Registered PP-ZAH) first flew in 1970, followed by production aircraft in 1973. The company's subsequent involvement with Embraer resulted in the Lanceiro's program termination.

She was principal for 50 years of the Haines Institute for Industrial and Normal Education. In 1974 Laney was posthumously selected by Governor Jimmy Carter as one of the first three African Americans honored by having their portraits installed in the Georgia State Capitol. She also was inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement. Early life Lucy Craft Laney was born free on April 13, 1854, in Macon, Georgia, 11 years before the end of slavery. It was abolished by constitutional amendment after the end of the Civil War. She was the seventh of 10 children born to Louisa and David Laney, free people who were both formerly enslaved. Her father had saved enough money to buy his freedom and that of his wife about 20 years before Lucy's birth. Both her parents were strong believers in education and were very giving to strangers; this upbringing would strongly influence Laney in her life. At the time of her birth it was illegal in Georgia for black people to learn to read. But with the help of Ms. Campbell, her parents' former enslaver's sister, Lucy learned to read at the age of four. She continued to study and attended Lewis (later Ballard) High School in Macon, Georgia, a mission school run by the American Missionary Association. In 1869 she entered the first class of Atlanta University (later Clark Atlanta University), where she prepared to be a teacher. She graduated from the school's teacher training program (the Normal Department) in 1873. Teaching career Laney worked as a teacher in Macon, Milledgeville, and Savannah, Georgia for ten years before deciding to open a school of her own. Due to health reasons, she settled in Augusta, Georgia, where she founded the city's first school for black children. Her first class in 1883 had six students, but Laney quickly attracted interest in the African- American community. By the end of the second year, the school had 234 students. With the increase in students, she needed more funding for her operation. She attended the northern Presbyterian Church Convention in 1886 in Minneapolis, Minnesota and pleaded her case there, but was initially turned down. One of the attendees, Francine E. H. Haines, later declared an interest in and donated $10,000 to Laney for the school. With this money, Laney expanded her offerings. She changed the school's name to The Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in honor of her benefactor and to indicate its goals of industrial and teacher training. The school eventually grew to encompass an entire city block of buildings. By 1928, at a time when public education was still segregated, the school's enrollment was more than 800 students. Haines Normal and Industrial Institute Cadets at the school Kindergarten class at the school Sewing class Haines Normal and Industrial Institute was a school for African Americans in Augusta, Georgia established by Lucy Craft Laney. It was named in honor of a benefactor who funded its expansion. A historical marker was added to the school site in 2009. It eventually became Lucy Craft Laney High School. Laney opened a school with a few students in 1883. She served as the school's principal. Chartered in 1886, it was expanded with a kindergarten and junior college (Lamar School of Nursing). By 1928, it had more than 800 students. The school also served as a community center. Photographs of the school were gathered by W.E.B. Du Bois and Thomas J. Calloway for the American Negro Exhibit at the Paris Exposition of 1900 (Exposition universelle internationale de 1900).https://www.loc.gov/item/2002716300/ In 1928, negotiation were engaged to have Du Bois speak at the school.https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth-oai:ff368n84t It was supported by the Presbyterian Board of National Missions.

Later in 1918 she helped to found the local chapter of the successor civil rights organization, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She was also active in other organizations to promote the welfare of blacks and black women: the Interracial Commission, and the National Association of Colored Women. She also helped to integrate the community work engaged in by the YMCA and YWCA (which had separate organizations for white and black residents, respectively).  Honors and recognition  In 1974 Governor Jimmy Carter arranged to hang the first portraits of African Americans in the Georgia state capitol to honor their contributions: included were Lucy Craft Laney, the Reverend Henry McNeal Turner, and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. In 1992 Laney was inducted into \\"Georgia Women of Achievement.\\"  Personal life  Laney died on October 24, 1933, and is buried at the corner of Laney Walker Boulevard and Phillips Street, where she first founded the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute.

The Star of the South), is a novel by Jules Verne, first published in 1884. It is based on a manuscript by Paschal Grousset. Setting This novel takes place in South Africa amongst the diamond fields in the district of Griqualand. Most of the land is owned by a fictitious wealthy miner, Mr. John Watkins. A shanty town filled with miners has sprung up, all with the hope to get rich. The main area of diamond mining is the Vandergaart Kopje. Synopsis The protagonist is a French mining engineer, Victor Cyprien (in the original French version: Cyprien M√©r√©). He moves to the Griqualand district to study the formation of diamonds. While he is there he falls in love with wealthy landowner Mr. John Watkins' daughter, Alice. He asks him for her hand in marriage but is denied on his lack of money and stature in the community. He decides that he could amass a fortune by mining with a partner, Thomas Steel. They buy a mining claim and proceed to dig. Victor hires a team of Africans to mine the claim. The claim collapses when Victor's team of hired help is digging. He manages to rescue one of them, Mataki. Achieving no great finds, Victor is disheartened for there are many more eligible suitors than he. Alice begs Cyprien to return to his studies. So Victor decides to attempt to artificially make a diamond. His experiment seems to work as a 243 carat (48.6 g) diamond is produced. He gives it to Mr. Watkins for Alice. Mr. Watkins holds a banquet in honor of Cyprien and his accomplishment. The diamond, christened as The Star of the South by Alice, is on display during this banquet. Midway through the banquet, the diamond vanishes as well as Victor's African hired help, Mataki. Mataki appears to flee with the diamond and Mr. Watkins, enraged, offers Alice's hand to whoever brings the diamond back. Victor and three other suitors set off to hunt Mataki down. They prepare to travel across the Veld. Victor brings along two companions his laundry man, Li, and a member of his digging team, Bardik. Along the way, the other three of his companions perish at the hands of animals or disease. Victor captures Mataki, who states he does not have the diamond. The only reason he ran was because he was afraid he would be hanged unjustly for the diamond's disappearance. Victor returns to Griqualand and finds the diamond in the stomach of Alice's ostrich, Dada. Cyprien is almost hung because his discovery of making artificial diamonds threatened the livelihood of the miners. He is only saved by Mataki's confession. Mataki found the diamond when he was covered by the landslide and stuck it in Victor's experiment in gratitude. Victor is shocked. Not caring about the diamond's origin, Mr. Watkins is glad for the recovery and holds another banquet. Mr. Vandergaart, the original owner of the land bursts in with a certificate saying that the land is once again his. John Watkins is devastated and is even more devastated when the Star of the South disintegrates. Shocked he dies the next day. Victor and Alice marry and live happily ever after.

He began his career at Shamrock Rovers but moved to rivals Bohemians in 2000. He made his first team debut for the club as substitute in the UEFA Cup tie against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in September 2000. After a short spell with Longford Town, Roddy Collins brought him along with teammate Trevor Molloy to Carlisle United in time for the 2002/03 season. He scored his first and only goal for Carlisle in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Leyton Orient on 28 December 2002. He returned to Ireland during the 2005 season with Shamrock Rovers, making his debut on 18 March and went on to make 17 total appearances. Having helped Drogheda to the club's first ever League of Ireland title in November 2007, he was named PFAI Player of the Year on 18 November 2007. However, the following season wasn't as successful as Drogheda finished well off the pace in the League and the club went into meltdown due to financial problems. Brian left Drogheda in January 2009 and returned to Dalymount Park for a 2nd spell with Bohemians. He has a made a fine start with the club and his form was rewarded with the Soccer Writer's Association Player of the Month for August. During this month, he scored his first goal of the season against Galway United at Dalymount Park. He then added to his collection of medals on 26 September as Bohs beat Waterford United in the final of the League of Ireland Cup. And he wasn't done yet as a great run of form towards the end of the season helped Brian to his third League of Ireland Premier Division winners medal, winning by 4 points from closest rivals Shamrock Rovers. His outstanding performances throughout the season was noted by his fellow professionals when he was voted on to the PFAI Team of the Year.Shelley on PFAI Team of the Year Shelley moved to the Ballarat Red Devils in Australia in the 2010-11 off-season, stringing together some dominating performances for the club in the Victorian State League 2 (NW). Following his successful first season, Shelley signed with the Red Devils for 2 years as Manager of the club, during October 2011. Shelley led the Ballarat Red Devils to its highest ever finish in the league ( 4th ) in his first season as head coach. Shelley also managed to pick up State 2 league best and fairest during his first season as head coach. Shelley has since made the move to Auckland, New Zealand to progress his coaching career while also continuing to play. Shelley penned a 3-year deal with Waitakere United as player/assistant coach. Brian has also taken on the role of Director of Football at the biggest college in Auckland where over 3000 students attend ( Rangitoto College )Shelley won the ASB premiership while with Waitakere as well as representing the club in the Oceania Football Champions League. Brian is currently Head of football at Saint Kentigern college in Auckland.

The Swift Folder is available from Design Mobility as a bare frame for customers to build up themselves, or assembled into a complete bicycle to the customer's requirements. From 2004http://www.swiftfolders.com/swift/Story.html to the end of 2016, a mass-market version of the bicycle was sold under license by Xootr as the Xootr Swift, fully assembled to a standard specification, in single and 8-speed models. Folding System The Swift Folder design employs a vertical folding method, using the seat-post and a split seat-tube as the locking mechanism. To fold, the seat-post is released from the two parts of the seat- tube by their respective quick release clamps, then pulled up into the upper part of the seat-tube to unlock the frame. A pivot in the main frame tube then allows the rear triangle (comprising the seat-stays, chain-stays and the lower portion of the seat-tube) and rear wheel to swing down and forward under the main tube. The seat-post is then slid back down through the upper part of the seat-tube to lock the rear wheel in the folded position. To unfold, the seat- post is again pulled up to allow the rear triangle to swing back and up into the normal riding position. The seat-post is then slid down through the upper and lower parts of the seat-tube, locking the rear triangle and wheel into place.YouTube video of Xootr Swift folding and unfolding The Swift frame is simple and robust, and allows a quick fold, but when folded is not as compact as some other folding bicycle designs. The bottom bracket forms part of the folding rear triangle, and as a result the bottom bracket to rear fork-end distance remains constant throughout the fold. This keeps the chain tension constant, which is an advantage when the Swift frame is used in a fixed-gear, single speed, or hub gear bicycle. Construction There are two Swift Folder frames, one is low-volume Chromoly manufacturing by Human Powered Machines of Eugene, Oregon, which also makes work bikes and trailers; the other, manufactured in Taiwan from TIG welded aluminium alloy with a \\"chromoly\\" steel fork, was marketed by Xootr. The frame is generally built to common \\"industry- standard\\" sizes and threads, and can accommodate a wide variety of gear systems, brakes and other components. The rear fork spacing can accommodate most standard road and mountain bike wheel-hubs. The Swift Folder is normally fitted with \\"20 inch\\" wheels. The standard ISO 5775 wheel size is 406mm (traditionally known as 20x1 to 20x2.125), the same size used on most BMX bicycles. A wide variety of wheels and tires are available in this size. The Swift Folder is also designed to work with 20 inch 451mm wheels. The linear pull brakes that come standard with the Swift will not work with 451s. The frame is designed to work with Caliper brakes with the larger wheels. Reviews Reviews of the Swift have generally been positive. The Swift has been praised for its responsive, comfortable ride, its stiff frame, its light weight, its low step-through height, and its use of standard as opposed to proprietary parts for the components. This includes the wheels, tires, handlebars, seat, shifter, brakes, chainring and cogset, all of which can easily be replaced. Reviews usually call out the large folded size and cumbersome folded shape as a disadvantage. It is sometimes also pointed out that the Swift doesn't stand when folded. There was some disagreement as to whether its price was high for the range, though commentary on that point tended to be muted as the price for the Xootr Swift was generally in line with mass market folding bikes. Given the generally positive reviews and the competitive price, it is likely that the large folded size was the sticky point for many buyers, as many more bicycles with higher pricetags and smaller sizes have been sold.

In particular, snowstorms are a common occurrence over the region and have major socio-economic impacts due to their significant precipitation amounts. The Great Salt lake never freezes and can warm rapidly which allows lake enhanced precipitation to occur from September through May. Lake-enhanced snowstorms are often attributed to creating what is locally known as \\"The Greatest Snow on Earth\\". Lake enhancement Radar image of enhanced precipitation by the lake and convergence. Lake-effect snow around the Great Salt Lake is generated in a similar fashion to elsewhere in the world. However, the Great Salt Lake primarily provides a lifting mechanism and acts as an atmospheric destabilizer, which encourages convection. This is in contrast to the Great Lakes, where the lakes contribute significant amounts of moisture and latent heat. Great Salt Lake enhanced precipitation occurs when a strong, cold, northwesterly wind blows across a relatively warm lake. This is common after a cold front passage, where the winds are predominantly northwesterly and the air is much colder than the lake. When the land-lake breeze blows towards the lake, there is a convergence zone that acts to channel the cold air over the center of the lake and further enhance precipitation. The salinity of the Great Salt Lake prevents freezing but reduces the saturation vapor pressure and latent heat flux into the overlying air. As a result, minimal amounts of moisture and latent heat are added to the air moving over the lake. The high relief of the Wasatch mountains further capitalizes on lake enhancement and can receive multiple feet of snow from lake-effect alone. Climatology The number of events varies considerably from year to year, according to the synoptic set-up. The average is 4 to 5 well-defined events annually and the same number of marginal events. Slightly more than half of the well-defined events persist for 13 to 24 h. In a 2000 study, researchers found that the larger number of cases were between October and February, with outlier cases in September and April or May. However a review of many more cases in 2012 found that the peaks of activity was really in the fall (mid-October to mid- December) and spring (early April) and that there was a minimum between those maximum. That same study found on average 13 events per year, well or not so well defined combined. Most well-defined events leave accumulations of or more, and in some cases more than , along a well-defined corridor. Forecasting lake-effect snow Forecasting skill has drastically improved in recent years due to a better observational network including the NEXRAD weather radar system. An accurate forecast involves identifying the crucial requirements for lake-effect precipitation. The basic requirements are a conditionally unstable environment, significant moisture and a lifting mechanism. Many different variables go into these requirements. Through extensive analyses and field experiments the understanding of lake-effect snowstorms has improved drastically in recent years. Many general rules of thumb have been developed in order to predict the occurrence, location and severity of lake-effect snow.  Rules of thumb  A set of rules has been developed by local forecasters to predict the development of lake enhanced snow: *A strong Northwesterly flow maximizes precipitation for the Salt Lake Valley. *A minimal temperature difference of 29 ¬∞F (16 ¬∞C) {fact} between the surface and the height is needed, but not necessarily sufficient in itself to cause lake-effect snow. *An inversion or stable layer below has never yielded lake-effect snow. *Lake-effect snow can occur in concert with synoptic scale storm systems. *A large lake-land temperature difference favors over-lake convergence. *Lake-effect is typically initiated during the night when land- breeze convergence is favored and convection occurs predominantly over the lake. *During the daytime lake-effect precipitation dissipates when solar heating creates scattered widespread convection over the land. *The 700 mbar winds typically determine the geographic position of the precipitation *Limited amounts of directional and vertical wind shear tend to produce heavier precipitation events. *The Great Salt Lake contributes minimal amounts of moisture so that upstream moisture is a crucial variable.

Gameplay A player fights enemy soldiers in the World War era. The \\"D-Scanner\\" at the top of the screen shows the location of the comrade who must be rescued. Time Soldiers can be played by either a single player, or by two players simultaneously. Players move their characters with an eight-way rotary joystick, shooting enemies along a scrolling backdrop. The rotary joystick allows players to walk in one direction while shooting in another (like in the SNK-developed Ikari Warriors series). The plot involves the protagonists traveling through time to rescue their comrades from the villainous Gylend. Each of the five levels is set in a different time period: The Primitive Age, The Age of Rome, The World Wars, The Age of War and Future World. Players travel between the periods with the aid of a device called the \\"D-Scanner.\\" Before each level, the player is shown the name of one of their comrades and the period in which that comrade is held captive. The player is then placed into one of the time periods. If that period is not the one in which the captive soldier is located, the player must defeat a midboss of the level and re-enter the time portal, repeating the process until the correct time period is reached. When the player reaches the correct time period, the player must then fight through the end of the level and defeat the level boss to rescue the captured soldier.Semrad, Ed. \\"Time Soldiers will Test the Best.\\" The Milwaukee Journal.

These winds frequently reach a maximum of at a height of above the ground. Surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation but are significantly weaker. The presence of these strong nighttime down-valley air flows has been documented at the mouth of many Alpine valleys that merge with basins, such as the Inn Valley of Austria, where the jet is strong enough to be heard at the ground. In the United States, exit jet signatures have been observed at the North Fork Gunnison River at Paonia, Colorado; the exit of South Boulder Creek south of Boulder, Colorado; Albuquerque, New Mexico at the mouth of Tijeras Canyon; and the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon in Utah. Theory Exit jets are likely to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal mountain wind systems, such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the US. These diurnal wind systems are driven by horizontal pressure gradients. Due to the abrupt transition over a short distance between the valley high pressure and the basin low pressure, the gradients are strongest near the valley exit, producing a jet. Other meteorological factors acting to increase exit wind speeds are the acceleration of winds originating inside the valley as they travel to lower elevations downvalley, and the process of cold valley air sinking and ejecting into the plain. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.Whiteman, C. David (2000). Mountain Meteorology, p. 193. Oxford University Press, New York. , pp. 191‚Äì193.  Impacts  Valley exit jets can play a major role in the mitigation of air pollution: * Airflow emerging into the basin is cleaner due to lower aerosol content * Vertical mixing resulting from directional shear and from the convergence of the jet with basin scale flows reduces ozone and other pollutants. * Surface eddies created near canyon mouths inhibit the transport of pollution.Darby, L.S., and R.M. Banta (2006) The modulation of canyon flows by larger-scale influences. Preprints, 12th Conf. on Mountain Meteorology. Amer. Meteor. Soc., 14-4. Methods of examining exit jets include remote sensing and direct observation. SODAR and Doppler LIDAR have been used in numerous studies to identify, quantify and relate the jets to atmospheric transport of hazardous materials.Banta, R.M., L.D. Olivier, P.H. Gudiksen, and R. Lange, (1996). Implications of small-scale flow features to modeling dispersion over complex terrain. J. Appl. Meteorol., 35:3, 330-342. Detailed profiles of winds at canyon exits can be directly observed and calculated using a single or double theodolite and tethersondes. The identification and measurement of valley exit jets can also significantly aid in fire control, as fire often rides valley jets, as well as the development of wind energy.

Leaving British Guiana at the age of 20, he had settled in England by 1931, and subsequently worked in other parts of Europe but lived most of his later years in London. Among numerous \\"firsts\\", he was the first black man to conduct the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1942), the first black man to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic (1945) and the first black man to conduct orchestras in Poland (1959) and Russia (1964).

Rudolph Dunbar: Pioneering Orchestra Conductor\\", The Black Perspective in Music, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Autumn 1981), pp. 193‚Äì225. He began his musical career playing clarinet with the British Guiana militia band at the age of 14,\\"Rudolph Dunbar, a talented international clarinetist with many 'firsts'\\", African American Registry. before moving to New York at the age of 20. He studied at the Institute of Musical Art (now Juilliard), and while in New York was also involved with the Harlem jazz scene, performing in 1924 with the Harlem Orchestra, and befriending the composer William Grant Still who played piano in the orchestra. In 1925 Dunbar moved to Paris and between 1927 and 1929 attended the Sorbonne, where he studied conducting with Philippe Gaubert, composition with Paul Vidal, and the clarinet with Louis Cahuzac. According to author John Cowley, Dunbar was in England in 1927, when he joined the Plantation Orchestra for a road tour of the show Blackbirds of 1927.John Cowley, \\"London is the Place: Caribbean Music in the Context of Empire 1900‚Äì60\\", in Paul Oliver (ed.), Black Music in Britain: Essays on the Afro Asian Contribution to Popular Music, Milton Keynes: Open University Press, 1990, pp. 57‚Äì76. Dunbar also spent time studying in Vienna with Felix Weingartner.Bob Shingleton, \\"Berlin Philharmonic's first Black conductor\\", On An Overgrown Path, 23 April 2007. His hopes of a degree were ended by the death of his father. By 1931, Dunbar had settled in London, where he founded the Rudolph Dunbar School of Clarinet Playing.Miranda Kaufmann, \\"Dunbar, Rudolph (1899-10 June 1988)\\", in David Dabydeen, John Gilmore & Cecily Jones, Oxford Companion to Black British History, 2007. He wrote columns as a technical expert in the Melody Maker for seven years and in 1939 published his Treatise on the Clarinet (Boehm System), which became a standard text about the instrument. His ballet, Dance of the Twenty-First Century, written for Cambridge University's Footlights Club, was premiered in the US in 1938 on an NBC broadcast. He had appearances on the BBC in 1940 and 1941, and became the first black man to conduct the London Philharmonic in 1942 at a concert in the Royal Albert Hall, London, before an audience of 7,000. In September 1945 he conducted the Berlin Philharmonic at the invitation of music director Leo Borchard, performing William Grant Still's Afro-American Symphony before Allied servicemen. According to J. A.

Journalism Dunbar also worked as a journalist. He became London correspondent for the Associated Negro Press news service in 1932, and in 1936 reported for them on debates in the House of Commons on the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. Additionally he was a war correspondent with the American 8th Army and crossed the English Channel on D-Day.

There are at least 27 plant associated Xanthomonas spp., that all together infect at least 400 plant species. Different species typically have specific host and/or tissue range and colonization strategies. Taxonomy The genus Xanthomonas has been subject of numerous taxonomic and phylogenetic studies and was first described as Bacterium vesicatorium as a pathogen of pepper and tomato in 1921. Dowson later reclassified the bacterium as Xanthomonas campestris and proposed the genus Xanthomonas.Xanthomonas was first described as a monotypic genus and further research resulted in the division into two groups, A and B. Later work using DNA:DNA hybridization has served as a framework for the general Xanthomonas species classification. Other tools, including multilocus sequence analysis and amplified fragment-length polymorphism, have been used for classification within clades. While previous research has illustrated the complexity of the genus Xanthomonas, recent research appears to have resulted in a clearer picture. More recently, genome-wide analysis of multiple Xanthomonas strains mostly supports the previous phylogenies. Xanthomonas spp. are evolutionary linked to opportunistic human pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, that was previously called Xanthomonas maltophilia.  Morphology and growth  Individual cell characteristics include: *Cell type ‚Äì straight rods *Size ‚Äì 0.4 ‚Äì 1.0 ¬µm wide by 1.2 ‚Äì 3.0 ¬µm long *Motility ‚Äì motile by a single polar flagellum Colony growth characteristics include: *Mucoid, convex, and yellow colonies on YDC medium *Yellow pigment from xanthomonadin, which contains bromine *Most produce large amounts of extracellular polysaccharide *Temperature range ‚Äì 4 to 37 ¬∞C, optimal growth 25-30 ¬∞C Biochemical and physiological test results are: *Gram stain ‚Äì negative *Obligate aerobes *Catalase positive *Oxidase negative  Xanthomonas plant pathogens  Symptoms of diseases caused by Xanthomonas Xanthomonas species can cause bacterial spots and blights of leaves, stems, and fruits on a wide variety of plant species. Pathogenic species show high degrees of specificity and some are split into multiple pathovars, a species designation based on host specificity. Citrus canker, caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri is an economically important disease of many citrus species (lime, orange, lemon, pamelo, etc.) Bacterial leaf spot has caused significant crop losses over the years. Causes of this disease include Xanthomonas euvesicatoria and Xanthomonas perforans = [Xanthomonas axonopodis (syn. campestris) pv. vesicatoria], Xanthomonas vesicatoria, and Xanthomonas gardneri. In some areas where infection begins soon after transplanting, the total crop can be lost as a result of this disease. Xanthomonas campestris pv. punicae cause bacterial blight of pomogranate. Bacterial blight of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, is a disease found worldwide and particularly destructive in the rice-producing regions in Asia.  Plant pathogenesis and disease control  Xanthomonas spp. life cycle Contaminated seeds, weeds, infected plant debris are the main route of transmission. Infection starts with epiphytic stage ‚Äì i.e. bacteria grow on the aerial tissues of plant host (leaf, fruit, etc) followed by endophytic stage when bacteria enter and colonise host tissues through wounds or natural openings. When population of bacteria increases it re-emerges to the surface and is transmitted mainly by wind, rain or through seeds or agricultural machinery, while animal and insect vectors seems to play minor role. Xanthomonas uses surface polysacharides, adhesion proteins and type IV pili to attach to the surface and can form biofilms to sustain abiotic stresses (UV, drought, etc). Xanthomonas produce xanthomonadins - yellow pigments that protect from radiation caused from natural light. Resistance to UV is mostly conferred by genes related to oxidative stress and DNA repair. Response to light is important in pathogenicity of these bacteria and regulates surface attachment and production of biofilm. Xanthomonas possess almost all known secretion systems (types I to VI) that play different roles in the life and disease cycle, with type III secretion system (T3SS) being the key factor of pathogenicity. Typically, Xanthomonas T3SS injects a cocktail of 20-30 effector proteins that interfere with plant immune system and various host cellular processes. Many of the effectors are presumably redundant as individual deletions of effector genes does not impair virulence, however mutations in T3SS apparatus has strong effect. Secretion of the effectors is coordinated with expression of other virulence factors via shared regulatory networks. The effector repertoire has been proposed to be a determinant of host specificity. Xanthomonas actively kill other bacterial using type IV secretion system and defend itself from amoeba using type VI secretion system. To prevent infections, limiting the introduction of the bacteria is key. Some resistant cultivars of certain plant species are available as this may be the most economical means for controlling this disease. For chemical control, preventative applications are best to reduce the potential for bacterial development. Copper-containing products offer some protection along with field-grade antibiotics such as oxytetracycline, which is labeled for use on some food crops in the United States. Curative applications of chemical pesticides may slow or reduce the spread of the bacterium, but will not cure already diseased plants. It is important to consult chemical pesticide labels when attempting to control bacterial diseases, as different Xanthomonas species can have different responses to these applications. Over-reliance on chemical control methods can also result in the selection of resistant isolates, so these applications should be considered a last resort. Potential use of bacteriophages is also considered, however major limiting factors are their sensitivity to environmental conditions and in particular to UV radiation. Plant beneficial microorganisms or attenuated strains of Xanthomonas are being tested as a biocontrol reasoning that they could compete by occupying the same niche and even eradicate pathogenic strain. Generation of plant species resistant to Xanthomonas is another potential strategy. Industrial use Xanthomonas species produce an edible polysaccharide called xanthan gum that has a wide range of industrial uses, including foods, petroleum products, and cosmetics. Xanthan also plays role in the disease cycle of Xanthomonas. In particular, xanthan gum is one of the main components of biofilm matrix. Biofilms help these bacteria sustain abiotic stresses on the leaf surface. Genes for Xanthan gum biosynthesis comprise the gum operon (gumB-gymM) coding for 12 enzymes. Xanthan production by Xanthomonas spp. that thrive in vascular plant systems might block the water flow of the plant and as a result cause wilting.  Xanthomonas resources  Isolates of most species of Xanthomonas are available from the National Collection of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria in the United Kingdom and other international culture collections such as ICMP in New Zealand, CFBP in France, and VKM in Russia. It also can be taken out from MTCC India. Multiple genomes of Xanthomonas have been sequenced and additional data sets/tools are available at The Xanthomonas Resource.

The music was categorized as rhythmic oldies but included much more variety than the typical radio station. Many songs were from the 1950s, and the station's focus was beach music, a style made popular on the South Carolina coast. Personalities included Billy Smith, Ted Bell, Ray Scott and Stevie Blackburn. The station aired the syndicated On the Beach radio show hosted by Charlie Brown. From spring to fall 1999, Hook was brought in to emcee live remote broadcasts Noon to 6 each Saturday and Sunday. In the course of the year, Hook, Earl Taylor, and station owner Deane Morris developed a relationship which bore fruit in February 2000 when Taylor and Morris brought Hook in as the morning drive DJ, as well as emcee of live remote Deck parties from five different venues, every Monday-Friday afternoon. In 2001/02 Hook and Taylor pioneered Grand Strand webstreaming by putting WVCO's broadcast live on the Internet. In 2002, Hook presented a business plan to WVCO colleague Earl Taylor and Harvey Graham which included the 10,000-square-foot Born In the Carolinas museum, the WVCO webstream, a live Sunday night simulcast of Born In the Carolinas Live (from 2001 Nightclub's ballroom), along with merchandising and sponsorship modules. Two corporations followed: one constituted by WVCO was split 51%, 24%, and 24% by Graham, Hook, and Taylor respectively, while the Born In the Carolinas museum and its holdings were captained by Graham 51% and Hook 49%. In summer 2003, the Born In the Carolinas Live shows, managed and facilitated by Susan and Donny Trexler, Andy Bickle, Kay Mattox, and Kathy Hardwick, presented 26 shows featuring a wide spectrum of Beach Bands, along with national artists including Cuba Gooding, Keisa Brown, Barbara Carr, and many others. Audio engineer Steve Durr was brought by Hook from Nashville to design the stage, sound system, and audio/video mixing room for the Born in the Carolinas museum. Durr was legendary, having designed the Sydney Opera House system in Australia, and a host of NASCAR race track sound systems. Hook presented a business/sponsorship plan to Pepsi Regional and National bringing them to the table for a six-figure title sponsorship. Ten more sponsors were signed at $75,000 each. Not long after Graham and Taylor expunged Hook in early 2004. All sponsors signed out, the Born in the Carolinas museum died on the vine. Durr's sound system was returned.

Death of WVCO co-owner Bill Norman and subsequent investigation Owner Bill Norman suffered a serious stroke on September 29, 2012, and died at Grand Strand Regional Medical Center on October 14, 2012, from what initially was labelled a \\"cerebral vascular accident\\" on the death certificate. On October 19, 2012, the Myrtle Beach Police Department launched an investigation into Norman's death. WMBF-TV reported on December 6‚Äì7, 2012, that a 53-year-old nurse, Janet Kupka, had given Norman 20 milligrams of morphine instead of the prescribed 4 milligrams. Kupka allegedly admitted to a witness that she gave Norman the drug Diprivan. Norman was brain dead due to the stroke. Norman's body had been cremated and was not available to be autopsied. The cause of death may be changed to an overdose.

Named for Agenor (in history and Greek mythology, a king of Tyre), she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction Originally projected as LST-490, an , this ship was redesignated ARL-3 and named Agenor on 13 January 1943. She was laid down on 24 January 1943, MC hull 1010, by Kaiser Shipyards, Yard No. 4, Richmond, California; launched on 3 April 1943; and commissioned at San Francisco, on 20 August 1943, Lieutenant Argyle W. Markley, USNR, in command. Service history=United States Navy From December 1943 through 9 June 1944, Agenor provided repair services to numerous landing craft operating in the Solomon, Russell, and Marshall Islands. On 9 June, the repair ship got underway for the Marianas. Eight days later, Japanese torpedo bombers attacked Agenors convoy. Despite several near misses, the ship continued on safely to waters off Saipan where she arrived on 24 June. Agenor was then assigned duty with a salvage group, Task Group 52.7 (TG 52.7). While air raids were a constant threat, the vessel carried out her work successfully. On 15 July, she moved to Tinian to supply services to invasion forces there. The ship sailed to Guam in early August, and reported to Task Force 53 (TF 53). That island was her base of operations through 2 October, when the ship shifted to Ulithi in the Carolines. Agenor returned to Guam on 10 February 1945, to prepare for the Iwo Jima landings. On 20 February, the repair ship arrived off Iwo Jima and joined TG 51.3. During the operations there, Agenor carried out her work despite air attack and heavy seas. The ship remained at Iwo Jima until 25 June. She then got underway for Saipan, where she dropped anchor on 29 June. Soon after reporting to Service Squadron 10 for duty, Agenor left Saipan bound for Hawaii and a much-needed overhaul. The vessel reached Pearl Harbor on 18 July and entered the navy yard. The Japanese surrender found the ship still undergoing repairs at Pearl Harbor. Upon completion of the yard work, Agenor served in the Hawaiian operating area until placed out of commission, in reserve, on 15 November 1946. French Navy Agenor was transferred to the government of France on 2 March 1951, under the terms of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act and renamed RFS Vulcain (A-656). Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 March 1951. Republic of China Navy Transferred by France to the Republic of China Navy in 1957 and renamed Shung Shan (ARL-336), later being renamed Tai Wu (AP-520.

While racial discrimination existed at several levels, the violent outbreaks were within working classes. Irish Americans, the largest and earliest immigrant group in the 19th century, established the first neighborhoods in South Omaha. All were attracted by new industrial jobs and most were from rural areas. There was competition among ethnic Irish, newer European immigrants, and African- American migrants from the South, for industrial jobs and housing. They all had difficulty adjusting to industrial demands, which were unmitigated by organized labor in the early years. Some of the early labor organizing resulted in increasing tensions between groups, as later arrivals to the city were used as strikebreakers. In Omaha as in other major cities, racial tension has erupted at times of social and economic strife, often taking the form of mob violence as different groups tried to assert power. Much of the early violence came out of labor struggles in early 20th century industries: between working class ethnic whites and immigrants, and blacks of the Great Migration. Meatpacking companies had used the latter for strikebreakers in 1917 as workers were trying to organize. As veterans returned from World War I, both groups competed for jobs. By the late 1930s, however, interracial teams worked together to organize the meatpacking industry under the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA). Unlike the AFL and some other industrial unions in the CIO, UPWA was progressive. It used its power to help end segregation in restaurants and stores in Omaha, and supported the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Women labor organizers such as Tillie Olsen and Rowena Moore were active in the meatpacking industry in the 1930s and 1940s, respectively. Most violence and civil unrest in the 1960s, by contrast, arose out of poverty and problems caused by massive loss of working-class jobs through industrial restructuring. The city's African-American community suffered particularly and erupted in protest. 19th century The Nebraska Territory was created in 1854 with the condition that the area stay slave- free. But, from 1855 on, there was debate in the Territorial Legislature about whether slavery should specifically be prohibited. As there were few slaves in the state, some legislators did not think the bill was needed.Bristow, D. (2002) A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha. Caxton Press. In 1859, the Daily Nebraskian newspaper reported its favoring of slavery, writing, :The bill introduced in [Omaha City] Council, for the abolition of slavery in this Territory, was called up yesterday, and its further consideration postponed for two weeks. A strong effort will be made among the Republicans to secure its passage; we think, however, it will fail. The farce certainly cannot be enacted if the Democrats do their duty.A Daily Nebraskian newspaper editorial from 1859, as quoted in Bristow, D. (2002) A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha. Caxton Press. During that period, some local newspapers openly editorialized against the presence of blacks in Omaha, for the Confederacy and against the election of Abraham Lincoln.Several sources in Bristow, D. (2002) The 1860 census showed that of the 81 Negroes in Nebraska, only 10 were slaves.(1938) Authur Goodlett. American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1940. Because a clause in the original proposed Nebraska State Constitution limited voting rights in the state to \\"free white males\\", as had been common in many states, Nebraska was delayed about a year from entering the Union. In 1865, the Nebraska Territorial Legislature changed the proposed State Constitution to provide expanded suffrage. The territory gained statehood soon after. Following the Civil War, enough blacks lived in Omaha to organize St. John's African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1867 as the first church for African Americans in Nebraska.(2003) The Negroes of Nebraska: The Negro goes to church. Memorial Library. The first recorded birth of an African American was that of William Leper, recorded in Omaha in 1872.(1895) \\"Negroes in Omaha,\\" Omaha Progress February 21, 1895. In 1891 a mob lynched George Smith, an African American man, for allegedly raping a \\"white\\" woman. No one was charged in his murder.Bristow, D. (2002) 20th century In the early 20th century, social tensions of the rapidly industrializing city absorbing waves of new immigrants and migrants broke out in riots between ethnic minorities. The riots included extensive property damage and some deaths.  South Omaha  South Omaha was where many different immigrant groups established their own neighborhoods. These ranged from Sheelytown for ethnic Irish to Polish and Czech. Little Italy and Little Bohemia closely bordered South Omaha at its north boundary as well. The immigrants comprised most of the workers at the stockyards and meatpacking plants, also located there. They started organizing different laborers and stopped work with strikes. The industry responded by hiring workers from other parts of the country who were also seeking work: both European immigrants and black migrants from the South (whose numbers doubled in Omaha from 1910 to 1920). In 1905, more than 800 students (mostly children of immigrant workers) in South Omaha protested the presence of Japanese students at their school, calling them \\"scabs\\". The Japanese students were children of strikebreakers brought in by the Omaha Stockyards the previous summer during a fierce strike. Children of the regular workers refused to attend classes and locked teachers out of the building.\\"Revolt over Japanese; South Omaha School Children Want Them Expelled\\", The New York Times. April 18, 1905. Retrieved 4/20/08.  Greek Town Riot  Greek Town was a growing Greek immigrant community in South Omaha. Other immigrants resented the Greeks, who had come to the city as strikebreakers. Many men of the community had been jobless for an extensive period after they were laid off following the strikes. Some Omaha citizens assumed they were lazy rather than unemployed. In September 1909 a male resident of the Greek community was arrested by an ethnic Irish South Omaha policeman for allegedly having a relationship with a \\"white\\" woman. (He was taking English lessons from her.) The man took the officer's gun and shot him. After the Greek was captured a short while later, a mob of ethnic whites numbering about 1,000 arrived at the door of the jail. By then the South Omaha policemen had transferred the man to the Omaha city jail. (The jurisdictions were then separate.) Frustrated, the mob turned to the Greek neighborhood and began to destroy it, threatening all of its residents with death if they stayed in town. Within a day the Greek residents abandoned the six-by-six block area and scattered into cities across the Midwest. Meanwhile, the mob destroyed the entire neighborhood. The accused Greek immigrant was brought to trial; but, after intervention from the Greek ambassador to the U.S., who protested the government's failure to protect the immigrant community, the city of Omaha released the man and dropped charges against him.  Anti-German sentiments  In the immediate years after World War I and defeat of Germany by the Allies, anti-German sentiment ran high across the country. The Nebraska legislature passed a law in 1919 that enforced teaching in English in public schools. (Because of substantial immigration by Germans to Nebraska, in earlier years, studies in German were available in the public schools, along with French and classical languages.) By law, \\"No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language than the English language.\\"\\"U.S. Supreme Court: MEYER v. STATE OF NEBRASKA, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)\\". University of Kansas City. Retrieved 9/3/07. Robert Meyer was found to violate this law because he taught German. He was taken to court by the State of Nebraska, and when found guilty he appealed. Although his appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court failed, the U.S. Supreme Court in Meyer v. Nebraska determined that Meyer had the right to teach the German language as a subject, and to teach it in German. During the course of the year, open discrimination against Germans throughout Omaha was taking hold. Many German-language newspapers were forced to change to English, or to close.Folsom, B.W. (1999) No More Free Markets Or Free Beer: The Progressive Era in Nebraska, 1900-1924. Lexington Books. p 112.  Red Summer  In September 1919, following a summer of racial riots in several other industrial cities, an African-American laborer named Willy Brown was lynched in Omaha. He had been accused of raping a young white woman. A mob of 5,000 ethnic white men marched from South Omaha (some young men were classmates of the woman) and appeared at the Douglas County Courthouse to demand \\"justice\\". Within hours the mob grew to 10,000 people. Many were drinking. When the reform mayor Edward P. Smith attempted to intervene, he was nearly lynched by the mob. Only a last-minute rescue saved him from being hanged. The mob threw stones at windows, far outnumbered the police, and set the courthouse on fire to force the release of Brown. The police turned him over to save other prisoners. In a frenzy, the mob hung Brown from a lamppost and shot him, later dragged his body and burned it. The mob turned against police vehicles and attacked any blacks they found in the street. They began to move toward a large African- American enclave in North Omaha. The city and governor had called in the U.S. Army from Fort Omaha to intervene. It stationed troops in North Omaha to protect the blacks, and after gaining control of the mob, in South Omaha to prevent any more riots forming. An unseasonal rainstorm cooled the mob down as well. The Army commander established martial law for several days. A grand jury's investigation identified the mob as arising from South Omaha and being encouraged by the city's vice world. No one was charged in the events, however.  Anti-Black racism  On July 4, 1910 African American boxer Jack Johnson won a major upset at a national match in Reno, Nevada. Upon hearing the news, a dozen fights broke out in different areas of the city between whites and blacks, as happened in other cities. Whites wounded several black men and killed one.\\"Omaha negro killed\\", The New York Times. July 5, 1910. Retrieved 4/20/08. After World War I, white veterans trying to return to their civilian jobs found African-American and Eastern European immigrants in their former positions. Their resentment led to several violent strikes in the South Omaha meat packing industry as groups tried to control access to jobs. During this period, Earl Little was a Baptist minister in North Omaha. After his son, Malcolm, was born in Omaha in 1925, the family moved away because of threats by the Ku Klux Klan in 1926. (The KKK had undergone a revival and growth in the Midwest in the early 1920s.) Malcolm Little later changed his last name to X, when he joined the Black Muslims, where he became an important leader known as Malcolm X.Malcolm X. (1973) The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Penguin Books Ltd. In the 1920s, racial segregation became normalized in Omaha as redlining and restrictive covenants kept African Americans concentrated in housing in North Omaha.A Street of Dreams Nebraska Public Television. The riot had discredited the city's newly elected reformist government. In the next election, \\"Cowboy\\" Jim Dahlman was returned to office with the support of Tom Dennison, the informal leader of the vice world. The labor struggles and social struggles led Omaha's African-American leaders, such as Earl Little, Harry Haywood and George Wells Parker, to push harder for civil rights.Davies, P. (2002) American Road: The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the Motor Age. Henry Holt and Co. P 107. After this period, African Americans in Omaha were largely concentrated as residents on the city's north side, with a small community in South Omaha.  Civil rights era  In 1947 a student-led civil-rights group called the DePorres Club was forced off the Creighton University campus, where they started. Mildred Brown, a community activist and publisher, invited them to meet at the Omaha Star, the paper she directed for the African-American community for decades.(n.d.)Mildred Brown Nebraska Studies. Omaha jazz legend Preston Love reported that in the 1950s he saw signs in Omaha restaurants and bars that said, \\"We Don't Serve Any Colored Race\\", but that he was always welcome as a musician.Bristow, D. (n.d.) Swingin' with Preston Love . Nebraska Life. In the 1950s, the United Meatpacking Workers of America (UPWA) helped use their power to have businesses in Omaha integrate their facilities. The late 1950s and early 1960s was the period which Lois Mark Stalvey wrote about in The Education of a WASP. She recounted her activist efforts to desegregate a middle-class West Omaha neighborhood for an African-American surgeon and his family who wanted to live in the area. Such efforts took place in a different environment from the struggles of most working-class families in North and South Omaha.Lois Mark Stalvey, Three to Get Ready: The Education of a White Family in Inner City Schools, University of Wisconsin Press. Retrieved 9/21/07. In 1955, the State of Nebraska took Omaha's main amusement park, Peony Park, to district court. The state believed that the park, founded in 1919, violated Nebraska Civil Rights Law when African American swimmers at the Amateur Athletic Union Swimming Meet held at the park on August 27, 1955 were discriminated against. In State of Nebraska v. Peony Park, the Nebraska Supreme Court found that two African-American participants were illegally barred from the meet because Peony Park barred them from the pool. On September 7, 1955, the court fined Peony Park $50 and costs of the trial. Additional civil suits were settled out of court.Civil Liberties Docket. Vol. I, No. 2. December, 1955. The Omaha Star newspaper reported extensively on the trial, using the opportunity to highlight segregationist policies around the city as well as the city's burgeoning civil rights movement.Suggs, H.L. (1996) The Black Press in the Middle West, 1865-1985. Greenwood Publishing Group. p 239. By the early 1960s, economic progress by many African Americans and ethnic Americans became unraveled in the massive job losses caused by restructuring of railroad and meatpacking industries. By the mid-1960s, North Omaha had much more poverty than before and increasing social problems. On July 4, 1966, tensions broke out in a riot after a day of blistering 103 degree weather. Refusing a police order to disperse, African Americans demolished police cars and attacked the North 24th Street business corridor, throwing firebombs and demolishing storefronts. Businesses in the Near North Side suffered millions of dollars in damages.Luebtke, F.C. (2005) Nebraska: An Illustrated History, University of Nebraska Press. p. 334.

The National Guard was called in to disperse the rioters.(n.d.) National Guard Mobilized in North Omaha . Black Facts Online. Less than a month later, on August 1, 1966, riots erupted after a 19-year-old was shot by a white off-duty policeman during a burglary. rioters firebombed three buildings and 180 riot police were required to quell the crowds. Leaders in the community criticized the Omaha World-Herald and local television stations for blaming African Americans for the conditions they faced in their deteriorating neighborhoods, when the problems of joblessness and decreased maintenance were beyond city and regional control.Olson, J.C. and Naugle, R.C. (1997) History of Nebraska. University of Nebraska Press. p 371. That same year, 1966, A Time for Burning, a documentary featuring North Omaha and the social problems, was filmed. Later it was nominated for an Oscar for best documentary. In March 1968 a crowd of high school and university students gathered at the Omaha Civic Auditorium to protest the presidential campaign of George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama. After counter-protesters began acting violently toward the activists, police brutality led to dozens of protesters being injured. During the melee, an African-American youth was shot and killed by a police officer. Students' fleeing the outbreak attacked businesses and cars, causing thousands of dollars of damage.\\"Peaceful protest turns violent\\" , The Creightonian Online. Retrieved 4/16/08. The following day a local barber named Ernie Chambers helped calm a disturbance and prevent a riot by students at Horace Mann Junior High School. Chambers was already recognized as a community leader. After finishing his law degree, Chambers was elected to the Nebraska State Legislature. He went on to serve a total of 38 years, longer than any of his predecessors. Robert F. Kennedy visited Omaha later that year in his quest to become president, speaking in support of Omaha's civil rights activists. An African-American teenager named Vivian Strong was shot and killed by police officers in an incident at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects in June 1969. Young African Americans in the area rioted after the teenager's death, and looted along the North 24th Street business corridor. Eight businesses were destroyed by firebombing or looting.Luebtke, F.C. (2005) Nebraska: An Illustrated History. University of Nebraska Press. p. 372.

This is the last noted riot in Omaha. In 1970 an African-American man named Duane Peak was arrested, and quickly implicated six others in a bombing at a vacant house in North Omaha that killed a police officer. On August 31, local Black Panther Party leaders David Rice and Ed Poindexter were arrested in the case, despite not having been originally implicated. In 1971 both men were convicted of murder in the controversial Rice/Poindexter Case, and in 1974 a retrial of Rice and Poindexter was denied by the Nebraska State Supreme Court.  Late 20th century  The 1970s construction of the North Freeway bisected North Omaha, effectively cutting the African-American community in half and creating social problems. In 1976, the Omaha Public Schools began court-ordered busing to achieve integration.1954-1979. Omaha World Herald (Nebraska) June 13, 2004 In 1981 arsonists burned an East Omaha duplex after an African-American family signed a rental agreement there. The arson is unsolved.Burbach, C. \\"Robbery, fire evoke memories of neighborhood's racist past,\\" Omaha World Herald. February 26, 2007. In 1993 the Nebraska Parole Board voted for the first time to unanimously commute the sentences of Rice and Poindexter to time served. The Nebraska Board of Pardons refused to schedule a hearing in the matter. This same sequence of events has occurred no fewer than three times since then, with the same outcome each time. In 1995 an African-American gang member murdered an Omaha police officer named Jimmy Wilson, Jr. The city responded by equipping every police car with a camera and giving North Omaha officers body armor. Later that year arsonists tipped over and burned an African-American woman's car in East Omaha near the site of the 1981 arson. Both cases are unsolved. In 1996 the Omaha public schools ended court-ordered busing.Omaha World Herald, June 13, 2004 That same year the Omaha World-Herald reported that, \\"One resident of Rose Garden Estates near 172nd and Pacific Streets said privately, for instance, that he finds the prospect of being incorporated into the city 'increasingly scary.'

At the end of the chase, he was shot and killed by officers. A grand jury later cleared the officers involved of any wrongdoing. That year the Nebraska State Legislature enacted term limits. Some believed this action was directed against the long- time State Senator Ernie Chambers, an African American who had then served 27 years.Associated Press (Apr 25, 2005). For the Record.

Because of the 2002 law, he was not allowed to run for office again once his term expired in 2008. Desegregation busing and racial integration in public schools were contentious issues in Omaha. Problems with public schools were a factor in middle-class people moving to the suburbs, but the shift in population to suburbs also followed the growth of the city and highways. Omahans' preference for larger, newer housing was just like that of other Americans. Middle-class African Americans have also moved to the suburbs here and in other cities.\\"One resident of Rose Garden Estates near 172nd and Pacific Streets said privately, for instance, that he finds the prospect of being incorporated into the city \\"increasingly scary.\\" \\"I left Benson because I didn't like the changes,\\" he said. \\"Too much crime, too much racial tension, too much school busing.

This article noted other similar instances.  Schooling  From 1976 to 1999, Omaha had a busing plan as an effort to integrate the schools. Busing was an early goal of civil rights leaders and groups in Omaha, including 4CL, who lauded integrated busing as a particularly important step in improving race relations.A Street of Dreams. When the city considered ending busing in the 1990s, Concerned and Caring Educators, a 100-member group of black education administrators and supervisors, praised the system as having improved race relations and the education of Omaha's students.Ngyren, J. \\"Black Group: Ending Busing A Step Back\\", Omaha World Herald, March 14, 1996. Omaha Public Schools ended busing to achieve integration in 1999. It responded to parental desires for neighborhood schools and for choice. It has created magnet schools to attract students from middle- class families. As in many other cities, concerns about schools are high. Like some other districts such as Louisville, Kentucky, Omaha has begun to explore socioeconomic integration - assigning students according to family income - to change the makeup of their schools and address low test scores among poor children in the inner city. There have been delays in efforts to unite the Omaha public school district with newly annexed smaller, local districts in the western half of the city.Robb, J. \\"Dream of integrated schools fading, Omaha World-Herald. November 1, 2005. Accessed 4/27/07. 21st century Senator Ernie Chambers proposed a controversial school separation plan for Omaha in the Nebraska State Legislature in response to concerns by suburban districts outside Omaha boundaries. The state legislature was interested in seeking a way to use suburban districts to help integrate the city's schools. \\"The law, intended to resolve a boundary dispute between the Omaha schools and largely white suburban districts, created a learning community of area school districts that would operate with a common tax levy and required them to draw up an integration plan for metropolitan Omaha.\\" Chambers lobbied to create three districts in the city, with each drawn along geographic boundaries that loosely correlated to the racial segregation of the city: African Americans in North Omaha, Hispanic/Latinos in South Omaha, and Caucasians in West Omaha. Chambers defended his decision from the standpoint that much of the city had residential segregation and that his plan would provide African American parents in North Omaha with more control over their district.Saunders, Michaela. Chambers up close A Q&A; with the senator, whose OPS views are rooted in his youth. Omaha World Herald (April 30, 2006) The State Legislature signed this plan into law in April, 2006, with the plan going into effect in 2008. Within a month of the legislature's passing the law, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People brought a lawsuit, arguing that due to Omaha's racially segregated residential patterns, subdivided school districts will also be racially segregated, contrary to United States law. The case has also drawn national attention. Critics regard the plan as \\"state-sponsored segregation\\". In February 2007, unknown assailants robbed, firebombed, and spray painted a racist epithet on the side of an East Omaha grocery store owned by an Ethiopian immigrant. That crime is unsolved.Burbach, C. (2007) In October 2007, the Omaha World-Herald noted recent census statistics showed that Omaha, the 43rd largest city in the United States, has the fifth highest poverty rate for African Americans among the 100 largest cities. More than one in three live below the poverty line. The city has plans for public-private development in North Omaha that are intended to revive the area.

Some groups have tried to gain political power by opposing immigrants, but more people in the city and community have rallied in support of immigrants, including the Hispanic community, who comprise the most numerous recent immigrants. In 2007 a neo- Nazi group tried to organize a protest and had 65 participants outside the city's Mexican consulate. They were far outnumbered by the thousands in counter-protests, as well as those celebrating at events marking the diversity of the city.Ruggles, R. and Cole, K.

In May and June of 2020, thousands of demonstrators filled Omaha streets to protest the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis and other killings marked by the Black Lives Matter movement. Police injured demonstrators with tear gas and projectiles, in at least one case shooting a bystander in the face, blinding him. A white bar owner in the Old Market, Jacob Gardner, shot and killed unarmed Black protestor James Scurlock. County Attorney Don Kleine declined to press charges against Gardner, which lead to more protests. In July of 2020, police conducted a mass arrest of 120 peaceful protestors on a highway overpass. Despite Kleine's refusal to press charges, on September 15, a Special Prosecutor, Frederick Franklin, pressed charges against Gardner. Gardner was formally charged with four felonies, including manslaughter. On September 20, while on a trip to Oregon to evade death threats he had been receiving in Nebraska, Gardner committed suicide, reportedly near a medical clinic.

An essential part of the nation's cultural heritage, tais weavings are used for ceremonial adornment, sign of respect and appreciation towards guests, friends, relatives, home decor, and personal apparel. The Catholic Church of East Timor has also adopted the use of tais during its ceremonies. Because of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, detailed study of the history and importance of the tais began only after 2000.Sacchetti, Maria Jos√©. \\"Tais: The Textiles of Timor-Leste\\" . Timor- Leste Government Tourism Office. 2005. Retrieved 7 February 2008. History and social role The tais has been used in East Timor as a unit of exchange, often for livestock or other valuables. In ceremonial use, the tais is usually worn along with feathers, coral, gold and/or silver.Niner, Sara. \\"Strong Cloth: East Timor's Tais\\". Craft Culture. 2 September 2003. Retrieved 7 February 2008. Still, the sale of tais has become common only in the last thirty years. Although small-scale commerce of tais is an important source of income for women, however, export is difficult and nearly all sales take place with foreigners. In recent years, the public textile market in the capital Dili has seen an influx of foreign-made weavings, which often look like tais and are sold (and made) more cheaply. Weaving of tais is performed solely by women, with techniques passed down from generation to generation in an oral tradition.\\"Hand-weaving: threads of hope\\". East Timor Women Australia. Retrieved 7 February 2008. The activity often serves as a community gathering as much as a chore of productivity, and served as a rare form of self- expression in the restrictive environment of the 25-year Indonesian occupation. Santa Cruz Massacre Tia Veronica Pereira created a black tais with the names of the 271 victims woven in red into it, to commemorate the victims of the 1991 Santa Cruz Massacre. The influence of textiles on the lives of women is reflected in the East Timorese expression \\"bringing a thread and bobbin\\" in reference to a newborn child. During the occupation, Indonesian soldiers were a considerable market for tais weavers. In the 1970s, tais for the first time began to feature inscriptions, usually written in Indonesian. In the era of independence, tais artisans have begun specializing in customized weavings, as well as tais-like products such as handbags and scarves. Since 1999 workers in NGO's and the UN bought tais to take home as gifts and mementos and new messages found their way into the tais in English and Portuguese as well as Tetun. A quite remarkable fact, given that most of the weavers are found in rural areas where they have not had the opportunity to learn how to read or write. Many people wishing to assist East Timorese women develop income streams have imported tais for sale and assisted weavers and sewing groups to produce items such as purses, bags, cushion covers and baskets that are saleable in Australia and elsewhere. The selling of tais is rapidly moving off-shore as many of the people taking these initiatives belong to Local Government Friendship groups in Australia.Friends of Suai. An East Timorese man in traditional attire, including tais mane Traditional Timorese culture is supported by growing, cutting, tying, knotting, weaving, dying and sheathing a variety of fibres, grasses and leaves for ceremonial and practical purposes. The weaving of the tais plays an integral role in Timorese life and especially women's lives: shaping identity and attitudes towards them. Before the introduction of currency and after, the tais has been used as a valued object of exchange in gifting and ceremonies. Textiles are the art-form of the South-east Asian region and often the most beautiful tais are used to wrap around the bodies of loved ones for burial. Its role in wedding arrangements and the associated family ties, is attributed by some writers with contributing to the maintenance and strength of Timorese identity despite hundreds of years of colonial occupation. A Forum was recently held in Melbourne to stimulate and expand the debate and dialogue about the impact of commodifying the tais because it is a craft grounded in culture and sacred life.Suai Mediaspace. Designs Tais in the National Parliament The imagery and patterns of tais vary greatly from region to region, but they often include messages of locale and significant events.Delaney, Dawn. \\"Threads of Hope\\". Craft Culture. 7 May 2003. Retrieved 7 February 2008. Imagery often includes animals such as the crocodile, upon which the creation legend of the island is based. Geometric patterns known as kaif are also employed in most tais. Styles of tais worn on the body are differentiated by gender: men traditionally wear the tais mane (or \\"man's cloth\\"), a single large wrap around the waist usually finished with tassels. Women wear the tais feto (\\"women's cloth\\"), a form of strapless dress woven in the shape of a tube. A third type known as the selendang, a slender cloth worn around the neck, has become popular in recent years. Production Using mostly cotton threads, the cloth is created during the island's dry season, almost entirely by hand. The use of cotton is a legacy of the Portuguese colonial era, when Timor was an important port for the trade in the material. Synthetic fibers like rayon, acrylic and polyester are becoming more common as they are imported more cheaply into East Timor. A single tais can take anywhere from several days to a year, depending on the complexity of design and variety of colors used. Dyes are used to create bright colors in the tais; these are mixed from plants like taun, kinur, and teka. Other dyes are derived from mango skin, potato leaf, cactus flowers, and turmeric. Individuals skilled in mixing dyes are sometimes compared to alchemists, using traditional recipes for creating desired colors. Although colors carry different associations from village to village, red is often used predominantly, as it is connected to long life and courage, in addition to being the base of the East Timorese flag. When the United Nations became the administering power in East Timor from 1999‚Äì2002, tais markets increased production of blue fabrics to match that organization's trademark flag.Pride, p. 17. A collection of tais from around East Timor, 2003 One of the most common tools for tais weaving is the back-strap loom, which allows tension on the cloth while the warp is manipulated. The pressure from the strap and the time required for the intricate designs on many tais produce significant pain for many women. During the 1999 wave of violence known in East Timor as \\"Black September\\", many tais weavers saw their tools and equipment stolen or destroyed. Recent years have also seen a decline in the number of young women learning traditional methods of tais weaving. Regional variations Designs, colors, and styles of tais production vary greatly in each of East Timor's thirteen districts. In the enclave of Oecussi-Ambeno, Portuguese influence is most apparent, with floral and religious imagery predominating alongside subdued shades of black, orange, and yellow. In the capital city Dili, by contrast, bright colors and solid panels reflect the focus on tais commerce. In the district of Ermera, black-and-white designs are most common, reflecting the royalty of the traditional leaders, who often lived in the area. The village of Manufahi produces tais with certain common animal themes, specifically the lizard and pig.

The early 1990s brought the winning tradition back to Monmouth with a Jersey Cup championship and a return to Division I rugby. After some tough injuries and a few early retirements, the club suffered a couple of rough seasons. Since 1994, the club has shown its resilience by winning three of four second side Jersey Cup championships and has appeared in the National playoff picture 5 times in the past 10 years. The club has made the quarterfinals twice within the 5 appearances, both years suffering close losses to Snake River, Idaho. After an undefeated season in 02', Monmouth was again brought up to Division I rugby in the Met Union. The club, coping with a declining membership and difficult scheduling, endured for three years on the Division I level. The prospect of the Super League and competing against a larger population base brought them back to Division II. During the 1990s Monmouth has won the Jersey Cup Tournament three times and placed second in the premier division in the Saranc Lake Tournament. Monmouth Rugby Club has started the 2009 fall season by winning the Jersey Shore Tournament's Premier bracket with wins over Schuylkill River, Reading and New York Rugby Club. The 2009 fall season finished with Monmouth being beaten by Middlesex, MA in the semifinal of the Northeast Championships on Randall's Island, leaving Monmouth Ranked 4th in the Northeast. Monmouth started the Fall 2010 season by winning their own invitational tournament, beating Princeton Athletic Club in the Final. Monmouth finished the Division 1 regular season 4 - 4. This put Monmouth in the NE crossovers against Boston Irish Wolfhounds who had just come down to D1 from SuperLeague. The step up was too much for Monmouth and they were well beaten by the Wolfhounds in Canton. Spring 2011 has seen Monmouth recruit well and they are looking forward to a big fall season in Division 1. Monmouth finished the 2011 Fall season as the #1 ranked team in MetUnion Division 1.

In the 1970s its advertising campaign was, according to the manufacturer, the first to show bare skin. During the 1960s, the way in which cosmetics and skincare products were marketed and sold to consumers changed. Cosmetics and skincare products were originally just sold by specialist retailers, such as chemists and department stores. At the same time as the growth in grocery shopping in supermarkets and convenience stores, Henkel announced in 1967 the instigation of project Lebensmitteleinzelhandel-Kosmetik (‚Äúgrocery and retail-trade cosmetics‚Äù). Its aim was to develop different products specifically for self- service retailers, leading to the creation of Creme 21. The colour orange and the plastic container represented modernity.

It includes scenes featuring Western musicians Yehudi Menuhin and George Harrison, as well as footage of Shankar returning to Maihar in central India, where as a young man he trained under the mentorship of Allauddin Khan. The film also features a portion of Shankar and tabla player Alla Rakha's acclaimed performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. The majority of the documentary was shot in the late 1960s, during a period when Shankar's growing popularity saw Indian classical music embraced by rock and pop musicians and their audiences. Financial problems then delayed production until Harrison provided assistance through the Beatles' company Apple Films. In addition to actively promoting Raga, Harrison produced the soundtrack album ‚Äì a project that led directly to he and Shankar staging the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. The film's working title was alternately East Meets West and Messenger Out of the East. In 2010, to coincide with celebrations for Shankar's 90th birthday, East Meets West Music released a fully remastered version on DVD, titled Raga: A Film Journey into the Soul of India. The expanded soundtrack album was also made available, via digital download. Production New York film-maker Howard Worth began work on Raga, a documentary film on Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar, in 1967, during the height of what Shankar describes in My Music, My Life (1968), the first of his two autobiographies,Lavezzoli, pp. 187, 197. as \\"the great sitar explosion\\".Shankar, My Music, My Life, p. 100. The latter term reflected the interest that had grown in the West for Indian music and its extended works, known as ragas, over 1966‚Äì67,Lavezzoli, pp. 171‚Äì72. following the Beatles and other rock bands' adoption of the multi-stringed sitar into their sound.World Music: The Rough Guide, pp. 109‚Äì10.Robert Shelton, \\"Indian Raga Music Gains in Popularity Across U.S.\\" , New York Times, 20 December 1966 (retrieved 3 December 2013).

Music critic Ken Hunt describes him as having become \\"the most famous Indian musician on the planet\\" in 1966. Shankar was uncomfortable with this development,Lavezzoli, p. 172. since his training had instilled in him a sacred purpose for India's musical heritage\\"'My Music Not For Addicts' ‚Äì Shankar\\", KRLA Beat, 29 July 1967, p. 10; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 20 June 2014).\\"Ravi Shankar: 'Our music is sacred' ‚Äì a classic interview from the vaults\\", theguardian.com, 12 December 2012 (retrieved 13 August 2014). ‚Äì namely, Nada Brahma (\\"Sound is God\\").Shankar, My Music, My Life, pp. 65, 100, 102, 105.Leng, pp. 24, 27‚Äì28. The film documents Shankar's concern that while old traditions were dying in India, they were simultaneously being misappropriated by America's youth culture,Shankar, Raga Mala, pp. 209, 210. particularly through many in the West choosing to associate Indian classical music with psychedelic drugs.Sue C. Clark, \\"Ravi Shankar: The Rolling Stone Interview\\", Rolling Stone, 9 March 1968 (retrieved 15 December 2013).Clayson, pp. 210‚Äì11. Speaking in 2010 of his involvement in Raga, Worth recalled that he disliked Indian music initially, but soon changed his view. At the request of Canadian television producer Nancy Bacal, he attended a private recital by Shankar, in the company of singers Judy Collins and Leonard Cohen, a performance that convinced Worth that he wanted to direct the planned Shankar documentary after all. (retrieved 1 November 2013). Worth also served as producer,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 320. and he and Bacal worked on a script at Collins's house in California. The film was originally called East Meets West, according to author Peter Lavezzoli;Lavezzoli, p. 184. Messenger Out of the East was an alternative working title.Clayson, p. 308. The first of these titles referenced West Meets East, Shankar's 1966 album with American violinist Yehudi Menuhin, and the winner of the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance.Lavezzoli, pp. 8, 63. Filming Much of Raga was shot during the first half of 1968 in India, particularly Bombay, home to Shankar's Kinnara School of Music since 1963.Shankar, My Music, My Life, p. 97. Among the scenes filmed in India, Shankar directs musicians such as Shivkumar Sharma, Hariprasad Chaurasia and Kartick Kumar in a Bombay studio and, in a scene titled \\"Vinus House\\", enjoys a casual musical get-together with singer Vinay Bharat Ram and violinist Satyadev Pawar. Maihar Railway Station in 2009. In Raga, Shankar journeys by train to Maihar as part of his reaffirmation of his cultural roots. Early in the film, Shankar travels by train to the Madhya Pradesh town of Maihar, to see his father-in-law and esteemed music teacher (or guru), Allauddin Khan,Lavezzoli, pp. 15, 51, 184. known affectionately as \\"Baba\\".Shankar, My Music, My Life, pp. 58‚Äì60.Reginald Massey, \\"Ravi Shankar obituary\\", The Guardian, 12 December 2012 (retrieved 13 August 2014). Worth recalls this visit as a nervous occasion for Shankar, who states in his role as narrator: \\"Whenever I think of [Baba], I have a mixture of fear and awe. For us, guru is sometimes greater even than God.\\" Another scene features dancers from the South Indian kathakali tradition, reflecting Shankar's early career as a dancer with elder brother Uday's pioneering troupe during the 1930s.Ken Hunt, \\"Ravi Shankar\\", AllMusic (retrieved 24 November 2013).\\"Ravi Shankar Raga: A Film Journey into the Soul of India DVD\\", East Meets West Music (retrieved 1 November 2013). According to Worth, the emotional highpoint of filming was when Shankar visited his spiritual guru, named Tat Baba.Shankar, My Music, My Life, pp. 89‚Äì90.Clayson, p. 207. In his own teaching activities, Shankar is shown mentoring students at Kinnara, adhering to the strict guru-shishya tradition he had experienced under Allauddin Khan.Lavezzoli, pp. 12‚Äì13, 51. Shankar later reflects on the comparative rush to master the intricacies of Indian music by his Western students in Los Angeles, where he opened a branch of the Kinnara School in May 1967.Shankar, My Music, My Life, pp. 97‚Äì98. Raga includes footage of a pair of celebrated live performances by Shankar from 1967, a year that Lavezzoli describes as the \\"annus mirabilis\\" for Indian music in the West.Lavezzoli, pp. 6, 63, 184. The first performance was from the Monterey Pop Festival in northern California on 18 June, where Shankar was accompanied by his longtime tabla player, Alla Rakha.Lavezzoli, pp. 7, 105‚Äì06, 180‚Äì81. The film shows Shankar and his companion Kamala ChakravartyShankar, Raga Mala, pp. 157, 196, 268‚Äì69.Priyanka Dasgupta, Purba Dutt & Nona Walia, \\"Meet India's bohemian lovers\\", Times of India, 18 February 2012 (retrieved 15 December 2013). circulating among the crowd before his performance, and American musicians Jerry Garcia and Jimi Hendrix among \\"the enthralled spectators\\" while he plays, according to Lavezzoli.Lavezzoli, p. 181. The second of these 1967 performances, a recital featuring Menuhin and Shankar, was filmed six months later on Human Rights Day, at the United Nations building in New York.Lavezzoli, pp. 7‚Äì8. Shankar's scenes with George Harrison were filmed at the Esalen Institute in California. Another milestone for the popularity of Indian music was the June 1967 release of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album,World Music: The Rough Guide, p. 109. the \\"spiritual centerpiece\\" of which, Lavezzoli writes, was George Harrison's Indian composition \\"Within You, Without You\\".Lavezzoli, pp. 6‚Äì7, 180. Harrison joined Shankar in Madras in April 1968, following the Beatles' stay at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's meditation ashram in Rishikesh,Miles, pp. 293, 296. but a bout of dysentery prevented him from participating in filming for Raga. Worth subsequently filmed Harrison's contributions at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California,George Harrison, pp. 57‚Äì58. on 10‚Äì11 June 1968.Badman, p. 54. In one of the scenes, Harrison receives sitar tuition from Shankar; in another, they both participate in a singing class with students from Kinnara. While his immersion in Indian music had been the most significant factor behind Shankar's recent rise to international fame,Clayson, p. 210.Philip Glass, \\"George Harrison, World-Music Catalyst and Great-Souled Man; Open to the Influence of Unfamiliar Cultures\\", New York Times, 9 December 2001 (retrieved 1 December 2013). Harrison would later cite this visit to Esalen as presaging the end of his commitment to the sitar.Lavezzoli, pp. 171‚Äì72, 177‚Äì78.Mitchell Glazer, \\"Growing Up at 33‚Öì: The George Harrison Interview\\", Crawdaddy, February 1977, p. 41. As of 2006, the scene in Raga featuring Shankar instructing Harrison was the only known film footage of Harrison playing the sitar during his years as a member of the Beatles.Unterberger, p. 202. California was also the location for the film's penultimate scene, in which Shankar, looking out over a windswept beach, questions the validity of his attempts to bring Indian culture to America.Shankar, Raga Mala, pp. 210‚Äì11. In his narration for the scene, he reads out a passage adapted from My Music, My Life, reaffirming his belief in Nada Brahma. Apple Films' involvement After the main filming over 1967‚Äì68 in India and the United States,Shankar, Raga Mala, pp. 209‚Äì10. financial and technical problems interrupted production on Raga.Lavezzoli, pp. 184, 187. According to Worth's recollection, the original financier for the project, whom he describes as \\"Ravi's manager\\", was forced to back out, having been committed to a psychiatric ward. In Raga Mala, Shankar says that he financed the film himself, adding: \\"which was rather sad because it cost a large amount and I only realised this later!\\"Shankar, Raga Mala, p. 210. Once back in New York, Worth contacted Harrison, hoping to secure support from United Artists, the film studio responsible for the Beatles' feature films A Hard Day's Night, Help! and Yellow Submarine.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 317‚Äì18. Late in 1970, Harrison attended a special screening of the assembled footage and was so moved, according to Worth, that within days he offered the services of the Beatles' own Apple Films as a distributor. Worth credits Harrison with saving the production and thereby \\"chang[ing] my life\\". Soundtrack The majority of Ragas musical soundtrack was recorded between April and July 1968.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 107. Aside from the recitals featured in the film, Shankar provided incidental music, the co-ordination of which was credited to his sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar (for pieces classed as \\"East\\") and American musician Collin Walcott (\\"West\\").Credits, Raga: A Film Journey into the Soul of India. Among the notable Indian musicians contributing to the soundtrack were Bismillah Khan (shehnai), Shivkumar Sharma (santoor), Hariprasad Chaurasia (bansuri), Aashish Khan (sarod), Shankar Ghosh and Zakir Hussain (both tabla), and singer Jitendra Abhisheki. For a scene that Shankar describes in Raga Mala as \\"reflect[ing] all the distortions in that period ‚Äì Indian music mixed up with rock, hippies and drugs\\", Walcott created a piece titled \\"Frenzy and Distortion\\", using \\"a profusion of electronic sounds\\". In June and through to July 1971, Harrison, as producer, prepared the recordings for release in conjunction with the movie.Badman, p. 36.Madinger & Easter, pp. 422, 435. While Shankar and Harrison were working in Los Angeles, news broke of the atrocities being committed by West Pakistan against the people of Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan, and before that, East Bengal).John Harris, \\"A Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, July 2001, p. 74. In response to a plea for assistance from Shankar, a Bengali by birth, Harrison set about organising the Concert for Bangladesh, held at Madison Square Garden, New York, on 1 August.Leng, p. 111.Lavezzoli, pp. 187‚Äì88. Work on the Raga soundtrack was completed in mid July, around the time of sessions for Shankar's Apple Records EP Joi Bangla.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 103. Release Raga received a limited release in November 1971, solely in the United States. Harrison helped promote the film, starting with an interview for New York's WPLJ Radio,\\"Irish Sitar\\", Contra Band Music, 3 May 2012 (retrieved 7 November 2013). and he attended a press screening at Carnegie Hall Cinema on 22 November, along with former bandmate John Lennon and their wives. While Shankar attended the premiere there the following night, Harrison instead appeared on The Dick Cavett Show, discussing Raga and bemoaning the delay surrounding the release of the live album from the Concert for Bangladesh.Badman, p. 55.\\"Big Bop Baby\\", Contra Band Music, 4 May 2012 (retrieved 7 November 2013). Shankar joined him late in the show, during which Harrison also plugged Concerto for Sitar & Orchestra, Shankar's recently released collaboration with Andr√© Previn and the London Symphony Orchestra.Rodriguez, pp. 321‚Äì22. On 24 November, Shankar and Harrison filmed an appearance on The David Frost Show,Madinger & Easter, p. 439. where they again discussed the film and Harrison gave a rare demonstration on sitar.Badman, pp. 55‚Äì56. Two days later, Shankar performed at Carnegie Hall, accompanied by Rakha and Chakravarty, giving his first New York concert since the Concert for Bangladesh shows in August.Billboard staff, \\"Shankar, 'Raga' At Carnegie\\", Billboard, 27 November 1971, p. 16 (retrieved 30 August 2015). Writing in The New York Times in November 1971, film critic Howard Thompson described Raga as \\"quietly penetrating\\" and \\"beautifully made\\", adding: \\"Everything about it is admirable.\\"Howard Thompson, \\"Screen: Ravi Shankar; 'Raga,' a Documentary, at Carnegie Cinema\\", New York Times, 24 November 1971, p. 23 (retrieved 1 November 2013). On 7 December 1971, Apple Records released the soundtrack album (as Apple SWAO 3384) ‚Äì like the film, in America only.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 107, 320. Billboards album reviewer commented on the packaging's \\"superb photo folio showing the sitarist's career\\" but said that, due to the fact that only portions of ragas were present, the soundtrack's \\"greatest attractiveness may be to those who see the movie or are Shankar collectors\\".\\"Album Reviews\\", Billboard, 18 December 1971, p. 25 (retrieved 1 November 2013). In August 1972, Harrison screened Raga for select guests at a cinema in Mayfair, London, to coincide with Shankar's upcoming appearance at Southwark Cathedral.Badman, p. 80. According to a report in Record Mirror in early November 1973, the film was due to open in London later that same month.Peter Jones (ed.), \\"Reflections: Ravi raga saga\\", Record Mirror, 10 November 1973, p. 10. When asked at the press conference for his and Shankar's 1974 North American tour whether the attendant publicity was likely to lead to a re-release for Raga in the US, Harrison expressed his hope that it would, but lamented that the restrictions imposed on cinema operators by film distributors were \\"like the way the record industry was ten years ago\\". He added: \\"If you don't work on Maggie's farm, you don't get your movie on, you know?\\"Steven Rosen, \\"George Harrison\\", Rock's Backpages, 2008 (subscription required; retrieved 5 July 2016). Reissue Raga was released on home video in 1991, distributed by Mystic Fire Video.Madinger & Easter, p. 422.

Importance The importance of MIH derives from the fact that a diverse range of broadband wireless access technologies is available and in course of development, including GSM, UMTS, CDMA2000, WiMAX, Mobile-Fi and WPANs. Multimode wireless devices that incorporate more than one of these wireless interfaces require the ability to switch among them during the course of an IP session, and devices such as laptops with Ethernet and wireless interfaces need to switch similarly between wired and wireless access. Handover may be required, e.g. because a mobile device experiences a degradation in the radio signal, or because an access point experiences a heavy traffic load. Functionality The key functionality provided by MIH is communication among the various wireless layers and between them and the IP layer. The required messages are relayed by the Media Independent Handover Function, MIHF, that is located in the protocol stack between the layer 2 wireless technologies and IP at layer 3. MIH may communicate with various IP protocols including Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for signaling, Mobile IP for mobility management, and DiffServ and IntServ for QoS. When a session is handed off from one access point to another access point using the same technology, the handover can usually be performed within that wireless technology itself without involving MIHF or IP. For instance a VoIP call from a Wi-Fi handset to a Wi-Fi access point can be handed over to another Wi-Fi access point within the same network, e.g. a corporate network, using Wi-Fi standards such as 802.11f and 802.11r. However, if the handover is from a Wi-Fi access point in a corporate network to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, then MIH is required, since the two access points cannot communicate with each other at the link layer, and are, in general, on different IP subnets. When a session is handed off from one wireless technology to another, MIH may assist the handover process by exchanging messages among the Internet access technologies and IP. Message are of three types: ‚Ä¢ Event notifications are passed from a lower layer in the protocol stack to a higher layer or between the MIHF of one device to the MIHF of another device. For instance ‚Äúwireless link quality is degrading‚Äù is an event notification that is passed from the wireless layer to the MIHF layer. ‚Ä¢ Commands are passed down the protocol stack or between the MIHF of one device to the MIHF of another device. For instance ‚ÄúInitiate Handover‚Äù is a command in which the access point MIHF provides the mobile device MIHF with a list of alternative access points that it could use. ‚Ä¢ Information Service is of three types. A higher layer may request information from a lower layer, e.g. the MIHF may request performance information, such as delay from the wireless layer. A lower layer may request information from a higher layer, e.g. the MIHF may request to know the ISP Name from the IP layer. One MIHF may request information from another MIHF, e.g. the availability of location-based services. Implementation The MIH function, MIHF, is implemented: ‚Ä¢ in mobile devices that have more than one wireless/wired interface; ‚Ä¢ in access points that have at least one wireless interface; ‚Ä¢ in core network equipment that may have no wireless interface. Mobile devices and access points clearly need to implement MIHF in order to communicate in a standard way between each other and between the wireless and IP layers. This allows them to make their own local decisions as to whether and how to handover a session. The reason for MIHF in core network equipment with no wireless interface is to enable the design of ‚Äúhandover servers‚Äù which can make centralized decisions about the handover of sessions among multiple access points and multiple access technologies. Such servers allow a wireless network operator to balance the traffic load so as to alleviate congestion on specific access points, and deliver sufficient QoS to all users.  Quality of Service (QoS)  Short- lived sessions such as accessing a single web page typically do not require handover or QoS. Longer duration sessions, which may well require handover, such as VoIP, audio/video streaming (including live TV and VoD), and VPNs, typically have QoS requirements including delay, delay variation and packet loss. It is important that QoS is maintained, not just before and after a handover, but also during the handover, and this can be achieved by using MIH to plan ahead. Before a handover is required, the MIHFs communicate to identify which access points using which wireless technologies are within range and what QoS is available from them. MIH can also be used to pre- authenticate the mobile device with alternative potential access points and to reserve capacity prior to handover. For instance WiMAX allows resources to be reserved for a session before they are actually allocated to that session. When a handover becomes necessary, much of the ground-work is therefore already in place and the session can be handed over with minimal delay and packet loss. Incoming packets to the mobile device that are delivered to the old access point after the handover can be forwarded via the new access point, thus further reducing packet loss. QoS is handled differently by each technology, including both the wireless access technologies and also IP, which has two QoS approaches, DiffServ and IntServ. Some technologies divide traffic into ‚ÄúService Classes‚Äù, e.g. streaming, while others allow users to specify quantitative ‚ÄúQoS Parameters‚Äù, e.g. transfer delay. WiFi, Mobile-Fi and DiffServ use the service class approach and although they do not have exactly the same service classes, it is possible to make a correspondence among them. WiMAX and IntServ use the QoS parameter approach, and UMTS uses both approaches. Again correspondences among parameters can be made, [1]. MIH can be used to exchange information about service class and QoS parameter availability from one wireless technology to another and to the IP layer. One source of such information is performance measurements made by the wireless layer, e.g. 802.11k for WiFi and 802.16f for WiMAX. Example MIH Scenario To illustrate the operation of MIH, let us take an example of a real-time gaming application, using DiffServ at the IP layer, being handed over from Mobile-Fi to WiMAX. The application is currently using the Assured Forwarding Class 1, AF1, DiffServ service, and the Class 2 Real-Time Interactive Mobile- Fi service. Since the MIH standard is not yet finalized, this example is illustrative of the type of functionality that may be provided, as opposed to a firm guarantee of what will become available. Also the standard specifies the MIH messages. The use of those messages in any particular application is implementation dependent. The example below is for illustrative purposes only. 1\\\\. The mobile device notices a degradation in the Mobile-Fi wireless signal strength and uses the MIH Event Notification Service to inform the MIHF layer in the mobile device. This information is passed to the MIHF in the access point. 2\\\\. The access point uses the MIH Command Service to tell the mobile device to initiate handover and includes a list of potential access points. 3\\\\. The mobile device MIHF passes this list to its various wireless layers and, using the MIH Information Service, requests them to determine the signal strength of each access point and report back to the MIHF. 4\\\\. The MIHF in the mobile device determines that the best signal strength comes from a WiMAX access point, and passes that information to its IP layer, using the Event Notification Service. 5\\\\. DiffServ at the IP layer in the mobile device uses the Information Service to request performance information from the WiMAX access point. This request is passed through the mobile device MIHF, via the WiMAX access point MIHF, to the WiMAX access point wireless layer. 6\\\\. The WiMAX layer in the access point uses IEEE 802.16f to obtain the performance information and reports back that it can schedule the session using its Unsolicited Grant Service, UGS, with a link delay of 5 ms, or on its Real-Time Polling Service with a link delay of 18 ms. 7\\\\. DiffServ selects the WiMAX UGS, and uses the MIH Command Service to tell the mobile device to commit to handover. It may also use Mobile IP if a change in the mobile device IP address is required. Related Standards Another standard that can be used for handover from one wireless technology to another is UMA, Unlicensed Mobile Access, which provides handover between WiFi and GSM/GPRS/UMTS. It was originally developed by an independent industry consortium and was incorporated into the 3GPP standards in 2005 under the name GAN (Generic Access Network). Another standard of interest is 802.11u which provides roaming between 802.11 networks and other networks, so that services from one network can be accessed when the user is subscribed to services from another network. However it does not provide handover of IP sessions in progress.

He headed the Department of Black Studies and the Department of Political Science and served as the Director of the Center for Black Studies Research. Robinson's areas of interest included classical and modern political philosophy, radical social theory in the African diaspora, comparative politics, racial capitalism, and the relationships between and among media and politics. Early life Robinson was born in Oakland, California, on November 5, 1940. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a B.A. in social anthropology in 1963, and Stanford University, where he received an M.A. and Ph.D. in political theory in 1974. He became a political activist during his student days, when he protested against the university administration and American foreign and domestic policies along with other Black radical students.Cedric J. Robinson: the Making of a Black Radical Intellectual, Robin Kelley, June 2016 Robinson's grandfather influenced his radical political views. As a political radical in 1920s Alabama, his grandfather was ultimately forced to leave to save his life and decided to go to California. Robinson named Winston Whiteside, C. L. R. James, and Terrence Hopkins as other thinkers who shaped his political outlook.Revisiting Black Marxism in the Wake of Black Lives Matter, Robin Kelley, November 2016 Career and public service After leaving Berkeley, Robinson was drafted into the U.S. Army and also worked at the Alameda County Probation Department. From 1971 to 1973, Cedric was a lecturer in Political Science and Black Studies at the University of Michigan. In 1973, Cedric accepted his first tenure, a track job at Binghamton University‚ÄìState University of New York. In 1978, Robinson joined the faculty at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and became director of the Center for Black Studies Research. In 1980, trying to correct what they saw as overall media bias as well as media laziness in accepting what the White House, the US State Department, and The Pentagon said about the Third World and American relations with it, Robinson and UCSB student Corey Dubin started Third World News Review (TWNR) on the campus and community radio station, KCSB. Five years later the program became available on public access television. Since 1980, UCSB students from the Third World and other UCSB faculty members have contributed to the program, produced it, or both.Elizabeth Robinson, \\"Twenty-five years of the Third World News Review,\\" Race & Class, October 2005; Vol. 47, No. 2: 77-81, citation p. 78.

The operation was part of the wider Battle of the Scheldt and involved two assault landings from the sea by the 4th Special Service Brigade and the 52nd (Lowland) Division. At the same time the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division would force a crossing of the Walcheren causeway. Background Walcheren Island The city of Antwerp and its port was captured by British 2nd Army in early September 1944. While 21st Army Group's priority at the time was Operation Market-Garden, no sense of urgency was placed in securing the approaches to the port facilities there. Walcheren Island, at the western end of the Beveland Peninsula, overlooked the Scheldt Estuary, and was strongly garrisoned by the German 15th Army who had emplaced strong concrete fortifications and large calibre guns which made it impossible to transit the waterway into Antwerp. Because of this delay, the remnants of the 15th Army \\"had been given the time to escape and reinforce the island of Walcheren and the South Beveland Peninsula\\". The First Canadian Army was tasked by 21st Army Group to open the Antwerp area; but in the meantime had also been detailed by Montgomery to capture the channel ports of Boulogne, Dunkirk and Calais, in order to ease the logistical concerns associated with drawing supplies from the Normandy beaches. German tenacity in the channel ports meant that the Allied supply lines would continue to extend the further away the front line advanced. The channel ports were eventually \\"masked\\" when Montgomery changed his priorities to clearing the Scheldt after the failure of Operation MARKET GARDEN and the Canadians turned their attention to the Battle of the Scheldt. The First Canadian Army advanced north-west from the bridgehead in Antwerp and, after heavy fighting in early and mid-October, broke out onto the narrow isthmus which connected South-Beveland to the mainland. On 9 October 1944 Field Marshal Montgomery issued a directive directing the Canadian Army to give absolute priority to the clearing of the Scheldt over any other offensive operations.Canadian Official History p387 and ten days later the Canadians began their approach to Walcheren Island along the isthmus. To the south of the Scheldt, the Germans had been cornered in Zeebrugge, surrendering the Breskens Pocket on November 2. Both South and North-Beveland had been virtually cleared and the time was right for the assault of Walcheren itself. For the Allies, failure to take Middelburg after the Battle of Walcheren Causeway was a disappointing prelude to Operation Infatuate. Prelude A three-pronged assault was planned with British Commandos and part of the 52nd (Lowland) Division landing at Westkapelle in the west of the island and at Flushing in the south. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division was to cross by a water channel close to the causeway in the east. However, in the Battle of Walcheren Causeway, it soon became clear that the tidal flats around the water channel were virtually impassable leaving the Canadians with the hazardous option of a direct assault along the well-defended causeway ‚Äî an exposed stretch 40 yards wide and 1500 yards long. The Canadians established a bridgehead on the island through which the British 52nd Lowland Division attempted to pass. Against much scepticism and opposition, the plan of Lieut.-Gen. Guy Simonds (acting commander of First Canadian Army) to breach the island's dykes, and flood the interior, was adopted. The plan to flood the island by bombing breaches in the dykes at Westkapelle, Flushing, and Veere, was controversial from the start. General Simonds, the main protagonist, thought that it would enable the attackers to approach the German positions from both the sea and the inundated-inland sides with landing craft. But the Canadian engineer, brigadier G. Walsh, who advised upon the matter pointed out that the breach would be too shallow for landing craft to pass through. The plan was apparently not discussed with the Dutch government-in-exile. When Prime Minister Gerbrandy got wind of the plan, he immediately demanded to see Winston Churchill, but Churchill denied any knowledge of the plan. When general Dwight D. Eisenhower approved of the bombing on 1 October, he appears not to have consulted the Dutch either. The military advantages of flooding the interior of the island were questionable, as it hampered both attackers and defenders. The German defenses were concentrated on the high-lying rim of the island; apart from the land-facing front in Flushing, there were no defensible positions inside the flooded area. The civilians living on the island were warned with leaflets dropped from planes to leave the area, but they had nowhere to go. The bombing of Walcheren in October by RAF Bomber Command had deliberately breached the dykes around the island and had turned it into a massive lagoon, rimmed by broken dykes. The Germans had installed defences on the dykes to virtually turn them into a continuous fortification bristling with guns of every calibre. The British Marines placed great reliance on Weasel and Buffalo amphibious landing craft. The Royal Marine Commandos were to seize the shoulders of the gap in the dyke and then to fan out north and south to roll up the remainder of the German defences by linking up with the southern thrust. The RAF provided air support and the 79th Armoured Division provided specialist vehicles in support of the ground assault, naval gunfire support was from warships and landing craft equipped with artillery (e.g. Landing Craft (Gun)) and Land Mattress multiple-rocket launch systems. Commando Units No. 2 Dutch Troop of 10 IA (Inter-Allied) Commando moved to Brugge in Belgium on 20 October 1944 and was incorporated into No. 4 Commando Brigade. They split up and were attached to other fighting units where, in the case of some officers and men, their native language skills helped Allied liaison with the local population, while others fought alongside their comrades in arms. The three RM Commandos of No.4 Special Service Brigade, along with the No.4 (Belgian) and No.5 (Norwegian), troops of No.10 (IA) Commando, commanded by Peter Laycock, landed at Westkapelle on the western side of the island. No.4 Commando, with Nos.1 and 8 (French) troops under command, crossed from Breskens and attacked Flushing. In support were 155 Infantry brigade. The brigade had trained for this assault in the Ostend area during October. Landings Map of fighting on and near Walcheren in October and November 1944 After some debate over the sea conditions the operation was planned for 1 November. On the day of the assault a heavy mist over Dutch and Belgian airfields limited RAF support for the actual landings, although the skies over Walcheren itself were clear. Landing at Flushing (operation Infatuate I) No. 4 Commando landed at 05:45 hours just east of the Oranjemolen, a windmill on the sea dyke at Flushing, with the main part of the troops arriving ashore at 06:30 hours. No. 4 Commando, under Lt-Colonel Robert W.P. Dawson DSO, had problems finding a suitable place to get ashore. Dawson sent a small reconnaissance party (known as Keepforce) ashore in two Landing Craft Personnel (LCPs). They were followed by Nos. 1 and 2 Troop, who secured the beachhead with minimal casualties and soon began to take prisoners. The main body came in at 06:30 hours, but by this time the Germans were totally alert and opened heavy fire with machine guns and 20 mm anti- aircraft cannon. Nevertheless, the Commandos got ashore with only a few casualties, although the Landing Craft Assaults (LCAs) containing the heavier equipment, including 3-inch mortars, hit a stake and sank some offshore. The mortars were successfully salvaged. The Commandos now fought their way through the German strongpoints. They were somewhat encumbered by the need to leave rearguards against infiltration. However, they were aided when the leading battalion of 155 Infantry Brigade began to land at 08:30 hours despite having lost two LCAs to heavy fire from one of the coastal batteries. German prisoners were pressed into service unloading stores and supplies. A good proportion of the defenders of Walcheren were poor-quality troops and many suffered from stomach complaints. Curiously the defence positions were well stocked with food and ammunition. By 16:00 hours the Commandos had reached most of their objectives and they decided to consolidate as the day drew to a close. Landing at Westkapelle (operation Infatuate II) The battle for Walcheren Island: An aerial photograph of bombs exploding on the Walcheren dyke, the Netherlands during RAF Bomber Command's raid on the island. Brigadier Leicester's plan for the attack on Westkapelle called for three troops of No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando, under Lt-Colonel E C E Palmer RM, to land on the north shoulder of the gap blown in the dyke with the objective of clearing the area between there and the village of Westkapelle. The remainder of the Commando, along with the two No. 10 (IA) Commando troops, would then come ashore in M29 Weasels and Buffaloes launched from Landing Craft Tanks (LCTs). Their mission would be to clear Westkapelle and then move north. No. 48 (Royal Marine) Commando, under Lt-Colonel J. L. Moulton DSO, would use the same methods, but come ashore south of the gap. From there they would advance on Zoutelande some to the southeast. Finally No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando, under Lt-Colonel C.F. Phillips, landed behind 48 Commando and drove on to meet up with 4 Commando near Flushing. The force sailed from Ostend at 03:15 hours and by 09:30 hours they were off the objective. The ships bombarded the German defences with everything at their disposal including the guns of , Erebus and Roberts, the Landing Craft (Gun)s, the rockets of LCT(R)s. The first German fire at 8:09 was followed by the other batteries. Most of the German fire was concentrated on the support landing craft rather than those carrying the troops.Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War, Vol III The Victory Campaign: The Operations in Northwest Europe, 1944-45 p417-418 Several landing craft were hit including a rocket LCT which received a direct hit, accidentally causing it to fire rockets at LCT(G)s located closer to the island, hitting five and wounding thirty, while some rockets from the other LCT(R)s fell short, hitting friendly craft. The RAF was able to provide a squadron (No. 183 Squadron) of explosive rocket-firing Typhoon fighter-bombers just at the point the LCTs were due to land. Part of the naval Support Squadron of 27 small craft, under Commanders Sellar and Leefe, closed to engage the eleven still-operational German shore-based batteries, on the direction of Captain A.F. Pugsley, R.N., DSO, the naval commander of the amphibious landings. This they did with conspicuous gallantry, but with very heavy casualties. By 12.30pm, nine of the Support Squadron's craft had been sunk, eleven put out of action, and a high percentage of their crews killed or wounded. Ultimately the Support Squadron was recalled as so many of the craft had been damaged or destroyed, but their aim, of drawing the fire of the defending batteries from the landing craft making the primary assault, had succeeded.Destroyer Man, autobiography of Rear-Admiral AF Pugsley in collaboration with Captain Donald Macintyre. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1957Walcheren 1944: Storming Hitler's Island Fortress Royal Marine Commandos landing at Walcheren using DUKW's, LVT, LCT's and Buffalo amphibians on 1 November 1944 In a tribute to the bravery of the Support Squadron, General Laycock, Chief of Combined Operations, wrote to Captain A.F. Pugsley with the following words: > \\"I understand that the success of the landings and the comparatively light > casualties sustained by No. 4 Special Service Brigade at Walcheren was due > largely to the heroic efforts of the Naval Support Craft who, at great cost > to themselves, effectively silenced the coastal defences. I should like to > express the appreciation of all ranks, Special Service Group, and > particularly that of General Sturges and Brigadier Leicester and all ranks > of No. 4 Special Service Brigade for the self-sacrifice shown by all naval > personnel during the landings, which had such splendid results.\\" The naval haul of gallantry awards was significant. Of particular note were the actions of Leading Seaman Owen Joseph McGrath who was Coxswain of a Landing Craft (LCP(L) 144) during the assault on Westkapelle. McGrath's citation for the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (the highest award for gallantry available to non-commissioned naval personnel short of the Victoria Cross) reads as follows: \\"[LCP(L) 144's] duty was to make smoke on the Southern flank. Many craft were hit by the accurate enemy fire, and some blew up very close inshore under the enemy guns. LCP(L) 144 was ordered to close, make smoke and pick up survivors. This was done at point blank range with an off- shore wind making effective smoke difficult. By his courageous action Leading Seaman McGrath rescued over twenty survivors\\".Supplement to the London Gazette 6 March 1945Sixth Supplement to the London Gazette 19 December 1944 Back on the island of Walcheren, 41 Commando overran a pillbox in their path and pushed on into Westkapelle where they were met by a battery of four guns. These were reduced with the help of some tanks and the Commando then moved north along the dyke. 48 Commando came up against a battery of guns. The leading troop commander was killed and several men wounded in an attack on the position. Another attempt was met with intense mortar fire. Supporting fire was called in from the field batteries in the Breskens area together with Typhoon attacks. Following this action another troop went in under cover of smoke and reached the centre of the battery putting it out of action. Men of the 4th Special Service Brigade wade ashore from landing craft near Flushing to complete the occupation of Walcheren The next day 4 Commando, together with the 5th Battalion of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, continued with the battle for Flushing. No. 5 (Norwegian) Troop of 10 (IA) Commando were involved in an action against a strongpoint nicknamed Dover. One section of the troop gained the roof of a cinema and opened fire on the strongpoint with their PIAT. The other sections moved along the street and through back gardens. As the Troop was preparing for the final assault, Typhoons attacked the enemy position. That afternoon the Troop resumed their advance and reached the corner overlooking their objective. One house remained occupied by the Germans and as they made for the strongpoint they suffered several casualties from the fire of No. 5 Troop. No. 1 Section was now by an anti-tank wall and firing PIAT bombs into the embrasures of the strongpoint at very short range. Corporal Lafont was on the point of breaching the strongpoint with a made-up charge at the ready when the German defenders surrendered. No. 48 (RM) Commando pushed on at first light and took Zoutelande, meeting only light opposition. 47 Commando took over the advance but soon came up against a strong fortified position with an anti-tank ditch and Dragon's Teeth. The weather had closed in and no air support was available so they attacked supported only by artillery. They came under heavy mortar fire and suffered several casualties. The other half of the Commando having moved along the dyke were confronted by another battery at Dishoek. Their approach was obstructed by pockets of resistance to the front of the battery which were not cleared until nightfall. The three Troops halted in front of the battery and repulsed a German counterattack just after they had been replenished with much-needed food and ammunition. Defensive stakes and mines on the beaches made it difficult for supply craft to land stores. By the third and fourth days the Commando were forced to use captured German rations. To the relief of all concerned supplies were parachuted in on 5 November near Zoutelande. Marine Commandos operating 3\\" mortars behind the cover of amphibious vehicles - they are wearing Denison smocks Nos. 41 and 10 Commando reached Domburg on the morning of 2 November where they encountered strong resistance. That evening Brigadier Leicester ordered No. 41, less one Troop, to assist No. 47 Commando in the south, leaving the Troops of No. 10 and one of No. 41 to finish mopping up Domburg. No. 4 Commando was relieved by 155 Brigade and embarked on Buffaloes to assault two batteries, W3 and W4, situated north-west of Flushing. They had been fighting for 40 hours and needed a well-earned rest. After landing in a gap in the dyke, about which little was known, Lt-Colonel Dawson asked Brigadier Leicester for a break of some 24 hours to rest his men. This was agreed, but it was well after dark before the Commando was relieved by 155 Brigade. In the event No. 47 (RM) Commando overcame the opposition at Dishoek later that day and linked up with 4 Commando. Meanwhile, No. 10 cleared Domburg, with the Commando's Norwegian Troop showing particular courage in the face of heavy opposition which cost them a number of casualties. In the after-action report of the battle Captain J. Linzel of No. 10 Commando stated: > This operation had more impact on me. The objective was to clear the seaway > to Antwerp.

Aftermath German prisoners on Walcheren - around 40,000 were taken after the operation had terminated Nos. 4, 47, 48 Commandos then concentrated at Zoutelande and a two-day pause ensued while they re-supplied. The remaining enemy resistance was concentrated in the area north-west of Domburg. Nos.4 and 48 Commando set off on foot, although they used landing vehicles to cross the gap at Westkapelle, in order to reinforce No.10 and No.41. While No. 41 assaulted the last remaining battery, W19, No.4 cleared the Overduin woods and pushed on to Vrouwenpolder opposite North Beveland. No.48 remained in reserve - this phase of the operation began on November 8. At 08:15, four Germans approached the Allied troops to ask for a surrender of all remaining German troops in the area. After some negotiation 40,000 Germans surrendered and for them the war was over. No.4 SS Brigade had lost 103 killed, 325 wounded and 68 missing during eight days of fighting. By the end of November after a massive minesweeping operation of the Scheldt, the first cargoes were being unloaded at Antwerp. Long-term after-effects for the civilians Clement Attlee (in the DUKW) visiting inundated Walcheren in 1945 The Inundation of Walcheren with which Operation Infatuate started, had long-term after-effects for the civilian population of Walcheren. Twice a day, at high tide and ebb tide, the sea water streamed with force through the breaches in the sea dikes, widening and deepening them. As a consequence, areas that fell dry at low tide were inundated again at high tide. Only the areas that were normally above sea level, like the town and village centers, remained permanently dry. Other low- lying areas, on the other hand, remained permanently flooded. This played havoc with Walcheren agriculture, as valuable land was permanently spoiled by salination. Because the pace of the flooding had been slow, loss of human life due to drowning had been minor, but most of the livestock drowned. Of 19,000 dwellings 3,700 were destroyed; 7,700 had severe damage and 3,600 minor damage. Attempts to close the breaches already started in November 1944, but lack of building materials, and of heavy construction equipment, and the destroyed infrastructure, together with the extensive minefields, hampered these efforts. When in July 1945 the operations of closing the breaches started in earnest, the total width of the breaches had already increased to three kilometers. The great depth of the scoured-out breaches made simply moving earth into them infeasible. Therefore surplus caissons that had not been needed to form the Phoenix breakwaters of the Mulberry harbours were used to block the deepest part of the breaches, after which normal dike-building operations could proceed. The breach at Flushing was finally closed on 2 October 1945, followed by the breach at Westkapelle on 12 October. The third breach, at Veere, was closed on 23 October. Then the work of draining the flooded areas could start. To that end a breach was made in the western levee of the Canal through Walcheren. This made it possible to slowly drain the main mass of water through the locks at Veere and Flushing by opening them at ebb tide. But to completely drain the area additional pumping was necessary, which required first opening up the drainage ditches that had been silted up. The draining operation was finished in early 1946.

Greenwood Press, New York City) is an American high school teacher and author of mystery novels. She is most notable for her series of historical novels set in Francoist Spain, starring Carlos Tejada Alonso y Le√≥n, a staunchly anti-Communist officer in the Guardia Civil. Biography Pawel began to develop an interest in the Iberian peninsula while studying flamenco and classical Spanish dance in junior high school. She graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1995, where she furthered her interest in Spain during a school trip to Madrid. In her undergraduate studies at Columbia University she majored in Spanish-language literature, with a concentration in the literature of the Iberian peninsula. She received her masters from Teachers College in 2000. Pawel has asserted she never intended to write mysteries, and came upon the idea almost by accident. In the summer of 2000, while on vacation in Spain, Pawel sent an e-mail to her college professor, Persephone Braham, asking if she could pick her up anything while she was there. Braham requested she bring back some murder mysteries set in Madrid. When Pawel confessed she couldn't think of any such mysteries, but that a mystery set in the Spanish capital after the Nationalist's siege would be a great idea, Braham suggested Pawel go ahead and write it. Eight weeks later, Pawel completed the manuscript for Death of a Nationalist. At age 24, Pawel was signed by Soho Press, a publisher of mysteries set in exotic locations, on the strength of her first two manuscripts, Death of a Nationalist and Law of Return. In 2004, Death of a Nationalist won the Edgar Award for \\"Best First Novel\\". It was also nominated for the Macavity Award at Bouchercon, and was a finalist for the LA Times Book Prize. Death of a Nationalist was originally conceived as a stand-alone mystery, but became the foundation for an entire series of novels centered around the character of Carlos Tejada Alonso y Le√≥n. The first Spanish-language edition of Death of a Nationalist appeared in 2005. Pawel teaches English at The High School for Enterprise, Business and Technology in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She recently finished the first draft of an as-yet untitled novel set in Renaissance Flanders in 1577. Influences Pawel is an admirer of the works of Ellis Peters, Dorothy Sayers and Terry Pratchett, the latter of whom she has called \\"a genius\\" and her \\"gold standard for writing\\". She has also mentioned several other influences specific to the \\"Tejada\\" series, such as Delano Ames' The Man in the Tricorn Hat, and Carmen Mart√≠n Gaite's El cuarto de atr√°s (aka The Back Room).

It is practiced in the United States, Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Europe, Mexico and Okinawa.  History  This style of karate was first introduced to Okinawa around 1875 by Norisato Nakaima. Born of wealthy parents in Kume, Okinawa, Nakaima went to Fuchou, China at the age of 19 for advanced studies in the martial arts. In China, a former guard to the Chinese embassies in the Ryukyu Islands introduced Nakaima to a Chinese boxing teacher known as Ry≈´ Ry≈´ Ko, who also taught to Sakiyama Kitoku and, according to some sources, Kanryo Higashionna many years later. Nakaima was accepted, trained for 7 years and received a certificate of graduation from the master. He was trained in a variety of arts and skills ranging from combative techniques to Chinese medicine and herbal healing remedies. Before leaving China, Nakaima traveled to the Fujian, Canton, and Beijing areas, where he collected a number of weapons and scrolls in order to further his experience in the martial arts. Nakaima returned to Okinawa and passed the Chinese boxing style in secret to his son Kenchu Nakaima, who then went on to teach it only to his son, Kenko Nakaima (founder of the Ryuei Ryu Karate and Kobudo Preservation Society). In 1971, at the age of 60, Kenko Nakaima realized that there was no longer a need to keep his family's fighting system a secret. He took on a group of 20 school teachers as karate students; it was at this point the name \\"Ryuei-Ryu\\" was first used to describe the art.

Prototaxites formed small to large trunk-like structures up to wide, reaching in height, made up of interwoven tubes around in diameter, making it by far the largest land-dwelling organism of its time. Whilst traditionally very difficult to assign to an extant group of organisms, current opinion suggests a fungal placement for the genus. Recent discovery of what are likely algal symbionts would make it a lichen, rather than a fungus. Lichens are classified with the fungal not the algal component, and the main tubular cells of Prototaxites are most like those of the fungal phylum Glomeromycota. This said, its reproductive features indicate a relationship with the Taphrinomycotina fungi. Morphology \\"Schunnemunk tree\\" P. loganii branching apex Dawson's 1888 reconstruction of a conifer-like Prototaxites The microstructure of Prototaxites under a light microscope P. milwaukeensis from Wisconsin Scanning electron microscope view of spherical phycobiont and elongate mycobiont of P. loganii Natural cast of most of an individual of Prototaxites honeggeri Green algal symbionts attached to generative hyphae of P. honeggeri With a diameter of up to 1 m, and a height reaching 8.8 m, Prototaxites fossils are remnants of by far the largest organism discovered from the period of its existence. Viewed from afar, the fossils take the form of tree-trunks, spreading slightly near their base in a fashion that suggests a connection to unpreserved root- like structures. Infilled casts which may represent the spaces formerly occupied by \\"roots\\" of Prototaxites are common in early Devonian strata. Concentric growth rings, sometimes containing embedded plant material, suggest that the organism grew sporadically by the addition of external layers. It is probable that the preserved \\"trunks\\" represent the fruiting body, or \\"sporophore\\", of a fungus, which would have been fuelled by a mycelium, a net of dispersed filaments (\\"hyphae\\"). On a microscopic scale, the fossils consist of narrow tube-like structures, which weave around one another. These come in two types: skeletal \\"tubes\\", 20‚Äì50 Œºm across, have thick (2‚Äì6 Œºm) walls and are undivided for their length, and generative \\"filaments\\", which are thinner (5‚Äì10 Œºm diameter) and branch frequently; these mesh together to form the organism's matrix. These thinner filaments are septate‚Äîthat is to say, they bear internal walls. These septa are perforate‚Äîi.e. they contain a pore, a trait only present in the modern red algae and fungi. The similarity of these tubes to structures in the early plant Nematothallus has led to suggestions that the latter may represent leaves of Prototaxites. Unfortunately for this hypothesis, the two have never been found in connection, although this may be a consequence of their detachment after the organisms' death. History of research First collected in 1843,A fossil specimen collected by Charles Darwin's friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, was mislaid for 163 years at the British Geological Survey offices in London (\\"Scientists find lost Darwin fossils in gloomy corner of British Geological Survey\\", Christian Science Monitor, 17 January 2012; identifying Hooker as \\"John Hooker\\"). it was not until 14 years later that John William Dawson, a Canadian scientist, studied Prototaxites fossils, which he described as partially rotten giant conifers, containing the remains of the fungi which had been decomposing them. This concept was not disputed until 1872, when the rival scientist William Carruthers poured ridicule on the idea. Such was his fervour that he rebuked the name Prototaxites (loosely translated as \\"first yew\\"The \\"Taxinaea\\" (Taxaceae) are the grouping of conifers to which Dawson drew analogy) and insisted that the name Nematophycus (\\"stringy alga\\") be adopted, a move strongly against scientific convention. Dawson fought adamantly to defend his original interpretation until studies of the microstructure made it clear that his position was untenable, whence he promptly attempted to rename the genus himself (to Nematophyton, \\"stringy plant\\"), denying with great vehemence that he'd ever considered it to be a tree. Despite these political attempts to rename the genus, the rules of botanical nomenclature mean that the name \\"Prototaxites\\", however inappropriate in meaning, remains in use today. Despite the overwhelming evidence that the organism grew on land, Carruthers' interpretation that it was a giant marine alga was challenged just the once, in 1919, when Church suggested that Carruthers had been too quick to rule out the possibility of the fungi. The lack of any characters diagnostic of any extant group made the presentation of a firm hypothesis difficult, and so the fossil remained an enigmatic mystery and subject of debate. It was not until 2001, after 20 years of research, that Francis Hueber, of Washington's National Museum of Natural History, published a long-awaited paper which attempted to put Prototaxites in its place. The paper deduced, based on its morphology, that Prototaxites was a fungus. This idea was faced with disbelief, denial and strong scepticism, but further evidence is emerging to support it.Debra Lindsay (2005) Prototaxites Dawson, 1859 or Nematophycus Carruthers, 1872: Geologists V. Botanists in the Formative Period of the Science of Paleobotany. Earth Sciences History: 2005, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 35-61. In 2007, isotopic analyses by a team including Hueber and Kevin Boyce of the University of Chicago concluded that Prototaxites was a giant fungus. They detected a highly variable range of values of carbon isotope ratios in a range of Prototaxites specimens; autotrophs (organisms such as plants and algae, that make a living via photosynthesis) living at the same time draw on the same (atmospheric) source of carbon; as organisms of the same type share the same chemical machinery, they reflect this atmospheric composition with a constant carbon isotope trace. The inconsistent ratio observed in Prototaxites appears to show that the organism did not survive by photosynthesis, and Boyce's team deduce that the organism fed on a range of substrates, such as the remains of whichever other organisms were nearby. Nevertheless, the large size of the organism would necessitate an extensive network of subterranean mycelia in order to obtain enough organic carbon to accumulate the necessary biomass. Root-like structures have circumstantially been interpreted as Prototaxites rhizomorphs and could support the possibility of the organism transporting nutrients large distances to support its above-ground body. Other recent research has suggested that Prototaxites represents a rolled-up bundle of liverworts, but this interpretation has substantial difficulties. A similar genus, Nematasketum, also consists of banded and branching tubes in axial bundles; this seems to be a fungus. Alternative views have suggested that Prototaxites was a vascular plant superficially like yew trees (hence the generic name), a kelp-like alga, or enrolled liverwort mats with associated cyanobacteria and fungal tubular elements. Species Prototaxites honeggeri is the oldest known described species Prototaxites, known from the Darriwilian age Douglas Lake Member of the Lenoir Limestone, at Douglas Dam, Tennessee. P. honeggeri is a small species with simple erect trunk and 4-5 club-shaped terminal branches furrowed by transverse wrinkles.P. honeggeri is similar to other species, but much smaller, about the size of a pencil. It was lichenized by small coccoids, probably green algal, attached to generative hyphae. Ecological context This organism would have been the tallest living thing in its day by far; the plant Cooksonia only reached 1 m, and itself towered over the \\"moss forests\\"; invertebrates were the only other land-dwelling multi-cellular life. Prototaxites became extinct as shrubs and vascular trees rose to prominence. The organism could have used its raised platform for spore dispersal, or, if Prototaxites really did form leaves, in competition for light. The University of Chicago research team has it reconstructed as a branchless, columnar structure.Prehistoric mystery organism verified as giant fungus Press release from University of Chicago, April 23, 2007. The presence of bio-molecules often associated with the algae may suggest that the organism was covered by symbiotic (or parasitic) algae (making it in essence a huge lichen), or even that it was an alga itself. Prototaxites mycelia (strands) have been fossilised invading the tissue of vascular plants; in turn, there is evidence of animals inhabiting Prototaxites: mazes of tubes have been found within some specimens, with the fungus re-growing into the voids, leading to speculation that the organisms' extinction may have been caused by such activity; however, evidence of arthropod borings in Prototaxites has been found from the early and late Devonian, suggesting the organism survived the duress of boring for many millions of years. Intriguingly, Prototaxites is bored long before plants developed a structurally equivalent woody stem, and it is possible that the borers transferred to plants when these evolved.

Coulter (February 17, 1913 ‚Äì August 7, 1998) was an American electrical engineer, inventor, and businessman. The best known of his 85 patents is the Coulter principle, which provides a method for counting and sizing microscopic particles suspended in fluid. His invention of the Coulter Counter made possible today's most common medical diagnostic test: the complete blood count (CBC). The Coulter principle is used in quality control of consumer products, such as chocolate and beer, paint and toners, and was even used to analyze moon dust. Recognized as one of the most influential inventors of the twentieth century, Wallace Coulter studied electronics as a student at Georgia Tech in the early 1930s. Mr. Coulter developed the \\"Coulter Principle,\\" a theory that gave birth to both the automated hematology industry and the field of industrial fine particle counting. His \\"Coulter Counter,\\" a blood cell analyzer, is used to perform one of medicine's most often-requested and informative diagnostic tests, the complete blood count.  Early life and education  Coulter was born in Little Rock, Arkansas on February 17, 1913. He attended high school in McGehee, Arkansas, and went to Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri and later studied electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Coulter Corporation  After securing a U.S. patent (#2,656,508) for the Coulter Principle in 1953, Wallace and his brother Joseph R. Coulter (d. 1998) began the production of the new cell and particle analyzer, the Coulter Counter. Orders and sales continued to increase and, in 1958, the brothers incorporated their company as Coulter Electronics, Inc. and relocated operations to Hialeah, Florida in 1961. Coulter positioned the Coulter Corporation as the leader in the diagnostic industry. In October 1997, the Coulter Corporation was acquired by Beckman Instruments, Inc., and is now known as Beckman Coulter, Inc. Coulter Corporation continues to be one of the largest employers in Miami-Dade county with 1800 employees in 2009.  Wallace H. Coulter Foundation  Coulter established the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation to improve health care through medical research and engineering. The foundation is located in Miami, Florida. In 2006 the foundation was the fifth largest in Florida with $430 million in assets and the sixth largest giver with $22 million in grants.  Legacy  The science and mathematics building at Coulter's alma mater of Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, is named the Coulter Science Center in Wallace's honor. The Wallace H.

The first festival included a massed-start road race (a rarity in mainland Britain at the time but allowed in the Isle of Man, a self-governing crown dependency) which featured the top riders of the day. Despite closed roads the race saw many crashes and only a few riders finished. The first winner was Charles Holland of Birmingham, later one of the first two Englishmen to ride the Tour de France. The first event involved riders racing a single lap of the famous TT circuit of . The course runs from Douglas to Ramsey then climbs for to a high point on the mountain of Snaefell at before descending to Douglas. The distance was later increased to two and then three laps ().

Directed by Chris Tashima.Be Like Water on EWP site It is currently being developed into a feature-length screenplay. In 2019 he began writing a new play in collaboration with Ruben \\"Funkahuatl\\" Guevara based on Guevara's short story, Masao and the Bronze Nightingale. Commissioned by Casa 0101 Theater in Boyle Heights, the play received four public readings in 2019 and is still in development as of 2020.  Other Performance Projects  Tales of Little Tokyo - In summer of 2018, Kwong was one of four artists selected (with filmmaker Tina Takemoto, painter Susu Attar, calligrapher Kuni Yoshida) for the inaugural +LAB Artist Residency, sponsored by the Little Tokyo Service Center. For 3 months the artists lived in the historic old Daimaru Hotel on First Street and created community-based art projects on the theme of \\"Self- determination and Community Control\\" for Little Tokyo -- a 134-year-old community now threatened by gentrification. Each artist was partnered with a local organization for their project, Dan being paired with the Japanese American National Museum. For his project Dan interviewed over 50 people with various relationships to Little Tokyo past and present, ranging in age from 97 to 17. After transcribing and editing hundreds of their stories, he selected approx. 30 to create a portrait of the community through the decades, showing its significance to people over generations. It was presented as a reading with veteran Nisei actress Takayo Fischer at JANM's Democracy Forum at the end of July. Tales of Little Tokyo is still being developed to incorporate more stories and a multimedia component. It was presented in this latest form in January of 2020 with Takayo Fischer and the addition of actress Hanna-Lee Sakakibara, once again at the Tateuchi Democracy Forum at JANM.  Directing  In January/February 2019 Dan directed and dramaturged the world premiere of Tales of Clamor, by traci kato-kiriyama and Kennedy Kabesares.

It is located near the intersection of US 75 (Central Expressway) and President George Bush Turnpike. It is being demolished, starting in September 2019, for replacement with a $1 billion mixed-use development, designed by Centurion American Development Group. Anchor tenants= JCPenney (closing)  The JCPenney Co. department store is an original anchor tenant of the mall. The only operating store left on the property. On August 18, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney would be closing as part of a plan to close 155 stores nationwide. The store will close in November 2020.https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort- worth/plano/impacts/2020/08/18/jcpenney-adds-planos-collin-creek-mall- location-to-list-of-permanent-closures/  Amazing Jake's (closed)  The fifth anchor opened as a Lord & Taylor department store in 1981. Lord & Taylor closed in 1990, and was replaced by a Mervyn's department store. Mervyn's exited the Texas market in early 2006 and the anchor store was temporarily vacant. In July 2008, the former Mervyn's was converted into a two-story Amazing Jake's indoor playland and buffet restaurant. However, as of April 2019, Amazing Jake's is now closed, and the website does not reflect a location at Collin Creek Mall. This anchor store is the first to be demolished in the redevelopment.  Sears (closed)  The Sears Roebuck & Co. department store was an original anchor tenant of the mall. The store closed in March 2019 as part to closing 80 stores nationwide due to Sears and Roebuck Co. filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.This anchor store was the third to be demolished in the redevelopment.  Macy's (closed)  This anchor location opened as a Sanger Harris department store. Sanger-Harris was merged with Foley's and renamed in 1987 then the combined company was sold to May Department Stores in 1988. The store was renamed Macy's in September 2006 as a result of May Company' purchase of the Federated Department Stores in 2005. The store's final business day was on March 26, 2017. This anchor store was the second to be demolished in the redevelopment.  Dillard's (closed)  The Dillard's department store was an original anchor tenant of Collin Creek, but closed in January 2014. This anchor store was the fourth to be demolished in the redevelopment. History When the mall opened in July 1981, Collin Creek featured a River Walk: a series of fountains connected by an indoor creek. The creek and most of the fountains were later removed, except for a small fountain left in the middle of the mall. Several years before the mall closed, plants were put in the remaining fountain. The mall also contained a \\"village\\" of small shops lining corridors narrower than the rest of the mall. Those shops were removed and the space converted into a food court as part of a remodeling project in 1992. In 2008, Collin Creek Mall had a small remodel including new paint and new tile, much like what Richardson Square Mall had in 1998. In 2018, the property was sold to Centurion American. On Friday, July 26, 2019, Collin Creek Mall had a farewell party to say goodbye to the mall. As of Wednesday, July 31, 2019, Collin Creek Mall is closed. Demolition and redevelopment began in September 2019. Economic factors Since the mall's opening, the area near Collin Creek has witnessed explosive growth, and the addition of the President George Bush Turnpike. The mall has suffered from fierce competition from newer nearby malls. The August 2000 opening of new regional mall Stonebriar Centre in nearby Frisco affected the sales of Lewisville's Vista Ridge Mall (Vista Ridge was more directly affected by the October 1997 opening of the nearby Grapevine Mills in Grapevine) and Plano's Collin Creek Mall as both malls experienced what Larry Howard, vice president for development of General Growth Properties Inc., called \\"some cannibalization\\". Developer Sam Ware of Dreien Partners has recently introduced a $1 billion+ plan to revitalize the mall, by tearing down much of its north wing and opening up the creek beneath it, as well as adding office, hotel, and residential components. That deal fell through and Centurion American is making a proposal to raze the mall and redevelop it as a mixed-use center.

The plot centers around Fireheart and Graystripe, newly promoted warriors of ThunderClan, which is one of the four groups of feral cats living in the wilderness. Fireheart learns that his best friend Graystripe has fallen in love with Silverstream, a warrior from RiverClan, even though it is against the cats' \\"warrior code\\". The book was first published on June 1, 2003 in the US as a hardcover. Since then, Fire and Ice has been released in paperback and e-book format in other languages. The main theme of the book is that the type of person one is inside is more important than the way one seems from the outside. The book received mixed reviews: the negative reviews criticized the flat characters, and how troublesome it was to flip back to the characters list due to the large number of cats; positive reviews praised the suspense and rising tensions in the book. Synopsis=Setting Fire and Ice takes place in a fictional forest which is home to four Clans of wild cats, ThunderClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan and WindClan, each of which lives in a territory best suited to their skills/abilities. The authors based the forest on New Forest in southern England. Characters *Fireheart is the main protagonist of the book. Originally a house cat named Rusty, he left his human owners to become an apprentice in ThunderClan. He is sent with Graystripe to find WindClan, who were chased out of their home by ShadowClan. Later, he realizes that Graystripe is in love with Silverstream, a warrior in RiverClan. Although he advises Graystripe against meeting her secretly, Fireheart agrees to keep it a secret. *Graystripe is Fireheart's best friend. After receiving his warrior name, Graystripe is sent with Fireheart to find WindClan, who were chased out of their home by ShadowClan. During a patrol, Graystripe is saved by Silverstream, a RiverClan warrior, when he falls into the river, and almost drowns. As a result, Graystripe and Silverstream fall in love and begin to meet each other in secret, against Fireheart's warnings. *Silverstream is a RiverClan warrior and the daughter of RiverClan's leader, Crookedstar. After saving Graystripe from drowning in the river, the two fall in love. Since the warrior code forbids cats from different Clans to be in love, they begin to meet in secret, sneaking out of camp in order to see each other. *Tigerclaw is the main antagonist. Tigerclaw had previously killed his own Clanmate, Redtail, in hope of taking Redtail's place as deputy. Instead, Lionheart becomes deputy, but he too, later dies. Tigerclaw then finally becomes deputy. Only Fireheart, Graystripe and Ravenpaw (Tigerclaw's apprentice) know of Tigerclaw's plans, but they do not tell anyone out of fear of him. Plot Fire and Ice begins with Fireheart and Graystripe performing a traditional silent vigil after their promotion to warrior status in Into the Wild. In the first couple chapters, the book explains in third person how Fireheart and Graystripe start to get comfortable with being warriors. ThunderClan thinks Ravenpaw is dead, but Fireheart reveals the truth to Bluestar not long before a Gathering, a meeting of the Clans held on the night of a full moon, is held. As their first task as warriors, Fireheart and Graystripe are assigned to find WindClan (cats that live primarily on the open moors), which had been driven out by ShadowClan, and bring them home. They go to the WindClan camp and search for clues there. On the way, they see some RiverClan warriors hunting on WindClan territory. Graystripe finds the correct scent trail, and they follow it to a makeshift WindClan camp. Fireheart spots Barley's farm a little ways off the trail and the pair hurriedly leaves in fear of the dogs that live on the farm chasing them after they get let out. Eventually, Fireheart and Graystripe succeed, finding WindClan under a tangle of Thunderpaths (a highway interchange). When Fireheart and Graystripe first find the Thunderpaths, they are confused by the mixed-up scents. After figuring out WindClan is under it, they decide to spend the night right outside the makeshift home and wait until morning to greet the Clan. Then they bring them home. Soon after, Bluestar apprentices Cinderpaw the smoky-dark gray she-cat to Fireheart, and Brackenpaw the golden-brown tabby tom to Graystripe. During a hunting patrol, Graystripe almost drowns after chasing a vole onto thin ice, falling in the river separating RiverClan and ThunderClan, but is rescued by Silverstream, a slender, light silver-gray-and-black tabby she-cat who is a RiverClan warrior. Graystripe and Silverstream fall in love; however, this is against the warrior code, a code of honor that all warriors must follow. And according to the code, warriors cannot fall in love with those not from their own Clan. Fireheart discovers their relationship, and unsuccessfully attempts to discourage them from seeing each other. Graystripe finally agrees to meet Silverstream only at the full moon at the Gathering, when the four Clans meet to share news. Fireheart later realizes that Graystripe has not been keeping his promise. Because Graystripe is often gone to see Silverstream, Fireheart takes over training Brackenpaw along with Cinderpaw. Tigerclaw, in his ambition to become leader, sets a trap for Bluestar by another Thunderpath, intending to kill her, thus bringing him closer to becoming leader. Instead, Cinderpaw is crippled by the trap. Her leg is broken, and when it heals, she has a permanent limp, preventing her from becoming a warrior. She then trains under Yellowfang to become a medicine cat. At one point, Fireheart is reunited with his sister, Princess, a fluffy light brown tabby she-cat kittypet living in a Twolegplace (human town). Princess gives Fireheart her oldest kit, Cloudkit the snowy-white young tom, to take into the Clan as a new apprentice. Although Fireheart agrees to accept his nephew as his new apprentice, his Clanmates, with the exception of Frostfur and Graystripe, are reluctant to accept him because of his kittypet blood, even though Fireheart himself also has kittypet blood. Bluestar allows him to stay, and Brindleface the pale gray tabby she-cat becomes his foster mother. Brokenstar, the former ShadowClan leader, eventually attacks ThunderClan, along with several other exiled ShadowClan warriors. After the battle, the rogues are driven off, with the exception of Brokenstar himself, who is blinded by Yellowfang and is kept as a prisoner. When Fireheart suggests they kill the evil cat, Yellowfang refuses, sadly revealing that she is Brokenstar's mother. Later, ThunderClan becomes involved in a fight against RiverClan and ShadowClan, when RiverClan and ShadowClan unite and try to drive WindClan out again, and WindClan ally themselves with ThunderClan. When Fireheart is attacked by Leopardfur, a dappled golden tabby she-cat who is the RiverClan deputy, Tigerclaw watches as Leopardfur and Fireheart fight, and does not attempt to join in. Silverstream attacks Fireheart but releases him; he then attacks her but, seeing Graystripe's look of dismay, he releases her. Darkstripe the large, lean, sleek, thin-furred, dark gray tabby tom witnesses the event and reports it to Tigerclaw. Consequently, Fireheart becomes certain that Tigerclaw is not to be trusted. Publication history Fire and Ice was first published as a hardcover by HarperCollins in the US on March 27, 2003. The paperback version was released on June 1, 2004, and an e-book version was released on September 9, 2007. An English Kindle edition is also available. Fire and Ice was published in Canada on May 20, 2004, and in the United Kingdom in June 2003. Other languages that Fire and Ice has been released in include German, Japanese, French, Russian, and Korean. A Chinese version has also been released that includes a 3-D card made of stereoscopic lenticular prints featuring Bluestar. Themes The main theme of Fire and Ice is that \\"it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside\\". Fireheart is challenged by other cats because he was once a kittypet (house cat), despite having proven his loyalty and bravery as a warrior. Similarly, Cloudkit was initially not accepted by the Clan because he had kittypet parents. Other themes include loyalty, betrayal, and forbidden love. Reception Fire and Ice received mixed reviews. The novel was well received by Voice of Youth Advocates, which observed that \\"Hunter works hard at incorporating authentic cat mannerisms and behaviors\\" and that \\"although more sophisticated teens might be put off by the coy dialogue attributes, younger readers probably will not notice and will be caught up in Fireheart's adventures\\". Children's Literature found the plot to be \\"flat, repetitious, much too long, and in the end unsatisfying except perhaps to devoted cat lovers or readers who revel in invented worlds\\". School Library Journal observed that readers unfamiliar with the first novel would find this one difficult to follow and that the \\"characterizations of the animals are somewhat flat, although it is possible to tell them apart, and the plot's twists and turns seem mapped out and predictable\\". Kirkus Reviews praised the increased tensions, noting that \\"Hunter's world keeps getting more finely drawn, and her characters more complex\\" though readers may be disappointed that Fireheart fails to resolve his \\"conflicting responsibilities\\". Booklist likewise praised the novel's tension, noting that the \\"characters remain true to their feline natures, adding to the plausibility of events in this tension filled story\\". In a review for both Into the Wild and Fire and Ice, Horn Book Review suggested Redwall fans might find the series appealing.

The plot is about Fireheart, a ThunderClan warrior, attempting to prevent his best friend Graystripe from falling in love with Silverstream, whom Graystripe is not allowed to fall in love with. Silverstream later dies giving birth to Graystripe's kits. When RiverClan claims the kits, Graystripe makes the difficult decision to join RiverClan. Fireheart also becomes deputy after Tigerclaw, the deputy, attempts to kill the leader, Bluestar. The main theme of the book is forbidden love. Forest of Secrets takes place in a fictional forest based on many natural locations. The book was first published in the United States as a hardcover on October 14, 2003. It was later published in paperback and as an e-book, and in countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada. It has also been translated into other languages such as Japanese, French, and Russian. The book received positive reviews from trade publications such as Horn Book review and Booklist, which praised the plot line of divided loyalties, betrayals, trust and the balance between the plot and everyday life. Development Holmes remembers that while editing Forest of Secrets, she thought: \\"Hang on, this is turning into something special\\". While coming up with the idea of Bluestar giving up her kits to become leader, she remembers \\"sitting at my keyboard, tapping away to unpeel the layers of emotion that must have led to her momentous decision, and suddenly realizing how real and vital the Clans' world had become to me\\". After that, Holmes says that the plot seemed to write itself out. HarperCollins requested Holmes to produce a book every three months. Upon hearing this, Holmes invited Cherith Baldry into the team in order to keep up with the schedule. Holmes says she chose Baldry because \\"her natural writing style was quite close to mine and Kate's, so I knew that Cherith's voice would fit\\". Synopsis=Setting Forest of Secrets is set in the same fictional forest as the previous two books in the series. The forest is home to four Clans of wild cats. The four Clans are ThunderClan, WindClan, RiverClan and ShadowClan. Each Clan has their own territory which they live in. The forest is based on New Forest in England. The setting was also influenced by Loch Lomond in the Scottish Highlands, and the Forest of Dean. New Forest, England, which inspired the setting for the series Plot Fireheart is determined to uncover the truth about the Clan deputy, Tigerclaw, whom he believes is untrustworthy, whilst risking the trust of his leader, Bluestar, and even the possibility that she might suspect Fireheart himself as a traitor. ShadowClan and WindClan eventually lead an invasion of the ThunderClan camp in an attempt to kill Brokentail whom ThunderClan is sheltering but are driven off. Meanwhile, Fireheart's best friend, Graystripe, risks the trust of his entire Clan as he continues having a forbidden love affair with Silverstream, who is from RiverClan. Fireheart and Graystripe face danger from Tigerclaw, who has noticed Graystripe missing from camp many times. Silverstream eventually dies while giving birth to Graystripe's kits when they come early. Graystripe is left heartbroken. ThunderClan then learns about his forbidden love with Silverstream and feel that they cannot trust Graystripe anymore. Later, Tigerclaw leads a band of rogues into ThunderClan camp, pretending to defend the Clan. During the battle, Tigerclaw corners Bluestar in her den and tries to kill her. Fireheart arrives just in time to save her and injures Tigerclaw. Bluestar is deeply shocked and shaken by Tigerclaw's mutiny, though she manages to announce Tigerclaw's exile from the Clan. Tigerclaw then asks Darkstripe, Longtail, and even Dustpelt the dark brown tabby tom if they want to join him in exile, but each cat refuses. With Bluestar having regained her trust over the cat that had exposed Tigerclaw's treachery, Fireheart is made deputy, although the announcement of the position is made after moonhigh, which is against Clan tradition. As a deputy, life is harder for Fireheart and things change rapidly. Fireheart is unsure whether he would be a good deputy, but he is sure that he has not seen the last of Tigerclaw. At the end of the book, Graystripe, feeling torn between loyalties, heavy-heartedly decides to join RiverClan in order to raise his and Silverstream's kits. Fireheart attempts to have him reconsider, but this later proves to be unsuccessful. Fireheart is left heartbroken with the thought of losing his friend with whom he shared many adventures, and was the first Clan cat he had ever met since his days as a kittypet. He believes he will be lonely without his best friend. Yellowfang also poisons and kills Brokentail with yew berries for the injustices he has caused. Publication history Forest of Secrets was first released in the US as a hardcover on October 14, 2003. It was then released as a paperback on October 5, 2004 and an e-book on September 4, 2007. Forest of Secrets has also been published in the UK as a hardcover and paperback and in Canada as a paperback. It has also been translated into other languages such as German, Japanese, French, Russian, and Korean. The Chinese version was released on November 30, 2008 and is packaged with a trading card featuring Tallstar. Themes The main theme in the book is forbidden love. The warrior code, the rules the cats must follow, allows cross-Clan friendship, but not love. In order to meet each other, Silverstream and Graystripe have to sneak away from their camps. As a reviewer noted, \\"the tragic death of Graystripe's mate as she's giving birth and his betrayal of the Clan by loving a cat from an enemy Clan bring the simmering tensions to a boil as both groups claim rights to the kits.\\" Critical reception Forest of Secrets has received positive reviews. School Library Journal compared the book to a \\"Greek drama, with its huge cast of characters (a chart of allegiances is included), intrigues, divided loyalties, star-crossed lovers, and parents murdering their offspring.\\" The review also commented on the violent battle scenes and how fans would be waiting impatiently for the next book. A review from Booklist also praised the book writing how \\"a devastating flood, shifting alliances between clans, treachery within and without ThunderClan, and attempted murder\\" create \\"another dynamic episode sure to please series fans\\". Horn Book Review also gave a positive review praising how the author is able to balance the book's conflicts and the everyday lives of the Clan cats. Children's Literature wrote that the book \\"is filled with intrigue and adventure\\". The review also recommended it to fantasy and cat-lovers.

GNYC has a unique organization in that it is sub-divided into borough councils, each of which is led by a borough executive. The borough councils are then divided into districts. Over five million young people have experienced Scouting through GNYC, since the council's inception in the 1920s. The programs of the Boy Scouts of America aim to serve young people by encouraging healthy habits and a lifelong appreciation of physical and personal fitness, replacing bullying with kindness, instilling a sense of environmental stewardship and sustainability, and providing leadership development opportunities and STEM Education, preparing young people for the workforce. The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. History The Greater New York Councils office relocated from the Empire State Building to 475 Riverside Drive in Morningside Heights in December 2018. The council currently operates and maintains three year round Scout camp properties: William H. Pouch Scout Camp, Alpine Scout Camp, and Ten Mile River Scout Reservation. Organization The name of Greater New York Councils is written in plural form, because the five borough councils that compose it are themselves councils and operate as such in many respects. Each has its own BSA council number, a council president and a council commissioner. Each selects recipients of the Silver Beaver award and presents these along with other council-level awards annually. Until 2013, each borough council had its own Order of the Arrow lodge. Those who are registered as youth or adult participants with borough councils wear borough council shoulder patches on their uniforms. This is permitted by BSA uniforming rules, because each of the borough councils is technically a local council in its own right. GNYC inextricably links the borough councils financially, administratively and through ownership of camp properties.

It is the principal Boy Scout camp serving New York City. In recent years, TMR is also now increasingly used by other councils in New York state. Over the years, prominent Americans have been instrumental in its history, including Franklin D. Roosevelt and New York mayor William O'Dwyer. =History= TMR was founded as the result of efforts by the New York City Boy Scout Foundation beginning in 1924 to develop a camp large enough to accommodate the burgeoning growth of Scouting in the New York metropolitan area during the 1920s, with a goal of providing camping for 3,500 Scouts at a time. Led by future New York governor and President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), who was president of the New York City Boy Scout Foundation, the group selected TMR's present site, oversaw the land acquisition process from multiple owners, and raised funds for the large camp's development. In recognition of his pivotal role in the founding and development of TMR, received Scouting's Silver Buffalo Award in a ceremony held at the camp on August 23, 1930. Later, as recently elected president of the U.S., FDR returned again to the camp in the summer of 1933 to be inducted into the Order of the Arrow. By the summer of 1936, 10,000 boys were attending the camp each summer, the New York Times reported. In 1952, a Manhattan Boy Scout was recognized as the 250,000th Scout to attend TMR and given a special award by FDR's widow, Eleanor Roosevelt. At its peak in 1965, Ten Mile River operated eleven camps with a peak usage of nearly 12,000 boys. Following a decline in the 1970s, five of TMR's eleven camps closed. By the late 1990s, attendance had rebounded to 6,000 Scouts. =Ten Mile River Scout Camps Notable Alumni= *Charles Camarda, astronaut. *Tony Curtis, actor. *Eugene Calvin Cheatham Jr., Eagle Scout, Tuskegee Airmen. *Jay M.

GNYC operates a summer day camp designed especially for Cub Scouts drawn from the surrounding communities. Order of The Arrow In 2013, the Greater New York Councils merged each of the five boroughs' Order of the Arrow Lodges (Ranachqua #4, Shu-Shu-Gah #24, Man-a-Hattin #82, Suanhacky #49 and Aquehongian Lodge #112) and formed Kintecoying Lodge #4 \\\\- the new Order of the Arrow Lodge for the Greater New York Councils, BSA. Kintecoying Lodge #4 can be found online on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. As of February 2018, former lodge vice chief of inductions and brotherhood member from The Bronx, Brian Byrne serves as Lodge Chief. Byrne also serves in the GNYC's Venturing Officers' Association as its VP-Administration.  History of the Order in GNYC  For over 100 years the Order of the Arrow has played a significant role in the life of millions of Scouts, shaping them to be young men dedicated to the cheerful service of others and bound in brotherhood to their fellow man. Soon after Dr. E. Urner Goodman and Col. Carol A. Edson founded our Order at Treasure Island Scout Camp in 1915, word of the Wimachtendienk came to New York City. In 1920, four men were inducted into the Order and formed the 4th Order of the Arrow Lodge in the country. It was on that evening that the rich history of Brotherhood, Cheerfulness, and Service began in what we now know as the Greater New York Councils. For 93 years, the Greater New York Councils chartered 5 lodges, one in each borough. Ranachqua Lodge #4 was founded in 1920 and served the Bronx. Shu-Shu-Gah Lodge #24 was founded in 1925 and served Brooklyn. Suanhacky Lodge #49 was founded in 1930 and served Queens. Man-A-Hattin Lodge #82 was founded in 1935 and served Manhattan. Aquehongian Lodge #112 was founded in 1938 and served Staten Island.  Lodge Merger of 2013  On August 30, 2012, after careful consideration over the course of many months, former Scout Executive Charles Rosser (1954-2014) announced the decision that combining the council‚Äôs five Order of the Arrow lodges into a single lodge will allow the OA to better fulfill the Mission of the Lodge and the Purpose of the Order of the Arrow. A committee of ten youth and 7 adults were tasked with transitioning the OA in the Greater New York Councils. Members of the transition team were: Representing Ranachqua Lodge, Brenden DelBene (Lodge Chief), Matthew Thomas and Marc Messenger (Lodge Adviser). Representing Shu-Shu-Gah Lodge, Robert Rowley (Lodge Chief), Nicholas Goldrosen, and Anthony Bracciante (Lodge Adviser). Representing Suanhacky Lodge, Anthony Lectora (Lodge Chief), Andrew Sommer, and Michael Lectora (Adviser). Representing Man-A-Hattin Lodge, Alan Tang (Lodge Chief), Brendan Looi, and Michael O‚ÄôBrien (Lodge Adviser). Representing Aquehongian Lodge, Allan Feldman (Lodge Chief), Christopher Sorensen, and John Perchiacca (Lodge Adviser). Lodge Staff Adviser Christopher Coscia, and Lodge Adviser Designate Colin Pinnavaia rounded out the committee. The team met nine times between the fall of 2012 and the spring of 2013 to discuss how the lodge would be organized, the lodge name and totem, lodge committees, and chapter organization among other topics. The Peregrine Falcon Lodge name of Kintecoying comes from several modern day sources which claim that what we now know as Astor Place used to be named Kintecoying or, ‚ÄúCrossroads of Nations,‚Äù and was a pow-wow point for the Lenape tribes of Manhattan. At this spot, where the branches of the trails converged, the Lenapes traded with each other, exchanged news, and held spiritual ceremonies and tribal councils to settle disputes. The ‚ÄúCrossroads of Nations‚Äù also speaks to New York City‚Äôs role as the ‚ÄúCapital of the World‚Äù and a ‚ÄúMelting Pot‚Äù of peoples from many lands from around the globe. Although the national OA organization has stopped using lodge numbers to identify lodges, we believed that the tenure of service of the Order to our council is unique. In order to acknowledge the 93 years of Order of the Arrow history in New York City, the lodge decided to retain the use of the lodge number 4 - the first lodge number for Greater New York Councils. The Peregrine Falcon was selected as the totem of Kintecoying Lodge. A native bird to New York City, the peregrine falcon is a symbol of strength, adventure, leadership and new beginnings. Peregrine Falcons are among the world‚Äôs most common birds of prey and live on all continents except Antarctica. They prefer wide-open spaces, and thrive near coasts where shorebirds are common, but they can be found everywhere from tundra to deserts. Peregrines are also found living on the bridges and skyscrapers of our city. Having been put on the endangered species list in the 1970s the peregrine falcon is making a strong comeback with Day One Event Logo population numbers on the rise worldwide. The transition team decided that an inaugural lodge-wide fellowship event would be held in April 2013 to bring the GNYC OA Membership together and to officially form the new lodge. Kintecoying Lodge Day One was held on April 13, 2013 at Alpine Scout Camp. Brothers from across the city gathered to enjoy a day of fellowship, elect new lodge officers, and establish Kintecoying Lodge #4. = Founding Officers = The first lodge executive committee was elected in the afternoon. Nicholas Goldrosen was elected Lodge Chief, Andrew Sommer was elected Vice-Chief of Inductions, James Maxham was elected Vice-Chief of Administration, Kirwin Seger was elected Secretary, and Patrick Machado was elected Treasurer.  Chapters  Chapters were formed to administer the OA program in the local communities. Six chapters were formed. Uteney Gokhos Chapter for the Bronx River District, Shu-Shu-Gah Chapter for Breukelen and Lenape Bay Districts, Man-a-Hattin Chapter for the Big Apple District, Aquehonga Chapter for Aquehonga District, Mespaetch Chapter for Pathfinder and Tomahawk Districts, and Matinecock Chapter for Founders District.  Events Hosted  On the weekend of June 7‚Äì9, 2013, Kintecoying served as the service lodge for the 2013 Section NE-2B Conclave held at Camp Keowa at Ten Mile River. In June 2017, the lodge would go back to hosting the Section NE-2B Conclave held at Camp Keowa, Ten Mile River Scout Reservation, in Narrowsburg, New York.

Rising Storm was written by Kate Cary. The series follows the adventures of four Clans of wild, anthropomorphic cats. In the previous book, Forest of Secrets, Graystripe‚Äôs mate, Silverstream, died while giving birth, though if she had been in the care of a medicine cat the whole time, her sad story might have ended differently. ThunderClan and RiverClan fought over the two kits, seeing as the mother of the kits, Silverstream, was the daughter of the RiverClan leader, Crookedstar, and the father was Graystripe, a ThunderClan warrior. Graystripe decided to join RiverClan, despite knowing he will be shunned there. In Rising Storm, Fireheart has to tackle his new duties as deputy, knowing that the old one, Tigerclaw, who had been exiled, is in the forest somewhere, seeking revenge against Fireheart, Bluestar, and ThunderClan. At the end of the book, Tigerclaw becomes leader of ShadowClan and receives the name Tigerstar, finally achieving the position he killed for. The main theme in the book is power. The forest in the book is inspired by multiple natural locations, such as the New Forest, in southern England. The book was first released as a hardcover in the US on January 6, 2004. It was then released in both paperback and e-book format. The UK has received the paperback version along with Canada. Rising Storm has been published in multiple languages including Chinese, German, and French. Reviews for the book were mixed to positive, with reviewers praising the suspense and cliffhanger ending; however, some reviews criticized the growing number of characters and lack of humor and depth. Synopsis=Setting Rising Storm takes place in a fictional forest just like the previous three books, though there are a few destinations with the same names. In Virginia there is a territory just like the one described in the books, and it is next to a windover road The forest is home to four Clans of wild cats, ThunderClan, WindClan, RiverClan and ShadowClan. In the middle of the book, Fireheart and Bluestar take a visit to Moonstone, which is a stone in an abandoned mine north-west of the forest. The Clans' name for the mine is Highstones. The forest is based on New Forest, in Southern England. In addition to the New Forest, Loch Lomond, the Scottish Highlands, and the Forest of Dean also inspired the fictional locales in the novel. Plot Fireheart is now ThunderClan's new deputy, but the previous deputy, Tigerclaw, still haunts Fireheart's dreams. Fireheart wonders if ThunderClan would be ready if Tigerclaw attacked, as many of the cats are still shocked about Tigerclaw's disloyalty, and many warriors are still badly injured. Bluestar also begins to become distrustful of the Clan after Tigerclaw's betrayal, trusting only her most senior warriors, including Fireheart, who she brought to the Clan. One day, Bluestar, accompanied by Fireheart, goes to speak with StarClan at Mothermouth, a quarry mine. On the way there, a patrol of WindClan warriors, led by a wiry mottled dark brown tabby tom named Mudclaw, stop them before Bluestar is able to talk with them. The ThunderClan leader later fears that StarClan sent WindClan to stop them from going to Mothermouth and speaking with StarClan, which causes her to slip into further paranoia. In the summer months, Fireheart struggles with his disrespectful nephew and apprentice, now called Cloudpaw, who goes to a Twoleg for food and is one day abducted by them. Fireheart and Sandstorm the pale ginger she-cat rescue Cloudpaw, who is found near the barn where Ravenpaw and Barley live. He is accepted back into the Clan, since Fireheart keeps it a secret that Cloudpaw went to humans for food. Fireheart must also deal with the fact that his best friend, Graystripe, is still in love with the dead RiverClan she-cat Silverstream. Meanwhile, the forest gets hotter and hotter, and a wildfire sweeps through the forest, destroying ThunderClan's camp and taking the lives of two elders, Patchpelt the small black-and-white tom and Halftail the big broad-shouldered dark brown tabby tom, as well as Yellowfang, ThunderClan's medicine cat. At the end of the book, it was revealed at a Gathering that both Nightstar the long-tailed black tom and Cinderfur of ShadowClan the thin gray tom have died from a sickness, and that Tigerclaw, is the new leader of ShadowClan, has earned the name \\"Tigerstar\\". Publication history Rising Storm was first published as a hardcover in the US on January 6, 2004. The book was later also published as a paperback on February 15, 2005 and an e-book on September 4, 2007. In the UK, the book was first released on October 2, 2006 as a paperback. The Canadian version released early on January 8, 2004. It has also been translated into other languages such as German, Japanese, French, Russian, and Korean. The Chinese version was released on November 30, 2008, and also includes a trading card of Graystripe. Themes A major topic in this book is power. Tigerclaw is determined to take over ThunderClan, even after being banished from the Clan for trying to do so earlier. Other themes are violence and death. Booklist notes that \\"teens may find their own journey toward adulthood echoed in the protagonist's struggles and self-doubts\\". Critical reception Rising Storm was mostly well received by critics. In one review by Booklist, the reviewer calls the novel suspenseful, also noting how the story echoes the journey to maturity. Another review, by VOYA, noted that while the books lacks humor and depth, there was still appeal in the hidden world of the warrior cats. A BookLoons review particularly praised the ending, calling it a cliffhanger. A review by Horn Book Review for both Rising Storm and A Dangerous Path was also positive writing \\"The fourth and fifth entries in the series continue the development of the complex, dynamic characters\\". However, Children's Literature was not as positive, saying it was getting hard to remember all of the characters' relatives and leaders.

During winters, the place mostly remains covered with the snow and the inhabitants move to lower regions of Himachal. According to a recent study by Centre of Atmospheric Sciences at IIT Delhi, Chitkul has the cleanest air in India. Geography Chitkul, on the banks of Baspa River, is the first village of the Baspa Valley and the last village on the old Hindustan-Tibet trade route. It is also the last point in India one can travel to without a permit. Visitor's attractions Of particular interest at Chitkul are its houses with either slate or wooden plank roofs, a Buddhist temple and a small tower. However, there has been an increased use of tin-roofs, especially the high school and the army/ITBP barracks. The Kagyupa temple has a highly valued old image of the Shakyamuni Buddha, a Wheel of Life mandala and four Directional Kings on either side of the door. Chitkul is practically the last point of the famous Kinner Kailash Parikrama as one can hitch a hike from here onwards. After one crosses over the 5,242 m high Charang Pass., it is a long and steep run down through slithery scree slopes to Chitkul(3,450m). The powerful goddess of Chitkul is the only non-Buddhist deity to which respect must be paid by the Parikrama pilgrims. It is believed that the local Deity is related to the Deity of Gangotri and till recently the locals would carry the Deity to Gangotri on foot over high mountain passes. Chitkul is situated around 40 km from Karcham, the place where road bifurcates from Hindustan- Tibet Road (NH 22). The Sangla Valley is a delight for nature lovers; especially the stretch after Raksham and right up to Chitkul. The valley is extremely beautiful, on the left bank of the Baspa River are snow-clad mountains and on the right bank the whole terrain is full of apple orchards and wooden houses. Chitkul is start point for Lamkhaga pass trek and Borasu pass trek. Nagasthi ITBP post is 4km and Ranikanda meadows is 10km trek from Chitkul. Transport Chitkul is around 569 km from the National capital Delhi and 28 km from Sangla.[7] Gallery File:Baspa_River_flowing_next_to_Chitkul.jpgBaspa River flowing next to Chitkul File:Wooden_hut_in_Chitkul.jpgWooden hut in Chitkul File:Chitkul Spitivalley.jpgChitkul during Dusk File:Chitkul.JPGChitkul File:Inhabitant of Chitkul.JPGInhabitant of Chitkul in traditional clothes of the region File:Kinnaur 219.jpgDomesticated goat File:Chitkul Village.JPGSnowing in Chitkul File:Baspa at chitkul.JPGRiver Baspa at Chitkul File:Chitkul border of India.jpgChitkul border of India.

This individual book was written by Cherith Baldry. The series is about four Clans of wild cats, and their adventures in the forest in which they reside. The story follows a plan set up by Tigerstar, leader of ShadowClan, who wishes to destroy ThunderClan by using dogs to hunt them down. At the end of the book, Bluestar, leader of ThunderClan, dies after risking her life to kill the dogs, making Fireheart, now Firestar, the new leader of ThunderClan. Near the end of the book, Fireheart's friend Graystripe also returns to ThunderClan from RiverClan, knowing that no one will respect him in RiverClan. The book was first published in the US as a hardcover on 1 June 2004. It was later published as a paperback and as an e-book, and in the UK and Canada as a paperback. A Dangerous Path has also been published in foreign languages, including French and Chinese. The book received positive reviews from reviewers such as Booklist and Horn Book Review, who praised the tensions and fast pace. Synopsis=Setting The story again takes place in a fictional forest populated by four groups of feral cats, ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan and ShadowClan. Each Clan has their own territory in which they hunt for prey and protect from enemies such as rival Clans and wild animals. The story follows Fireheart and his adventures in ThunderClan. The forest is based on New Forest, which is located in Southern England. Besides New Forest, Loch Lomond, the Scottish Highlands, and the Forest of Dean also inspired the fictional locales in the novel. Plot When a pack of dogs begins to run wild in the forest, Fireheart, deputy of ThunderClan, suspects that Tigerstar, ShadowClan's new leader, is behind it. Bluestar names Cloudpaw a warrior even though all of the apprentices had worked hard, and they were all old enough. Two of ThunderClan's apprentices, Swiftpaw the small black- and-white tom and Brightpaw the white she-cat with ginger patches, try to fight the dog pack themselves in an attempt to prove themselves. However, Swiftpaw is killed and Brightpaw badly disfigured by the pack of dogs, losing part of her face and one eye. While Brightpaw is recovering from the mauling, she repeats words she heard the dogs say: \\"pack, pack\\" and \\"kill, kill\\". Bluestar then \\"promotes\\" Brightpaw to the full status of a true warrior, but she shames Brightpaw by giving her the name Lostface. Normal Clan life resumes, but Fireheart begins to have a strong sense of curiosity of how this happens. To find out, he asks Lostface if she remembers what happens, but she can only remember the words \\"Pack, pack, kill, kill\\". Whitestorm the big muscular snowy-white tom reports to Fireheart that they smell dog near Snakerocks, a pile of rocks where adders live, so they head there. When they arrive, they find a trail of dead rabbits is found leading to the camp, ending with Brindleface in front of the camp, who had been killed by Tigerstar. Fireheart orders a patrol to get rid of the rabbits. Brindleface's death shocks everyone, and after her burial, the camp is evacuated to Sunningrocks to protect ThunderClan. With Bluestar still mentally unstable, it is up to Fireheart to destroy the pack and protect ThunderClan. He and the senior warriors decide that a patrol of cats will lead the dogs to and over the nearby gorge, drowning some of the dogs. But, before he leaves, he apologizes to Sandstorm for not obeying Bluestar and they fall in love, but all they did was realize the existing love they had for each other. The plan works: each cat successfully leads the pack closer to the gorge, breaking away from the group once they lead the dogs to a certain spot, where a fresh runner lies in wait so they can lead the dogs to the next point. Fernpaw the short-furred pale gray she-cat and her brother Ashpaw the pale gray tom with darker flecks (both of them are Brindleface's kits) took part in leading the dogs; they did it as revenge against Tigerstar for killing their mother. Fireheart, the last in line, keeps a good distance between him and the pack leader, until Tigerstar appears and pins Fireheart down. As the huge male dog leader with a massive black-and-tan head gets dangerously close, Tigerstar leaps away, leaving Fireheart to be killed by the pack. As Fireheart struggles against the lead dog , Bluestar, her old self returned once more, slams into the dog, releasing its grip on Fireheart and throwing the lead dog ‚Äî and herself ‚Äî over the side of the gorge. Fireheart leaps down the cliff to the river and dives in to save Bluestar. Fireheart manages to get a hold on her, but is barely able to keep their heads above the water. Soon, however, Bluestar's RiverClan children, Stonefur the long-legged pale blue-gray tom and Mistyfoot the lithe blue-gray she-cat with dense fur, discover Fireheart struggling in the river trying to save their mother and help drag Bluestar to the bank. There, Bluestar pleads with her kits to forgive her for lying to them about who their parents were. They forgive her, as they had not known about their true heritage until then. Bluestar then tells Fireheart that she realised that they were not all traitors to the Clan, like Tigerstar was. She also tells him that he is now the leader of ThunderClan, and that \\"you are the fire that saved my Clan\\", fulfilling two prophecies: Goosefeather the plump speckled gray tom's prophecy that water would kill Bluestar, and Spottedleaf's prophecy stating that 'fire will save the Clan'. With that, she loses her final life. Fireheart is filled with grief, and Mistyfoot asks if she and Stonefur can help carry her back to camp and sit vigil for her.

It is formed as a result of subduction of the Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate underneath the South American Plate. The belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones which are separated by volcanic gaps. The volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style, products, and morphology. While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to, there are significant differences within volcanic zones and even between neighboring volcanoes. Despite being a type location for calc-alkalic and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a broad range of volcano-tectonic settings, as it has rift systems and extensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of mid-ocean ridges and seamount chains as well as a large range of crustal thicknesses and magma ascent paths and different amounts of crustal assimilations. Romeral in Colombia is the northernmost active member of the Andean Volcanic Belt. Global Volcanism Program South of latitude 49¬∞ S within the Austral Volcanic Zone volcanic activity decreases with the southernmost volcano Fueguino in Tierra del Fuego archipelago. Volcanic zones The Andean Volcanic Belt is segmented into four main areas of active volcanism; the Northern, Central, Southern, and Austral volcanic zones, each of which is a separate continental volcanic arc. Northern Volcanic Zone The Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ) extends from Colombia to Ecuador and includes all volcanoes on the continental mainland of these countries. Of the volcanoes in this zone, 55 are located in Ecuador, while 19 are in Colombia. In Ecuador, the volcanoes are located in the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Real while in Colombia they are located in the Western and Central Ranges. The Pliocene Iza-Paipa volcanic complex in Boyac√°, in the Eastern Ranges is the northernmost manifestation of the Northern Andean Volcanic Belt. The volcanic arc has formed due to subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath western South America. Some volcanoes of the Northern Volcanic Zone, such as Galeras and Nevado del Ruiz that lie in densely populated highland areas, are significant sources of hazards. It has been estimated that crustal thickness beneath this region varies from around 40 to perhaps more than . Sangay is the southernmost volcano of the Northern Volcanic Zone. The Geophysics Institute at the National Polytechnic School in Quito, Ecuador houses an international team of seismologists and volcanologists whose responsibility is to monitor Ecuador's numerous active volcanoes in the Andean Volcanic Belt and the Gal√°pagos Islands, all of which is part of the Ring of Fire. Central Volcanic Zone The Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) is a volcanic arc in western South America. It is one of the four volcanic zones of the Andes. The Central Volcanic Zone extends from Peru to Chile and forms the western boundary of the Altiplano plateau. The volcanic arc has formed due to subduction of the Nazca Plate under western South America along the Peru‚ÄìChile Trench. To the south, the CVZ is limited by the Pampean flat-slab segment or Norte Chico flat-slab segment, a region devoid of volcanism due to a lower subduction angle caused by the subduction of Juan Fern√°ndez Ridge. The CVZ is characterized by a continental crust that reaches a thickness of approximately . Within this zone, there are 44 major and 18 minor volcanic centers that are considered to be active. This volcanic zone also contains not less than six potentially active large silicic volcanic systems, which include those of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex, as are Cerro Panizos, Pastos Grandes, Cerro Guacha, and La Pacana. Other silicic systems are Los Frailes ignimbrite plateau in Bolivia, and the caldera complexes of Incapillo and Cerro Gal√°n in Argentina. Southern Volcanic Zone The South Volcanic Zone (SVZ) extends roughly from Central Chile's Andes at the latitude of Santiago, at ca. 33¬∞S, to Cerro Arenales in Ays√©n Region at ca. 46¬∞S, a distance of well over . The arc has formed due to subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate along the Peru‚ÄìChile Trench. The northern boundary of the SVZ is marked by the flat-slab subduction of the Juan Fern√°ndez Ridge, which is believed to have produced a volcanic gap called the Pampean flat-slab segment in the Norte Chico region since the late Miocene. The southern end of the SVZ is marked by the Chile Triple Junction where the Chile Rise subducts under South America at the Taitao Peninsula giving origin to the Patagonian Volcanic Gap. Further south lies the Austral Volcanic Zone. From north to south the Southern Volcanic Zone is divided into four segments according to the characteristics of the continental crust, volcanoes and volcanic rocks: *Northern SVZ (NSVZ; 33¬∞S‚Äì34¬∞30‚Ä≤S) *Transitional SVZ (TSVZ; 34¬∞30‚Ä≤S‚Äì37¬∞S) *Central SVZ (CSVZ; 37¬∞S‚Äì41.5¬∞S) *Southern SVZ (SSVZ: 41.5¬∞S‚Äì46¬∞S) In Central Southern Volcanic Zone and Southern Southern Volcanic Zone, magma ascent occur primarily by the Liqui√±e-Ofqui Fault. The Principal Cordillera of Andes (east Santiago) rose in late Cenozoic and became extensively glaciated about one million years ago. This meant lavas from NSVZ volcanoes begun to be channeled along a network of glacial valleys ever since. The Maipo caldera exploded about 450 thousand years ago, leaving behind copious amounts of ash and ignimbrite rock that can be observed today both in Chile and Argentina. During the Pliocene, the SVZ south of 38¬∞S consisted of a broad volcanic arc. The area with volcanic activity 1 to 2 million years ago between 39¬∞S-42¬∞S was up to 300 km wide (if back-arc volcanism is included). A reduction in the convergence rate of the Nazca and the South American Plate from 9 cm per year to 7.9 cm per year 2‚Äì3 million years ago contributed to a narrowing of the southern SVZ that occurred possibly 1.6 million years ago. The southern part of the SVZ retained vigorous activity only in the west, especially around the Liqui√±e-Ofqui Fault Zone, while eastern volcanoes such as Tronador and Cerro Pantoja became extinct. The magmas of modern (Holocene) volcanoes in the Transitional Southern Volcanic Zone are derived from heterogenous sources in the Earth's mantle. Many lesser parts of melts are derived from subducted oceanic crust and subducted sediments. Towards the east, in the backarc region, the degree of melting in the mantle that gave origin to volcanism is less as are the subducted crust influences. Several volcanoes of the SVZ are being monitored by the Southern Andean Volcano Observatory (OVDAS) based in Temuco. The volcanoes monitored have varied over time but some like Villarrica and Llaima are monitored constantly. In recent years, there have been major eruptions at Chait√©n (2008‚Äì2010), Cord√≥n Caulle (2011) and Calbuco (2015). Austral Volcanic Zone The Austral Volcanic Zone (AVZ) is a volcanic arc in the Andes of southwestern South America. It is one of the four volcanic zones of the Andes. The AVZ extends south of the Patagonian Volcanic Gap to Tierra del Fuego archipelago, a distance of well over 600 mi (1,000 km). The arc has formed due to subduction of the Antarctic Plate under the South American Plate. Eruption products consist chiefly of alkaline basalt and basanite. Volcanism in the Austral Volcanic Zone is less vigorous than in the Southern Volcanic Zone. Recorded eruptions are rare due to the area being unexplored well into the 19th century; the cloudy weather of its western coast might also have prevented sightings of eruptions. The Austral Volcanic Zone hosts both glaciated stratovolcanoes as well as subglacial volcanoes under the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Volcanic gaps The different volcanic zones are intercalated by volcanic gaps, zones that, despite lying at the right distance from an oceanic trench, lack volcanic activity. The Andes has three major volcanic gaps the Peruvian flat-slab segment (3 ¬∞S‚Äì15 ¬∞S), the Pampean flat- slab segment (27 ¬∞S‚Äì33 ¬∞S) and the Patagonian Volcanic Gap (46 ¬∞S‚Äì49 ¬∞S). The first one separates the Northern from the Central Volcanic Zone, the second the Central from the Southern and the last separates the Southern from the Austral Volcanic Zone. The Peruvian and Pampean gaps coincide with areas of flat slab (low angle) subduction and therefore the lack of volcanism is believed to be caused by the shallow dip of the subducting Nazca Plate in these places. The shallow dip has in turn been explained by the subduction of the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fern√°ndez Ridge for the Peruvian and Pampean gaps respectively. Since the Nazca and Juan Fern√°ndez Ridge are created by volcanic activity in Pacific hotspots (Easter and Juan Fern√°ndez) it can be said that volcanic activity in the Pacific is responsible for the suppression of volcanism in parts of the Andes. The Patagonian gap is different in nature as it is caused not by the subduction of an aseismic ridge but by the subduction of the Chile Rise, the boundary ridge between the Nazca and the Antarctic Plate. Peruvian gap Between the latitudes of 3 ¬∞S‚Äì15 ¬∞S in Peru the last volcanic activity occurred 2.7 million years ago in Cordillera Blanca. The lack of volcanism in central and northern Peru is widely attributed to a side effect of the flat-slab (low angle) subduction of the Nazca Plate occurring there. While the subduction of the Nazca Ridge has often been credited for causing this flat-slab and hence the lack of volcanism, many researchers find the gap too wide to be explained by this alone. One hypothesis claims that the flat-slab is caused by the ongoing subduction of an oceanic plateau. This hypothetical plateau named Inca Plateau would be a mirror image of the Marquesas Plateau in the South Pacific. Pampean gap The Pampean gap or Norte Chico separates the Andes Central and Southern volcanic zones. A low subduction angle caused by the subduction of Juan Fern√°ndez Ridge has been pointed out as causing or contributing to the suppression of volcanism. Back-arc volcanism Back-arc volcanism is a significant phenomenon in Argentine Patagonia and Mendoza Province. Flat-slab subduction along the Peru‚ÄìChile Trench during the Miocene has been pointed out as being responsible for back-arc volcanism in Mendoza and Neuqu√©n Province during the Quaternary. Notable back-arc volcanoes include Payun Matru, Agua Poca, Payun Liso, Pali- Aike Volcanic Field, Tromen, Cochiquito Volcanic Group and Puesto Cortaderas. Other significant back-arc volcanism regions include the Argentine Northwest where the Gal√°n Caldera is located and the Andean foothills of Ecuador's Cordillera Real, where a series of alkaline volcanoes like Sumaco develops. Geothermal activity The Andean Volcanic Belt represents a large geothermal province, with numerous hot springs, solfataras and geysers associated with its volcanoes. Already in the pre-Columbian era, the indigenous peoples used the various hot springs as places of healing. The geothermal exploration in the Chilean Andes was pioneered in the 1960s, although the site of El Tatio was investigated previously in the 1920s. Compared to neighboring Central America, the Andean region is poorly explored and exploited for geothermal resources.

The series centers around a group of wild cats living in four Clans, ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan, and ShadowClan. It was published on October 1, 2004, by HarperCollins Publishers. The story chronicles the events directly after A Dangerous Path and leads to the final battle for the forest. Plot Firestar is now the leader of ThunderClan, following the death of Bluestar and he receives his nine lives at the Moonstone. During the ceremony StarClan tells him the prophecy \\"Four will become two, Lion and Tiger will meet in battle, and blood will rule the forest\\". He chooses as his deputy Whitestorm, an experienced warrior who is old, but well-respected in the Clan. At the next Gathering, Tigerstar attempts to unify all four Clans claiming that it would help the Clans survive. While Leopardstar agrees, Tallstar and Firestar both refuse to join this alliance, which Tigerstar has called \\"TigerClan\\". Accompanied by Ravenpaw, who is on a visit to ThunderClan, Graystripe and Firestar go to RiverClan and find that Graystripe's kits, Stormpaw and Featherpaw, and Bluestar's kits, Mistyfoot and Stonefur, are being held prisoner because of their half-Clan heritage. Since they are all half-ThunderClan and half-RiverClan, Tigerstar accuses them of being traitors and abominations because of their mixed Clan heritage. Firestar, Graystripe, and Ravenpaw manage to rescue Mistyfoot, Stormpaw, and Featherpaw, but Stonefur is killed by Darkstripe and Blackfoot when he refuses to kill Stormpaw and Featherpaw. In an attempt to convince Tallstar and Firestar to join his alliance, Tigerstar reveals to them about BloodClan, a dangerous group of rogue cats that lives in the alleys of a nearby twolegplace and call themselves a Clan even though they are not an official Clan. When both leaders still refuse, Tigerstar orders BloodClan to fight for him, but they do not do so, as they only listen to the commands of their leader, a small black tom with one white paw ice-blue eyes called Scourge. Scourge tells Tigerstar that he is the only cat in charge of BloodClan, and after Firestar tells everyone Tigerstar's bloodthirsty history and that he cannot be trusted to share power, Scourge decides that there will be no battle. Enraged by Scourge's refusal to cooperate, Tigerstar attacks him, but Scourge proves to be a truly formidable fighter despite his small size, and slays Tigerstar easily by cutting him open from chin to tail with his claws, which are reinforced with dead dogs' teeth. This devastating blow wipes away all nine of Tigerstar's lives at once. Scourge then gives all of the forest Clans three days to leave; otherwise, they will have to fight BloodClan for the forest. To face this danger, the four Clans unite, forming an alliance which is known as LionClan. During the battle, Whitestorm is killed by Bone, the huge tom who is the BloodClan deputy, but Bone is killed soon afterwards when a group of apprentices avenge Whitestorm's death. The apprentices are Featherpaw, Stormpaw, Tawnypaw, and Bramblepaw (who is Tawnypaw's brother). The battle is won when Firestar kills Scourge, though he loses one of his own nine lives in the process. Without its leader, BloodClan scatters. With the forest returned to normal, the four Clans become independent from each other once more. Publication history The book was first released in the US on October 5, 2004, as a hardcover. It was later leased as a paperback on October 4, 2005, and later as an e-book on September 4, 2007. The book has also been published in German, Chinese, Japanese, French, Russian, and Korean. Themes Bookloons notes that the book \\"stresses the importance of caring and community\\". This is shown to be true as the Clans need to work together in order to defeat BloodClan. Normally, the Clans are enemies with one another, and occasionally form alliances with one other Clan, however, all four forest Clans had to cooperate to protect their home from BloodClan. Critical reception The Darkest Hour received critical acclaim. Hilary Williamson wrote: \\"The Darkest Hour is the best yet in this thrilling series of feline adventure, that also stresses the importance of caring and community\\". A reviewer for Booklist called The Darkest Hour \\"tension-filled\\".

Following The Darkest Hour and Firestar's Quest, and preceding Moonrise, it was released May 10, 2005. The novel centers on a group of feral cats living in four Clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan, and ShadowClan. Plot summary More than a year has passed since the previous book, The Darkest Hour. Bramblepaw, Tigerstar's son, has received his warrior name, Brambleclaw. Firestar has had two kits with Sandstorm, named Squirrelpaw and Leafpaw. Squirrelpaw is apprenticed to Dustpelt, and Leafpaw is apprenticed to Cinderpelt, in training to become the next medicine cat of ThunderClan. While Leafpaw and Cinderpelt search for herbs, StarClan, the cats' ancestors, sends Cinderpelt an ominous warning in some burning bracken, a picture of a tiger running through fire, which she interprets to mean that fire and tiger will destroy the forest. Cinderpelt concludes that the warning must be about Squirrelpaw and Brambleclaw, the daughter of Firestar and the son of Tigerstar. They share the warning with Firestar, who later decides to keep Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw separated. In a dream, StarClan tells Brambleclaw, Feathertail (Graystripe's daughter), Crowpaw, and Tawnypelt (formerly Tawnypaw, Brambleclaw's sister) to listen to what \\"midnight\\" has to say. Eventually, they begin a journey in the direction of the setting sun. Squirrelpaw tags along and Stormfur insists on accompanying them to protect his sister, Feathertail, as the six cats trek into the unknown world. On their journey, they meet an old loner named Purdy who helps the Clan cats get to the sun-drown place (ocean). Eventually, they reach the sun-drown-place and enter a cavern inhabited by a highly intelligent American badger known as Midnight, able to speak the languages of cats, foxes and rabbits, who reveals to them that humans will destroy the forest and that the cats must either leave the forest or die. She also tells them that a dying warrior will lead the Clans to their new home. The book ends with a short epilogue back in the forest, where the humans begin to destroy ThunderClan's territory. Publication history Midnight was first released in the US and Canada in hardcover on May 10, 2005. It was released in the UK on October 25, 2006. It was released in paperback on April 4, 2006. It was also released for the Amazon Kindle on November 6, 2007. Critical reception The reception of Midnight was mixed. Children's Literature gave a negative review. Points raised in the review include the demotion of Firestar to a simple spokesman, the huge volume of characters, and the \\"wimpy\\" group of traveling cats. However, the review did praise the character of Squirrelpaw. On the other hand, Kirkus Reviews said the novel was \\"structurally solid\\". BookLoons called the new generation \\"engaging\\". Inspiration and influences The forest depicted in the book is based on New Forest, a forest in southern England. The herbs that the cats use for healing is based on information found in Culpeper's Herbal by Nicholas Culpeper.

He was portrayed by Julian Stone from April 10, 1998 to December 14, 1999. In January 2007, the role was recast with Sebastian Roch√©, who was initially introduced as a terrorist named Mr. Craig, with his true identity remaining hidden until a few months later. Roche has held the role sporadically since, with his latest arc occurring from August to September 2012. He returned for one episode on December 18, 2012 and made a second return for multiple episodes starting September 30, 2013. After last appearing on December 3, 2013, Roch√© made several guest appearances throughout October 2014. He once again reprised the role of Jerry on December 10, 2015. Background Jerry is originally from Australia, but he and his family moved to Alaska. He is described as being a playboy, never bothering with love, just in it for fun and games. Storylines=2007‚Äì10 Jerry Jacks returned to Port Charles in January 2007, as James Craig, a mysterious man with ties to Lorenzo Alcazar. In February, he and a team of masked gunmen invaded the Metro Court Hotel and held numerous employees and guests hostage in order to steal a briefcase held in the hotel's vault by Alcazar. Sam McCall activated the silent alarm, locking the vault and alerting the cops who arrived within minutes. During this time, Jerry (as Mr. Craig) tormented the hostages, especially Carly Corinthos. He shot Robin Scorpio, and forced Carly and medical intern Emily Quartermaine to perform crude surgery on her in the hotel lobby while Robin's boyfriend, Dr. Patrick Drake, gave instructions by phone. Craig also forced Alan Quartermaine to suffer through an untreated heart attack (which later proved fatal). Sam, aided by Jason Morgan, was able to escape and told the police that the lobby was rigged with explosives. A rescue attempt was launched, and Craig triggered the explosives, escaping in the confusion. Jason tracked him down, and was able to wound him before rushing to the side of his dying father, Alan. A short time after the hostage crisis, Jerry showed up at Wyndemere, as James Brosnan, and poisoned Nikolas Cassadine, injecting him with a neurotoxin which would kill him in 24 hours unless a counteragent was administered daily. He blackmailed Nikolas into creating a false identity for him, breaking up with Emily, and pretending to have a relationship with Robin, whom he'd forced to break up with Patrick. While at Wyndemere, Jerry has several encounters with Nikolas's aunt, Alexis Davis, who was unaware of his involvement with the hostage crisis. In April, it is revealed that Craig/Brosnan was actually Jerry Jacks. He was being pressured by his mother, Lady Jane, and brother Jasper Jacks to attend Jax's upcoming wedding to Carly. On April 30, 2007, Jerry tried to observe the wedding, hiding in the shadows, but is spotted and recognized by his mother, even though he'd had plastic surgery. Jerry went to Carly's house knowing that she and Jax were still on their honeymoon, and that his mother was there watching Carly's sons, Michael and Morgan. The next day, Ric Lansing brought Carly a picture from the Metro Court surveillance camera of \\"Mr. Craig\\" for her to identify. After Ric left, Michael and Morgan told Carly that the man in the picture was \\"Jax's brother, Jerry.\\" General Hospital's head-writer Robert Guza, Jr. has stated on Jerry's change in character, \\"However much a troublemaker or a wild card Jerry was, he never would have done the things that Mr. Craig did. We will explain the transformation, what 'turned him.' You've got to psychologically explain how could this person do this... and we will.\\" It was revealed that Craig was forced to watch the brutal murder of a woman he had been in love with. The killers then tasked him with recovering the briefcase, threatening his death if he didn't get it. On July 31, Jerry's former lover, Irina is revealed to be alive and holding Jax against his will. Irina planned to murder Jax in front of Jerry, as revenge for betraying her. Irina raped Jax and then called Carly. After seeing Jerry kill Irina with no hesitation, Jax told him he did not want him in his life anymore. Jerry threatened Sam into seducing Trevor Lansing to get information on Anthony Zacchara. He was stabbed by Nikolas, but made a full recovery. On May 18, 2008, Jerry met and stabbed Anthony's daughter, Claudia. A month later, he began a fling with Alexis. It was revealed that Jerry had been posing as Mr. Moreau, a lethal drug dealer who was out to get Johnny Zacchara. He was also working with Dr. Ian Devlin, trying to acquire Alcazar's warehouse property. Then, Jerry started working with Russian mob boss Andrei Karpov. When Sam went undercover working for Karpov to prove that Jerry was working with him, he had her framed and sent to jail. Once she was released, Jerry tried to kill Sam by placing a bomb in a dumpster, but she was saved by Jason. He then kidnapped her and took her to a ship where he planned to blow up the ship with Sam onboard and fake his own death. Jason once again rescued Sam, and they barely escaped as the ship exploded with Jerry on board. Although Jerry was presumed dead, Jax received an anonymous phone call from someone who didn't say a word, leading Jax to believe his brother was still alive. Weeks later, Claudia receives a DVD with a cryptic message from Jerry, very much alive. He stated that he'd hidden several DVDs in Sonny Corinthos's house, detailing her part in Michael's shooting. It was up to her to find the DVDs before anyone else who would expose her. Claudia, who was now married to Sonny, frantically searched for the DVDs, and was caught in the act when Sonny's ex, Kate Howard, found one and discovered what Claudia had done. On April 7, 2009, Carly answered the phone in Jax's office, only to find that it was Jerry on the other end of the line. On July 30, 2009, Claudia sent Jerry down to Mexico to get revenge on Michael for her miscarriage. A few days later, Claudia called to tell Jerry that Michael was not responsible for her miscarriage, but that Alexis Davis had \\"confessed\\" to the crime. However, Jerry refused to believe her, and continued to search for Michael. Jerry ran into Sam, who was helping Jason search for Michael and Kristina Corinthos-Davis. Jerry used Sam to lure Jason out to an abandoned church, and after the roof collapsed over Jason, he shot him twice before leaving him for dead. When Jerry returned, Jason and Sam were gone (hiding in the ceiling). On December 13, 2010, Jerry returned to Port Charles, picking up the body of a criminal's son, and realized Jason was there, waiting to capture him. Lucky Spencer had set up a roadblock to trap him, but Jerry ran his car over a cliff, supposedly dying. However, he showed up later at Jax's house when Carly walked in on him playing with her and Jax's infant daughter, Josslyn. He gave Josslyn back to Carly, and told her he was there to take care of Brenda. Jax arrived and told Jerry to leave Brenda alone. Then Jerry pulled a gun on Carly, saying that he'll leave Jax and Josslyn alone, but he doesn't care about Brenda and Carly. Jax lets him go to protect Carly. It is revealed Jerry is working for Theo Hoffman aka The Balkan. During a meeting with Siobhan McKenna, Jerry is shot by an unseen person, causing him to fall into the water and be presumed dead. The shooter is later revealed to be Shawn Butler. 2012-15 In August 2012, Jerry resurfaced at Wyndemere, meeting with Dr. Ewen Keenan, revealing that he orchestrated the abduction of Robin Scorpio-Drake (under the orders of Cesar Faison masquerading as Duke Lavery) after Franco's death in the burning studio. Jerry injects Alexis Davis and Josslyn Jacks with an unknown substance. Then he goes to Atlantic City, to recruit an imprisoned Joe Scully Jr. to help him poison the Port Charles water supply. He purchases the local TV access channel from Todd Manning, to broadcast his plan. It is revealed that he injected Alexis and Josslyn with antidotes. Jerry takes Alexis hostage and tries to leave town via boat. A shootout causes an explosion on the docks, and Jerry is presumed dead. In Switzerland, Dr. Obrecht, working for Faison, is seen with Robin, who is being held hostage. Obrecht tells an unknown man that Faison has been captured, and she didn't know what to do with Robin. The man is revealed to be Jerry, who asks Robin what he should do with her as she looks on in fear. In August 2013 Luke Spencer and Holly Sutton discovered that Jerry had been hiding in Corinth, Pennsylvania, where he was operating a secret laboratory in the old Alden house. Laura Spencer-Baldwin discovered him there but he overpowered her and got away. In September 2013 Luke caught up with Jerry at Cassadine Island where he discovered that Jerry had been manufacturing a cure for polonium poisoning. The person doing the research - whom Jerry referred to as \\"my physician\\" - was Dr. Robin Scorpio-Drake, who is being held captive by Jerry in a laboratory. Since Luke is also dying of polonium poisoning Jerry has decided to keep Luke alive as a guinea pig to test any cure Robin presents him. Jerry believes Robin will try to poison him with a bogus cure, so he wants to give the first dose to Luke to see what happens. Eventually Robin develops the cure and gives it to Jerry and he goes to see Luke, Jerry attempts to test the cure on Luke but Tracy points a gun at Jerry and demands he fill the syringe with the full dose Jerry does so and Tracy takes the syringe from him and gives the dose to Luke, Jerry was not pleased and attempted to attack Luke but Tracy shot him in the shoulder and took Luke and Left Cassadine Island, Jerry later goes to see Robin and tells her the cure was stolen and demands she find a way to make another cure. In December 2013, he and Luke were fighting on the rooftop of the Metro Court Hotel. After falling, he fled the city with the help of Julian Jerome in which his former accomplice Franco Baldwin did not see or witness. Jerry briefly returned in October 2014, where he was able to trick Tracy Quartermaine into giving him ELQ shares in exchange for returning her husband to her. Tracy was under the assumption that the husband in question was Luke, but in fact, Jerry returned Larry Ashton to her. Larry would later be revealed to be in cahoots with Faison, Helena, and Jerry. Special Agent Kyle Sloane then comes to Port Charles after Jerry is still on the run and nowhere to be found. The aftermath lead to Michael committing obstruction of justice about ELQ shares. Robin was being held hostage at Cassadine Island trying to develop a way to keep Helena Cassadine alive but she died before Robin could finish, In December 2015 it was revealed that Robin was being held by Jerry Jacks and he was very interested in a way to stay alive forever which he could sell to highest bidder, Robin was working on the project but it wasn't quite finished, Jerry saw her as a liability and wanted to kill her because her parents pose a serious threat while Robin's best friend Sonny is disabled by Jerry's new accomplice Paul Hornsby who later became the district attorney of Port Charles. Robin begged for more time to finish and Jerry gave her 48 hours to come up with something or die. Robin made progress and showed Jerry but since it could take years before it could be fully perfected Jerry deemed that as failure and told Robin it was over and left afterwards Jerry told a man to kill Robin. Jerry was not pleased that the man had not yet killed Robin and told him to get it done afterwards Jerry returned and yet Robin was not dead yet and threatened the man to either kill her or Jerry would kill him while Jerry was gonna destroy all the evidence since Jerry found out Anna, Robert and Patrick were on the island. Later on Anna, Robert and Patrick made their way to the room where Robin was and busted the door open and Jerry was there, Patrick grabbed him and demanded to know where Robin is and Jerry replied Robin is dead. He later surrenders to the authorities and is sent to prison after Jordan Ashford became the commissioner of the Port Charles Police Department who she informed it to Jerry's accomplice Paul about it. 2019 On June 21, 2019, during a chat between Robert and Jax it was revealed that Jerry had escaped from Steinmauer and Robert threatened to find him and dismember him if he so much as checked the weather in Berkeley, California.

The book, which follows the adventures of four groups of wild cats (called Clans), was written by Erin Hunter (a pseudonym used by Victoria Holmes, Cherith Baldry, Kate Cary, and Tui T. Sutherland), with cover art by Wayne McLoughlin. Moonrise follows six cats, Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Feathertail, Stormfur, and Tawnypelt, as they return to their forest home from a journey to the ocean. They travel through the mountains, where they meet the Tribe of Rushing Water, a new group of cats first introduced in this novel. The Tribe cats are being attacked by a savage mountain lion called Sharptooth. The Clan cats eventually agree to help the Tribe get rid of Sharptooth. Series editor Victoria Holmes drew inspiration from locations such as the New Forest and the Scottish Highlands. Moonrise has been released in hardcover, paperback, and e-book formats, and has been translated into French, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, German and Polish. The book received mostly positive comments from reviews published in Booklist and Horn Book Review, which praised the plot and cliffhanger ending. However, a reviewer for Kirkus Reviews criticized the characters' confusing names and the writing style. Moonrise held the number two spot on The New York Times Best Seller list for children's chapter books for two weeks. Development=Inspirations, influences, and style The authors of the series drew inspiration from several natural locations in the United Kingdom. The four Clans (WindClan, RiverClan, ThunderClan, and ShadowClan) share a fictional forest based on England's New Forest. Loch Lomond is another location that influenced the setting of Moonrise. Some other sources of inspiration for the series include the works of authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. Cherith Baldry, one of the people who write using the pen name Erin Hunter, said that it was hard to write the death of Feathertail at the end of Moonrise because they had to present it in a way suitable for the book's younger target audience. Moonrise is written in an alternating third-person limited narrative, with the exception of the prologue, which is written in a third-person objective perspective. The point-of-view alternates between the characters Stormfur, who is with the questing cats, and Leafpaw, describing her experiences as the destruction of the forest begins. Publication history Moonrise was written by Erin Hunter, a pseudonym used by authors Cherith Baldry, Kate Cary, Tui Sutherland, and series editor Victoria Holmes. The pseudonym is used so that the individual novels in the series would not be shelved in different places in libraries. Victoria Holmes chose the name Erin because she liked the name, and Hunter because it matched the theme of feral cats. It also ensured that the books were shelved near those of Brian Jacques, an author that the writers, collectively known as \\"the Erins\\", liked. Moonrise was published as a hardcover by HarperCollins on July 25, 2005, in Canada, and August 2, 2005, in the US and UK. The book was released as a paperback on July 25, 2006, and as an e-book on November 6, 2007. Moonrise has been translated into various foreign languages: it was released in Russian on October 18, 2005, by OLMA Media Group, in Japanese on March 18, 2009, by Komine Shoten, and in French on March 5, 2009, by Pocket Jeunesse. The Chinese version of Moonrise was published on April 30, 2009, by Morning Star Group. It was packaged with a 3-D trading card depicting Feathertail, with some biographical information on the reverse side. The German translation was published on February 19, 2011, by Verlagsgruppe Beltz. Synopsis=Setting and characters Moonrise takes place in several locations inspired by similar locales in the United Kingdom. With the exception of a disused mine, the forest in which the cats live is based largely on the New Forest. In addition, parts of the story take place by the ocean and in a fictitious mountain range. The main characters each come from one of four Clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, and WindClan. These main characters are known as Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Tawnypelt, Crowpaw, Stormfur and Feathertail. All Clan cats share a belief in StarClan, a group of spirits usually represented by the stars, who are their ancestors and provide them with guidance. The Clans also follow identical hierarchy structures: Clans each have one leader, a deputy who is second-in-command, and a medicine cat who heals Clanmates in addition to communicating with StarClan. The bulk of each Clan consists of warriors, who carry out hunting for food, patrol borders, and fight battles when they occur. Apprentices are younger cats who are in training to become warriors, or more rarely, medicine cats. Plot In the previous book in the series, Midnight, StarClan, the warrior cats' ancestors, sent four cats (one from each Clan‚ÄîBrambleclaw, Crowpaw, Feathertail, and Tawnypelt) on a quest. Squirrelpaw and Stormfur went with them. At the end of their journey, they arrived at the ocean and found an unusually intelligent badger named Midnight. Midnight told the cats that the Clans would have to leave their forest home and find a new place to live, as humans were going to cut down the forest and build a new \\"Thunderpath\\" (the cats' word for a road). On the return journey, the Clan cats decide, after consultation with Midnight, to go through a mountain range which they had avoided in their initial travels. There, they meet a Clan-like group of cats called the Tribe of Rushing Water, who have their own set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe takes the traveling cats in and gives them food and shelter. The Clan cats discover that the Tribe cats have a prophecy: a silver cat will save them from Sharptooth, a cougar that has been killing many members of the Tribe. The Tribe thinks that Stormfur is the silver cat from the prophecy, and he is therefore expected to protect the Tribe from Sharptooth. Stormfur eventually agrees to help the Tribe. Together, the Clan cats succeed in leading Sharptooth into a trap in a cave. However, their plan to poison Sharptooth goes awry, as he swats the rabbit they used to bait him aside and goes after Crowpaw instead. Brambleclaw knows that they can't end their journey if the cat from WindClan is killed. Feathertail stares at the situation before turning to Stormfur, telling him this was for her to do not him. Without hesitation, she jumps up to the roof of the cave onto a stalactite, causing it to fall. Both Feathertail and Sharptooth are killed by the impact. Crowpaw and Stormfur are distraught and upset at the loss of their friend and clanmate. The Tribe then realizes that Feathertail was the silver cat in their prophecy, not her brother Stormfur, as they had previously thought. The five remaining cats then continue their journey. The book ends with Squirrelpaw noticing Highstones, which is at the edge of WindClan territory; they are almost home. Meanwhile, back in the forest, the Clans begin to experience the effects of the humans' intrusion into their territories, including lost and poisoned prey, destruction of the forest and cats being abducted. Moonrise is followed by Dawn, which details the events following the questing cats' return to the forest, and their subsequent journey to find a new home. Critical reception and sales Moonrise received mostly positive reviews from critics. Sally Estes, writing for Booklist, praised Moonrise for its \\"cliffhanger\\" ending \\"that will leave readers eager for the next installment\\", as well as the suspenseful possibility of the destruction of the forest. A reviewer for Horn Book Review gave a positive review, praising the plot, characters, and writing. The reviewer stated that \\"Hunter successfully weaves character, plot, and good writing into another readable story\\". Hilary Williamson, writing for BookLoons, gave Moonrise a positive review, calling it \\"exciting\\" and a \\"gripping epic\\". A reviewer for Kirkus Reviews criticized the novel for mundane writing, easy-to-confuse names, and the use of the words \\"meowed\\" and \\"mewed\\" instead of \\"said\\". The reviewer thought that the plot was \\"marred by the same preciousness of its predecessor\\", but praised the plot for its \\"enhanced complexity\\" and suspenseful writing, saying that \\"a small plot twist is refreshing and suspense builds steadily towards the final installment\\". The novel has also been mentioned for containing \\"magic, fantasy, and heroic adventure\\", and was recommended to fans of Harry Potter as possible reading material after that series' end. Moonrise reached The New York Times bestseller list for children's chapter books, holding the number two spot for two weeks. It was also ranked 121st on USA Today's bestseller list during the week of August 11, 2005. The work was also a success in Canada, reaching number seven on the Leader-Post children's bestseller list, and remaining in the top 15 for seven weeks. In a Fairfield, Greater Victoria store, Moonrise was reportedly more popular than Harry Potter.

It was first released on April 23, 2007 and won the 2007 Apple Design Award for Best User Experience. Coda version 2.0 was released on 24 May 2012, along with an iPad version called Diet Coda. Although formerly available on the Mac App Store, it was announced on May 14, 2014 that the update to Coda 2.5 would not be available in the Mac App Store due to sandboxing restrictions. Concept and idea The concept for Coda came from the web team at Panic, who would have five or six different programs for coding, testing and reference. The lack of full-featured website development platforms equivalent to application development platform Xcode served as the purpose for Coda's creation. Development Currently, little is known about the actual development of Coda. What is known from Panic co-founder Steven Frank's blog is that Coda development started at Panic sometime in late 2005. Assigned to the project were 5 engineers, 3 people on support and testing, one designer, and one Japanese localizer. Sections The application is divided into six sections (Sites, Edit, Preview, CSS, Terminal, and Books), which are accessed through six tabs at the top of the application. Users can also split the window into multiple sections either vertically or horizontally, to access multiple sections or different files at the same time. Sites In Coda, sites are the equivalent of \\"projects\\" in many other applications like TextMate. Each site has its own set of files, its own FTP settings, etc. When Coda is closed in the midst of a project and then reopened, the user is presented with exactly what it was like before the application was closed. Another notable feature is the ability to add a Local and Remote version to each site, allowing the user to synchronize the file(s) created, modified or deleted from their local and remote locations. Files Coda incorporates a slimmed down version of the company's popular FTP client, Transmit, dubbed \\"Transmit Turbo\\". The Files portion is a regular FTP, SFTP, FTP+SSL, and WebDAV client, where the user can edit, delete, create, and rename files and folders. Editor The editor in Coda incorporates a licensed version of the SubEthaEdit engine, rather than having a custom one, to allow for sharing of documents over the Bonjour network. Coda also has a new Find/Replace mechanism, which allows users to do complex replaces using a method similar to regular expressions. Coda also recognises specially-formatted comment tags in many syntaxes, called bookmarks, which appear in a separate pane beside the editor called the Code Navigator. Bookmarks allow the user to jump to the corresponding line of text from anywhere in the editor by clicking on the link in the Code Navigator. Plug-ins Coda 1.6 and later supports plug-ins, which are scripts usually written in command line programming languages like Cocoa, AppleScript, Perl, or even shell scripting languages like bash, that appear in Coda's menu bar and do specific tasks like appending URLs or inserting text at a certain point. Plug-ins can either be written using Xcode or through Panic's free program, the Coda Plug-in Creator. Command-line utility Coda does not come with its own command-line utility. Instead, a third-party utility such as coda-cli can be used. Reviews=Coda 1 Coda 1 received a review of 3.5/5 mice from Macworld. It received 4/5 stars from CNET's Download.com. Coda 2 Coda 2 received a rating of 4.5/5 mice from Macworld.

Fully fashioned stockings (FFS), are stockings with characteristic reinforcements on the heel and top, a so-called keyhole at the back of the top, and a stitched back seam in between. They are made to be worn with a garter belt and are today considered a vintage design of hosiery after largely having been replaced by seamless stockings and pantyhose from the 1960s onwards. Fully fashioned stockings are usually made from nylon and thus have very little stretch compared with modern stockings and pantyhose. Description Fully-fashioned Point Heel stockings with the welt, shadow welt, keyhole, seam and heel reinforcement clearly visible. Fully fashioned stockings are usually knitted from sheer nylon yarn. To support the attachment of suspenders, they have a darker section of double fabric at the top, called the welt. This is followed by a ligher transitional section called the shadow welt. The keyhole is visible in the middle of the seam at the back of the welt. The back seam is an integral part of the stocking and not sewn on afterwards. Fully fashioned stockings are sized to the height and shoe size (generally) of the wearer and have little or no stretch in them as they have no lycra (spandex) contained within the yarn. In addition to the distinctive seam they also come in a number of heel designs. The most common are the French or Point Heel, where the reinforcement ends in a sharp point, and the Cuban Heel, which ends in a truncated point.  Manufacturing  Fully fashioned knitting means that a garment is shaped by increasing and decreasing the number of stitches in a row. Fully fashioned stockings are made from sections of nylon fabric that are knitted flat from the top down in the shape of a profile view of a leg. These are then sewn together in the back forming the seam. The top is folded and sewn back on itself forming the welt and the shadow welt, with a finishing loop applied, forming the keyhole, to allow the needle sewing the seam to be withdrawn. Additional layers of nylon are added to reinforce the sole and heel. Fully fashioned stockings are becoming increasingly rare; only a handful of manufacturers worldwide now make them regularly. History Fully fashioned stockings rose to prominence in the market during the 1940s (peaking in the 1950s) with the introduction of Nylon, with over 780,000 pairs sold on the first day and 64 million in the first year of North American sales alone. They remained popular until the introduction of Lycra in 1958 and mini-skirts shortly after. Heel styles now vary from the original French (pyramidal) or point heel which was made most famous by the Aristoc Point Heel design to the Cuban and Havana heels ‚Äî darkened reinforced heel design finishing in a square top rather than pointed top ‚Äî the Cuban heel being defined by being much thinner and finishing higher up the calf than the Havana heel. More recently a number of manufacturers have also started manufacturing different heel styles ‚Äî most specifically the Manhattan heel which is a cross between the two above and French brand Gerbe coming out with some more distinctive designs around the heel.

Dawn was written by Kate Cary under the pen name of Erin Hunter. It was published on December 27, 2005 by HarperCollins. The book follows the adventures of the four warrior cat Clans after five questing cats return to the forest with a grave message to find a new home. Together, the Clans cross a mountain range and meet another group of cats, the Tribe of Rushing Water. At the end, a new territory is found beside a lake. The book was first published as a hardcover in the US and Australia on December 27, 2005. The book was then released in paperback and e-book formats. Dawn has also been published in the UK, Canada, and China. Themes in the book include religion, conflicting loyalties, and cooperation. The book received mainly positive reviews, but some reviewers criticized the limited prose and number of characters. Synopsis=Setting Dawn takes place in three places: the Clans' original forest territory, the mountain range inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water, and the lake territory located at the very end of the book. The forest in the beginning is divided into four territories for the four Clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan and ShadowClan. The forest is based on New Forest, which is in Southern England. Later, the Clans wander into the mountains in search of their new territory. There, they meet the Tribe of Rushing Water who give the Clans shelter and food. While with the Tribe, the Clans realize that the Tribe's spiritual ancestors are the Tribe of Endless Hunting, not StarClan: through this difference, the theme of religion is explored. After the Clans leave the Tribe, they arrive at the lake territory which the Clans decide will be their new home. Plot Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Stormfur and Tawnypelt have returned to the Clans from a quest with a message: the Clans must move to a new home, or risk death. The destruction of the forest has already begun, with the Clans starving as the food supply has been cut off and their habitat destroyed by the humans building a new road. At the same time, cats are being taken away by humans, including a ThunderClan apprentice, Leafpaw. A patrol is sent to rescue the captured cats, but Graystripe is captured after he succeeds in rescuing Leafpaw and other cats from RiverClan and WindClan, as well as many non-Clan cats. It is difficult for Firestar, ThunderClan's leader, to convince ShadowClan and RiverClan to leave. Finally, RiverClan decides to leave when their river becomes poisoned by humans. ShadowClan also agrees to leave when a tree cut down by humans falls in their camp. While trying help ShadowClan, Firestar loses his second life when a tree falls on him. Midnight, an intelligent badger from the previous book, had told the questing cats that a dying warrior will show the Clans the way to their new home. The dying warrior turns out to be the spirit of Mudfur, the RiverClan medicine cat who died earlier. As the Clans' spiritual ancestors are represented by the star, Mudfur runs through the night sky as a shooting star and drops behind the mountains, showing the new territory will be beyond the mountains. The Clans travel together through the mountains, guided by Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Tawnypelt, and Stormfur. While in the mountains, the Clans meet the Tribe of Rushing Water and Stormfur chooses to stay with the Tribe with Brook Where Small Fish Swim, whom he has fallen in love with, and his sister, Feathertail's, spirit. Near the end of the book, Squirrelpaw confesses her love to Brambleclaw and he confesses that he loves her back. At the end of the book, the Clans discover a forest around a lake that reflects all of the stars. This was the place where Starclan had sent them. Publication history The book was first published as a hardcover on December 27, 2005 in the US. The e-book version was released about a year later on November 6, 2007 and the paperback version was released on November 14, 2006. In the UK, the hardcover was released on January 1, 2006, a few days after the US version came out. The paperback version was released eleven months later on December 1, 2006. The Canadian version was released by Tween Publishing on November 2, 2006. Dawn was released as a hardcover in Australia at the same time as America on December 27, 2005. Similarly, the paperback and e-book version were released on the same day as the US, November 14, 2006 for the paperback and November 6, 2007 for the e-book. The Chinese version of Dawn was released on March 30, 2009 with a slightly different cover. 3-D cards featuring Leafpaw were packaged inside the books. Themes Themes in Dawn include religion, conflicting loyalty, and cooperation. A reviewer from Children's Literature wrote that it \\"shows how difficult it can be for four separate and sometimes hostile groups to work together for a common goal, but also shows the rewards of that cooperation\\". This refers to how all four Clans, who used to fight each other for food, must suddenly help each other for a common goal. Religion and loyalty are explored when the Clans meet the Tribe of Rushing Water, and Stormfur is torn between the Clans and Brook where Small Fish Swim, as well as when the Clans realize that Tribe cats believe in the Tribe of Endless Hunting and not StarClan. The religion issue causes the Clan and Tribe to be slightly distrustful of each other because they do not understand each other. Series editor Victoria Holmes, however, has stated in an author chat that both the Clans and the Tribe are \\"equally valid\\" when it comes to faith. Critical reception Dawn has been received warmly by several critics. In a review by Booklist, Dawn was said to be \\"eminently satisfying\\". A reviewer from Kirkus Reviews said that while the prose of the novel was bad, Dawn had a good plot. The reviewer also said that the author was able to make the reader care about the characters. A reviewer for Children's Literature commented on how difficult it was to not confuse the names, though it did praise the theme of cooperation in the novel. A reviewer for the Detroit Free Press also praised the book and recommended it to animal fable lovers and cat lovers. A review for both Dawn and Starlight from Horn Book included praise for Erin Hunter's ability to balance \\"multiple plot lines and points of view, creating a believable world\\".

Plot summary The four Clans of warrior cats, ThunderClan, ShadowClan, RiverClan and WindClan, discover a lake which serves as their new home, replacing their old home which is destroyed by humans. The Clans temporarily set up camp by the lakeshore and decide that, the next day, they sort out their respective territories and look for a Gathering place to hold their monthly meetings under a truce. During a meeting, Firestar, leader of ThunderClan, calls up Squirrelpaw, his daughter who is an apprentice, and promotes her to the status of warrior, giving her the warrior name Squirrelflight. The next day, the leaders call upon the four remaining cats that go on the journey to the sun- drown-place in Midnight, Brambleclaw, Squirrelflight, Crowfeather, and Tawnypelt, as well as Mistyfoot of RiverClan to explore around the lake and find camps for each Clan. The cats come across a location that seems ideal for RiverClan's fishing lifestyle. Continuing on, they find a coniferous forest which seems to suit ShadowClan. Desperate to prove herself by finding ThunderClan a camp, Squirrelflight runs ahead and accidentally falls down a large circular stone hollow. She recovers and realizes that it is a perfect place for a well-sheltered ThunderClan camp. The cats later cross a moorland which Crowfeather thinks suits WindClan's lifestyle of chasing rabbits. The five cats return and announce their findings to all of the other cats. The Clans decide to leave for their new camps the next day. After the Clans move into their new camps, Barkface, the WindClan medicine cat, goes to Firestar and tells him that Tallstar, leader of WindClan, is dying. Firestar asks Brambleclaw to follow him as well as Onewhisker of WindClan, at Tallstar's request. Tallstar tells them that he does not wish for Mudclaw, the WindClan deputy, to lead WindClan, and wishes to switch to Onewhisker as deputy. He dies soon after telling the cats. The next morning, Firestar and Onewhisker announce this to the other Clans, much to Mudclaw's anger. Onewhisker appoints Ashfoot as his deputy, although he has not yet received his nine lives and leader name from StarClan, the cats' ancestors. The medicine cats worry about whether there is another Moonstone (a sacred stone in the old territory which they can communicate with StarClan, their warrior ancestors) for Onewhisker to visit for his leadership ceremony. During Gatherings and times when the Clans are together, Brambleclaw spends more time with his half-brother Hawkfrost, which does not sit well with Squirrelflight. Brambleclaw has a dream in which he sees Tigerstar, his evil dead father, and Hawkfrost. Tigerstar praises Brambleclaw and Hawkfrost for their courage during the change in territory and tells them that he has great plans for them. There is also tension erupting in WindClan, which seems to be divided in two groups consisting of Mudclaw's supporters and Onewhisker's supporters. One night, Spottedleaf, a former ThunderClan medicine cat, now deceased, goes to Leafpaw, a ThunderClan medicine cat apprentice, and tells her to follow her. Leafpaw's friend Sorreltail accompanies Leafpaw, and the two of them go far up on ThunderClan's territory near the border with WindClan. Spottedleaf takes Leafpaw to her destination: a pool of water which reflects the stars and moonlight. Leafpaw sees all of the cats of StarClan and realizes this could be the replacement for the Moonstone. Bluestar, former leader of ThunderClan, tells her that this place, the Moonpool, is where medicine cats come to share tongues with StarClan. She goes back to tell Cinderpelt, ThunderClan's medicine cat, and the two of them tell all of the other medicine cats. Later, during the half- moon, Leafpaw receives her full medicine cat name, Leafpool. The next day, Mistyfoot rushes into ThunderClan camp and says that Mudclaw and Hawkfrost have been meeting at night. She then says that Hawkfrost and a patrol went out at dawn that day and had not returned, and she suspects that they have gone to attack Onewhisker's followers in WindClan. Firestar assembles a patrol to accompany him to fight, and sure enough, a battle starts on WindClan territory. Leafpool is left behind with a couple of other ThunderClan warriors in the camp. Two ShadowClan warriors invade and almost kill Leafpool when Crowfeather comes to her rescue. Crowfeather confesses he loves her, and she realizes she loves him too. During the battle, Brambleclaw fights Mudclaw. Although Mudclaw has the advantage over Brambleclaw, Hawkfrost saves Brambleclaw. Mudclaw claims that he and Hawkfrost had an agreement: Mudclaw would take over and make Hawkfrost the deputy, despite the fact that Hawkfrost is from RiverClan. Hawkfrost denies this when lightning suddenly strikes a tree, crushing Mudclaw and making a bridge to an island, making it the new Gathering place. Critical reception Starlight was successful in gaining a good reception among critics. A reviewer for School Library Journal called the novel \\"a fine rendition\\". A Children's Literature reviewer commented that the viewpoints of the characters were \\"cleverly written\\". AudioFile praised the narrator of the audiobook version of Starlight.

Emerson, ed. incomplete portions of six \\"drafts\\" lettered A‚ÄìF. Sheffield aggressively edited both the Memoirs and the MW in order to reflect Gibbon's anti-French Revolutionary sentiment while also downplaying his connection with Edmund Burke's eschatological interpretation; to prevent any further enlargement of Gibbon's reputation for harboring \\"irreligion\\" or atheism; and for other purposes of a more personal nature.Womersley, Watchmen, at 235‚Äì36, 240, and 346‚Äì49. In 1966, Georges Bonnard published a composite collection chronologically arranged, \\"built on the same general lines\\" as Sheffield's, along with a thoroughly informative account of the historical background.Bonnard, Memoirs, \\"Preface,\\" vii-xxxiii, at xxxi. The manuscript originals are all contained, with one small exception, in the British Museum, Gibbon Papers, Add. MSS 34874 (p. xiii). As to why Gibbon exercised six attempts to recount his life on paper, Bonnard opines that he was repeatedly dissatisfied with subject order and length. But from draft to draft, where Gibbon met with self-approval, he \\"very often contented himself with simply copying what he had already written.\\" (p. xxiv.)

Gibbon's first published work, an invaluable introduction to the Decline and Fall, defends the √©rudits (antiquarian scholars) against French philosophes (especially D'Alembert in his Discours pr√©liminaire √† l'Encyclop√©die [1751]) who had \\"contemptuously\\" assailed the √©rudits' work as inferior, parochial, and effete. Gibbon recoiled at the charges, and strove to reconcile the two groups by \\"proving...that all the faculties of the mind may be exercised and displayed by [the] study of ancient litterature [sic].\\" The Essai was reviewed with \\"cold indifference\\" in England,Gibbon, Memoirs, ¬∂\\"The design of my first work;\\" ¬∂\\"Two years elapsed in silence.\\" but on the continent, it was met enthusiastically. In Paris, Gibbon was recognized as a man of letters.

The brief work strongly recommends Scot historian and poet John Pinkerton to head the project; an editor, Gibbon writes, \\"replete with a variety of knowledge,\\" and \\"well qualified for this study, by a spirit of Criticism, acute discerning and suspicious.\\"Craddock, EEEG, 534‚Äì45, at pp. 538‚Äì40, 542, 544‚Äì45; 600. see also Norton, Biblio, 179‚Äì81. At this juncture, Pinkerton's reputation had been decidedly mixed: part serious antiquarian enjoying the patronage of Horace Walpole, part near buffoon whose work could evoke \\"hilarity\\" and \\"ridicule.\\" Gibbon eventually chose to prefer the former, believing that \\"the volatile and fiery particles of his nature have been discharged [leaving] a pure and solid substance endowed with many active and useful energies.\\" Craddock, EEEG, p. 542; Trevor- Roper, \\"Gibbon's Last Project,\\" pp. 407, 414.

Employing language undeniably influenced by Montesquieu, Gibbon observes that Bern in adopting an oligarchic form similar to the Venetian, has omitted any incorporation of the separation of powers, in doing so has ignored the \\"principles of liberty,\\" and therefore stands on the brink of despotism. Pocock identifies the Lettre as Gibbon's \\"first essay on empire in the context of European history.\\" By this time, Gibbon has clearly adopted erudition as \\"the dominant interest of his young and his mature life.\\"Pocock, EEG, pp. 89‚Äì91, 93.

The headwaters of the river are below Mount WagnerMount Wagner Wyo. accessed 28 Jan 2010 in the Salt River Range. The river flows west out of the mountains and then northward along the border of Wyoming and Idaho. It passes Smoot, Wyoming and then meanders through the mostly agricultural Star Valley, being joined by numerous creeks along the way, to its confluence with the Snake River near the town of Alpine (elevation ). The Salt River watershed drains about of the western part of the Salt River Range in Wyoming and the eastern part of the Caribou Range of Idaho. The Greys River, draining part of the eastern side of the Salt River Range, joins the Snake River just a few miles east of the mouth of the Salt River. About halfway along its course, the Salt River passes through a section known as the \\"Narrows\\", where it cuts between two ridges that divide Star Valley into an upper and lower valleys. The river's mouth is now inundated by the reservoir of the Palisades Dam in Idaho during high water. Paralleling the Salt River is Wyoming Highway 89 leading north to Teton and Yellowstone National Park. The river is an excellent source for fly fishing for brook, rainbow, cutthroat and brown trout.

Starting from about 1810 to 1840 it and its many tributaries was trapped in the spring and fall by numerous trappers seeking its often plentiful beaver, muskrats and other fur and game. From about 1858 to 1910 the Lander Road of the Oregon and California Trail paralleled much of the river from above Smoot to Auburn, Wyoming. Starting in 1866 to about 1880 an extensive salt works called the Oneida Salt Works dried the salt from some of these salt springs and sold it to miners, ranchers etc. in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. They closed down operations in the winter. Before about 1879 when settlers first started wintering over in the high upland valley later called Star Valley people left for warmer places to spend the winter. Some of the river's tributaries include Cottonwood, Stump, Willow, Strawberry, Cedar, Jackknife, and Dry creeks. Towns near the river progressing north include Smoot, Fairview, Afton, Grover, Auburn, Turnerville, Bedford, Thayne, Star Valley Ranch, Freedom, Etna, and Alpine.Tributaries and cities derived from USGS topo maps and Google maps.

The book begins with the group of cats known as ThunderClan rebuilding its camp with the help of its old friends Stormfur and Brook following a badger attack in Twilight. As the book progresses, BrambleClaw and Squirrelflight overcome a previous conflict and fall in love again, but Brambleclaw continues to visit the spirit of his evil father Tigerstar in his dreams. Brambleclaw manages to convince ThunderClan leader Firestar to choose a new deputy to replace the long missing Graystripe and is surprised when he is chosen. Brambleclaw's half-brother Hawkfrost attempts to kill Firestar in order that Brambleclaw might become leader of ThunderClan, but Brambleclaw saves Firestar and kills Hawkfrost, fulfilling the prophecy \\"Before there is peace, blood will spill blood and the lake will run red\\". The book was first released on December 26, 2006, in the US as a hardcover. It then was released as a paperback, e-book, and audiobook. The book was the third in the series to be released in audiobook format. The audiobook was read by Nanette Savard, whose performance was praised by AudioFile. Sunset received mixed to positive reviews from reviewers. Plot summary After dead badgers attack destroys much of ThunderClan's camp, Brook Where Small Fish Swim (Brook) and Stormfur, old friends of ThunderClan, help to rebuild the camp. The battle is not without its consequences, as both the medicine cat Cinderpelt and the warrior Sootfur die. The battle rekindles Squirrelflight's love for Brambleclaw (following a conflict between the two during the previous book), leading her to have an argument a few days after with Ashfur, whom she had moved to following her separation from Brambleclaw. All of the Clans are grieving for the death of Cinderpelt. Leafpool finds herself struggling between grief and betrayal, for she has not seen Cinderpelt in the ranks of StarClan. During a visit to the Moonpool, where medicine cats share dreams with StarClan each month, former medicine cat Spottedleaf goes to Leafpool in a dream and shows her that Cinderpelt is reborn in the form of Cinderkit, one of Sorreltail's four kits whom Cinderpelt died protecting. After months of waiting and with persuasion from Brambleclaw, Stormfur, the new medicine cat Leafpool and his own mate Sandstorm, Firestar, leader of ThunderClan, finally declares that his friend and deputy Graystripe is not going to return after being abducted by humans in Dawn. When a dream from StarClan, the spirits of the cats' ancestors, tells Leafpool that Brambleclaw should be the new deputy, Firestar agrees and appoints Brambleclaw as the new deputy. The decision is met with objection, because Brambleclaw had never mentored an apprentice, a requirement for becoming deputy. The matter is cleared when Firestar declares that Brambleclaw will mentor Berrykit when the kit turns six months of age and mentions Leafpool's dream from StarClan to his warriors. Tigerstar, an evil cat who is dead, continues to visit his sons (through different mothers) Hawkfrost and Brambleclaw in their dreams and when Brambleclaw becomes deputy, Tigerstar reveals his plan for Brambleclaw to take over ThunderClan and WindClan and for Hawkfrost to take over RiverClan and ShadowClan. Brambleclaw firmly rejects this idea, but agrees to make up a plan with Hawkfrost when they are awake. During the meeting, Brambleclaw hears a cat struggling in pain. He finds Firestar caught in a fox trap (wire snare) and Hawkfrost urges Brambleclaw to kill the ThunderClan leader so that Brambleclaw can become the new leader. After struggling with his desires, Brambleclaw refuses to kill Firestar and frees him from the trap. Hawkfrost attacks Brambleclaw, but Brambleclaw kills Hawkfrost with the trap's sharp stick by stabbing his neck. Before he dies, Hawkfrost claims to Brambleclaw that a ThunderClan warrior helped him with his plan and that their fight is not over. The prophecy \\"Before there is peace, blood will spill blood, and the lake will run red\\", given to Leafpool in an earlier book, is fulfilled; since Brambleclaw and Hawkfrost are half-brothers, they share the same blood and are kin, and as he stumbles down to the lake, blood pours from Hawkfrost's neck, making the lake run red. Publication history Sunset was released as a hardcover in the US and UK on December 12, 2006. The paperback version was released about a year later on September 25, 2007. Sunset has also been released in CD audiobook and e-book format. The audiobook was read by Nanette Savard, whose performance was praised by a reviewer for AudioFile, who stated: \\"Nanette Savard brings out the youth of the cats who are struggling to help their clan survive and to protect each other from outside danger\\". The book was also re-released in the UK on September 29, 2011, with new cover art. Critical reaction Sunset managed to boost the Warriors series into second position on The New York Times Bestseller List in the children's series section.HarperCollins Authortracker email, Erin Hunter. Feb. 8, 2007 It also received praise from reviewers for Barnes & Noble, who said the book had an \\"addictive bite\\". A reviewer from Children's Literature compared the novel to a soap opera, with conflict after conflict. These conflicts, the reviewer noted, added depth to the novel. The reviewer closed by saying that while not well-written and difficult to understand without knowledge of previous books, Sunset was still entertaining. A second review, also by Children's Literature, was lukewarm, saying it had a \\"steady pace\\" but could be \\"more frustrating than satisfying\\" for readers. Booklist praised the book, saying, \\"As series fans will expect, the action here proves as compelling as the relationships between cats and the dynamics among the clans\\".

It was released on April 24, 2007, and it is the first installment of the Warriors: Power of Three series by Erin Hunter. This book was recommended as Children's Summer reading by the Washington Post Children's Book Club. Plot summary In the prologue, it is revealed that near the conclusion of Firestar's Quest, a prophecy was sent to Firestar. After a report of a fox and her cubs loose in ThunderClan territory, the three kits, Lionkit, Hollykit, and Jaykit, secretly leave camp and try to track down the foxes and help their Clan. They end up in trouble, but are saved by a patrol. A few moons later, Hollypaw becomes Leafpool's (the medicine cat) apprentice; Lionpaw becomes Ashfur's apprentice; and Jaypaw becomes Brightheart's apprentice. At a Gathering, all Clans have little to report. In the middle of the Gathering, two unknown cats appear. The Clans realize they are Graystripe, with a new friend, Millie. Graystripe was thought to have died when Twolegs took him away in The New Prophecy. Instead, he managed to escape with the help of Millie, and found the new home with the help of Barley and Ravenpaw. It turns out all of the forest was destroyed. The Clans leave, and Graystripe and Millie return to ThunderClan, exhausted. The return of Graystripe causes another problem. Firestar appointed Brambleclaw as the new deputy, assuming Graystripe had died, yet Graystripe was still alive. To help make the decision on who should be deputy, Firestar sends Leafpool to the Moonpool to talk with StarClan. Leafpool is told that Firestar needs to make his own choice. Jaypaw follows her and when Leafpool sees him, she is amazed. In the end, Brambleclaw stays as deputy since he knows the Clan (and the new territories) better. When a battle with ShadowClan breaks out, Jaypaw can only defeat an enemy apprentice with the help of his sibling, telling him where the enemy is. Hollypaw finds the thrill of battling better than chewing up bitter herbs. Jaypaw likewise receives a dream from StarClan telling him he must become a medicine cat, because he has a gift to walk in other cat's dreams. Hollypaw and Jaypaw decide to trade roles, with Jaypaw becoming Leafpool's apprentice, with Hollypaw, Brackenfur's apprentice. At the next Gathering, a dispute breaks out between the Clans. To solve the argument, Squirrelflight shares an idea: to have a special Gathering, just once. Each Clan would have their apprentices compete in different contests; tree climbing, hunting, and fighting. Jaypaw is upset that he can't compete, and while staying behind at the camp, he has a vision. He is choking on earth, and he smells badger and fox. He is scrabbling desperately with his paws, until realizes that he is seeing through Lionpaw's eyes. It turns out that, while competing, Lionpaw and Breezepaw fell into a collapsing badger set. Luckily, Jaypaw got there in time to save them along with Crowfeather. The leaders decide that since every Clan won at something, there would be a tie and no Clan would win. In the end, Jaypaw walks in Firestar's dream and hears the prophecy, \\"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws.\\" Realizing that he and his siblings are the cats described in the prophecy, Jaypaw suddenly thinks \\"One day we will be so powerful that we shall command even StarClan!\\" Critical reaction The Sight quickly mounted #1 on all major sales charts, including the New York Times Bestseller List.18 May 2007 HarperCollins Erin Hunter AuthorTracker email It was recommended as Children's Summer reading by the Washington Post Children's Book Club.

It created the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority which is in charge of human embryo research, along with monitoring and licensing fertility clinics in the United Kingdom. The Authority is composed of a chairman, a deputy chairman, and however many members are appointed by the UK Secretary of State. They are in charge of reviewing information about human embryos and subsequent development, provision of treatment services, and activities governed by the Act of 1990. The Authority also offers information and advice to people seeking treatment, and to those who have donated gametes or embryos for purposes or activities covered in the Act of 1990. Some of the subjects under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990 are prohibitions in connection with gametes, embryos, and germ cells.Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 - Principal Terms Used The Act also addresses licensing conditions, code of practice, and procedure of approval involving human embryos.Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 - Table of Contents This only concerns human embryos which have reached the two cell zygote stage, at which they are considered ‚Äúfertilised‚Äù in the act. It also governs the keeping and using of human embryos, but only outside a woman‚Äôs body. The act contains amendments to UK law regarding termination of pregnancy, surrogacy and parental rights. Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and stem cell policy The Human Fertilization and Embryology Act 1990 regulates ex-vivo human embryo creation and the research involving them. This act established the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to regulate treatment and research in the UK involving human embryos. In 2001, an extension of the Act legalized embryo research for the purposes of ‚Äúincreasing knowledge about the development of embryos,‚Äù ‚Äúincreasing knowledge about serious disease,‚Äù and ‚Äúenabling any such knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease.‚Äù The HFEA grants licenses and research permission for up to three years, based on approval of five steps by the Research License Committee.HFEA - Centre for Human Reproductive Science HFEA policies are reviewed by specialists in the field regularly. After research and literature are reviewed, and open public meetings are held, the summarized information is presented to the Human Fertilisation Embryology Authority. Policy under reviewSperm and egg donation= Donors must meet certain criteria in order to be eligible for sperm, egg, or embryo donation. The donor can donate for research purposes or fertility treatment. Donors should find a HFEA licensed clinic, or can go through the National Gamete Donation Trust. =Multiple births as a result of IVF= The HFEA is carrying out a detailed review to determine the best way to reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies with in vitro fertilization (IVF). For example, Nadya Suleman (or \\"Octomom\\") is publicly known for giving birth to octuplets after IVF treatment. =Review of scientific methods to reduce mitochondrial disease= This policy allows for the use of techniques which alter the mitochondrial DNA of the egg or an embryo used in IVF, to prevent serious mitochondrial diseases from being inherited. Past policy reviews The policies reviewed by HFEA cover everything from human reproductive cloning to the creation of human-animal hybrids, and include subjects such as ethics with scientific and social significance. =Genetic testing= Sperm, eggs and embryos received in the donation process are currently tested for many medical conditions, and also quarantined for six months to reduce the risk of complications to the mother and child. Other than a screening for genetic disorders, donors are tested for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.Babycentre - Egg and embryo donation =Embryo research= Embryos must be donated by a woman between the ages of 18-35 years old, who has also undergone a medical screening and given informed consent (which can be revoked at any point up until the embryo is used). =Fees and regulation= *¬£3,000 for extraction and initial freezing *¬£160 yearly for storage *¬£4,000-¬£8,000 total per treatment cycle =Risks of treatment= \\"Welfare of the Child\\" review (multiple pregnancy), for people seeking IVF treatment. While there is always a risk of having a multiples pregnancy after receiving IVF treatment, HFEA is reviewing policies which will reduce this dangerous possibility. No more than two eggs or embryos can be legally implanted in a woman in an IVF treatment. There is a 25% success rate of this procedure per treatment cycle. =Clinical safety= Includes safety procedure regulations at fertility clinics; includes safe cryopreservation of eggs and embryos. Eggs and embryos are stored for ten years after the initial treatment. If the patient decides not to pursue another pregnancy, the eggs and embryos can be donated for research or to another couple for fertility treatments. =Payment of donors= In donor-assisted conception, the donor may not receive any monetary compensation (in the UK), although they may have related expenses covered.  HFEA and liquid nitrogen gamete storage  Sperm, eggs and embryos are stored in liquid nitrogen using cryopreservation (defined as the freezing of cells or whole tissues to sub-zero temperatures‚Äîthe boiling point of liquid nitrogen).http://www-cyanosite.bio.purdue.edu/protocols/cryo.html This method preserves living organisms in a state where they can be restored to how they were before freezing. A cryoprotective compound (a liquid called cryopreservation medium), along with carefully controlled cooling and warming cycles ensure that minimal damage is done to the cells. However, the freezing process is still somewhat damaging. Therefore, men wishing to donate sperm or have it stored for future use must make six sperm deposits for every one child they wish to have, due to the 50% survival rate of the sperm in each deposit. The sperm is then put into straw shaped vials, and placed in a storage tank of either liquid nitrogen, or liquid nitrogen vapor. The sub-zero temperatures of the liquid generally range from -150 degrees Celsius, to -196 degrees Celsius. According to HFEA, the storage period for both human gametes and embryos cannot exceed ten years. HFEA requires a full informed consent from each party that has any relation to the egg, gametes, or embryo, all of which must be stored in accordance with their consents. Exceptions to the informed consent of gamete storage: # Consent is not required if the gametes were legally obtained from the person in question before they reached 18 years of age. # Consent is not required if the person in question is about to undergo a medical procedure which could impair their fertility. In this situation, a licensed medical practitioner can sign off for the storage of the gametes. A medical practitioner can also authorize storage of the gametes, if it is believed to be in the person's best interest. # Consent is not required if the person in question is under 16 years of age, and is therefore considered incompetent to give consent. The act states that it is legal to \\"take\\" gametes or accept those provided, and store them without a person's consent, if the person is considered incapable, or until they \\"acquire such capacity.\\" However, under paragraphs 9 and 10 of HFEA 1990, a person's gametes cannot be legally stored in the UK after their death. Early litigation In July 1982 the Warnock Committee Inquiry was established. It was \\"to consider recent and potential developments in medicine and science related to human fertilisation and embryology; to consider what policies and safeguards should be applied, including consideration of the social, ethical, and legal implications of these developments; and to make recommendations.\\" The Warnock Report was published on 18 July 1984. The report stated that a regulator was needed due to the 'special status' of embryos. In 1985 the Interim Licensing Authority was created. It was supposed to regulate work and research regarding human in vitro fertilisation until a permanent government legislation was passed. It remained the only authority until 1990. The Unborn Children Protection Bill was also created in 1985. It was written by Enoch Powell and prohibited embryonic research. The Health Secretary would only have been allowed an embryo to be kept and implanted if it was for the sole purpose of assisting a named woman to bear a child. No other reason was allowed. This bill was not passed. It was reintroduced in 1986, where it again failed to pass. This was repeated again 1989. The Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985 was the first law that governed surrogacy arrangements. It criminalized commercial surrogacy arrangements. In 1987 the framework for human fertilisation and embryology was created. A white paper was published in regards to the recommendations of the Warnock Report. In 1990 the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 was passed. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, HFEA, officially started work August 1, 1991. HFEA coverage The act covers several areas: # Any and all fertility treatment of humans involving the use of donated genetic material (eggs, sperm or embryos). # The storage of human eggs, sperm and embryos. # Research on early human embryos. # The creation of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, or HFEA, which regulates assisted reproduction in the UK. Within the act an embryo is defined as a live human embryo where fertilisation is complete, complete is defined as the appearance of a two cell zygote. Storage of human eggs, sperm, and embryos The act states that eggs, sperm, and embryo can only be stored for a finite amount of time in very specific conditions that are regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. *Human eggs and sperm can be stored for up to ten years. *Human embryos can be stored for maximum of five years. Research on early human embryos Research on human embryos can only be performed for specifically defined purposes that must be considered 'necessary and desirable' by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Research can only be performed on an embryo for a maximum of fourteen days or until the primitive streak appears. The genetic composition of any cell within the embryo cannot be altered during the embryo's formation for research. The act defined several purposes: * Innovations in infertility treatments * Increasing knowledge regarding miscarriages * Increasing knowledge of congenital disease * Developing more effectual methods of contraception * Generating methods for detecting and identifying gene or chromosomal irregularities in embryos before implantation. Abortion provisions Section 37Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 - Abortion of the Act amends the Abortion Act 1967. The section specifies and broadens the conditions where abortion is legal. Women who consider abortion are referred to two doctors. Each doctor then advises her whether abortion is a suitable decision based on the conditions listed below. An abortion is granted only when the doctors reach a unanimous decision that the woman may terminate her pregnancy. An abortion that is performed without this decision or under any other circumstances is considered unlawful. Abortion may be granted under one of the following circumstances: # if the pregnancy has not exceeded its 24th week (previously lowered from 28 weeks in the Abortion Act of 1967) and has a heightened risk of injury to the physical and/or mental health of the mother, existing children, or family # if the pregnancy places the mother's life in jeopardy # if the pregnancy poses a risk of grave permanent injury to the mental or physical health of the mother # if there is significant risk or evidence that the unborn child would suffer from physical or mental abnormalities, resulting in a serious handicap The registered medical practitioner that performs the abortion will continue to act in accordance with the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929. Amendments In 1991 the statutory storage period and special expeditions sections were revisited. Regulations were extended storage periods for eggs and sperm. Licensing rules for egg and sperm storage were also clarified. A Disclosure of Information Act was created in 1992. This allowed the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to disclose information to others with the patient's consent. for example, information could be shared with their general practitioner. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 added section 156. This prohibited the treatment of cells from aborted embryos. During the same year the Parental Orders regulations allowed parental orders to be made in surrogacy cases. In 1996 the permitted storage period for embryos was extended. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Deceased Fathers) Act 2003 amended section 28 in 2000.Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 - Section 28 Sperm may be taken from a deceased male to fertilize an egg if the corresponding man and woman were: *married *living as man and wife *or had been receiving treatment together at a licensed clinic. In 2001 the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Regulations were added. These regulations extended the purposes that an embryo can be created for in regards to research. *Better understanding of embryonic development *Further knowledge of serious disease *research involving the treatment of serious disease In addition, the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 was passed. This essential made human reproductive cloning illegal by outlawing the implantation of research embryos. As of 2004 the Disclosure of Donor Information Regulations were formed. Any sperm or egg donors registered after April 1, 2005 were required to pass on name and last address given to the offspring. During this time Parliament began reviewing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.Department of Health - Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 (Archived) Licensing of all establishments handling gametes for treatment was required as of 2007 in the Quality and Safety Regulations. In 2006 a white paper was published regarding a revised legislation for fertility. This led to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, HFE, being passed. This was a major review of fertility legislation, updating and amending the act of 1990. In 2009 the HFE act was passed. This is the current law in the UK.

Kindt played college football for the University of Wisconsin Badgers primarily as a halfback from 1943‚Äì1946, missing the 1944 and half of the 1945 season because of World War II. He was the starting halfback for the Badgers for most of his college career. Kindt decided to forgo his senior season at Wisconsin in order to be eligible for the 1947 NFL Draft. He was selected with the last pick of the first round (eleventh overall) by the Bears despite having an history with injuries, and recovering from an off-season knee surgery he suffered while playing a basketball game at Wisconsin. After playing dual positions in his first few seasons with the Bears, Kindt was used primarily on defense for his last six seasons in the league. Considered to be a defensive standout during his playing career, Kindt was selected to participate in one Pro Bowl, and led the team in interceptions several times. His son Don Kindt, Jr. also played in the National Football League, as a tight end for the Bears during the 1987 season. Early career Kindt was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He played football for Washington High School in Milwaukee where he named to the All-City squad. He also played guard for Washington's high school basketball team. 1943 season After graduating from high school, Kindt received a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin. He became the starter at right halfback in his first year, while fellow freshman Clarence Self started at left halfback. In the season opener against Camp Grant, Kindt scored his first career touchdown on a six-yard run in the fourth quarter, which tied the game 7‚Äì7. Wisconsin went on to lose the game 10‚Äì7 after Camp Grant scored a field goal with five seconds left. In his third game, Kindt became a \\"hero of the game\\" for his playing tactics against the Iowa Hawkeyes. He scored the only touchdown of the game, a two-yard run, and managed to force the Hawkeyes to score a safety with time expiring when he did a quarterback kneel, and purposely fell down in the end zone, getting an Iowa defender to touch him for the safety. It prevented the Hawkeyes from potentially scoring a game-winning score as the Badgers won the game 7‚Äì5. Wisconsin temporarily managed to be in first place in the Big Ten conference play standings, though it was the lone highlight of the season for the Badgers, as they lost all their remaining games, mostly by blowouts and finished with a 1‚Äì9 record. After his first three games Kindt was impressing Wisconsin's coaches with his \\"ball carrying and defensive abilities\\", while scoring two of Wisconsin's three touchdowns so far for the season. In the next game against the University of Illinois, head coach Harry Stuhldreher named Kindt as the captain of the team. He missed the next two games due to a leg infection suffered prior to a game against the University of Notre Dame. He returned for the homecoming game against Northwestern University, where he played a \\"couple of minutes\\" as he was still recovering from his injury. He came back to full form against the University of Michigan. Overall, Kindt scored four of Wisconsin's six touchdowns of the season. World War II and 1945 season Kindt was drafted into the United States Army in 1943 while at Wisconsin, in the midst of World War II. He reported to active duty on February 1, 1944, receiving basic training at Fort Wolters, Texas. After training, Kindt was assigned to the Army's 10th Mountain Division. He missed the 1944 season and half of the 1945 season while participating in the Italian Campaign. He was rewarded with two Bronze Stars, and a Victory Medal for his actions in Italy. Kindt returned to play for the Badgers in October 1945. In his return, Kindt shared the halfback position with Ben Bendrick, and Jerry Thompson. Kindt only managed to play three games that season, mainly because of a late release he received while returning from the Army. When Kindt returned to the squad, one journalist took it as far as hailing Kindt's return as a \\"godsend\\" who inspired the Badgers with his \\"inspirational play\\". He scored two touchdowns against Iowa upon his return. In the season finale on November 24 against the Minnesota Golden Gophers, Kindt scored three touchdowns despite being used as a \\"blocking back\\" in a 26‚Äì12 win. The Badgers finished the season with a 3‚Äì4‚Äì2 record. 1946 season Prior to the 1946 season, Kindt was involved in a skiing accident when he fell down a flight of stairs, hurting his leg. He regained his job as the primary starter at the halfback position in time for the season opener. Kindt battled injuries with his ankle, leg and thigh throughout the season, which hampered his play at times. He rushed for 42 yards on 14 carries and one touchdown in a 20‚Äì7 upset over 14th ranked Ohio State Buckeyes on October 13, the first time Wisconsin beat Ohio State in football since 1942. The next game, a 27‚Äì21 loss against the University of Illinois, Kindt suffered a left knee injury after getting \\"kicked in the shins\\" during the fourth quarter and left the game, not playing on a regular basis afterwards. He rushed only for 21 yards on five carries in a 21‚Äì7 loss against Iowa on November 9. After the season, Kindt injured his right knee while playing a game of intramural basketball, requiring surgery at a time in which knee surgery wasn't as technologically advanced as today. During his career in Wisconsin, Kindt was considered to be the team's best all-around player, a person who could run, throw, and kick efficiently, as well as playing defense. He also punted and played safety for Wisconsin. Kindt was named to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988 and the University of Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997. NFL career Kindt forfeited his last year of eligibility at Wisconsin after the 1946 season to play in the National Football League. It was reported that the Chicago Bears had Kindt as its top player in their draft wish list. By the time the 1947 NFL Draft was held, the Bears managed to get Kindt with the eleventh overall pick. He soon signed a three-year contract at a reported $25,000 to play for head coach George Halas. After starting in a dual offensive/defensive role, Kindt decided to focus on playing only as a defensive back for the last few seasons of his career. During his rookie season, Kindt joined a backfield which contained quarterback Sid Luckman and George McAfee, the primary starter at halfback. That season Kindt rushed for 266 yards and two touchdowns on 61 carries. One of his touchdowns was a meaningless three-yard run while the game was out of reach, a 49‚Äì7 blowout against the Chicago Cardinals on November 23. The next season Kindt rushed for 189 yards on 54 carries and two touchdowns, as the Bears acquired former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack and Bobby Layne to join Kindt, Luckman and McAfee in the backfield. A highlight of the season happened against the Detroit Lions on October 17 when he had a 66-yard run for a touchdown in a 28‚Äì0 Bears victory. After running for 118 yards on 41 carries, an average of 2.9 yards per carry during the 1949 season, Kindt contributions to the offense were limited despite Layne getting traded to the New York Yanks, Lujack being injured and both McAfee and Luckman retiring. In his final six seasons, he only carried the ball 16 times for 13 yards and no touchdowns. Kindt was a starter at defensive back for most of his career. An outspoken player, Kindt was the defensive captain of the team by 1952. He was not afraid to criticize head coach George Halas on some of his coaching decisions, at times having to get separated from each other. One notable incident was during a 1952 loss against the Dallas Texans which Halas decided to start his second sting unit because the Texans were winless prior to the game. Kindt and Halas had to be separated after the final play of the game because Kindt \\"laughed\\" at something to his teammates after the Texans won and Halas ran across the field and kicked him. He later blamed Halas for the loss stating \\"poor defensive strategy\\". They had a similar incident during a game against the Green Bay Packers after Kindt miscalculated a play which led to touchdown and Halas kicked him in his knees. Kindt later claimed that Halas apologized for the incidents. He was selected to the 1954 Pro Bowl as a member of the West team, during which he scored a safety after tackling Cleveland Browns quarterback Otto Graham during the second quarter. In his career, Kindt appeared in 108 games with the Bears, intercepting 21 passes with 10 forced fumbles and one defensive touchdown. As a running back, Kindt had 172 carries for 586 yards and four touchdowns while as a receiver, he had 43 receptions for 506 yards and two touchdowns. Later life Kindt retired from football after the 1955 season to focus on a coaching career. In 1956, Curly Lambeau named Kindt as one of the assistant coaches for his College All-Stars squad, alongside future Hall of Famers Tony Canadeo, and Mike Michalske to play against the Cleveland Browns in an exhibition game. Again he was named as a coach for the College All-Stars in 1957. Kindt was the person in charge of the University of Wisconsin alumni varsity football game in 1958. He was married for over 50 years, and had three children, one of whom, Don Kindt, Jr. also played for the Chicago Bears in 1987. After his brief coaching stint ended, Kindt became a salesperson for the Badger Meter Company in Milwaukee, retiring in 1988. Kindt also dabbled with an acting career, appearing in amateur plays in his hometown.

In the television ads, the two turtles are usually shown together explaining why they are so happy with DSL service, and that if they got Xfinity, it would be far too fast for them.

He came in seventh place. Peterson returned in 2013 to compete on Survivor: Blood vs. Water and ultimately ended up in the finals, finishing third place with zero jury votes. Survivor=Borneo During the original Survivor season, Survivor: Borneo, Peterson worked only when necessary, and was able to successfully preserve much of his strength until the individual challenges in the later rounds. Although at times it made him appear lazy, he claims that this was part of his strategy.\\"Reality Check\\", TV Guide, June 27, 2004, at p. 64. As a member of the Pagong tribe, Peterson was one of the first Survivor contestants who was forced by circumstance to eat cooked rat for sustenance. In one episode, he made a disparaging remark about women, stating that \\"nothing is dumber than a woman, except maybe a cow.\\" However, his teammate Joel Klug laughed so hard that the comment was attributed to him, and the female members of Pagong voted Klug off at the next opportunity. After the two tribes merged into Rattana, Peterson (like all the remaining members of Pagong) did not realize that former Tagi members Richard Hatch, Kelly Wiglesworth, Rudy Boesch, and Susan Hawk had formed a voting alliance until the Pagong faction had been outnumbered and outmaneuvered. The Tagi alliance, along with former Tagi member Sean Kenniff, eliminated Peterson. At the Final Tribal Council, he voted for Wiglesworth to win the title of sole Survivor, but she ultimately lost to Hatch by a vote of 4‚Äì3. Amidst the fervor that swept the nation during Survivor: Borneo, a hacker announced that he had gained access to an area of the CBS Survivor website containing a photo array of the 16 contestants. An \\"X\\" was displayed across the picture of everyone except Peterson. This led many to believe that the network had inadvertently revealed Peterson to be the winner. A few episodes later he was voted off, and CBS admitted that its so- called snafu was done purposely to fool viewers and pundits as a way of keeping the true winner's identity secret (the Final Tribal Council, where Hatch was voted the winner, had been pre-recorded along with the rest of the season).Poniewozik, James. \\"Aaargh! CBS Is Playing 'Survivor' Mind Games\\", TIME, August 3, 2000. Retrieved August 30, 2007. Blood vs. Water Peterson competed for a second time on the show's 27th season, Survivor: Blood vs. Water. Peterson was cast along with his niece Marissa, with Peterson joining the Galang tribe of veteran contestants while Marissa joined the Tadhana tribe of the returning players' loved ones. After his excessive celebrating of the Galang tribe's first victory, the Tadhana tribe decided to retaliate by voting out Marissa. In the third Redemption Island duel, Marissa was defeated by the husband-and-wife duo of Candice and John Cody, finishing in 17th place. Peterson was switched to the Tadhana tribe after a tribal swap but eventually made it to the merged Kasama tribe. Throughout the entire season, he served as the right-hand man of alliance leader Tyson Apostol. In the penultimate Tribal Council, and the final chance to use a hidden immunity idol, Apostol gave his second immunity idol to Peterson, who used it to negate the two votes that were cast against him. Peterson made it to the Final Three, along with Apostol and Monica Culpepper, but Peterson received no votes. Apostol won the game with seven of the eight jury votes, while Culpepper received one vote. Post-Survivor=Acting and modeling Like several members of the Survivor: Borneo cast, Peterson has attempted to parlay his popularity into an acting career. Thus far, his most notable role has been that of absentee father Leo Thompson, whom he portrayed in 2001 on the CBS daytime drama As the World Turns. Other television appearances include Son of the Beach, The Hughleys, and Nash Bridges. He had starring roles in the independent films 13th Grade and Hell's Threshold, and also appeared in White Men Can't Rap and L-O-V-E. Additionally, he made a cameo appearance in The Scorned, which featured numerous personalities from American reality television. Peterson appeared in the Bravo series Battle of the Network Reality Stars, which pitted familiar reality television personalities against each other in a competition reminiscent of ABC's Battle of the Network Stars from the 1970s and 1980s. Initially, Peterson was the captain of Team Light Blue, but when contest rules allowed two teams to choose a member from each other's roster, he was selected by Team Red. The finale aired on September 21, 2005, the same night as Bravo's All Star Reality Reunion, in which Peterson also appeared. With the exception of his stint on Survivor, Peterson is always seen with a fully shaven head. He has been selected as one of the celebrity representatives for the HeadBlade, a razor designed specifically for men who shave their heads. He has also modeled clothing for South Pole. Sports In 2006, Peterson became co-owner of the Pennsylvania ValleyDawgs, a franchise in the United States Basketball League. However, the team folded later that year due to financial difficulties. The USBL replaced it with the Albany Patroons. In 2009, Peterson participated in a celebrity boxing match sponsored by the Celebrity Boxing Federation.

History The origins of ENAER can be traced back to 1930, when the Chilean Air Force formed a dedicated maintenance wing, the Maestranza Central de Aviaci√≥n (Central Aviation Workshop). During 1980, the Chilean Air Force established an aircraft manufacturing arm, IndAer. During the early 1980s, an agreement with Piper Aircraft saw IndAer begin the local assembly of the firm's PA-28 Dakotas for the Chilean Air Force. Around the same period, it also started building the ENAER T-35 Pill√°n, a military light trainer, which was developed for manufacture in Chile by Piper, based on a PA-32R fuselage with a new center- section and wing stressed for aerobatics. The first production aircraft was delivered by ENAER to the Chilean Air Force Air Academy in August 1985. On 16 March 1984, IndAer was reorganised as a state-owned company separate to the Chilean Air force, named ENAER (Empresa Nacional de Aeron√°utica de Chile, \\"National Aeronautical Company of Chile\\"). The Chilean Air Force initially provided the company with capital, personnel and resources, while one of the firm's prime responsibilities was to service the various aircraft types operated by the Chilean Air Force. During the 1980s, the Chilean Air Force acquired four Spanish-built CASA C-101 trainer aircraft, along with a licensing agreement for another eight to be assembled locally by ENAER. In Chilean service, the type is designated as the T-36 Halc√≥n.Tobar, Alfonso and Graham Warwick. \\"Looking forward.\\" Flight International, 14 April 1999.Hoyle, Craig. \\"PICTURES: Chile receives first four Super Tucanos.\\" Flight International, 5 January 2010. A follow-on agreement for a dedicated attack version of the C-101, which was locally designated as the A-36 Halc√≥n (\\"Falcon\\"), was also ordered by Chile; only the prototype was manufactured in Spain, while the remaining 22 machines were assembled by ENAER. Modifications over the trainer model previously procured included an engine upgrade and increased fuel capacity.Hewson 2001, p. 36.\\"Military Aircraft Directory: CASA.\\" Flight International, 29 July 1998. During 1986, ENAER decided to embark on its first entirely indigenous aircraft. It was a two-seat, single- engined light aircraft suitable for use by flying clubs as a training aircraft. As such, the project, initially known as the Avion Livano (light aircraft) and later known as the √ëamc√∫, was to be inexpensive, with a price of US$70,000 claimed in 1991. The first prototype made its maiden flight in April 1989, with three more prototypes following, one of which had a fatal crashed on 11 February 1992. After attempts to interest the Chilean Air Force in the √ëamc√∫ failed, ENAER set up Euro-ENAER, a joint venture with the Delft University of Technology and private Dutch investors, to certify the aircraft as airworthy in the Netherlands under European regulations; ENAER hoped to sell as many as 50 aircraft per year, at a price which had increased to US$100,000 per aircraft. By 1998, it was planned to assemble a modified version of the aircraft, powered by a Textron Lycoming O-320-D2A engine, in a new factory in the Netherlands. Certification was expected by late that year, while the unit price had again risen to $120,000. In early 1999, Euro-ENAER blamed poor weather and difficulties with the Joint Aviation Authorities for certification delays, while the unit price rose yet again to US$160,000, although the company was forecasting annual sales of 50 aircraft per year in Europe and 200 per year in America. Euro-ENAER certified the aircraft in 1992, but the company announced that additional funding was needed to start production. Financing could not be found, however, thus Euro-ENAER was declared bankrupt later that year.

In four years Plan Ceibal delivered 450,000 laptops to all students and teachers in the primary education system and no-cost internet access throughout the country. As of 2009, results include increased self-esteem in students, improved motivation of students and teachers, and active participation by parents (94% approve of the Plan according to a national survey performed in 2009). The success of Plan Ceibal is not only due to technological innovations, but also to achievements such as the creation of a training plan for teachers in primary education, the active inclusion of the society and teachers in the project and the successful design and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation model to measure the impact nationally that serves as a guide to define future actions in the Plan. Ceibal Project emerged as a result of the digital gap that existed in Uruguay between the people who didn't have access to technology and to those who did. It was impelled during Tabar√© Vazquez' term of office. Vasquez was the main proponent of this pioneer project; although it was inspired by Nicholas Negroponte's One Laptop per Child project. It raised three principal values: to distribute technology, to promote knowledge and to generate social equity. The project was named \\"Ceibal\\" like the typical Uruguayan tree and flower called \\"ceibo\\", known in English as Cockspur coral tree. Ceibal also stands for \\"Conectividad Educativa de Inform√°tica B√°sica para el Aprendizaje en L√≠nea\\" (Educational Connectivity/Basic Computing for Online Learning in English). The OLPC XO-1 computers used in the project are nicknamed \\"ceibalitas\\". Goals Ceibal Project tries to promote digital inclusion and decrease the digital gap that exists among the Uruguayans and between Uruguay and the rest of the world. However, this goal can be accomplished only if it is complemented by an educational plan for teachers, students and their families. The educational plan of Ceibal Project tries to create the technological resources, the teacher's formation, the creation of suitable content and the social and familiar participation. Ceibal Project has strategic principles: equity of knowledge, equal opportunities for children and youth, and the provision of tools to learn not only knowledge given by the school, but also knowledge that the child can learn by him or herself. The original expected outcomes defined the right to have an internet connection at school as well as at home, explicitly (\\"1.2.3. EXPECTED RESULTS\\") ofCeibal project#cite note-1.

Minas, Uruguay, December 2013[El Pais-Uruguay (3 December 2013) Morosoli for Plan Ceibal and Miguel Brechner.] English project Primera clase de Ceibal en Ingl√©s The project Ceibal en Ingl√©s was conceived with the aim to solve problem of lack of specialized teachers of English in primary schools in the Uruguayan public system of education, with the objective of universalizing the right of every Uruguayan child to acquire a second language through a means that would ensure both quality and sustainability.Montevideo.com LANZAMIENTO DE CEIBAL EN INGL√âSPresidencia 16.08.2012 Design The project allows primary school children between fourth and sixth grades to have three 45 minute slots per week of English: one taught by a remote teacher, model of language and in charge of introducing and explaining the linguistic content corresponding to each week through his remote presence via videoconference equipment; and two forty-five-minute slots with the classroom teacher, who following the lesson plans sent to her every week, may review, accompany and guide her students in the learning of English. Lesson plans are associated to digital and non-digital materials, which contain songs, games, videos, etc., so that those contents already presented and explained by the remote teacher, may be revised, reviewed and recycled under the conduction of the classroom teacher. Coherence between remote lessons and face to face lessons is ensured by a half hour virtual coordination between the two teachers involved in the learning process, in which concerns, learning and teaching styles are discussed. Each classroom teacher decides whether she wants to participate in this project, she does not need to know any English, but she receives an on- line course of English so that she can be one step ahead of her students and give them the necessary support. Pilot phase and expansion This project was piloted in twenty schools in the country between June and November 2012; five in the south (three in Maldonado and two in Pando, Canelones), and fifteen in the north between Salto and Paysand√∫, with a total of 37 groups. The group in the south started on June 23, and the one in the north on August 23. The results of the pilot phase are highly encouraging, for this reason Ceibal en Ingl√©s has expanded the project to one thousand groups in 2013. Plan Ceibal through an open international bid chose the British Council, a British organization of recorded experience in the teaching of English as a foreign language internationally, as its partner for this project. On Thursday, 9 January 2014, the BBC Mundo website published an article entitled \\"Thousands of children in Uruguay learn English with distance teachers\\". The report highlights the work done by Plan Ceibal and explains that \\"this is the first time in the world where telepresence technology is used to teach English to large classes of primary school students in the state system\\", according to Paul Woods, representative of the British Council, the organization providing the teaching materials.

History The first station at 100.5 FM to be located in the Greenville-Spartanburg market was WDXY-FM, a sister station to WORD (AM) in Spartanburg. 100.5 signed on in November 1960 as WLBG-FM, the FM sister to WLBG 860 AM in Laurens. It became WGXL in the 70s when it moved the tower to Gray Court and increased the power. At the time, well known local broadcast personality Monty Dupuy moved his morning show from WFBC to what was then called XL Stereo 100. Former WFBC-TV news director Dave Partridge also provided news on the station during this time. WGXL was sold in the early 80s to Keymarket Group, which took the station country in September 1981 as WSSL and moved it into the Greenville-Spartanburg market. The station is now owned by Clear Channel Communications, along with fellow country station WESC-FM. Musically, the stations are similar, with WESC playing some more gold/classic country songs. By the late 2000s, WSSL had emerged as the leading country music station in upstate South Carolina. The station is home to the popular Ellis & Bradley morning show.

Of particular importance is the existence, and sometimes explicit constructions, of self-adjoint extensions. This problem arises, for example, when one needs to specify domains of self-adjointness for formal expressions of observables in quantum mechanics. Other applications of solutions to this problem can be seen in various moment problems. This article discusses a few related problems of this type. The unifying theme is that each problem has an operator-theoretic characterization which gives a corresponding parametrization of solutions. More specifically, finding self-adjoint extensions, with various requirements, of symmetric operators is equivalent to finding unitary extensions of suitable partial isometries.  Symmetric operators  Let H be a Hilbert space. A linear operator A acting on H with dense domain Dom(A) is symmetric if :\\\\langle Ax, y\\\\rangle = \\\\langle x, A y\\\\rangle for all x, y in Dom(A). If Dom(A) = H, the Hellinger-Toeplitz theorem says that A is a bounded operator, in which case A is self-adjoint and the extension problem is trivial. In general, a symmetric operator is self-adjoint if the domain of its adjoint, Dom(A*), lies in Dom(A). When dealing with unbounded operators, it is often desirable to be able to assume that the operator in question is closed. In the present context, it is a convenient fact that every symmetric operator A is closable. That is, A has a smallest closed extension, called the closure of A. This can be shown by invoking the symmetric assumption and Riesz representation theorem. Since A and its closure have the same closed extensions, it can always be assumed that the symmetric operator of interest is closed. In the sequel, a symmetric operator will be assumed to be densely defined and closed. Problem Given a densely defined closed symmetric operator A, find its self-adjoint extensions. This question can be translated to an operator-theoretic one. As a heuristic motivation, notice that the Cayley transform on the complex plane, defined by :z \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{z-i}{z+i} maps the real line to the unit circle. This suggests one define, for a symmetric operator A, :U_A = (A - i)(A + i)^{-1}\\\\, on Ran(A + i), the range of A + i. The operator UA is in fact an isometry between closed subspaces that takes (A + i)x to (A - i)x for x in Dom(A). The map :A \\\\mapsto U_A is also called the Cayley transform of the symmetric operator A. Given UA, A can be recovered by :A = - i(U + 1)(U - 1)^{-1} ,\\\\, defined on Dom(A) = Ran(U - 1). Now if : \\\\tilde{U} is an isometric extension of UA, the operator :\\\\tilde{A} = - i( \\\\tilde{U} + 1)( \\\\tilde{U} - 1 )^{-1} acting on : Ran (- \\\\frac{i}{2} ( \\\\tilde{U} - 1)) = Ran ( \\\\tilde{U} - 1) is a symmetric extension of A. Theorem The symmetric extensions of a closed symmetric operator A is in one-to-one correspondence with the isometric extensions of its Cayley transform UA. Of more interest is the existence of self-adjoint extensions. The following is true. Theorem A closed symmetric operator A is self-adjoint if and only if Ran (A ¬± i) = H, i.e. when its Cayley transform UA is a unitary operator on H. Corollary The self-adjoint extensions of a closed symmetric operator A is in one-to-one correspondence with the unitary extensions of its Cayley transform UA. Define the deficiency subspaces of A by :K_+ = Ran(A+i)^{\\\\perp} and :K_- = Ran(A-i)^{\\\\perp}. In this language, the description of the self-adjoint extension problem given by the corollary can be restated as follows: a symmetric operator A has self-adjoint extensions if and only if its Cayley transform UA has unitary extensions to H, i.e. the deficiency subspaces K+ and K‚àí have the same dimension.  An example  Consider the Hilbert space L2[0,1]. On the subspace of absolutely continuous function that vanish on the boundary, define the operator A by :A f = i \\\\frac{d}{dx} f. Integration by parts shows A is symmetric. Its adjoint A* is the same operator with Dom(A*) being the absolutely continuous functions with no boundary condition. We will see that extending A amounts to modifying the boundary conditions, thereby enlarging Dom(A) and reducing Dom(A*), until the two coincide. Direct calculation shows that K+ and K‚àí are one-dimensional subspaces given by :K_+ = \\\\operatorname{span} {\\\\phi_+ = a \\\\cdot e^x } and :K_- = \\\\operatorname{span}{ \\\\phi_- = a \\\\cdot e^{-x} } where a is a normalizing constant. So the self-adjoint extensions of A are parametrized by the unit circle in the complex plane, . For each unitary UŒ± : K‚àí ‚Üí K+, defined by UŒ±(œÜ‚àí) = Œ±œÜ+, there corresponds an extension AŒ± with domain : \\\\operatorname{Dom}(A_{\\\\alpha}) = { f + \\\\beta (\\\\alpha \\\\phi_{-} - \\\\phi_+)  f \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Dom}(A) , \\\\; \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} }. If f ‚àà Dom(AŒ±), then f is absolutely continuous and :\\\\left\\\\frac{f(0)}{f(1)}\\\\right = \\\\left\\\\frac{e\\\\alpha -1}{\\\\alpha - e}\\\\right = 1. Conversely, if f is absolutely continuous and f(0) = Œ≥f(1) for some complex Œ≥ with Œ≥ = 1, then f lies in the above domain. The self-adjoint operators { AŒ± } are instances of the momentum operator in quantum mechanics.  Self-adjoint extension on a larger space  Every partial isometry can be extended, on a possibly larger space, to a unitary operator. Consequently, every symmetric operator has a self- adjoint extension, on a possibly larger space.  Positive symmetric operators  A symmetric operator A is called positive if \\\\langle A x, x\\\\rangle\\\\ge 0 for all x in Dom(A). It is known that for every such A, one has dim(K+) = dim(K‚àí). Therefore, every positive symmetric operator has self-adjoint extensions. The more interesting question in this direction is whether A has positive self- adjoint extensions. For two positive operators A and B, we put A ‚â§ B if :(A + 1)^{-1} \\\\ge (B + 1)^{-1} in the sense of bounded operators.  Structure of 2 √ó 2 matrix contractions  While the extension problem for general symmetric operators is essentially that of extending partial isometries to unitaries, for positive symmetric operators the question becomes one of extending contractions: by \\"filling out\\" certain unknown entries of a 2 √ó 2 self-adjoint contraction, we obtain the positive self-adjoint extensions of a positive symmetric operator. Before stating the relevant result, we first fix some terminology. For a contraction Œì, acting on H, we define its defect operators by : D_{ \\\\Gamma } = (1 - \\\\Gamma^*\\\\Gamma )^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad D_{\\\\Gamma^*} = (1 - \\\\Gamma \\\\Gamma^*)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}. The defect spaces of Œì are :\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\Gamma} = Ran( D_{\\\\Gamma} ) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\Gamma^*} = Ran( D_{\\\\Gamma^*} ). The defect operators indicate the non-unitarity of Œì, while the defect spaces ensure uniqueness in some parameterizations. Using this machinery, one can explicitly describe the structure of general matrix contractions. We will only need the 2 √ó 2 case. Every 2 √ó 2 contraction Œì can be uniquely expressed as : \\\\Gamma = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Gamma_1 & D_{\\\\Gamma_1 ^*} \\\\Gamma_2\\\\ \\\\Gamma_3 D_{\\\\Gamma_1} & \\\\- \\\\Gamma_3 \\\\Gamma_1^* \\\\Gamma_2 + D_{\\\\Gamma_3 ^*} \\\\Gamma_4 D_{\\\\Gamma_2} \\\\end{bmatrix} where each Œìi is a contraction.  Extensions of Positive symmetric operators  The Cayley transform for general symmetric operators can be adapted to this special case. For every non-negative number a, :\\\\left\\\\frac{a-1}{a+1}\\\\right \\\\le 1. This suggests we assign to every positive symmetric operator A a contraction :C_A : Ran(A + 1) \\\\rightarrow Ran(A-1) \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{H} defined by :C_A (A+1)x = (A-1)x. \\\\quad \\\\mbox{i.e.} \\\\quad C_A = (A-1)(A+1)^{-1}.\\\\, which have matrix representation : C_A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Gamma_1 \\\\ \\\\Gamma_3 D_{\\\\Gamma_1} \\\\end{bmatrix} : Ran(A+1) \\\\rightarrow \\\\begin{matrix} Ran(A+1) \\\\ \\\\oplus \\\\ Ran(A+1)^{\\\\perp} \\\\end{matrix}. It is easily verified that the Œì1 entry, CA projected onto Ran(A + 1) = Dom(CA), is self-adjoint. The operator A can be written as :A = (1+ C_A)(1 - C_A)^{-1} \\\\, with Dom(A) = Ran(CA \\\\- 1). If : \\\\tilde{C} is a contraction that extends CA and its projection onto its domain is self- adjoint, then it is clear that its inverse Cayley transform :\\\\tilde{A} = ( 1 + \\\\tilde{C} ) ( 1 - \\\\tilde{C} )^{-1} defined on :Ran ( 1 - \\\\tilde{C} ) is a positive symmetric extension of A. The symmetric property follows from its projection onto its own domain being self-adjoint and positivity follows from contractivity. The converse is also true: given a positive symmetric extension of A, its Cayley transform is a contraction satisfying the stated \\"partial\\" self-adjoint property. Theorem The positive symmetric extensions of A are in one-to-one correspondence with the extensions of its Cayley transform where if C is such an extension, we require C projected onto Dom(C) be self-adjoint. The unitarity criterion of the Cayley transform is replaced by self- adjointness for positive operators. Theorem A symmetric positive operator A is self-adjoint if and only if its Cayley transform is a self-adjoint contraction defined on all of H, i.e. when Ran(A + 1) = H. Therefore, finding self-adjoint extension for a positive symmetric operator becomes a \\"matrix completion problem\\". Specifically, we need to embed the column contraction CA into a 2 √ó 2 self-adjoint contraction. This can always be done and the structure of such contractions gives a parametrization of all possible extensions. By the preceding subsection, all self-adjoint extensions of CA takes the form : \\\\tilde{C}(\\\\Gamma_4) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Gamma_1 & D_{\\\\Gamma_1} \\\\Gamma_3 ^* \\\\ \\\\Gamma_3 D_{\\\\Gamma_1} & \\\\- \\\\Gamma_3 \\\\Gamma_1 \\\\Gamma_3^* + D_{\\\\Gamma_3^*} \\\\Gamma_4 D_{\\\\Gamma_3^*} \\\\end{bmatrix}. So the self-adjoint positive extensions of A are in bijective correspondence with the self-adjoint contractions Œì4 on the defect space :\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\Gamma_3^*} of Œì3. The contractions :\\\\tilde{C}(-1) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad \\\\tilde{C}(1) give rise to positive extensions :A_0 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad A_{\\\\infty} respectively. These are the smallest and largest positive extensions of A in the sense that :A_0 \\\\leq B \\\\leq A_{\\\\infty} for any positive self-adjoint extension B of A. The operator A‚àû is the Friedrichs extension of A and A0 is the von Neumann-Krein extension of A. Similar results can be obtained for accretive operators.  References  *A. Alonso and B.

The Trump administration decisively strengthened ties between the two countries Polish‚ÄìUnited States relations, alternatively known as the Polish‚ÄìAmerican relations, are the diplomatic, social, economic and cultural bilateral relations between Poland and the United States. The official relations on a diplomatic level were initiated in 1919, after Poland established itself as a republic after 123 years of being under foreign rule following the Partitions of Poland. However, ties with the United States date back to the 17th century, when the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was one of Europe's largest great powers and many Poles immigrated to the Thirteen Colonies. During the American Revolutionary War, Polish military commanders Thaddeus Ko≈õciuszko and Casimir Pulaski contributed greatly to Patriot cause, with Ko≈õciuszko becoming a national hero in America. Since 1989, Polish‚ÄìAmerican relations have been strong and Poland is one of the chief European allies of the United States, being part of both NATO and the European Union. There is a strong cultural appreciation between the two nations (polonophilia). According to U.S. Department of State, Poland remains a \\"stalwart ally\\" and \\"one of strongest Continental partners in fostering security and prosperity, throughout Europe and the world\\". Poland was also one of four participating countries in the U.S.-led Iraq War in 2003. In addition to close historical ties, Poland is currently one of the most consistently pro-American nations in Europe and the world, with 79% of Poles viewing the U.S. favorably in 2002 and 67% in 2013.Opinion of the United States - Poland Pew Research Center According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 36% of Poles approve of U.S. leadership, with 30% disapproving and 34% uncertain,U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup and in a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 55% of Poles view U.S. influence positively, the highest rating for any surveyed European country.2013 World Service Poll BBC Before the 20th century Kosciuszko statue in Lafayette Park, Washington, D.C. Although the partitioning of Poland which erased the Polish state from the map in 1795 prevented the establishment of official diplomatic relations between Poland and the new American state for a long time, Poland, which enacted the world's second oldest constitution in 1791, always considered the United States a positive influence, and even in the 18th century, important Polish figures such as Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko and Casimir Pulaski became closely involved with shaping US history. Haym Salomon, a Polish Jew, was the prime financier of the American side during the American Revolutionary War against Britain. Many Poles also emigrated to the United States during the 19th century, forming a large Polish American community in urban centres such as Chicago. American response to the November Uprising Writer Edgar Allan Poe wished to join the Polish Army to fight off the partitioning powers Poland's November Uprising of 1831 and the fight for regaining independence from the neighbouring empires was extensively-documented and editorialized in American newspapers. As historian Jerzy Jan Lerski described, \\"one could reproduce in detail virtually the whole story of the November Uprising from the 1831 files of American dailies published at that time, regardless of the fact that they were usually four-sheet affairs with little space left for foreign news.\\"#Jerzy Jan Lerski p. 26 There was only a very small number of Poles in the United States at the time, but views of Poland were shaped positively by their support for the American Revolution. Several young men offered their military services to fight for Poland, the most well-known of which was Edgar Allan Poe who wrote a letter to his commanding officer March 10, 1831 to join the Polish Army should it be created in France. Support for Poland was highest in the South, as Pulaski's death in Savannah, Georgia was well-remembered and memorialized. An American surgeon, Dr. Paul Fitzsimmons, from the State of Georgia, actually joined the Polish Army in 1831. He was in France at the time and, inspired by \\"how gallant Pulaski had fallen at the siege of Savannah during the Revolutionary struggle of 1776\\", he traveled to Warsaw as a field surgeon for the Polish infantry. The United States never initiated the creation of a military force for supporting Poland. Financial support and gifts were sent from the United States to the American-Polish Committee in France, which intended to purchase supplies and transport aid to Poland. American writer James Fenimore Cooper wrote an appeal for the organization at the height of his popularity, motivating a nationwide collection for Poland in American cities. French General Lafayette was an outspoken voice in France, urging for a French intervention to aid Poland in its independence from Russia. The French government sought to make peace with the Russian Empire and generally stayed out of the revolution.#Jerzy Jan Lerski p. 7. Following the collapse of the insurrection, American newspapers continued to publish news from British and French sources documenting oppression of Poles by Imperial Russia and also by the German Empire. Newspaper editors made mention of the Russians as \\"brutal\\" and \\"evil\\" whereas the Poles were \\"gallant\\" and \\"heroic\\" in their efforts. The American public was apprised of the ongoing suppression of the Polish Catholic Church and forced conscription of Poles into the Imperial Russian Army, hurting Russian-American relations. An American writer in Boston, Robin Carver, wrote a children's book in 1831 called Stories of Poland, which said that for Polish children, \\"Their houses are not peaceful and happy homes, but are open to the spies and soldiers of a cruel and revengeful government...There is no confidence, no repose, no hope for them, and will not be, till, by some more fortunate struggle, they shall drive the Russians from their borders, and become an independent people.\\"Stories of Poland. p. 141-142. Poetic tributes to Poland were written in America, and literature denouncing Russian treatment towards Poland continued after the Uprising. The Russian Emperor, Nicholas I, and his emissaries asked the U.S. Secretary of State for a formal rebuke of American newspapers reporting the mistreatment of Poles. Then Secretary of State Edward Livingston chose to wait two months before responding to Russia's demands, but the United States Ambassador to Russia James Buchanan made promises to the Russians that the American press would circulate evidence that Russian cruelty was \\"much overplayed\\". Historian Jerzy Jan Lerski was critical of Buchanan's pro-Russian stance on the Polish issue, and said he made statements on Poland without visiting the country or \\"listening to Polish testimony\\".#Jerzy Jan Lerski p. 32. Lincoln and the Civil War Poland's independence lost favor among American intellectuals during the American Civil War. Historians have argued that President Lincoln himself was sympathetic to the Poles but chose not to intervene in Europe's affairs out of fear that European powers would support the Confederacy. Historian Tom Delahaye pointed to 1863 as a critical breakdown in relations between the \\"Crimean Coalition\\" (Britain, France, and Austria) and Russia, with Poland's independence a key reason for conflict. Russian sympathies were solidly in favor of the North, and Lincoln expressed non-interventionist policy towards Russia's \\"Polish problem\\". By doing so, he alienated himself from British and French politics and came closer to the Russians, contributing to a balance of power in favor of the tsar. Second Polish Republic The U.S. embassy in Warsaw with shattered windows after the German bombing, Invasion of Poland, September 1939. Original colour photo by Julien Bryan. After World War I, United States President Woodrow Wilson issued his principles for an end to the war, the Fourteen Points in which XIII point called for independent Poland with access to the sea - \\"An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant.\\" On January 22, 1919, Secretary of State Robert Lansing notified Poland's Prime Minister and Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, that the United States recognized the Provisional Polish Government. The United States established diplomatic relations with the newly formed Polish Republic in April 1919 but the relations between the two countries were distant, while positive (due to United States non-interventionism and Poland not being seen as important for U.S. interests). Eventually both countries became part of the Allies in the Second World War, but there was relatively little need for detailed coordination between the United States and the Polish government in exile based in London. Communist period Edward Gierek, First Secretary and leader of communist Poland, waving from the balcony of the White House in Washington, D.C. in 1974. To the right is President Gerald Ford. On July 5, 1945, the U.S. government recognized the communist government installed in Warsaw, thus abandoning the Polish Government in Exile. After 1950, Poland (or the Polish People's Republic since 1952) became a member of the Eastern Bloc, and as such, America's foe in the Cold War. The first U.S. ambassador to post- war Poland, Arthur Bliss Lane, wrote a book I Saw Poland Betrayed about how the Western Allies abandoned their former ally, Poland, to Soviet influence. Despite this, the Poles and the Polish government maintained very close and warm ties with the Western Bloc and the United States. After Gomu≈Çka came to power in 1956, relations with the United States improved considerably. However, during the 1960s, reversion to a policy of full and unquestioning support for Soviet foreign policy objectives and negative attitude toward Israel during the Six-Day War caused those relations to stagnate. U.S.‚ÄìPolish relations improved once more after Edward Gierek succeeded Gomu≈Çka. A consular agreement was signed under in 1972. In 1974, Gierek was the first Polish communist head of state to visit the United States. This action, among others, demonstrated that both sides wished to facilitate better relations. The birth of Solidarity in 1980 raised the hope that progress would be made in Poland's external relations as well as in its domestic development. During this time, the United States provided $765 million in agricultural assistance and loans. Human rights and individual freedom issues, however, were not improved upon; the U.S. revoked Poland's most-favored-nation (MFN) status in response to the decision to ban on the Solidarity Movement in 1981 and instigation of martial law by the Polish United Workers' Party. MFN status was reinstated in 1987. Gierek and President Jimmy Carter, 1977 The Reagan administration engaged in clandestine support for Solidarity. CIA money was channeled through third parties., revised as Domber 2014, p. 110 . CIA officers were barred from meeting Solidarity leaders, and the CIA's contacts with Solidarnosc activists were weaker than those of the AFL-CIO, which raised 300 thousand dollars from its members, which were used to provide material and cash directly to Solidarity. The U.S. Congress authorized the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy, and the NED allocated $10 million to Solidarity. CIA support for Solidarity besides money included equipment and training,which was coordinated by Special Operations CIA division.Cover Story: The Holy AllianceBy Carl Bernstein Sunday, June 24, 2001 Henry Hyde, U.S. House intelligence committee member, stated that USA provided \\"supplies and technical assistance in terms of clandestine newspapers, broadcasting, propaganda, money, organizational help and advice\\".Branding Democracy: U.S. Regime Change in Post-Soviet Eastern Europe Gerald Sussman, page 128 Michael Reisman from Yale Law School named operations in Poland as one of the covert actions of CIA during Cold War.Looking to the Future: Essays on International Law in Honor of W.

June 28, 2008. Third Polish Republic Private meeting of Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa with George H. W. Bush, 1989 The United States and Poland have enjoyed warm bilateral relations since 1989. Every post-1989 Polish government has been a strong supporter of continued American military and economic presence in Europe, and Poland is one of the most stable allies of the United States. When Poland joined NATO on March 12, 1999 the two countries became part of the same military alliance. As well as supporting the Global War on Terror, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and coalition efforts in Iraq (where Polish contingent was one of the largest), Poland cooperates closely with the United States on such issues as democratization, nuclear proliferation, human rights, regional cooperation in central and eastern Europe, and reform of the United Nations. President Barack Obama visited Poland on 27‚Äì28 May 2011. He met with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski. The American and Polish leaders discussed economic, military and technology cooperation issues. Donald Trump at a bilateral meeting in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda, July 2017 In July 2017 US President Donald Trump in his second foreign travel visited Poland. He met with the President of Poland Andrzej Duda. President Trump and President Duda then held a joint press conference in the Royal Castle, Warsaw. President Trump thanked the Polish people and President Duda for the warm welcome he received in Warsaw. He said: \\"Our strong alliance with Poland and NATO remains critical to deterring conflict and ensuring that war between great powers never again ravages Europe, and that the world will be a safer and better place. America is committed to maintaining peace and security in Central and Eastern Europe\\". President Trump also spoke with European leaders attending the Three Seas Initiative Summit in Warsaw.\\" In 2018, Poland proposed that the United States open a permanent military base within its country. The Polish government would finance around $2 Billion of the cost of hosting American forces, if the proposal was accepted by the United States. Poland has proposed either Bydgoszcz, or Toru≈Ñ, as potential base locations. Since 1999, Poland has sought closer military ties with the United States. In June 2019, both sides agreed to send 1,000 U.S. troops to Poland. In September 2019, six locations were determined to host approximately 4,500 of the U.S. military in Poland, including: Pozna≈Ñ, Drawsko Pomorskie, Strachowice, ≈Åask, Powidz and Lubliniec. On 24 June 2020, Trump said at a press conference with Duda that the United States plans to move some U.S. troops from Germany to Poland. Trump said that \\"Poland is one of the few countries that are fulfilling their obligations under NATO ‚Äî in particular, their monetary obligations ‚Äî and they asked us if we would send some additional troops. ... I think [putting more US troops in Poland] sends a very strong signal to Russia.\\" Issues=Rados≈Çaw Sikorski Despite their apparently close relationship, Wprost (a Polish magazine) obtained a recording of Polish Foreign Minister Rados≈Çaw Sikorski calling the Polish-US alliance \\"downright harmful\\" and caused a \\"false sense of security\\"., while in a poll made in 2016, around 20% of questioned considered Americans a potential threat to Polish national security. Despite that, also in this poll, more than 50% of questioned considered Americans and Canadians as trustworthy. US missile defense complex in Poland The US missile defense complex in Poland was part of the Ballistic Missile Defense European Capability of the US, to be placed in Redzikowo, S≈Çupsk, Poland, forming a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system in conjunction with a US narrow-beam midcourse tracking and discrimination radar system in the Brdy, Czech Republic. The plan was cancelled in 2009. Polish society was divided on the issue. According to a poll by SMG/KRC released by TVP 50 per cent of respondents rejected the deployment of the shield on Polish soil, while 36 per cent supported it. In October 2009, with a trip by Vice President Joe Biden to Warsaw, a new, smaller interceptor project on roughly the same schedule as the Bush administration plan, was introduced, and welcomed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\\"Poland Agrees to Accept U.S. Missile Interceptors\\" by Peter Baker, The New York Times, October 21, 2009.

It was part of the building that stands at 599 Broadway until 2002 when the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) gave the owners permission to take it down so the interior wall could be repaired. The artwork has since been re-installed.  The artwork  The Wall was built in 1973 by Forrest Myers under a $2,000 commission by the now defunct City Walls, Inc. It consists of \\"42 aluminum bars bolted to 42 steel braces, painted green against a blue background\\" and takes up 3/4 of the building's wall that it resides on. It stands about 8 stories high.  Removal and re-installation The owners of 599 Broadway complained to the LPC in 1997 that the artwork had caused the wall it was mounted on to leak into the building, and that it had caused structural damage. The LPC finally allowed the removal of the artwork in 2002 under the condition that the owners put the art back up after work was completed. In September 2004 the owners were sued by the city to replace the wall. US District Court Judge Deborah Batts threw out the initial defense by the owners that the wall was an infringement of their First Amendment rights. In May 2005, however, Judge Batts ruled that the City was violating the owners' Fifth Amendment rights, and that the city could not force the owners to maintain the wall. However, if the city did decide to go through with an order to replace the wall, it would owe the owners fair compensation for the wall's construction. In April 2007, the City and owners announced a deal whereby the exterior of the building would be increased by 30 feet, so that the artwork could be installed higher, allowing for street level advertising space. Without the artwork, the owners estimated that the wall could generate up to $600,000 in advertising revenue a year.

Ross' musical style on Pale Rider strays only slightly from his previous solo album, This Is the Life, and thus breaks his tradition of making significant shifts in musical direction on each of his solo albums. Despite the similarities in style, Pale Rider is, overall, a more vibrant and melodic album than its predecessor‚Äîdespite its recurring themes of death and mortality. One of the strongest songs expressing these themes is \\"In the End\\", which Ross dedicates to Deacon Blue guitarist Graeme Kelling, who died due to cancer before the album's release. The lyrics reference the last conversation Ross had with Kelling just prior to Kelling's passing. Ross does not, however, break the tradition of featuring his wife and fellow Deacon Blue member Lorraine McIntosh on backing vocals for one track on the album. This time around, McIntosh is featured on \\"In this World\\".

History The club were founded as Old St Stephen's FC in 1880 in Westminster, although they soon moved out to play in Denmark Hill and Nunhead. In 1892 they were founder members of the Southern Alliance, one of the first attempts at a league in southern England, and topped the table before the competition was abandoned before the 1892‚Äì93 season was out. In 1894 they went on to become a founder member of the Southern League Second Division and finished third in their inaugural season; however they lost a test match against Royal Ordnance Factories and did not achieve promotion to the First Division. They continued to play in the Southern League under the Old St Stephen's name for another three seasons, never performing better than their inaugural season. During this time, in 1895, they moved across London to Shepherd's Bush, playing on Shepherd's Bush Green itself, which was to host football at the 1908 Summer Olympics (linked article says this event took place at White City stadium). In 1898 Old St Stephen's merged with another local team to become Shepherd's Bush FC. They took Old St Stephen's place in the Southern League and continued to play up until the 1901‚Äì02 season. Gaining the nickname of \\"the Bushmen\\", the club moved to Wormholt Farm, but when that site was threatened with development in 1904, Shepherd's Bush built and moved into the Loftus Road ground nearby; they played their first game there against Old Malvernians on 22 October 1904. In 1907 the club re-entered competitive league football, joining the Spartan League and a year later the Isthmian League, where they played until the outbreak of World War I. Loftus Road as it is today During wartime, Shepherd's Bush F.C. were unable to play any further fixtures and disbanded in 1915. In 1917, their ground, Loftus Road, was taken over by Queens Park Rangers, who continue to occupy it.

It is a twin-engined aircraft and can carry up to 8 people, including the pilot, and a range of military equipment or armaments. The helicopter is marketed for troop transport, medical evacuation, cargo transport, reconnaissance and surveillance and armed combat support missions. Development The Eurocopter EC635 was developed to meet a Portuguese Army requirement for a light fire support and medical evacuation helicopter, as part of its programme for the raise of a specialist army aviation unit, the UALE. The EC635 was first revealed at the Aviation Africa exhibition in May 1998 and the Portuguese Ministry of Defence subsequently signed an agreement for nine EC635 T2 helicopters equipped with Turbomeca Arrius 2B2 engines, at a cost of ‚Ç¨35 million in October 1999.Helis.com ‚Äì Nine EC635 Helicopters For The Portuguese Army Delivery of the first Portuguese aircraft was expected to begin in 2001; however, continual delays in production led to the Portuguese Ministry of Defence canceling the contract in August 2002, citing Eurocopter's failure to deliver all aircraft between August 2001 and April 2002 as the reason. Eurocopter claimed that disagreements over the integration of weapons systems on the helicopter were the reason for the cancellation.Helis.com ‚Äì Portugal Cancels EC635 Contract The Royal Jordanian Air Force agreed to purchase the 9 Portuguese helicopters in October 2002 and the first aircraft was delivered in July 2003.

In April 2006, the Swiss Defence Procurement Agency (Armasuisse) ordered 20 EC635's for the Swiss Air Force, to replace the aging A√©rospatiale Alouette III in performing transport and advanced training missions. The first four aircraft were built by Eurocopter, with the remaining 16 being built by RUAG Aerospace in Alpnach, Switzerland, and deliveries were as expected completed between March 2008 and December 2009.

The engines power a fibre-reinforced composite Bearingless Main Rotor (BMR) with four blades, and the familiar Fenestron enclosed tail rotor, both of which reduce vibration and noise levels. Vibration levels are further reduced by a built-in Anti Resonance Isolation System (ARIS). The EC635 can be fitted with either a conventional cockpit consisting of a traditional dashboard, or a glass cockpit, which utilizes a Thales 'Avionique Nouvelle' suite with MEGHAS Flight Control Display System and active matrix liquid crystal displays. There are four configurations designed by Eurocopter for the EC635. The Troop Transport version can be fitted with utility seats to carry up to 7 troops with a pilot, or passenger seats to carry up to 6 people and a pilot. The Medical Evacuation version can carry 1 or 2 litters with up to 5 seated medical workers. The Cargo Transport version has 4.9 m¬≥ (173.04 ft¬≥) of space for cargo, while the Armed Mission version is equipped with specialist equipment and weapons for combat (such as 70-mm-rocket launcher FZ233 from Belgian manufacturer Forges de Zeebrugge). The helicopter can also be fitted with a FLIR camera turret, an infra-red capable search light, SAR weather radar and electronic equipment for Observation Missions. Armed EC635s typically feature the Stand Alone Weapon System (SAWS) kit, which comprises a mission and firing control computer onto which various weapon systems and sensors can be integrated; such weapons have included 12.7 mm gun pods, a 20 mm cannon, 70 mm rockets and ZT3 Ingwe anti-tank missiles.

Lewis (March 17, 1940 - April 4, 2008) was an artist and peace activist, primarily noted for his participation with the Baltimore Four and the Catonsville Nine. Biography Lewis was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from the Catholic Mount Saint Joseph High School there and took courses at several universities in Baltimore, as well as studying art informally with Earl Hofmann and Joe Sheppard. Before his career as an activist he also visited Italy and was inspired by works in the Uffizi Gallery.Dowty, Morgan. \\"Incendiary Etchings: Tom Lewis and the Catonsville Nine,\\" _Art in Print_ , Vol. 7 No. 3 (September- October 2017). Lewis traced his life in activism back to a protest against the segregated Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in 1963, which he had intended on sketching as a journalist for Catholic publications before feeling compelled to participate. He subsequently joined the CORE, the Prince of Peace Plowshares, and developed close ties with the Catholic Worker Movement. His art became political accordingly, without severing ties with his religious background; in one example, in 1965 he made a woodcut of an antiwar speech Pope Paul VI made at the United Nations. Baltimore Four In the late 60s, he was involved in \\"actions\\" against the war, first as the Baltimore Four, who poured blood on draft files at the Baltimore Customs House in 1967.United States v. Eberhardt, 417 F.2d 1009 (4th Cir. 1969)Melville v. State, 268 A.2d 497, 10 Md. App. 118 (Ct. Spec. App. 1970) On October 27, 1967, the \\"Baltimore Four\\" (Lewis; Christian anarchist Philip Berrigan; poet, teacher and writer David Eberhardt; and United Church of Christ missionary and pastor, the Reverend James L. Mengel) poured blood (blood from several of the four, but additionally blood purchased from the Gay St. Market: poultry blood, according to the FBI, used by the Polish for soup) on Selective Service records in the Baltimore Customs House. Mengel agreed to the action and donated blood, but decided not to actually pour blood; instead he distributed the paperback Good News for Modern Man (a version of the New Testament) to draft board workers, newsmen, and police. As they waited for the police to arrive and arrest them, the group passed out Bibles and calmly explained to draft board employees the reasons for their actions. Catonsville Nine and prison While on trial for this protest, Lewis engaged in a more daring one with the Catonsville Nine, who \\"napalmed\\" draft files in Catonsville, Maryland.United States v. Eberhardt, 417 F.2d 1009 (4th Cir. 1969) One week later he was sentenced to six years in federal prison for the Baltimore Four protest, and in November 1968 to another three and a half years for the Catonsville Nine. He was ultimately released in 1971, serving out his sentence chiefly at the minimum- security prison farm at Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. While in prison Lewis continued to produce art, including over one hundred portraits of his fellow inmates, which he always produced in duplicate to allow his subjects to keep one themselves. The culmination of his work there was a portfolio of etchings, _The Trial and Prison_ , published in fifty copies to raise funds for the movement in 1969, while Lewis was briefly out on appeal. Produced in a prison art studio Lewis had to share with mafia members (for whom it doubled as stash house for smuggled wine and spaghetti), at times using ink of his own concoction from ashes, coffee or cocoa powder, the etchings depict the psychic distress of his fellow inmates and ghostly, near apocalyptic confrontations between police and protestors. The text was written by Lewis, and the cover printed by Corita Kent. Lewis was a well-known artist throughout the Worcester area, running printmaking workshops at the Worcester Art Museum for almost twenty years.. Many of his pieces still survive in galleries and archives throughout the USA. He was an art teacher at Anna Maria College, and he taught printmaking at the Cambridge School of Weston, and Worcester Art Museum. Baltimore artist Earl Hofmann instructed Lewis in art during the 1960s. Lewis was a memorable figure in the \\"radical Catholic\\" movement for his combination of art and activism; for example, Daniel Berrigan described his art as \\"‚Ä¶a poignant and powerful witness to the survival of the endangered conscience‚Ä¶. He heals the ancient split between ethics and imagination.\\" PeaceChain 18 The day after the invasion of Iraq on March 21, 2003, Tom Lewis and 17 other activists using the PeaceChain blocked the Natick Chemical Weapons Research Laboratory and were arrested. Mr. Lewis spoke elequently before the Judge during the trial about the consequences of the invasion. He, along with the other members of PeaceChain 18, was convicted for illegal trespass and disturbing the peace. The direct action was organized by the Peace Abbey of Sherborn, MA. Personal He dearly loved his family, and they became a huge part of his life. He often said that his pride and glory was his daughter, Nora Lewis Borbely, and that she was by far his greatest accomplishment. Lewis died at age 68 in his sleep on April 4, 2008. A portion of Tom's cremated remains is buried at the Conscientious Objectors cemetery on the grounds of the Pacifist Memorial in Sherborn, MA.

Malayappa swami is worshipped during religious ceremonies and processions wherein it would be inappropriate to use the main deity (for example one which requires the deity to be carried or moved). The two deities are worshipped equally and believed to be non-different in personality. The Malayappa deity is classed as a Swayambhu and was discovered in 1339 AD. Initial records state his original name as Malai Kuniya Ninra Perumal (Lord stood on the hill which bowed low to Him) History Ugra Srinivasa was the first utsava murti at Tirumala temple. In the 14th century AD, it is said that during the procession, fire broke out in the village and destroyed most of the houses. A vision appeared to a devotee stating that Ugra Srinivasa needs to be replaced by a new murthi that would be discovered in the glades of the mountain. The murthi was found in the place mentioned, a place where the hills appeared to bow very low and hence he was initially known as Malai Kuniya Ninra Perumal. Over the course of time, his name was shortened to Malayappan or Malayappa swami. The location where he was found is still known as Malayyappan Konai (Malayappa's corner). Description Malayappa swami is seen in the standing pose and is a replica of Dhruva bera. The two upper arms hold the sankhu and chakram while the two lower arms are in yoga poses. The right arm is in the Varada hasta pose (boon giving) and the lower left arm is in the Katyavalambita pose (palm perpendicular to the ground and resting on the hip). The idol stands about three feet tall on a platform of about 14\\" height. Along with the idol, his consorts - Sridevi and Bhudevi were also found and accepted as Swayambhu idols. Sridevi idol The idol of Sridevi is always placed on the right hand side of Sri Malayappa swami. The idol is 26\\" in height and stands on a 4\\" pedestral. The panchaloha idol is seen with the left hand in the Kataka hasta pose. In this pose, the fingers are partially closed, as if holding a lotus. The right hand hangs loosely on the side and the fingers are held in the Gajakarna pose. Bhudevi idol The idol of Bhudevi is always seen on the left hand side of Lord Malayappa swami. The idol is very similar to the idol of Sridevi to signify that Sridevi and Bhudevi represent the two equal spirits of Goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. The only difference in the idols is the swap in the hand poses. The idol of Bhudevi has her right hand in Kataka hasta pose and the left in Gajakarna pose. Worship=Order The order that represents the lord - Dhruva Bera, Bhoga Srinivasa, Malayappa swami with consorts, Ugra Srinivasa with consorts and Koluvu Srinivasa. Thus Kautaka Bera (Bhoga Srinivasa) should be consecrated directly from Dhruva Bera and the Utsava Bera (Malayappa swami) from the Kautaka Bera. The order continues downwards to the Snapana Bera (Ugra Srinivasa) and Bali Bera (Koluvu Srinivasa). Daily worship Malayappa swami is used as the utsava murti and marriage to his consorts and post- marriage rituals are performed to the idol every day. Srivari Kalyanotsavam (Lord's marriage festival) is conducted with Sridevi and Bhudevi. After the marriage ceremony, the lord and his consorts are seated on various vahanams (Vehicle) as part of the Arjitha Brahmotsavam. Dolotsavam seva has the Lord seated in the Addala mandapam (Mirror hall) and entertained with vedic hyms. This is followed by serving the Lord with perfumeries, scents and sandal paste to the vedic hyms of Purusha suktam and Sri Suktam and is followed with Abhishekam as part of the Arjitha Vasanthotsavam celebrations. Arjitha Brahmotsavam and Vasanthotsavam functions are the abridged versions of the Brahmotsavam (9 days) and Vasanthotsavam (3 days) festivals respectively. In the evening, the Lord and consorts are taken outside the temple as part of the Sahasra Deepalankarana Seva where he is entertained with vedic hyms and annamaya sankirtanas. This is followed by procession on the 4 mada streets surrounding the temple before the lord is taken back into the temple, in time for the ratripuja (night puja). Weekly sevas Visesha Puja is performed on Mondays when the 'Chaturdasa kalasa visesha puja' (14 kalasas special puja) is performed to the Lord through the utsava murti. During the Sahasra Kalabhishekam puja, abhishekam is performed to Bhoga Srinivasa, Malayappa swami and Visvaksena. Annual sevas Elephants Saluting Lord Venkateshwara at Tirumala During Teppotsavam, the utsava murti along with his consorts are worshipped in the Swami Pushkarini (holy lake adjoining the temple) when the Lord is taken to a float constructed in the lake and worshipped during Phalguna Pournami. Abhideyaka Abhishekam is performed every year in the month of Jyesta (July) to protect the utsava deities from damage during processions and other events. The festival lasts for three days with the deities adorned Vajrakavacham (armour studded with diamonds), Muthyalakavacham (armour studded with pearls) and svarnakavacham (armour of gold) for these days. During Padmavathi Parainayam celebrated in May, the wedding of Lord Srinivasa and the Goddess Padmavathi is celebrated in the Narayanagiri gardens for three days. During the three days, Malayappa swami arrives on Gaja (Elephant), Asva (Horse) and Garuda (Eagle) vehicles while Sridevi and Bhudevi arrive in separate palanquins. After the kalyanotsavam and cultural performances, the lord and consorts are taken back to the temple. Pushpa Pallaki festival is celebrated in July at the start of financial year for the lord with the utsava murtis taken in procession on a richly decorated floral palanquin. The utsava murtis are taken in procession on various vehicles during the annual Brahmotsavam celebrations.

Background A knight of the Order of Santiago, Diego Fajardo was an illustrious scion of the house of the Marqu√©s de los V√©lez and a nephew of a previous Philippine Governor, Alonso Fajardo de Entenza, who had held the position from 1618 to 1624. Fajardo Chac√≥n had been reared in the family of Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, whose captain of the guard he had been. His valor in war led to promotions, both military and political. He became governor of Perpi√±√°n (Perpignan) and of the Islas Terceras (Azores). His character was assessed by his near-contemporary, the historian Fray Casimiro D√≠az: > He was a gentleman of great abilities, which, had they not be accompanied by > an excessive severity, uncommunicativeness, and too great rigor in his > punishments, would have rendered him equal to the greatest governors, not > only of these islands but of the whole world. For he was very intelligent in > military affairs, but chaste, truthful, and modest, and so free from > anything that can touch covetousness that in that respect he rather > resembled a most observant religious than a military gentleman; for he was > never known and he never presumed to receive anything -- not only no jewel > of value, but not even a present of any food. Arrival in the Philippines Fajardo arrived as the new governor of the Philippines on the 1644 ship from New Spain (Mexico). He took office on 11 August 1644 (some sources say 16 August), and remained in the government for nine years. He was soon dominated by his secretary, Eustacio de Venegas, an old-time resident of Manila. For a time, Fajardo left the public affairs in the hands of Venegas, and himself retired to seclusion. As soon as he assumed the government, in accordance with a royal decree, he moved the pari√°n (settlement) of the Sangleys (Chinese-Filipino mestizos). He ordered that the governors' income from Sangley gambling be placed in the treasury. At the end of October, reinforcements were sent to Terrenate and other provinces. He also imprisoned his predecessor, Sebasti√°n Hurtado de Corcuera, based on a judicial inquiry (juicio de residencia) after Hurtado's term had ended. Hurtado spent five years in prison in the redoubt of Santiago, before an order was sent by the king to return him to Spain. The 1644 galleon for New Spain had to put back to the Philippines because of great storms. The ship San Diego also put back to Cavite, because the Dutch had entered the Embocadero de San Bernardino (San Bernardino Strait). Dutch threats to the colony were greatly feared, partly because of their base in Formosa. The Dutch were said to have sent 200 ships with high freeboard (and additional smaller vessels) from the Cape of Good Hope to Formosa, and were thought to be preparing an attack on Manila, to take over the entire archipelago. One of the first precautions was to send Francisco de Atienza y B√°√±ez, a soldier from Toledo, as governor of Zamboanga, where he made peace with the Moros of Mindanao under Sultan Muhammad Kudarat. The continued fighting in Mindanao had been a severe domestic drain on Spanish strength, when it was needed to repel the Dutch. Atienza also later made peace in Jolo. Domination by Manuel Eustacio de Venegas According to Casimiro D√≠az, Fajardo was an upright man, but with two serious failings that damaged the effectiveness of his administration. First, he was so devoted to justice as to be incapable of showing mercy, which caused him to be greatly feared in the colony. Secondly, he was a solitary man, and did not relish taking an active role in government. This latter characteristic was so pronounced that Manuel Eustacio de Venegas, a rich citizen of Manila well connected by marriage, gained great control over the governor. According to D√≠az, Fajardo \\"neither did nor commanded other than what his favorite desired.\\" Venegas grossly abused his power, arrogating to himself all the grandeur due to the governor alone, and enforcing his will against his enemies (religious as well as laymen) by violence, imprisonment, confiscation and exile. According to Bishop-elect of Nueva Segovia Jos√© Mill√°n de Poblete, > Already so great was the number of those thrown into prisons, dungeons, and > obscure cells, that all the places set aside by justice for the punishment > of criminals were filled; and other new and frightful places, sites, and > methods of delayed punishment were found inside the city. And when these > places were also full, it was necessary to divide the prisoners among the > provinces, villages, and presidios of these islands. These abuses continued from 1644 through 1651. In the latter year Fray Jer√≥nimo de Medrano, leader of the Augustinians in the Philippines, was able to convince Farjado that accusations of abuse by his surrogate warranted an investigation. Fajardo carried out the investigation, and on 16 September 1651 had Venegas arrested. D√≠az says, \\"[H]e questioned him under torture, in which the prisoner answered nothing -- either because of his great courage, or because he had taken some confection of opium... which has so narcotic a virtue that it renders those who drink it insensible to pain.\\" Fajardo took over the government for the last two years of his term. He was succeeded by Sabiniano Manrique de Lara in 1653. Events of 1645 The two galleons Encarnaci√≥n and Rosario from New Spain with reinforcements and much aid against the Dutch arrived in July 1645, having narrowly escaped three Dutch warships from Formosa. Don Fernando Montero de Espinosa, the new archbishop of Manila, arrived on the flagship, but he died suddenly just before making his triumphal entry into Manila. His body arrived, and entered by the same gate that his predecessor, Fray Hernando Guerrero, had used to leave for exile nine years before. The archdiocese remained without a head until the arrival of Miguel de Poblete in 1653. The evening of 30 November 1645 (the day of St. Andrew, patron of the city), an earthquake immensely devastated Manila. 150 stone buildings were destroyed, and the remainder so badly damaged that they had to be demolished. An accurate enumeration of the dead was impossible, but 450 were known to be missing. The cathedral was totally destroyed. At an elegant chapel of the Society of Jesus adorned with pictures of the twelve apostles, there was considerable damage, but only one of the portraits fell -- that of St. Andrew. Fajardo was in his apartments, and narrowly escaped being buried. He lived for several months in a field tent in the Plaza de Armas, until a suitable wooden building was completed for him. Five days later, on 5 December 1645 a second earthquake occurred, said to be of the same magnitude as the first. This time there were no fatalities, due to the fact that most of the buildings had already collapsed and the population was prepared. The city was left in such condition that one could not walk through it. The Dutch attack on Manila, 1646 In 1646 the Dutch were believed to have sent 18 warships in three squadrons to converge on Manila. News of the first of these squadrons was received on 1 February 1646. The only ships available for defense were the galleons Encarnaci√≥n and Rosario, recently arrived at Cavite from New Spain. These were well-armed, carrying 34 and 30 pieces of artillery, respectively, but they were only two ships against many. Nevertheless, it was determined to man and equip them for war. Fajardo named General Lorenzo de Orella y Ugalde commander-in-chief. Fajardo spoke to the men of the fleet on 3 March 1646 just before they weighed anchor. The first battle occurred on 15 March 1646, off Mariveles Island, near Corregidor. The two Spanish ships defeated four Dutch ships, which, however, were able to escape in the night. None of the Spanish was killed, but the Spanish claimed to have learned later that many Dutch were killed, and two of the ships were rendered useless. The Spanish galleons were then dispatched to await a relief ship from New Spain, the galleon San Luis, in the Embocadero, principal target of the Dutch. On the 24th, a squadron of seven Dutch warships blockaded the two Spanish galleons in a harbor on the island of Ticao. The blockade lasted more than a month, but was lifted when the Dutch sailed for Manila. General Lorenzo followed them with his two ships. The second battle occurred on the night of the 29-30 July, between Banton and Marinduque. The battle lasted from 7 in the evening to daybreak. The Spanish lost six men killed, and destroyed one of the Dutch ships (a fireship that was unsuccessful in its attack). The Spanish vessels pursued the Dutch, catching up with them on 31 July 1646 off the coast of Mindoro. Another terrific battle ensued, with the Dutch losing another fireship and having their flagship badly damaged. At dusk the Dutch fled towards land. On the governor's orders, the Spanish galleons returned to Cavite in August, after a six months' voyage, where needed repairs were made. Fajardo rewarded General Lorenzo with one of the best encomiendas in the islands. There still remained one Dutch squadron, waiting near Manila. The Encarnaci√≥n and Rosario were now reinforced by the newly constructed San Diego, a galleon intended for New Spain, but now prepared for war. The three galleons sailed from Cavite on 15 September 1646, accompanied by a galley and four brigantines. Another battle ensued shortly thereafter, with the Dutch again retreating. A further battle occurred on 4 October, with the same result. End of the Dutch threat Although it was not known whether the Dutch would attack in 1647, given their defeats the previous year, nevertheless Governor Fajardo ordered that all possible defensive preparations be made, fortifying the city and ordering new warships to be built. On 6 June 1647, Dutch vessels were sighted near Mariveles Island. In spite of the preparations, the Spanish had only one galleon (the San Diego) and two galleys ready to engage the enemy. The Dutch had twelve major vessels. On 12 June the armada attacked the Spanish port of Cavite. The battle lasted eight hours, and the Spanish believed they had done much damage to the enemy flagship and the other vessels. The Spanish ships were not badly damaged and casualties were low. However, nearly every roof in the Spanish settlement was damaged by cannon fire, which particularly concentrated on the cathedral. On the 19th, the armada was split, with six ships sailing for the shipyard of Mindoro and the other six remaining in Manila Bay. The Dutch next attacked Pampanga, where they captured the fortified monastery, taking prisoners and executing almost 200 Filipino defenders. The governor ordered solemn funeral rites for the dead and payments to their widows and orphans. This year was the last in which the Dutch attacked the Manila area. There was an expedition the following year that arrived in Jolo in July. The Dutch had formed an alliance with an anti- Spanish king, Salicala. The Spanish garrison on the island was small, but survived a Dutch bombardment. The Dutch finally withdrew, and the Spanish made peace with the Joloans, and then also withdrew. There was also an unsuccessful attack on Zamboanga in 1648. That year the Dutch promised the natives of Mindanao that they would return in 1649 with aid in support of a revolt against the Spanish. Several revolts did break out, the most serious being in the village of Lind√°o. There most of the Spaniards were killed, and the survivors were forced to flee in a small river boat to Butu√°n. However, Dutch aid did not materialize. The authorities from Manila issued a general pardon, and many of the Filipinos in the mountains surrendered. However, some of those were hanged and most of the rest were enslaved. On 2 October 1649 the galleon Encarnaci√≥n was wrecked at Sorsogon, en route from Acapulco.

Career Byers was a runner at The Ohio State University in the 1970s and still holds the outdoor OSU distance record in the 1500m (3.37.5). He held the mile record (4:00.10.) until Jeff See broke it on June 2, 2007. During his time at OSU, he also won the U.S. Junior 1500m title, finished second at the AAU outdoor championships, and participated in the '76 Olympic Trials. Byers temporarily retired from competitive running for several years to join the corporate world, but returned to professional running in the 1980s. One thing for which Byers was noteworthy was his hair. Unlike most middle and long distance runners, who wore their hair short, Byers chose to wear his long. His 3:50.84 mile ranks 11th fastest by a United States runner, while his 2:16.1 in the 1000 meters is the third fastest by a US runner. Oslo, 1981 Byers took a dramatic victory in a 1500m race in Oslo in 1981. The world record holder Steve Ovett was a strong favourite to win the race, and Byers was expected to act only as a pacemaker. But Ovett and the pack did not follow his pace, and Byers did not step off the track. He was leading by almost ten seconds going into the final lap. Ovett ran the last lap almost nine seconds quicker than Byers but finished second by 0.53s. Personal life He had two sons. One of his sons, Thomas Joseph Byers III (1985‚Äì2005), was a distance runner for Coffman High School in Dublin, Ohio (where he graduated in the same class as fellow student-athlete Brady Quinn), and went on to run at the University of Kentucky and the University of Mississippi.

The cause appears to be instability of the scanning motor for the AVHRR sensor. According to an official release from NOAA, on July 23rd at 0400 Zulu time, the current draw of that motor spiked, as did the motor temperature. Additionally, the sensor stopped producing data. NOAA says this is consistent with a motor stall, and could be permanent. On July 25th 2019, the AVHRR motor spontaneously recovered. The cause of the failure is still under investigation. On July 30th, 2019 the AVHRR motor suffered another failure consistent with motor stall. As per the previous statement by NOAA, recovery is unlikely.

The ride ceased operation on February 3, 2013 to make way for El Loco which opened in February 2014.  Ride layout  Riders boarded on the second level of the park. Each boat held up to 15 passengers in three rows of five secured by a single-position lap bar that spanned each row. Once dispatched, conveyor belts moved the boat into the water for The boat slowed as it entered a \\"lake\\" area and made a right turn. The water was at its deepest point at this point, approximately 12 feet, as this was the main reservoir for the ride. Another set of conveyor belts lifted the boat out of the water, into a tunnel and onto the one and only chain lift for the ride. As riders ascended the dimly lit cavern, pin points of light that look like eyes flicker. During the annual Halloween event, Fright Dome, special music and extra decoration filled the lift tunnel. At the top, there was a slight drop-off the chain as the boat heads toward the drop. An animatronic \\"falling rock\\" teetered close to the boat. This area was once filled with an extremely dense layer of mist, to obscure riders' vision of what lies ahead. At this point, the Canyon Blaster was mere feet above the heads of Rim Runner passengers. Another set of conveyor belts positioned the boat for its final plunge, an 80-foot camelback drop to a wet conclusion. A final right-hand turn placed the boat at the final set of conveyor belts that lifted the boat out of the water and back into the station.  Changes  When the attraction first opened riders were soaked during the final plunge and splashdown. The large wave created would hit the bridge that spans the runout, getting onlookers wet as well. However, due to complaints an acrylic glass wall was soon added to the bridge to keep the upper level dry. This area is now home to numerous arcade-style video games. In addition to the wet spectators, passengers began to complain that the ride was simply too wet for the climate-controlled theme park. During the first few years of operations several remedies were tried by making adjustments to the boats themselves. At one point they even kept one boat in the original configuration calling it the \\"soak boat\\" and the modified one the \\"sprinkle boat\\". Eventually all the boats were modified to minimize the amount of water hitting the riders. Over the years the boats have had other changes as well. Complaints about injuries sustained when the boat impacted the runout at the bottom of the drop were common during the first few years. First management put up a higher height requirement for the front row before eventually blocking off the front row entirely. Next, the back row was blocked off presumably to \\"balance\\" the boat (although not until some time later). The result is now a boat designed for 20 to 25 passengers fitting a maximum of 12. Rim Runner officially closed to the public on Sunday, February 3, 2013 to make room for El Loco. The boat storage area, lift hill & trough leading to the drop still remain standing.

He founded the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary in 1849 Life Gailhac was born on 13 November 1802 in B√©ziers, France. He entered the major seminary in Montpellier in 1821 and was ordained by Bishop Nicolas Fournier for the Diocese of Montpellier on 23 September 1826.\\"Founder Father Jean Gailhac\\", Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, California and Mexico As a young priest he taught philosophy and helped in the religious formation of the students at the seminary. On 12 September 1828, Father Jean Gailhac was assigned as chaplain to the civil and military hospital of the city of B√©ziers where he met many women who suffered from illnesses which were the result of prostitution. These women were mostly uneducated and had neither family nor social support. With the help of friends, he founded the Good Shepherd, a shelter for these women. Over the course of the years, Father Gailhac spoke with his friends Eugene Cure and his wife Appollonie Cure. The Cures were devoted to the works that Father Gailhac had undertaken. In 1848 after the death of Eugene Cure, Appollonie Cure decided to devote her funds and her life to work for the education and help of these women and their children. In 1849, Father Gailhac called together Appollonie Cure and five other women: Eulalie Vidal, Rosalie Gibbal, Rose Jeantet, C√©cile Cambon, and Marie Roques to form the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary. Father Gailhac acted as their spiritual director and formator for these women who began their work in the Good Shepherd Refuge for women and an orphanage. Appollonie Cure, now Mother Saint Jean, was named the general superior of the new community. As the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary grew and expanded to other countries and continents, Father Gailhac kept in contact with them through numerous letters, visits and spiritual treatises until his death on 25 January 1890. Father Jean Gailhac was declared Venerable by the Roman Catholic Church in 1972. ReferencesBibliography * Gailhac, Vener√°vel P. Jean. Cartas, Vol. I and II. * Gailhac, R. P. The Religious Life.

History=Early Years WESC-FM signed on the air in March 1948 as the FM sister station to WESC 660, simulcasting its country music format. In the late 1960s, WESC-FM switched to beautiful music while WESC 660 remained a country outlet. WESC-AM-FM returned to a country music simulcast in the 1980s, although there were times the AM station aired separate programming, leaning toward classic country. WESC-AM-FM were acquired in 1998 by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-399 In 2014, Clear Channel changed its name to iHeartMedia. In 2000, the simulcast was split apart. WESC-FM retained its country format, while WESC 660 was leased to the Radio Training Network, which programmed a Christian talk and teaching format in conjunction with 89.3 WLFJ- FM. The local marketing agreement (LMA) ended in August 2019, after which the two stations returned to their prior simulcast. Move Toward Classic Country In 2001, WESC-FM adjusted its format to classic-leaning country, in a move to separate itself from co-owned 100.5 WSSL-FM, which has a more youthful country sound. Although there is overlap with WSSL-FM, WESC distinguishes itself by playing more 'genuine/raw' current selections along with hits from the early 1990s and before, sometimes going back to the 1970s. It is also the area's network affiliate for NASCAR, often calling itself \\"Your Racin' Station.\\" WESC-FM has a half-century heritage as a country music station. In the 1980s and 90s, it was sometimes #1 in the Greenville- Spartenburg Arbitron ratings. Country Heartlines WESC-FM was the home station for the syndicated radio show \\"Country Heartlines,\\" hosted by John Crenshaw. A nationalized version of Crenshaw‚Äôs Cryin‚Äô Lovin‚Äô Laugin‚Äô or Leavin‚Äô show, the program was popular in the 1990s and at one time was carried on over 80 FM stations across the country. The show consisted of a format of country songs played in between callers calling in with a mix of relationship and love related problems, of which Crenshaw and other listeners would give advice and a lending ear. The syndicated show fully ended in 2011. Transmitter WESC-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the highest power permitted for most FM stations.FCC.gov/WESC-FM The tower has a height above average terrain (HAAT) of 610 meters (2001 ft). The transmitter is located near Caesars Head State Park in northern Greenville County, near the North Carolina state line. WESC-FM can be heard across most of Northwestern or Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina, as well as part of Northeastern Georgia and a small portion of Eastern Tennessee. The signal comes close to other nearby radio markets, including Charlotte, Atlanta, Columbia, Knoxville and the Tri-Cities.

The quality of his autopsies, and the resulting criminal charges and convictions of thirteen people, have been called into question and a full public inquiry was ordered. The inquiry found there to be fundamental errors made on the part of Smith and many of the cases in which he had testified are now being re-examined and appealed.Chapman, John. \\"Death in the Family\\" Doubleday Canada. 2017. In 2008, the chief forensic pathologist for Ontario began a public inquiry into 220 cases of shaken baby syndrome to determine if anyone was wrongfully convicted in the babies' deaths. Smith proclaimed that he had \\"a thing against people who hurt children\\", while critics said that \\"he was on a crusade and acted more like a prosecutor\\" than a pathologist. Early life and career Smith was born in a Toronto Salvation Army Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, and put up for adoption three months later. He spent years looking for his biological mother and called her on her 65th birthday though she refused to take his call. His adoptive father was in the Canadian Armed Forces and lived in numerous places in Canada and Germany. Smith attended high school in Ottawa. Smith graduated from the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada in 1975. He completed his training in Pathology at the University of Toronto and was certified as an anatomical pathologist in 1980. He joined the Hospital for Sick Children in 1981 as one of the rotating team of pathologists, and shortly was doing autopsies on children who had met sudden or suspicious deaths. In 1992, the Ontario Coroner's Office created a pediatric forensic pathology unit at Hospital for Sick Children and Smith was appointed director. He had become almost solely responsible for investigating suspicious child deaths in Ontario. In this period he conducted hundreds of autopsies and testified in court multiple times. He conducted training sessions for lawyers on how to examine and cross-examine expert witnesses, and training for law-enforcement and medical staff on detecting child abuse. While at Sick Children's Hospital, Smith lived on a farm in Newmarket. His marriage collapsed around the time that his pathology work at Sick Children's received heavy scrutiny. Smith was briefly relocated to Saskatoon but currently lives in Ontario. Notable cases=Maureen Laidley Maureen Laidley was charged with killing Tyrell Salmon, the three-year-old son of her boyfriend. Laidley said the boy had jumped off the couch, slipped and struck his head on a marble coffee table, but was arrested after Smith informed them that such injuries could not result in death. The charge was abruptly stayed when outside experts testified that the injuries were fully consistent with Laidley's account. William Mullins- Johnson William Mullins-Johnson of Sault Ste. Marie was found guilty of the first-degree murder of his niece, Valin Johnson, after a two and half week trial in September 1994. He was convicted after a jury trial in which Smith's evidence played a major role in determining the time of death, the cause of death and whether the girl had been sexually assaulted. Mullins-Johnson had babysat Valin, 4, and her 3-year-old brother on the evening of June 26, 1993. When the girl's mother returned home, she did not check on her daughter. At 7 a.m. the next day she found Valin dead in bed. A local pathologist performed an autopsy on Valin. Then \\"consultation reports\\" were sought from Smith and four other specialists, based on tissue samples and other evidence from the autopsy. Smith was the only consultant to conclude Valin was sexually assaulted at the time of death. That contradicted the defence's point that Valin, who had a history of vomiting in bed, might have died of natural causes. The jury convicted, which the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld in 1996. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed a further appeal in 1998. Attempts were made to clear his name based on available DNA technology, but the tissue could not be located by Smith, who was given the evidence by the pathologist who did the autopsy, until 2005, 11 years after the trial, when the missing tissue samples turned up in Smith's office. William Mullins-Johnson was released on bail in 2005, pending review of his case. On July 16, 2007, a report by three expert pathologists (a report written unbeknownst to the lawyers working on his behalf) determined there was no evidence that the girl was sexually assaulted, and the Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant, said that William Mullins-Johnson's conviction \\"cannot stand\\" and that he should be acquitted by the appeals court. On October 15, 2007 he was acquitted by the Ontario Court of Appeal. In 2010, five years after he filed a $13 million lawsuit, he received $4.25 million in a compensation settlement from the government of Ontario. Sherry Sherret On the morning of January 23, 1996, Sherry Sherret found her four-month-old son Joshua lying in his bed not breathing. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. Three and a half years later she was given the option to accept a plea of infanticide. She was convicted of infanticide without offering a defence (but offering no admission of guilt) in a plea (the delay was primarily attributable to Smith's unavailability to testify). Sherret was jailed on the basis of Smith's opinion that her four-month-old son Joshua had a skull fracture, and that he had been smothered. She was released on bail in 1996 and remained on bail until the conviction. Sherret's sentence was 1 year in jail and 2 years probation. Sherret served eight months in total, and was entered into the child abuse registry. Her older child was removed by Children's Aid, and in order to get him out of foster care, she agreed to give him up for adoption and have no physical contact with him until he was 18. Later exhumation of the child and examination of the skull have shown that there was no skull fracture. It is thought Dr. Smith confused the normal gap between the baby's skull plates for an injury. On December 7, 2009, the Ontario Court of Appeal exonerated Sherret, stating that it was \\"profoundly regrettable that due to flaws in pathological evidence\\" she was wrongfully convicted. Brenda Waudby Brenda Waudby of Peterborough was charged with beating her 2-year-old daughter Jenna to death on January 22, 1997, on the basis of Smith's professional opinion as to what time the injuries were inflicted. Anthony Kporwodu and Angela Veno Anthony Kporwodu and Angela Veno were charged in 1997 with murdering their infant daughter. Smith took more than seven months to prepare his initial autopsy report. The charges were ultimately thrown out by a judge for violating the constitutional right to a timely trial. Louise Reynolds Louise Reynolds was a 28-year-old single mother living in Kingston, Ontario, charged with second degree murder for having killed her seven-year-old daughter Sharon in 1997 by stabbing her more than 80 times with a pair of scissors. Much of the case rested on Dr. Smith's 10-page autopsy report. In January 2001 the Crown abruptly dropped the charges, after numerous experts, including Crown witnesses, disagreed with Smith and agreed that a powerful dog had mauled the girl (there was a pit bull present in the house at the time). By then, Reynolds had spent 22 months in custody. Louise Reynolds sued in March 2007. Despite the rules related to Crown immunity, the Court of Appeal ruled, in a ground-breaking decision, that the suit against Smith and other experts could go ahead: while court testimony is protected, faulty work is not. Dinesh Kumar Dinesh Kumar was a 26-year-old Punjabi immigrant to Canada who was charged with second degree murder in the 1992 death of his infant son. He pled guilty to criminal negligence causing death and was sentenced to ninety days in jail. He was acquitted by the Ontario Court of Appeal on January 20, 2011. His case was part of the review ordered of Dr. Smith's cases following the Goudge Inquiry. Tammy Marquardt Tammy Marquardt was convicted in Ontario in 1995 of killing her two-year-old son, who had epilepsy. Her conviction rested in large part upon testimony from Smith, who concluded the boy had been strangled or smothered. She was sentenced to life in prison, and her two other children were taken from her and put up for adoption. Marquardt's conviction was set aside on 10 February 2011 by the Ontario Court of Appeal. Prosecutors agreed her trial had been faulty because of Smith's unreliable testimony, but they would not say whether a retrial would be sought or not.\\"Ont. mother's murder conviction quashed\\", CBC News, 10 February 2011.\\"15 years later, court overturns child murder conviction\\", The Toronto Star, 10 February 2011. On June 6, murder charges were withdrawn.\\"Murder charge withdrawn for mom in disgraced pathologist case\\", The National Post, 6 June 2011.  Maria Shepherd  Maria Shepherd pled guilty in 1992 to the 1991 death of her stepdaughter, Kasandra Shepherd. She was sentenced to two years less a day for manslaughter. In May 2009, the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed her to appeal her initial conviction. In February 2016, the Crown agreed her guilty plea and conviction should be struck and an acquittal should be entered in its place. Outcome In 2002, Smith was reprimanded with a caution by the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons for his work on three suspicious-death cases, and in 2003 he was removed from performing autopsies. In July 2005, Smith resigned from Sick Children's Hospital to take up a position at Saskatoon City Hospital in Saskatchewan. He failed to mention to his new employers that he was under investigation for misconduct in Ontario. In December 2005 he was dismissed. He successfully appealed, but was not reinstated because he was not licensed to practise in Saskatchewan. He pled guilty to a charge of unprofessional conduct for his failure to disclose he was under investigation by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan. In June 2005, the Chief Coroner of Ontario ordered a review of 44 autopsies carried out by Smith. Thirteen of these cases had resulted in criminal charges and convictions. The report was released in April 2007, indicating that there were substantial problems with 20 of the autopsies. In response to this report, Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant announced that there would be a full public inquiry into the state of pediatric forensic pathology in Ontario. The Goudge Inquiry began hearing evidence on November 12, 2007. Justice Goudge's report, released on October 1, 2008 concluded that there were serious problems with the way suspicious deaths involving children are handled in Ontario. He pointed to the problems that had been found with the 20 or so problematic cases that Charles Smith had handled as evidence of serious problems in the Ontario system. On February 1, 2011, Smith was stripped of his licence during a hearing by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario examining \\"disgraceful conduct\\".

A cadastral community records property ownership in a cadastre, which is a register describing property ownership by boundary lines of the real estate. The common etymology in the Central European successor states of the Habsburg Monarchy comes from (KG), plural: Katastralgemeinden, translated as or comune catastale, , , and (\\"cadastral territories\\"). History Cadastral map of Roznberk in present-day Brno-Chrlice In 1764, at the behest of Empress Maria Theresa, a complete survey of the Habsburg lands was begun, initiated by the general staff of the Imperial and Royal Army under Field Marshal Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, who had become aware of the lack of reliable maps in the Seven Years' War. Maria Theresa's son Emperor Joseph II ordered the implication of a complete urbarium for property tax purposes in 1785. The present-day cadastre was completed after the Napoleonic Wars from 1817 onwards under Emperor Francis I of Austria (Franziszeischer Kataster). Since then, the Austrian (i.e. Cisleithanian) crown lands were subdivided in Katastralgemeinden; surveying in the Hungarian (Transleithanian) lands started in 1850. Municipalities as administrative subdivisions with certain rights of self-governance were not established until after the 1848 revolutions. Most of the nowadays Katastralgemeinden once had been independent communes and were incorporated on the occasion of a municipal territory reforms. They can be further divided into smaller villages and localities (Ortschaften). there are 7,847 Katastralgemeinden in Austria. For land registration, the unit identifier used in a Katastralgemeinde is \\"KG-Nr\\" (KG-Nummer, or number). The Dutch system of kadastrale gemeenten was set up around 1830. When municipalities are merged, often the cadastral communes remain as they were, so one civil municipality can consist of more than one cadastral commune; but again, a cadastral commune can never be part of more than one civil municipality.

It is located east of Beirut, overlooking the capital and the Mediterranean. Overview As most of the villages, Brummana has an Aramaic name which most probably means \\"house of Rammana, the God of Air, Storm and Thunder\\". In the location where Brummana was built it was thought that the god Rammanu lived there, which gave the name \\"House of Rammanu\\", and it is known that the letter B at the beginning of the name of villages refers to \\"beit\\" in Syriac, meaning \\"house\\".

Summer temperature rarely exceeds 30 ¬∞C, with a lower limit of around 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F). Its relative humidity in summer runs at 68%. Winter is wet and mild with temperatures ranging between 5 ¬∞C and 18 ¬∞C, with the occasional snowfall. Demographics Brummana is home to a number of religious groups, with Christians, mostly Greek Orthodox making up 40%, Maronite Catholic making up 40% of the population, and Roman Catholic (Latin) making up 10% of the population, with Druze making a substantial minority of 10%.Community The town is also the summer home of tourists from the Middle East. Education Brummana High School was founded by the Quaker Theophilus Waldmeier in 1873. The school influenced the inhabitants of Brummana and gave the town some English traditions, such as five o‚Äôclock tea.Brummana Cultural Tradition Theophilus Waldmeier was born in 1832 in Basle, Switzerland. He attended the missionary college of St Crischona, near Basle, and went to Abyssinia as a missionary in 1858. After being among a motley assortment of Europeans held prisoner by the mad Ethiopian King Theodore and rescued in the nick of time by General Napier and his British troops at the siege of Magdala, he left in 1868 and went to Syria, settling at Beirut in connection with the British Syrian Mission founded in 1860. He re-embarked on a second career of good works. Among the fruits of that career are two of Lebanon's most vigorous institutions - Brummana High School, and Asfuriya Mental Hospital, founded in 1894. Waldmeier moved his half-Ethiopian wife and his eight children by horseback up the steep mountain path from Beirut to Brummana where he started the Friends' Syrian Mission in 1873. In 1874, he traveled to Europe to seek financial backing from the Society of Friends. After listening to his impassioned plea for aid, some British and American Quakers formed a committee which, from that time until today, has provided support for the Brummana School. Brummana Soup Kitchen 19th-century drawing of Brummana In the summer of 1915, as the First World War gathered pace, the British imposed an economic blockage against the Ottoman territories along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean sea.Tamari, Salim (2011) Year of the locust: a soldier's diary and the erasure of Palestine's Ottoman past. University of California Press. . p.51 The Young Turk government introduced military rule across its Arab territories and began stockpiling food for their armies. This coincided with the 1915 Ottoman Syria locust infestation across food-producing areas. In the resulting famine, which lasted two years, it is estimated that 100,000 of Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate's 450,000 inhabitants died.Cobban, Helena (1985) The making of modern Lebanon - (The making of the Middle East). Hutchinson and Co. . p.55Antonius, George (1938) The Arab Awakening. The Story of the Arab National Movement. Hamish Hamilton. (1945 edition). p.203 The Turkish military governor, Djemal Pasha, was a frequent resident of Brummana. Another resident was Arthur Dray, who was one of the founders of the School of Dentistry at the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut. The two men were on good terms following Dray's treatment of a bullet wound to Djemal's jawCortas, Wadad Makdisi (2009) A world I loved: the story of an Arab woman. Nation Books. . p.9 and Dray received permission to open a small soup kitchen. The kitchen started in the summer of 1916. It employed one cook and fed 15 people. At the same time Mariam Cortas (n√©e Asswad) and her two sisters Labibi (Mrs Amin Rizk) and Selma (Mrs Selim Rizk) were managing funds to help nursing mothers and were distributing milk and food. Mrs Cortas took over the running of the kitchen, increasing the number of daily meals to 50 in the first week and 100 in the second. The kitchen was then moved into an empty hotel that had been used by the Turkish army. By the end of 1916 the Brummana Soup Kitchen was feeding at least 1500 people a day. The project received military approval on the understanding that no males between the age of 12 and 60 were being fed. Funding came from the American Mission and a number of wealthy Syrians in Beirut. At its busiest the kitchen employed between 200 and 300 people. A visitor in October 1917 reported 1,200 people being fed, of whom 1080 were children. Despite the kitchen's success people were turned away, and the body of a woman and her child were found a few hundred yards away. Other then-major kitchens in the country were at Souk El Gharb, 'Abay, Sidon and Tripoli. After the war their work was taken over by the Syria and Palestine Relief Fund. As things returned to normal it was found that there were over 400 orphans being cared for in Brummana.Turtle, H.J. (1975) Quaker Service in the Middle East with a history of Brummana High School. 1876-1975. Friends Service Council. pp.151-161. Etymology The name of the town, Brummana, stems from the Aramaic language. The name most probably means \\"House of Rammanu\\", which was an Akkadian name meaning \\"Thunder\\" used for the weather god more commonly known as Hadad in ancient Canaanite religion. (The Aramaic version of this name is RaÀÅmƒÅ, ). During classical antiquity, it was believed that Hadad lived in the area that is now Brummana, and thus the area became known as \\"the House of Rammanu\\", later corrupted to Brummana. Tourism Brummana is one of Lebanon's main summer resorts due to its relatively cool climate. Sitting on top of a pine-forested hill, the town has views over Beirut, the Mediterranean coast, and the surrounding mountainous area. It attracts Lebanese visitors for day and weekend trips. Brummana also attracts thousands of Arab tourists from the Persian Gulf every summer, eager to escape from the hot and arid climate of the Persian Gulf. The population of Brummana rises to about 60,000 during the summer months, from a low of about 15,000 in winter, when the weather is cold and sometimes snowy.Brummana High School In July 2018, Mayor Pierre Achkar, introduced a controversial plan to boost tourism by making local police women wear short shorts and red berets.

By the start of World War I, the shipyard had built a total of 70 vessels, mainly pontoons, barges and lighters. During the war, the company built a number of auxiliary ships for the Kaiserliche Marine and started building minesweepers. They also launched its first two cargo steamboats in 1917 for German owners. Germany‚Äôs defeat in World War I temporarily halted the country‚Äôs export shipbuilding industry, but the company switched production to deep-sea fishing steamers and later, again, cargo steamers. In 1930 the company scored a major coup with contracts for a series of three-mast schooner yachts. During the period from 1935 to 1939, the shipyard supplied the German Ministry of Finance with three customs cruisers, the Nettelbeck, the York, and the Freiherr von Stein. Shortly before and during World War II, the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe placed orders with Nobiskrug for a range of auxiliary ships including several ocean-going tugs and tankers. During the immediate post-war years, the company concentrated on ship conversions and repairs. From 1945 to 1955 advanced in building larger vessels. In 1963 the shipyard delivered the then highly sophisticated navy training ship Deutschland. One year later, Nobiskrug built its first ferry, the Prins Bertil. Four more ferries were built up until 1968. This period also saw the completion of a number of conventional freighters and asphalt tankers as well as heavy goods and RoRo vessels. The early 1980s saw the construction of the research vessel Polarstern, and the diving support vessels Seabex One and Seaway Condor. In the mid-1980s the fortunes of the shipyard took a turn for the worse, leading ultimately to the verge of financial collapse in 1986. Under these difficult circumstances, the yard lengthened the ocean cruise liner MS Berlin operated by Peter Deilmann Cruises. This ship is known to German TV viewers as cruise line in the German version of the Love Boat. The successful completion of this project was a sign of better things to come. Nobiskrug was acquired in 1987 by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft and the shipyard was modernized into a compact shipyard, its maritime division specialising exclusively in repairs and conversions. Staffing levels were reduced dramatically, from more than 1,200 at the start of the 1980s to approximately 400. In 1997 the shipyard supplied the forward half of the passenger ship MS Deutschland and then began work on its first superyacht, the 303-foot (92m) mega-yacht Tatoosh, which it completed in the summer of 2000. Today Nobiskrug‚Äôs focus is on engineering, construction, and refit of custom- built superyachts. In the past decade Nobiskrug has delivered some of the award-winning superyachts including Sycara V, Triple Seven, Sapphire, Mogambo, Dytan (project 783), Odessa II. Sailing Yacht A In 2017 Nobiskrug launched the sail-assisted motoryacht Sailing Yacht A, the largest private sailing yacht ever built. Measuring almost 143 m and a gross tonnage of about 12.600, Sailing Yacht A became one of the most impressive PYC superyachts in the world in terms of design and technology. Nobiskrug's latest delivery in 2020 is its first hybrid superyacht, 80-meter Artefact. Artefact's many environmentally- friendly features include diesel-electric variable-speed Azipod-propulsion, dynamic-positioning system, wastewater recycling system for re-use as technical water, batteries and solar panels. At 2.999 GT, Artefact is the biggest-volume 80-meter superyacht in the world. Currently there are several yacht projects under construction like the 77m Black Shark or the 62m long superyacht with the Espen Oeino design. This year the Rendsburg shipyard Nobiskrug is celebrating 115 years of shipbuilding since its foundation in 1905.

The march began at Twin Lakes, Indiana (Myers Lake and Cook Lake, near Plymouth, Indiana) on September 4, 1838, and ended on November 4, 1838, along the western bank of the Osage River, near present-day Osawatomie, Kansas. During the journey of approximately over 61 days, more than 40 persons died, most of them children. It marked the single largest Indian removal in Indiana history. Although the Potawatomi had ceded their lands in Indiana to the federal government under a series of treaties made between 1818 and 1837, Chief Menominee and his Yellow River band at Twin Lakes refused to leave, even after the August 5, 1838, treaty deadline for departure had passed. Indiana governor David Wallace authorized General John Tipton to mobilize a local militia of one hundred volunteers to forcibly remove the Potawatomi from the state. On August 30, 1838, Tipton and his men surprised the Potawatomi at Twin Lakes, where they surrounded the village and gathered the remaining Potawatomi together for their removal to Kansas. Father Benjamin Marie Petit, a Catholic missionary at Twin Lakes, joined his parishioners on their difficult journey from Indiana, across Illinois and Missouri, into Kansas. There the Potawatomi were placed under the supervision of the local Indian agent (Jesuit) father Christian Hoecken at Saint Mary's Sugar Creek Mission, the true end point of the march. Historian Jacob Piatt Dunn is credited for naming the Potawatomis' forced march \\"The Trail of Death\\" in his book, True Indian Stories (1909). The Trail of Death was declared a Regional Historic Trail in 1994 by the state legislatures of Indiana, Illinois, and Kansas; Missouri passed similar legislation in 1996. , there were 80 Trail of Death markers along the route: they were located at the campsites set up every 15 to 20 miles (a day's journey by walking), in all four states. Historic highway signs have been placed along the way in Indiana in Marshall, Fulton, Cass, Carroll, Tippecanoe and Warren counties, signaling each turn. Many signs have been erected in Illinois and Missouri. Kansas has completed placing highway signs in the three counties crossed by the Trail of Death. Background The Potawatomi are an Algonquian-speaking people. They moved south from northern Wisconsin and Michigan and historically occupied land from the southern tip of Lake Michigan to Lake Erie, an area encompassing northern Illinois, north central Indiana, and a strip across southern Michigan. Although the land in what became known as Indiana was long occupied by the Miami, the Potawatomi were also recognized as traditional owners under the Northwest Ordinance (1787) and in subsequent treaties. They had become the second-largest Native American tribal group in Indiana. During the War of 1812 the tribe allied with the British in the hopes of expelling American colonists encroaching on their lands. Following that period, the Potawatomi lived in relative peace with their white neighbors. In 1817, a year after Indiana became a state, an estimated 2000 Potawatomi settled along the rivers and lakes north of the Wabash River and south of Lake Michigan. Around the same time, the state and federal government became eager to open the northern parts of Indiana to settlement and development by European Americans.Glenn and Rafert, p. 51. Under treaties between the US government and the Potawatomi in 1818, 1821, 1826, and 1828, the native people ceded large portions of their lands in Indiana to the federal government in exchange for annuities in cash and goods, reservation lands within the state, and other provisions. Some tribal members also received individual grants of northern Indiana land.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 17. The passage of the Indian Removal Act (1830) enabled the federal government to offer reservation land in the West in exchange for the purchase of tribal lands east of the Mississippi River. The government's intent during Indian Removal of the 1830s was to extinguish the land claims of Indian nations in the East, and to remove them from the populated eastern states to the remote and relatively unpopulated lands west of the Mississippi River. Other Indian tribes already controlled large territories there. The Act specifically targeted the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. It was also used to arrange removal of other tribes living east of the Mississippi, including several in the former Northwest Territory, south of the Great Lakes. In three treaties signed in October 1832, at the Tippecanoe River north of Rochester, Indiana, the Potawatomi ceded to the federal government most of their remaining lands in northwestern and north central Indiana in exchange for annuities, small reservation lands in Indiana, and scattered allotments to individuals. They also received the federal government's agreement to provide goods to support the Potawatomi migration efforts, should they decide to relocate. These treaties reduced Potawatomi reservations in Indiana, which included land along the Yellow River. Under the terms of a treaty made on October 26, 1832, the federal government established Potawatomi reservation lands within the boundaries of their previously ceded lands in Indiana and Illinois in exchange for annuities, cash and goods, and payment of tribal debts, among other provisions. This treaty provided the bands under Potawatomi chiefs Menominee, Peepinohwaw, Notawkah, and Muckkahtahmoway, with a joint grant of 22 sections (14,080 acres) of reservation land. Chief Menominee's signature was recorded with an \\"x\\" on the treaty of 1832. He and his Yellow River band at Twin Lakes, Indiana, southwest of present-day Plymouth, would be forced to remove from these reservation lands on the \\"Trail of Death\\" to Kansas in 1838.McDonald, p. 13. Increased pressure from federal government negotiators, especially Colonel Abel C. Pepper, succeeded in getting the Potawatomi to sign more treaties that ceded their lands and obtained their agreement to move to reservations in the West. In treaties negotiated from December 4, 1834 to February 11, 1837, the Potawatomi ceded the remaining reservation lands in Indiana to the federal government. In 1836 alone the Potawatomi signed nine treaties, including the Treaty of Yellow River in Marshall County, Indiana; five treaties on the Tippecanoe River north of Rochester, Indiana; two treaties in Logansport, Indiana; and one treaty at Turkey Creek in Kosciusko County, Indiana. These agreement were called the Whiskey Treaties because whiskey was given to get the Indians to sign. Under the terms of these treaties the Potawatomi agreed to sell their Indiana land to the federal government and move to reservation lands in the West within two years. One treaty that directly led to the forced removal of the Potawatomi from Twin Lakes was made at Yellow River on August 5, 1836. Under its terms, the Potawatomi ceded the Menominee Reserve, established under an 1832 treaty, to the federal government and agreed to remove west of the Mississippi River within two years. In exchange, the Potawatomi would receive $14,080 for the sale of their 14,080 acres of Indiana reservation lands, after payment of tribal debts were deducted from the proceeds.McDonald, p. 14. Chief Menominee and seventeen of the Yellow River band refused to take part in the negotiations and did not recognize the treaty's authority over their land. In a petition dated November 4, 1837, Chief Menominee and other Potawatomi submitted a formal protest to General John Tipton. The chiefs claimed that their signatures on the August 5, 1836, treaty had been forged (Menominee's had been omitted) and the names of other individuals who did not represent the tribe had been added. There is no record of a reply to their petition.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" pp. 34-35. They sent additional petitions to President Martin Van Buren and Secretary of War Lewis Cass in 1836 and 1837, but the federal government refused to change its position.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" pp. 25-26. By 1837 some of the Potawatomi bands had peacefully removed to their new lands in Kansas. By August 5, 1838, the deadline for removal from Indiana, most of the Potawatomi had already left, but Chief Menominee and his band at Twin Lakes refused to move. The following day, August 6, 1838, Col. Pepper called a council at Menominee's village at Twin Lakes, where he explained that the Potawatomi had ceded land in Indiana under the treaty, and they had to remove.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" p. 36. Chief Menominee responded through an interpreter: > My brother, the President is just, but he listens to the word of young > chiefs who have lied; and when he knows the truth, he will leave me to my > own. I have not sold my lands. I will not sell them. I have not signed any > treaty, and will not sign any. I am not going to leave my lands, and I do > not want to hear anything more about it. After the council meeting, tensions increased between the Potawatomi and the white settlers who wanted to occupy the reservation lands. Fear of violence caused some settlers to petition Indiana governor David Wallace for protection. Wallace authorized General John Tipton to mobilize a militia of one hundred volunteers to forcibly remove the Potawatomi from their Indiana reservation lands.McDonald, p. 16.Funk, 46 Reverend Louis Deseille, a Catholic missionary at Twin Lakes in the 1830s, denounced the Yellow River treaty (1836) as a fraud and argued, \\"this band of Indians believe that they have not sold their reservation and that it will remain theirs as long as they live and their children.\\" In response to his support of the Potawatomi's resistance efforts, Col. Pepper ordered Father Deseille to leave the mission at Twin Lakes, or risk arrest for interfering in Indian affairs. Father Deseille went to South Bend, Indiana, although not without protest, and intended to return to Twin Lakes, but died at South Bend on September 26, 1837.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" p. 35. Father Deseille's replacement, Reverend Benjamin Marie Petit, arrived at Twin Lakes in November 1837. Within a few months Father Petit had resigned himself to the Potawatomi's removal from Twin Lakes. Father Petit received permission to join his parishioners on the forced march to Kansas in 1838.McDonald, p. 36. Removal On August 30, 1838, General Tipton and his volunteer militia surprised the Potawatomi village at Twin Lakes. When Makkahtahmoway, Chief Black Wolf's elderly mother, heard the soldiers firing their rifles she was so badly frightened that she hid in the nearby woods for six days. Unable to walk with a wounded foot, she was found by another Indian, who was looking for his horse, and brought to South Bend.\\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit\\" by Irving McKee, the Indiana Historical Society, v. 14 (1941), pp. 97‚Äì101Dunn, p. 242-43. Upon his arrival Tipton allegedly called for a meeting at the village chapel, where he detained the Potawatomi chiefs as prisoners. Although Father Petit was in South Bend at the time of the militia's arrival, he later protested that the Potawatomi had been taken by surprise under \\"the ruse of calling a council.\\"Dunn, p. 242. Tipton reported that several of the Potawatomi had already gathered near the chapel when he arrived, but acknowledged that the Potawatomi were not allowed to leave \\"until matters were amicably settled\\" and they had agreed to give up their Indiana land.McDonald, pp. 21-22. Between Thursday, August 30, and Monday, September 3, 1838, the day before their departure, Tipton and his militia surrounded Menominee's village at Twin Lakes, gathered the remaining Potawatomi together, and made preparations for their removal to Kansas.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" pp. 29 and 36. The names of the Potawatomi heads of families and other individuals, which numbered 859 in all, were recorded on tribal registration rolls.McDonald, p. 21. In addition, the soldiers burned the crops and destroyed the Potawatomi village, which consisted of approximately 100 structures, to discourage them from trying to return.Dunn, p. 244. Father Petit closed the mission church at Menominee's village, explaining in a letter to his family dated September 14, 1838, \\"It is sad, I assure you, for a missionary to see a young and vigorous work expire in his arms.\\"McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 90. The journey from Twin Lakes, Indiana, to Osawatomie, Kansas, began on September 4, 1838. It covered about over 61 days, often under hot, dry, and dusty conditions. The caravan of 859 Potawatomi also included 286 horses, 26 wagons, and an armed escort of one hundred soldiers. During the journey to Kansas, 42 people died, 28 of them children.Funk, pp. 45-46. Historian Jacob Piatt Dunn is credited for naming the Potawatomi's forced march \\"The Trail of Death\\" in his book, True Indian Stories (1909). It was the single largest Indian removal in the state. Journals, letters, and newspaper accounts of the journey provide details of the route, weather, and living conditions. Eyewitness accounts from those who accompanied the Potawatomi on the march, including as John Tipton, Father Petit, and Judge William Polke (although Polke's journal was written by his agent, Jesse C. Douglass), provide day-to-day descriptions of their experiences. Tipton led the militia as the group's military escort. Judge Polke, from Rochester, Indiana, served as the federal agent for the group and conducted the caravan to Kansas. Father Petit led religious services and administered to the sick and dying. The caravan also had an attending physician, Dr. Jerolaman, who joined the group in Logansport, Indiana. Local physicians occasionally visited the encampments as the group journeyed west.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" pp. 100-101. March On September 4, the march to Kansas began. Three chiefs, Menominee, Makkatahmoway (Black Wolf), and Pepinawa, were treated as prisoners and forced to ride in a wagon under armed guard. Father Petit secured their release from the wagon at Danville, Illinois, after giving his word that they would not try to escape.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" p. 40.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" pp. 97-99. Father Petit later described the caravan in a letter to Bishop Simon Brute at Vincennes, Indiana, dated November 13, 1838, from the Osage River country of Missouri: > The order of march was as follows: the United States flag, carried by a > dragoon; then one of the principal officers, next the staff baggage carts, > then the carriage, which during the whole trip was kept for the use of the > Indian chiefs, then one or two chiefs on horseback led a line of 250 to 300 > horses ridden by men, women, children in single file, after the manner of > savages. On the flanks of the line at equal distance from each other were > the dragoons and volunteers, hastening the stragglers, often with severe > gestures and bitter words. After this cavalry came a file of forty baggage > wagons filled with luggage and Indians. The sick were lying in them, rudely > jolted, under a canvas which, far from protecting them from the dust and > heat, only deprived them of air, for they were as if buried under this > burning canopy--several died thus.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of > Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 99. On the first day, September 4, 1838, the group traveled and camped at Chippeway village on the Tippecanoe River, north of Rochester. They camped from William Polke's house to his trading post on the Tippecanoe River, a mile long of campfires. The second day they left 51 sick persons at Chippeway. They marched single file down Rochester's Main Street, at gunpoint. Ten year old William Ward followed them to a mile south of Rochester, wishing to go west with his little friends, but his mother caught up with him and took him home. They reached Mud Creek in Fulton County, where one infant died-the caravan's first casualty. By the third day, September 6, they reached Logansport, Indiana, where the encampment was described as \\"a scene of desolation; on all sides were the sick and dying.\\"Dunn, p. 246. The group remained at Logansport until September 9. About 50 of the sick and elderly and their caregivers were left at Logansport to recover; most of them were well enough to rejoin the group within a few days.\\"Journal of an Emigrating Party of Pottawattomie Indians, 1838\\", p. 317. During this part of the journey the group traveled along the Michigan Road on land the tribe had ceded to the federal government for its construction in 1826.Funk, p. 47. On September 10, the march resumed from Logansport and continued along the north side of the Wabash River, passing through present-day Pittsburg, Battle Ground, and Lafayette to reach Williamsport, Indiana, on September 14. Two or more deaths occurring nearly every day. Their last encampment in Indiana was along an \\"unhealthy and filthy looking stream,\\" near the Indiana-Illinois state line.\\"Journal of an Emigrating Party of Pottawattomie Indians, 1838\\", p. 320. On September 16, the caravan crossed into Illinois and camped at Danville, where four more Potawatomi died and were buried. Father Petit joined the caravan at Danville and traveled with the Potawatomi to Kansas, tending to the sick and the religious needs of the group.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" pp. 96-98. According to Tipton's written comments, Father Petit, \\"produced a very favorable change in the morals and industry of the Indians.\\"McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" p. 37. Father Petit described his arrival at the camp in his journal: > On Sunday, September 16, I came in sight of my Christians, under a burning > noonday sun, amidst clouds of dust, marching in a line, surrounded by > soldiers who were hurrying their steps.... Nearly all the children, weakened > by the heat, had fallen into a state of complete languor and depression. I > baptized several who were newly born - happy Christians, who with their > first step passed from earthly exile to the heavenly sojourn.\\" After their arrival at Danville, the group traveled to Sandusky Point (present-day Catlin, Illinois), where the caravan resupplied and rested from September 17-20 before continuing their journey. On September 20, General Tipton left fifteen of his soldiers with the caravan and departed with the remainder of the militia on a return trip to Indiana.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 100. Judge Polke led the Potawatomi the rest of the way to their new reservation. Between September 20 and October 10, the Potawatomi traveled through the Illinois prairie, passing Monticello, Decatur, Springfield, New Berlin, Jacksonville, Exeter, and Naples, where they ferried across the Illinois River. On October 10 the group tribe left Illinois, crossed the Mississippi River into Missouri on steam- powered ferry boats from Quincy, Illinois.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" pp. 100 and 102. According to Father Petit's accounts, \\"After arriving in Missouri, we had hardly any sick\\", and the Indians were allowed to hunt for wild game to supplement their diet.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" pp. 104-105. Marching through Missouri, the Potawatomi passed through West Quincy, Palmyra, Paris, Moberly, Huntsville, Salisbury, Keatsville (Keytesville), Brunswick, De Witt, Carrollton, and Richmond, Missouri. At Lexington they crossed the Missouri River and continued on to Wellington, Napoleon, near Buckner and Lake City, Independence, and Grandview. On November 2 the group crossed the north fork of the Blue River into Kansas and camped at Oak Grove.Oak Grove is probably Elm Grove; there is no Oak Grove in the area. On November 3 they reach Bull Creek, near Bulltown\\"Journal of an Emigrating Party of Pottawattomie Indians, 1838,\\" p. 334. (present-day Paola, Kansas). The group reached the end of their journey, on the western bank of the Osage River, at Osawatomie, Kansas, on November 4, 1838. After having traveled the Potawatomi were placed under the supervision of the local Indian agent and Reverend Christian Hoecken.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" pp. 27 and 39. Of the 859 who began the journey, 756 Potawatomi survived; 42 were recorded as having died; the remainder escaped. Judge Polke and the soldiers who accompanied the Potawatomi to Kansas began the return trip to Indiana on November 7-8, 1838. Father Petit, who severely weakened from the arduous journey, began his return trip to Indiana on January 2, 1839. Too ill to continue his trip home, he died at St. Louis, Missouri, on February 10, 1839, at the age of 27, in part exhausted by the rigors of the journey.Dunn, p. 250.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" p. 39.In 1856 Father Petit's remains were brought to Indiana, where is buried at the University of Notre Dame. See Dunn, p. 250. The Potawatomi of the Woods, or Mission Band, remained in eastern Kansas for ten years. In March 1839, they moved about south to Sugar Creek mission in Linn County, Kansas. In 1840 more Potawatomi from Indiana arrived to settle on the Kansas reservation.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 116. The following year, on April 15, 1841, Chief Menominee died and was buried in Kansas; he never returned to Indiana. In 1848 the Potawatomi moved further west to St. Marys, Kansas, northwest of Sugar Creek, where they remained until the Civil War. In 1861 the Potawatomi of the Woods Mission Band were offered a new treaty which gave them land in Oklahoma. Those who signed this treaty became Citizen Band Potawatomi, because they were given U.S. citizenship. Their headquarters today is at Shawnee, Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Potawatomi scattered; many of them moved to other reservations in Kansas and Oklahoma. A reservation for the Prairie Band Potawatomi is located at Mayetta, Kansas. The state of Kansas named a Pottawatomie County, Kansas, in honor of the tribe. Not all the Potawatomi from Indiana removed to the western United States. Some remained in the East, while others fled to Michigan, where they became part of the Huron and Pokagon Potawatomi bands. A small group joined an estimated 2500 Potawatomi in Canada. Route details In the decades since 1838, numerous groups have placed commemorative markers along the route in tribute to those who marched to Kansas and as a memorial to those who died along the way.

It is south of Rosetown and north of Swift Current on Highway 4 and Highway 44. A community in the middle of an agricultural economy, Elrose has also become a local hub of activity in the oil industry. The town is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Monet No. 257.  History  Some homesteaders and other settlers were established in the area before the arrival of the railroads, being is situated along the remains of the historic Swift Current-Battleford Trail, but the majority of newcomers arrived by rail later. In 1909, the Rural Municipality Monet 257, Saskatchewan was organized. It was named after a local farmer, Fortunat Monet (pronounced Monette). The town of Elrose was originally called LaBerge after local landowner Albert LaBerge. After the railway arrived in 1913, the countryside quickly filled with people and a meeting was called to discuss a permanent name for the town. Elrose was chosen, although the origin of this name is unclear for certain. Elrose incorporated as a village in 1914. Schools and grain elevators were built, the town grew as more people arrived, and prairie sod was turned under to sow crops. The newly tilled land was rich, agriculture was profitable, and communities thrived. In 1951 Elrose reached Town status. During the 60s and 70s smaller villages in the area (Hughton, Wartime, Forgan, Greenan) began to decline and their populations migrated to Elrose. The Town of Elrose continues to move forward with the times and new prosperity appears as the local oilpatch is growing significantly. The agriculture industry is thriving as well, contributing to recent growth in the community. Demographics *Dominion Land Survey 9-26-15-W3 *Time zone (est) UTC-6 ClimateGovernment Elrose is part of the Cypress Hills‚ÄîGrasslands Federal Riding with David Anderson as the federal Member of Parliament representing this town in Ottawa. Elrose belongs to the provincial constituency Rosetown-Elrose, with the elected Member of the Legislative Assembly Jim Reiter who represents this town in Regina. The town of Elrose has its affairs looked after by Elrose Town Council, currently headed by Mayor Dane MacDonald. Education Elrose Composite School provides both primary and secondary for Elrose and surrounding rural areas. Elrose Composite School is part of the Sun West School Division which provides education to the west-central part of Saskatchewan, one of the largest school divisions in the area. Early childhood education is provided at the community owned daycare, the Elrose ABC Family Centre.  Recreation  As with most rural Saskatchewan towns, Elrose offers a variety of opportunities for people to get out and enjoy themselves. There is the Elrose Memorial Hall, a 40' x 120' structure built in the 1950s, that serves as an excellent venue for a variety of events including dances, plays, weddings and auctions. The Elrose- Monet Uniplex is a multi-use facility located at the southern end of Elrose's Main Street. This facility was constructed following the loss by fire of the original Elrose Arena. The Elrose-Monet Uniplex houses a skating rink, curling rink, and an olympic sized indoor swimming pool. The building serves as a base for the sports grounds behind it, which include baseball diamonds, a batting cage, and a number of full service campsites. The Uniplex continues to be an outstanding facility for the town and surrounding community. Recreational parks *Elrose Regional Park Library *Wheatland Regional Library Media=Newspapers *Eston-Elrose Press Review Transportation Previous to the building of railroads, many travellers through the area followed the historic Swift Current-Battleford Trail. This winding cart trail connected Fort Battleford on the North Saskatchewan River with the Saskatchewan Landing, a natural crossing on the South Saskatchewan River. Both Highway 4 and Highway 44 serve vehicular traffic to and from Elrose.

Biography  Born in C√°diz, he served as commander of the brigantine Nervi√≥n and royal commissary for the island of Fernando Po. In March 1843, he proclaimed Spanish sovereignty over Fernando Po and replaced English toponyms with Spanish ones. He worked to establish Spanish control over other islands in the Gulf of Guinea, annexing Corisco after negotiating with Benga king Bonkoro I, and colonizing the foothold on the African continent that later became Spanish Guinea. He also took possession of Elobey Grande and Elobey Chico and the island of Annobon. After a voyage filled with hardships, he returned to Spain and gave his report to his government. The Spanish government subsequently prepared a second, larger expedition to the Gulf of Guinea. Lerena was meant to head this expedition; however, he was frustrated in this ambition. He also invented a solar telegraph whose use he offered to the Spanish Navy. He died at Madrid in 1863.

The book is a notable example of cultural history, the history of mentalities and microhistory. It is \\"probably the most popular and widely read work of microhistory\\". The study examines the unique religious beliefs and cosmology of Menocchio (1532‚Äì1599), also known as Domenico Scandella, who was an Italian miller from the village of Montereale, twenty-five kilometers north of Pordenone. He was from the peasant class and not a learned aristocrat or man of letters, Ginzburg places him in the tradition of popular culture and pre-Christian naturalistic peasant religions. His outspoken beliefs earned him the title of a heresiarch (heretic) during the Roman Inquisition. Menocchio's life= Education and cultural horizon  Menocchio's literacy may be accounted for by the establishment of schools in the villages surrounding Friuli: Aviano and Pordenone. A school was opened at the beginning of the sixteenth century under the direction of Girolamo Amaseo for, \\"reading and teaching, without exception, children of citizens as well as those artisans and the lower classes, old as well as young, without payment.\\" It is possible that Menocchio attended a school such as this. He began to read some books available in his locality and began to reinterpret the Bible. No complete list exists of the books that Menocchio might have read which influenced his view of the cosmos. At the time of his arrest several books were found, but since they were not prohibited, no record was taken. Based on Menocchio's first trial these books are known to have been read. The Friuli region within modern-day Italy *1. The Bible in the vernacular *2. Il Fioretto della Bibbia (a translation of a medieval Catalan chronicle compiled from various sources) *3. Il Lucidario della Madonna, by the Dominican Albert da Castello *4. Il Lucendario de santi, by Jacopo da Voragine (see Golden Legend ) *5. Historia del giudicio (anonymous fifteenth-century poem) *6. Il cavallier Zuanne de Mandavilla (an Italian translation of the book of travels attributed to Sir John Mandeville) *7. A book called Zampollo (Il sogno dil Caravia) Based on the testimony from Menocchio's second trial these books also are known to have been read. *8. Il supplimento della cronache *9. Lunario al modo di Italia calculato composto nella citta di Pesaro dal. ecc. mo dottore Marino Camilo de Leonardis *10. the Decameron of Boccaccio *11. an unidentified book believed to be an Italian translation of the Quran Many of these books were loaned to Menocchio and were common at the time. Knowing how Menocchio read and interpreted these texts might provide insight into his views which led to his execution for proselytizing heretical ideas. Argument During the preliminary questioning, Menocchio spoke freely because he felt he had done nothing wrong. It is in this hearing that he explained his cosmology about \\"the cheese and the worms\\", the title of Carlo Ginzburg's microhistory of Menocchio and source of much that is known of this 16th-century miller. > Menocchio said: \\"I have said that, in my opinion, all was chaos, that is, > earth, air, water, and fire were mixed together; and out of that bulk a mass > formed ‚Äì just as cheese is made out of milk ‚Äì and worms appeared in it, and > these were the angels. The most holy majesty decreed that these should be > God and the angels, and among that number of angels there was also God, he > too having been created out of that mass at the same time, and he was named > lord with four captains, Lucifer, Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. That > Lucifer sought to make himself lord equal to the king, who was the majesty > of God, and for this arrogance God ordered him driven out of heaven with all > his host and his company; and this God later created Adam and Eve and people > in great number to take the places of the angels who had been expelled. And > as this multitude did not follow God's commandments, he sent his Son, whom > the Jews seized, and he was crucified.\\" Menocchio had a \\"tendency to reduce religion to morality\\", using this as justification for his blasphemy during his trial because he believed that the only sin was to harm one's neighbor and that to blaspheme caused no harm to anyone but the blasphemer. He went so far as to say that Jesus was born of man and Mary was not a virgin, that the Pope had no power given to him from God (but simply exemplified the qualities of a good man), and that Christ had not died to \\"redeem humanity\\". Warned to denounce his ways and uphold the beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church by both his inquisitors and his family, Menocchio returned to his village. Because of his nature, he was unable to cease speaking about his theological ideas with those who would listen. He had originally attributed his ideas to \\"diabolical inspiration\\" and the influence of the devil before admitting that he had simply thought up the ideas himself.

Don Young (R-AK). He pleaded guilty on April 24, 2007 to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts from lobbyist Jack Abramoff in return for using his position in Congress to advance Abramoff's interests.Docket for Mark Zachares (pdf), April 23, 2007 Career Zachares became acquainted with Jack Abramoff while serving as Secretary of the Department of Labor and Immigration for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (\\"the CNMI\\"); Abramoff was a lobbyist for business interests of the U.S. territory. The Anchorage Daily News described their relationship: > Abramoff was the commonwealth's lobbyist. According to the Saipan Tribune, > he was paid at least $11 million from 1994 to 2001 to prevent Congress from > interfering with local regulation of wage rates and immigration - the two > issues under Zachares' authority. \\"Beginning in the mid-1990s, Zachares came > to have extensive contact with Abramoff during Zachares' tenure as an > official of the CNMI, and Zachares and Abramoff became personal and > professional acquaintances\\", the charging document said. Zachares received $10,000 from Abramoff's false charity, Capital Athletic Foundation in two payments. The first came while he was secretary, the second after leaving the job. Starting after the 2000 election and a number of months afterwards, Abramoff attempted to convince the White House to hire Mark Zachares as the head of the Interior Department's Office of Insular Affairs. In 2002, Abramoff helped Zachares secure a job as legal counsel to the Oversight & Investigations subcommittee of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, then became staff director for the Coast Guard & Maritime subcommittee‚Äîboth overseen by Rep. Don Young, who served on the committee that oversees insular affairs, the House Resources Committee. It was alleged that > While doing favors for Abramoff from his positions on Young's committee, > Zachares was rewarded with all kinds of favors, from being invited on a > $160,000 golf trip to Scotland to use of Abramoff's luxury box seats at the > MCI Center in Washington where the Wizards of the NBA and Capitals of the > NHL play, $30,000 worth of sporting and event tickets from Abramoff, free > meals and drinks at Signatures Restaurant, and free rounds of golf at > Woodmore Country Club, where Abramoff was a member. Zachares, as part of his plea bargain, agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, who, in exchange, would not prosecute Zachares' wife, Cynthia. The scandal was portrayed in the 2010 movie Casino Jack and the United States of Money.

The name of the club comes from the river which runs throughout the parish on its way to meet the River Blackwater. The club fields both senior Gaelic football and junior hurling teams. It is a member of Avondhu division of Cork GAA. History The club was founded by Fr. James Moynihan in 1888 with the original name \\"Mourneabbey\\". It was originally an all hurling club but in 1923 the club began to compete in Gaelic football also. Records show that Mourneabbey contested a Junior Football County against Canovee in 1911. However, on that occasion they lost. Throughout the '20s '30s & '40s the Club played with little success. Mourneabbey GAA Club was renamed Clyda Rovers in 1945 after The River Clyda which meanders through the parish of Mourneabbey on its way to join the River Blackwater. In the mid 1950s hurling became strongest in the parish and a first North Cork Title was won in Novice Grade in 1955, and a Football title followed in 1956 In the 1960s the club won a number of novice football Cork titles, the win in 1967 in particular was a great boost to the club. In 1980 after a number of years of trying Clyda Rovers won their first ever Junior A Football North Cork when they defeated Ballyclough in the final. The 1980s was to prove a decade of unparalleled success. Clyda won 7 North Cork titles throughout the decade, 5 in Football and 2 in Hurling. They also Contested 3 County Junior Finals losing 2 football finals but winning the Junior A Hurling County against Ballinscarthy in 1989. The 1990s began with Clyda Rovers GAA having 2 Intermediate Teams in football and in hurling. The footballers had more success than the hurlers and reached 1 County Final and 3 Semi-finals where they were narrowly defeated each time. However on September the 8th 1996 Clyda finally realised their potential when they defeated Carrigaline to win the Cork Intermediate Football Championship title. Scenes of great celebration followed and for the first time in its history Clyda was a Senior Football Club. For the next 8 years the Clyda team gave us some historic victories, beating teams such as Muskerry, Carbery, Naomh Abhan, Bishopstown, Douglas, Duhallow to name a few. They reached the Semi-final of the Cork Senior Football Championship in 2000 and were beaten by eventual Champions Nemo Rangers. The Club regraded to Premier Intermediate Football in 2006. Between the Years 2009 to 2011 the club contested 3 Premier Intermediate finals but lost narrowly on each occasion to Valley Rovers, Newcestown and Newmarket. In 2010 the club won its first ever minor hurling county when they defeated St Marks in the Cork Minor B Hurling Championship final in an epic game. After the 3 final loses under the guidance of Ned English in 2013 Clyda finally brought home the premier intermediate football title when they defeated Macroom in the county final by 13 points to 8 to secure a second intermediate county title in football The Team then went on to reach the Munster Intermediate Football final where they played St Joesphs Milltown Malbay where they won on a scoreline of 0‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì07 to cap a memorable year for the club. Two Club players Ray Carey and Paudie Kissane made history for the Club when they were on the Cork Senior Football Team that won the All Ireland Senior Football Title in 2010 when Cork defeated Down 16 points to 15. in 2019 Conor Corbett captained the Cork Minor Footballers to all Ireland success when they defeated Galway in the final. Its sister club Mourneabbey Ladies Football have won 2 All-Ireland club titles in Junior 2005 and Intermediate 2007, they also contested 3 Senior Club finals in 2014,2015 & 2017 finally landing the All Ireland Senior title in 2018 to scenes of great celebrations. Our juvenile club won its first ever county title in Under-16 hurling in 2007. In the year 2000 Clyda Rovers were looking at moving away from their base in the community centre as the facilities were now not able to cater to the growing demands of the club. However once land alongside the current community centre came up for sale Clyda Rovers GAA came to an agreement with the community council. Between 2001 and 2020 over 1.9 Millon has been spent developing first class facilities in Mourneabbey such as new dressing rooms and the laying of two new pitches ‚Äì the main one having 400 lux floodlighting. In 2018 a new astroturf pitch was opened. Now Clyda Rovers GAA and Mourneabbbey boast a modern complex which the local area is very proud of.

The FCC looked into the allegations since the letter was sent, and Fox quietly canceled the show without airing any of its eight episodes.

Life In her hometown Rotterdam Ida Gerhardt attended the Erasmus Gymnasium, where the poet J.H. Leopold was her Classics Teacher. He made an indelible impression on her. There she also met her future life partner Marie H. van der Zeyde. From 1924 to 1933 Gerhardt studied classical languages, first in Leiden and later in Utrecht. In 1942 she graduated cum laude on the translation of Lucretius' De rerum natura, Books I and V. From 1937 she was a teacher in Groningen, then in Kampen. In 1951, at the request of the non- conformist pedagogue Kees Boeke, she joined him at the school section of the Werkplaats Kindergemeenschap in Bilthoven. She retired in 1963 and settled in Eefde. Literary career Just before the outbreak of World War II in May 1940, Ida Gerhardt made her debut with her first collection of poems, Kosmos. Her poems are characterized by a special focus on nature and landscape, especially the landscapes of the rivers Merwede, Waal, Lek and IJssel. Formed by her classical education and inspired by Christian beliefs, she does not confine to landscape descriptions, but always looks for kosmos, the unity in and of all creation. In her view there is meaning in nature and it is the poet's sacred duty to uncover this. Every poem is a complex network, full of sometimes mysterious relations between words, elements of nature, personal (even private) experiences, and the higher reality. Therefore, her work is often classified as symbolist or post-symbolist. Gerhardt's poetry was published when another poetics prevailed, which meant that her poetry in official criticism remained in the shadow. A real appreciation of her work emerged from 1970 onwards. In 1979 she received the Award for Mastership from the Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde, in 1980 the P.C. Hooftprijs. She also received recognition for her careful translation of the Psalms, which she made together with her friend, Marie H. van der Zeyde (1972). For her Latin translations of Virgil she received the prestigious Martinus Nijhoff Award. Her Collected Poems appeared in 1980 and were reprinted several times. The literary award Ida Gerhardt Po√´zieprijs is named after her.

Geology The waterfall begins as a slide which drops over a ledge approximately four feet high. The river then continues down a long, sloping, ever-steepening granite slope before plunging into some small pools or against large rock slabs at the bottom. A portion of the river drops off a 25' cascade on river left at the bottom. Bottom portion of Bridal Veil Falls Visiting the falls Access to the falls is from the forest's Fawn Lake parking area by hiking or bicycle by going past Fawn Lake, the airstrip, and the horse barn, or from the Buck Forest parking area by crossing the covered bridge, turning right, and following this road past Lake Julia to the falls. Access to the falls by vehicle may also be allowed for handicapped persons. A wide gravel road travels within several hundred feet of the falls, where a gentle, graveled path descends to the base. There is a viewing platform halfway down this trail and a bike rack at the bottom. While it is possible to go behind portions of the falls and cross the river, or to walk up the wide, open slab of rock beside the falls when the rock is not wet or slippery, such activities are potentially dangerous. Visitors should exercise caution when crossing any stream or venturing near any waterfall.

Geography Wulften am Harz lies on the south western edge of the Harz mountains and on the north western end of the Rotenberg hills. The Oder river flows past the village. The nearest towns are Osterode am Harz (12 km), Herzberg am Harz (15 km) and G√∂ttingen (30 km). History * Wulften am Harz was mentioned for the first time in the year 889: the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia granted Adalgar, the Gaugraf of Lisgau the villages of Kalefeld and Wulften (6 July 889). * In 1502 the St. Aegidienkirche was established under the patronage of nobles. * In 1567 Wulften came under the rule of the Welfen principality of Grubenhagen. Wulften became integrated with the church offices in Herzberg am Harz and the Reformation led to the population becoming Lutheran (in 2004, 78.5%). * In 1626 Johann t'Serclaes von Tilly, heading to the battle of Lutter am Barenberge crossed the Oder River at Wulften. There was repeated plundering here during the Thirty Years War. * In the Seven Years' War of 1756-63 the St. Aegidienkirche church was damaged. * 1807-1813 Wulften belonged to the kingdom of Westphalia (D√©partement of Harz; 1815-1866 to the kingdom of Hanover, 1866-1946 to the Prussian province of Hanover and since 1946 to the Bundesland of Lower Saxony. * On 1 December 1868 Wulften gained railway access when the Northeim-Herzberg am Harz railway (later called the S√ºdharzstrecke) opened. The Wulften-Duderstadt railway opened on 31 October 1889. * In 1933 Nazi rule came to Wulften: on 7 July 1933 all German Democratic Party members of the community council were dismissed by police order. The Nazi regime ended in Wulften on 10 April 1945 with the liberation by soldiers of the 9th US Army. * From 1972 the Gemeinde of Wulften became part of the Samtgemeinde of Hattorf am Harz. * From 1 October 2004 the village has had the official name Wulften am Harz. Politics On 1 November 2006 eight councillors from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and five from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) parties were elected.

Most of the lake is located in Williamson County, southwest of Marion, Illinois. The lake is accessible from Interstate 57. Two arms of the lake penetrate into adjacent Union County. The lake is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Geology and history  Devil's Kitchen Lake is located just south of the farthest advance reached by glaciers during the Ice Ages. Instead of being located in the relatively flat, rolling terrain characteristic of most of Illinois, the lake is located in an unglaciated zone of deep sandstone valleys and steep slopes. Devils Kitchen Lake is located in one of these valleys, and it is one of the deepest lakes in Illinois. Sections of the lake are as deep as 90 feet (27 m).Chris McKinley, \\"Southern Illinois Lakes: Cool, Cool Water\\", accessed April 23, 2007. The drainage area surrounding Devil's Kitchen Lake was not very suitable for agriculture and, after being cleared in the early 19th century by frontier settlers, the region drifted out of cultivation. Much of the land was condemned by the federal government during the Great Depression of the 1930s as a form of agricultural readjustment and relief. The Civilian Conservation Corps built Crab Orchard Lake in that decade, and two lakes in Crab Orchard's drainage area, Devils Kitchen Lake and Little Grassy Lake, soon followed it to stabilize water supply to the larger, downstream lake and provide additional recreational opportunities. The drainage area around Devil's Kitchen Lake was allocated to Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge, Crab Orchard Wilderness, Panther Den Wilderness, and Shawnee National Forest.Susan L. Post, \\"Hiking Illinois\\" (1997; Human Kinetics), page 189. The lake today The depth of Devil's Kitchen Lake make it a suitable lake for rainbow trout, a cool-water fish that does not thrive in most Illinois waters. Other fish more familiar in Illinois are also found, such as the largemouth bass, bluegill, and crappie.Joe McFarland, \\"The Unique Refuge\\", Outdoor Illinois XIX:3 (March 2011), page 14. The shores are controlled by the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge, and there are three separate boat-launching areas, on the north end, western shore, and eastern shore. There is a power limit on the lake, with motors restricted to 10 h.p. or less. Sections of the lake are filled with underwater snags, the stumps of dead trees from the valley forest that once lived where the lake is today. Fishermen are advised to be aware of these snags. Swimming is forbidden in Devils Kitchen Lake. A fee is required for motor vehicle access to the lake shore.\\"Shawnee National Forest: Recreational Activities\\", accessed April 23, 2007.

He is initially postulated to have been a pupil of a little known Francesco Leoncini in his native city.Guida di Pistoia per gli amanti delle belle arti con notizie, by Francesco Tolomei, 1821, page 152. Attracted by the fame of his fellow Tuscan Pietro da Cortona, and seeking his instruction, he sought da Cortona in Rome, where he was welcomed. Pascoli narrated that he obtained the first commissions through da Cortona, under whom he became adept at fresco technique. Work The first public work was probably the St Francis painted in the third chapel to the left in the church of San Marco in Rome, dating back to the seventeenth century decoration of the church (1653‚Äì56). He painted a David and Goliath for Alexander VII in the Palazzo Quirinale, where his style evolved into a choice of light tones that will remain typical of his painting, today appreciable above all in the frescoes. Gradually Baldi came to personal interpretation of the style of Cortona, by then dominant style in Rome along with style represented by Andrea Sacchi. He accepted compositional formulas and the typology, but not the baroque impetus. In the representation of the landscape he was influenced by Gaspar Dughet - the French artist who painted the background in the Creation of Adam and Eve - and also from Pier Francesco Mola and his background in the altarpiece The Rest During the Flight to Egypt. Religious commissions He also executed frescoes (1658) for the church of San Giovanni in Oleo and a San Giovanni in Patmos(1660‚Äì1665) for San Giovanni in Laterano. He also painted an altarpiece of the Martyrdom of St. Lazarus for the church of Santi Luca e Martina. He also worked in Camerino; Pistoia (an Annunciation for the church of San Francesco and a Repose in Egypt for the Umilta); and Perugia (Casa Borgia-Montemellino).F. Tolomei, page 152-153. As an engraver, Baldi is known for a plate on The Conversion of St. Paul.

Created in 1966, it is named for environmentalist and author Rachel Carson, whose book Silent Spring raised public awareness of the effects of DDT on migratory songbirds, and of other environmental issues. Plaque at the entrance to the refuge. The refuge's parcels include protected areas between Kittery and Cape Elizabeth, including land in Wells, Kennebunk, Kennebunkport, Biddeford, Saco, and Scarborough. The refuge protects of estuary salt marsh and uplands that drain into the Webhannet River, or about one-ninth of the river's watershed. The refuge's headquarters are on Route 9 in Wells. The refuge protects various kinds of habitat, including barrier beach, dune, tidal estuary, salt marsh, and rocky coastline. The piping plover, an endangered species, nests on refuge land. Wildlife and habitat The Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge was established to preserve ten important estuaries that are key points along migration routes of waterfowl and other migratory birds. During harsh winters, the refuge's marshes provide vital food and cover for waterfowl and other migrating birds at a time when inland waters are frozen. The refuge also supports piping plover, least terns, peregrine falcons, bald eagles, and other state and federally protected species. Nesting success of plover and terns has benefitted from the increased habitat protection. In addition to anadromous fish, many commercially and recreationally important fin and shellfish rely on these coastal wetlands as critical nursery areas. American woodcock Refuge lands total over in eleven geographic units from Kittery to Cape Elizabeth, Maine. In 1989, the refuge boundary expanded to include salt marsh, freshwater wetlands, and \\"critical edge\\" uplands around each of the nine divisions. In addition, the Biddeford Pool Division, the tenth division of the refuge, was created. This division serves as a key staging area in southern Maine for a large number and diversity of shorebirds. In 2007 the final Comprehensive Conservation Plan was signed, adding the eleventh division, York River Division. When land acquisitions are complete, the refuge will be about in size. In 1984, a National Estuarine Research Reserve was established in Wells, Maine. The reserve land is made up of portions of the Upper and Lower Wells divisions of the refuge. Together, the reserve and refuge function to further the knowledge and understanding of estuaries throughout the community. The goal is to promote an increased stewardship and, ultimately, a greater protection of the estuaries. Threatened and endangered wildlife species The piping plover is designated federally threatened and state endangered in Maine. Fifty to 75% of the Maine piping plover population nests at sites on or near the refuge, including Crescent Surf Beach, Goosefare Brook, and Marshall Point at Goose Rocks. New England cottontails (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found in Maine. Cottontails inhabit early successional habitat that was relatively abundant in the early to mid-20th century. As farms were abandoned, the species did very well. Subsequently, increased development and reforestation has led to a population decline as this type of habitat became increasingly rare. The refuge prohibited rabbiting starting in 1998 because of ongoing population declines. Subsequently, the Service was petitioned in 2000 to list the New England cottontail under the Endangered Species Act. Currently, New England cottontail is listed as a Candidate Species under the Endangered Species Act and as endangered in Maine. Migratory birdsSalt marsh birds= In 1995, sharp-tailed sparrows were divided into two separate species: the Nelson's sharp-tailed sparrow (Ammodramus nelsoni) and the saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus). Saltmarsh sharp- tailed sparrows are found in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast from the Delmarva Peninsula north to southern Maine. Within the refuge both species are found only on salt marshes. The saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrow is an obligate salt marsh species that spends its entire life cycle on salt marshes. =Waterbirds= Common loons (Gavia immer) frequent the lower reaches of tidal creeks of all refuge divisions from late autumn through early spring. They are commonly observed feeding on green crabs and small fish. During spring, summer and autumn migration, 11 species of wading birds use the estuarine systems of the refuge. =Waterfowl= Twenty-six species of waterfowl are recorded from the refuge. The most commonly observed species are American black duck (Anas rubripes), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), green-winged teal (Anas carolinensis), common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), and red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator). Dabbling ducks use salt pannes and the upper reaches of tidal creeks, while diving ducks prefer deeper parts of the tidal creeks and the mouths of rivers and streams. Black ducks, mallards, and increasing numbers of Canada geese breed on each division of the refuge. Wood ducks (Aix sponsa) breed on the Upper Wells and Mousam River Divisions each year. =Shorebirds= Southern coastal Maine is a migration and staging area for much of the North American shorebird population. Thousands of shorebirds feed along coastal beaches and mudflats as they migrate through the state. Biddeford Pool serves as one of the top shorebird staging areas in southern Maine. The most common species observed in the autumn include semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus), black-bellied plover (Pluvialis squatarola), least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca), short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), and semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla). These species and others typically feed in the mudflats at low tide. Most shorebirds feed in salt pannes and roost in pannes and adjacent upland areas during high tides. =Gulls and terns= Roseate tern in flight Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) are the most common gull species sighted on the refuge. They frequent all divisions throughout the year, but are most abundant in the autumn and winter when they roost on the marsh and tidal flats, and occasionally steal food from diving ducks in tidal creeks. Ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) also are common throughout the refuge, particularly during non-breeding season. During autumn and winter migration, Bonaparte's gulls (Larus philadelphia) feed and roost at the mouths of tidal creeks and rivers throughout the refuge, but they are most abundant on the Biddeford Pool, Upper Wells, and Lower Wells divisions. Least terns nest on the refuge in several locations. In the mid-1980s, common terns nested in the salt marsh on the Lower Wells and Little River divisions. Roseate terns (Sterna dougallii) nested on West Goose Rocks Island in 1985, and lately, have been observed along Crescent Surf Beach in the Upper Wells Division. In 2003, Crescent Surf Beach hosted the largest nesting colony (157 pairs) of least terns in Maine. Early season crow predation and late season owl and coyote predation depressed productivity. The refuge controls diurnal predators such as crows and foxes with several techniques, including hazing, fencing, trapping, and shooting. Least terns also nest at Laudholm Beach, Goose Rocks, Higgins, and Reid State Park. During migration, large numbers of common terns, along with smaller numbers of roseate terns (15), stage at Crescent Surf Beach. =Land birds= Over 120 species of land birds have been recorded at the refuge, with over 72 nesting. Some of those include great crested flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus), tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens), scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea), and others. Forests, woodlands, and swamps surrounding refuge salt marshes also provide habitat for many raptors. Many migrating raptors use forested areas next to marshes as hunting perches and feeding areas. Sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus), Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii), and broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus) have nested in forested habitat on the refuge. Northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) and red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) nest in the area. During migration (primarily autumn), many raptors move through the refuge. Northern harriers are the only raptor species thought to breed in the estuarine communities of the refuge. Mammals White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are the mammal most commonly observed on the refuge. Their trails cut through certain portions of the salt marsh on each division, although they more typically are observed along marsh edges and in surrounding forests. The refuge lies entirely within Wildlife Management District No. 24, which had an estimated winter deer population density of in 1997. The Wildlife Division Research and Management Report (2000) stated that the herd has continued to grow at 15 percent per year, and the wintering deer population density is now nearly . In certain areas of the refuge, hunting (including white-tailed deer) is prohibited because of state designated Game Sanctuaries. Deer population densities in those areas are estimated from to more than . Those densities far exceed the state target of 50 percent to 60 percent of carrying capacity. Raccoon (Procyon lotor) tracks and scats abound on all divisions. Their sign most often appears along the edges of tidal creeks and salt pannes, where they search for green crabs and small fish. Care must be taken to distinguish raccoon sign from that of river otters (Lutra canadensis), another mammal that forages extensively in the marshes. River otters are observed infrequently in the salt hay along the edges of tidal creeks. Most recently, river otters were seen in the Merriland River and Branch Brook in the Upper Wells Division. Mink (Mustela vison), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), red fox (Vulpes fulva), and coyote (Canis latrans) also hunt within the estuary. Beaver (Castor canadensis) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) are occasionally seen swimming in tidal creeks. A few harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) haul-out sites exist on the Brave Boat harbor, Lower Wells, Mousam River and Goose Rocks divisions. Peak use occurs during the winter, but individuals are observed throughout the year. The Lower Wells haul-out site receives the most use, with peak counts of 30 seals. During the winter months harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus), and occasionally hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), can be found basking on refuge salt marshes and in offshore waters. Seal strandings are a common occurrence, and are reported to marine animal rescue agencies. Many large mammals are found on or near the refuge. Moose (Alces laces) and black bear (Ursus americanus) are becoming more common in southern Maine as their populations continue to grow. They have been sighted on all refuge divisions except Moody. A bobcat (Lynx rufus) was reported as sporadically using the Upper and Lower Wells divisions in 1991 and 1992. Fishers (Martes pennanti) are increasingly sighted on the refuge; a vehicle killed a fisher near refuge headquarters in 1998, and several sightings around the headquarters have occurred since then. Gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and short-tailed weasel (Mustela erminea) most likely use several refuge divisions. Porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) and woodchucks (Marmota monax) are found throughout the refuge, where they occur in varied habitats. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are found in forests throughout the refuge in areas with dense understory. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), meadow jumping mice (Zapus hudsonius), and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) occasionally use the edge of salt marsh habitat. Masked shrews (Sorex cinereus), northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda), southern red- backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi), and pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) have also been caught in salt marshes. Other small mammals that commonly are found on the refuge include eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), and eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). These species are most common in pine-oak forests where acorns are abundant. Southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) is recorded for the Upper Wells and Brave Boat divisions, but they probably also occur in other areas with mature pine-oak forest. Other small mammals that are known or are likely to occur on the refuge include hairy-tailed mole (Parascalops breweri), star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata), smoky shrew (Sorex fumeus), and house mouse (Mus musculus). Reptiles and amphibians The refuge has a limited amount of freshwater cattail marsh or pond habitat. However, within its uplands, the refuge protects an extensive network of rivers, uplands and vernal pools, which provide important amphibian and reptile habitat. Frog call counts and limited vernal pool surveys were conducted on the refuge; American toad (Bufo americanus), green frog (Rana clamitans), wood frog (Rana sylvatica), pickerel frog (Rana palustris), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), gray tree frog (Hyla versicolor), and spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) are documented as breeding on most refuge divisions. In addition, yellow-spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), red back salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), and eastern newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) are recorded as common breeders. The blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale) and northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) are uncommon, but likely are breeders on the refuge. Documented species on the refuge Garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), ribbon snake (Thamnophis sauritus, Maine‚ÄîSpecial Concern), smooth green snake (Liochlorophis vernalis), redbelly snake (Storeria occipitomaculata), painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), and spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata, Maine‚ÄîThreatened) are documented species within the refuge. Species that are likely to use the refuge but are not documented include ringneck snake (Diadophis punctatus), milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum), northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon), brown snake (Storeria dekayi, Maine Special Concern), Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii, Maine Endangered), and possibly, eastern racer (Coluber constrictor, Maine‚Äî Endangered), wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta, Maine‚ÄîSpecial Concern) and common musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus). Records indicate that both Blanding's turtle and spotted turtle occur in many locations along the refuge boundary. Wood turtle and black racer records are much less common, and musk turtle records in the vicinity of the refuge are nonexistent. Surveys targeted at detecting turtles and snakes could be developed and implemented on refuge lands with particular attention to the occurrence of the rare, secretive Blanding's turtle. Lands within the proposed acquisition boundary in Kennebunk and Biddeford have extensive vernal pool habitat that would benefit several Species of Concern. Fish Coastal marshes, bays, tidal creeks, and rivers support diverse shellfish and finfish populations. Sunfish (Lepomis species), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) abound. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (Pollachius virens), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native species such as winter flounder, northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts little skate (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, cunner, Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink River supports blueback herring, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, cunner, winter flounder, and little skate. Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as \\"essential fish habitat\\" areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat. Habitat types Rachel Carson NWR is approximately 35 percent tidal, 10 percent freshwater wetlands and 55 percent uplands. Tidal habitats include beach, dune, dune grassland, river, rocky shore, estuarine, bay, and salt marsh. Freshwater wetlands include cattail marsh, bog, emergent scrub-shrub wetlands, pocket swamps, red maple swamps, and floodplain forest. The majority of the upland forests consist of mixed oak and pine forest. However, hemlock, spruce and pitch pine stands occur, as well as hickory and maple forests. Viburnums, winterberry, blueberry, serviceberry, Virginia rose, and male berry comprise much of the shrub understory. Other upland habitats consist of grassland units and thicket units. Habitats are quite diverse, containing elements from the more southern oak-pine forests and the coniferous forests of the north. Southern Maine is where these two community types collide and blend, creating a wealth of biodiversity. The refuge has exemplary natural communities that include a coastal dune marsh ecosystem, Spartina saltmarsh, white oak ‚Äì red oak forest, dune grassland, and pitch pine bog.

It grows over the range of 5 to 25% NaCl. The type species of this genus is Halomonas elongata. Description Members of Halomonas are Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria, generally 0.6-0.8 Œºm by 1.6-1.9 Œºm. They move by using flagella. They grow in the presence of oxygen, although some have been reported to be able to grow without oxygen. When grown on an agar plate, they form white/yellow colonies that turn light brown over time.

In one study, three species were isolated from two patients suffering bacteremia in a dialysis center. The study hypothesized that the bicarbonate used in the dialysis fluid may have been contaminated by the bacteria. Etymology The name Halomonas derives from: Greek noun hals, halos (·ºÖŒªœÇ, ·ºÅŒªœåœÇ), salt; and monas (ŒºŒøŒΩŒ¨œÇ), nominally meaning \\"a unit\\", but in effect meaning a bacterium; thus, salt (-tolerant) monad.

Function  BMPR1B is a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor family of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. The ligands of this receptor are BMPs, which are members of the TGF-beta superfamily. BMPs are involved in endochondral bone formation and embryogenesis. These proteins transduce their signals through the formation of heteromeric complexes of 2 different types of serine (threonine) kinase receptors: type I receptors of about 50-55 kD and type II receptors of about 70-80 kD. Type II receptors bind ligands in the absence of type I receptors, but they require their respective type I receptors for signaling, whereas type I receptors require their respective type II receptors for ligand binding. The BMPR1B receptor plays a role in the formation of middle and proximal phalanges.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene have been associated with primary pulmonary hypertension. In the chick embryo, it has been shown that BMPR1B is found in precartilaginous condensations. BMPR1B is the major transducer of signals in these condensations as demonstrated in experiments using constitutively active BMPR1B receptors. BMPR1B is a more effective transducer of GDF5 than BMPR1A. Unlike BMPR1A null mice, which die at an early embryonic stage, BMPR1B null mice are viable.

Castellari. The film stars Franco Nero, James Whitmore, Delia Boccardo and Fernando Rey. High Crime was a big success at the time of its release, and helped popularize the Italian cop thriller genre. Plot A Lebanese drug dealer arrives in Genoa and Vice-Commissioner Belli (Nero) soon tracks him down. After a long car chase, Belli manages to arrest him. However, when the prisoner is being taken to the police station, the police car is bombed before it reaches its target. The Lebanese and four policemen die in the hit, but Belli survives. Belli then goes to Cafiero (Rey), an old-fashioned gangster who claims to have transformed into a peaceful gardener, to question about the bombing and it turns out that there is a new player in town. Cafiero decides to take care of the new gang before the police get to them. His task turns out to be more difficult when his trusted man, Rico (Daniel Mart√≠n), turns out to be a mole working for the unknown new gangsters. Belli's boss, Commissioner Aldo Scavino (Whitmore), has put together a dossier on the city's mafia connections, but thinks that there is not enough hard evidence to take down all the gangsters from top to down. After several discussions with Belli, he finally agrees to take the dossier to the district attorney. However, he is murdered and the dossier is stolen. Belli now takes over Scavino's seat as the Commissioner and eventually finds the murderer. The murderer names Umberto Griva (Duilio Del Prete) as his boss, as Belli expected. When Griva's brother Franco (Silvano Tranquilli) is found murdered, it seems that someone with even higher political connections is trying to take over the city's drug trafficking. Belli then starts from square one and, after a warning from Cafiero, decides to send his daughter away to a safer place. However, his daughter is soon murdered and his girlfriend Mirella (Boccardo) beat up. With a helpful hint from Cafiero, Belli finds out about a large drug smuggling operation. As Belli arrives on the scene, a shootout ensues, and Belli survives while all the criminals are killed. Production Director Enzo G. Castellari was influenced to create High Crime after watching the film Bullitt. When presenting the idea of this sort of film to producer Edmondo Amati, he was told to show him a story. Castellari discussed a plot with screenwriters Tito Capri and Amati's son Maurizio. The group developed a treatment based around the murder of Luigi Calabresi. Castellari did not want Edmondo Amati to read their script, and decided to tell him the story instead. Italian film historian Roberto Curti has stated that despite Castellari's recollections, he felt the story outline was more derived from William Friedkin's The French Connection with its similarity to its opening scenes and Fernando Rey's presence as an elderly crime boss. High Crime was filmed at Incir De Paolis in Rome and on location in Genoa, Ligurian coast, Marseille. Release High Crime was released on August 12, 1973, in Italy, where it was distributed by Fida Cinematografica. The film grossed 1,625,825,000 Italian lire on its theatrical run in Italy. The film was described as a \\"huge box office hit\\" by historian Roberto Curti. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin gave the film a negative review, finding the film \\"especially graceless when one recalls the opaque joys of Salvatore Guiliano.\\" The review critiqued the dubbing, and that its formulaic character scarcely redeemed by high-minded nods at social comment (militant workers, corrupt capitalists), the film fails even to vindicate an early promise of more homely pleasures: \\"You cops ... you're always full of jokes\\".\\" Footnotes=References * External links * .

He grew up near Los Alamos, New Mexico, where his was one of a small number of African-American families.

On August 28, 1963 Carson was overwhelmed to find himself among hundreds of thousands of African Americans at the March. This was the first big thing Carson had done in contribution to the Civil Rights Movement.Carson, Clayborne. Interview. Valerie Lampman. 23 May 2019. Recalling the March, at which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial, Carson says, \\"I have a lot of vivid memories, but not of King's speech.\\" What left the biggest impression, he says, were \\"the people I met there.\\" The March was also the only time Carson had every heard Dr. King speak in public. It wasn't until 1964 after Carson had transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)the he became more active in what he calls the \\"northern version of the southern struggle\\", and continued with SNCC. At UCLA Carson Changed his field of study from computer programming to American History. Here he earned his B.A. (1967), M.A. (1971), and wrote his doctoral dissertation on Stokely Carmichael and SNCC which earned him his Ph.D. (1975). While studying at UCLA, he was also involved with anti-Vietnam War protests. He speaks of that experience in his current writing, highlighting the importance of grassroots political activity within the African American freedom struggle.

It consists of the South and North Channel Bridges. The South Channel Bridge was opened in 1958, and spans the St. Lawrence Seaway. The North Channel Bridge, opened in 2014, connects the City of Cornwall to Cornwall Island. The bridge is among the busiest on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border in the state of New York, with about two million crossings a year. It is jointly owned by the Federal Bridge Corporation (a Crown corporation of the Canadian federal government) and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (an agency of the United States Department of Transportation), and is operated by the Seaway International Bridge Corporation, which came under the control of the Federal Bridge Corporation from the Saint Lawrence Seaway Authority in 1998. Previously known as the Cornwall-Massena International Bridge, the SIBC was a private bridge whose outstanding stock was purchased by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Authority (Canada) and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (U.S.) in 1957. It was incorporated in Canada five years later. In 2000, the international border crossing that the Seaway International Bridge comprises was named the Three Nations Crossing, in honor of the Mohawks of Akwesasne who inhabit the region. On January 24, 2014, the opening of a new lower-level bridge marked the official closing of the former high-level North Channel crossing of the Seaway International Bridge. This project was estimated to cost $75 million, entirely funded by the Government of Canada. It was announced in 2010 that the Government of Canada would be going forward with this project that would involve the construction of a new low-level bridge as well as the demolition of the Seaway International Bridge to ensure the longevity of the border crossing, assuring that the former bridge was still in safe driving condition. The high-level Seaway International Bridge was completely demolished in 2015. At the opening ceremony of the new bridge, the first person to make the crossing was Raymonde Champagne, who had also been the first person to cross the high-level bridge in 1962. Border crossing The Three Nations Crossing is the border crossing associated with the Seaway International Bridge. It was named in 2000, in honor of the Mohawk of Akwesasne, a federally recognized tribe in the United States and First Nation in Canada. Their reserve extends across the international border, in addition to that between Quebec and Ontario. Most of the land is in New York, United States.

His obituary in The Washington Post described him as a \\"sort of a gonzo museum director‚Äîelusive, unpredictable, outlandish in his range, jagged in his vision, heedless of rules.\\"  Early life and education  Hopps was born into a family of prominent doctors in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California. He was home-tutored until junior high school, when he entered the private Polytechnic School in Pasadena. From there he went to Eagle Rock High School.Christopher Knight (March 22, 2005), Curator Brought Fame to Postwar L.A. Artists Los Angeles Times. At Eagle Rock, he was assigned to an arts-enrichment program that included visits to cultural sites and performances around Los Angeles. One such visit was to the home of the pioneering Modern Art collectors Walter and Louise Arensberg, who befriended the young Hopps and invited him to their house frequently. In 1950, Hopps enrolled at Stanford University where he met Jim Newman who in 1958 opened the Dilexi Gallery in San Francisco and with whom he established a professional working relationship; a year later he switched to UCLA to study microbiology. He also studied art history.  Career  In 1952-1955, while in college, Hopps operated, along with Newman, Craig Kauffman and Ben Bartosh, Syndell Studio in Los Angeles, showing the work of artists he knew in the area. As the gallery was closing in 1955, he organized the \\"Action\\" exhibition in the indoor merry-go-round at Santa Monica Pier. Hopps and several friends stretched tarps around the merry-go-round poles and hung nearly 100 paintings by 40 artists, mostly from San Francisco, including Sonia Gechtoff, Richard Diebenkorn, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Paul Sarkisian and Jay De Feo.Howard, Seymour, Galleries of Discovery: Beat Rhythms and Beats in \\"The Beat Generation: Galleries and Beyond\\", Natsoulas, John, John Natsoulas Press, 1996, pp. 5-9 and continuing. While nothing in the exhibition sold, as a free show, it attracted a diverse group of attendees from the surrounding beaches. In 1957, he founded the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles, in partnership with artist Ed Kienholz. Keinholz soon left to focus on his own work and sold his interest to Irving Blum. The gallery showed a range of east and west coast artists during Hopps's tenure there, including, famously, Andy Warhol's first gallery show, which consisted of 32 Campbell's Soup Can paintings. Slow sales of Warhol's work ultimately persuaded Blum to buy all 32 pictures for himself; they are now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Hopps left Ferus in 1962 to become curator of the Pasadena Art Museum, now the Norton Simon Museum, and was promoted to director in 1964. At Pasadena, he mounted the first museum retrospectives of Kurt Schwitters, Joseph Cornell and Marcel Duchamp, as well as the first survey of American Pop Art, New Painting of Common Objects. His work at Pasadena brought him to national attention. Hopps served as United States commissioner for the S√£o Paulo Biennial in 1965 and the Venice Biennale in 1972. Leaving Pasadena, he was appointed director of the Washington Gallery of Modern Art in 1967 and oversaw its absorption into the Corcoran Gallery of Art. At the Corcoran, he was appointed director in 1970 and left in 1972 amid a dispute over his support of unionizing the staff. Hopps's staff at the Corcoran found him frustratingly unavailable when he was needed, and created buttons reading \\"Walter Hopps will be here in 20 minutes.\\" From 1972 to 1979, Hopps was curator of 20th-Century American Art at the Smithsonian's National Collection of Fine Arts (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum). He commented to an interviewer about that period, saying that working for bureaucrats at the Smithsonian was \\"like moving through an atmosphere of Seconal.\\" Nevertheless, he curated notable exhibitions at the Smithsonian, including a large-scale 1976 retrospective of Robert Rauschenberg that was the museum's Bicentennial observance. In 1979, Hopps became a consultant to the Menil Foundation, helping select the architect Renzo Piano to design the Menil Collection and becoming director in 1980. He was the director of the museum when it opened in 1987, but soon assumed a role as curator of 20th-century art. At the Menil, his exhibitions included a retrospective of the French artist Yves Klein as well as exhibitions of the work of John Chamberlain, Andy Warhol, and Max Ernst. He organized a Kienholz retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1996; a second Rauschenberg retrospective (with Susan Davidson) at the Guggenheim Museum and the Menil in 1997. Hopps died in Los Angeles after a brief hospitalization at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He was in Southern California to mount a retrospective of the work of sculptor George Herms, which he organized for the Santa Monica Museum of Art.  Legacy  Writing in The New Yorker magazine in 1991, Calvin Tompkins sought to describe Hopps's radical approach to curatorial work, saying, > His sensitivity to works of art takes in not only the works of art > themselves but the dialogue that he believes can and should occur between > one work and another, provided the placement, the lighting, the sightlines > can all be worked out. In a Hopps exhibition, considerations of art history > and scholarship are often present, along with ideas about style and > influence and social issues, but the primary emphasis is always on how the > art looks on the wall, and this, surprisingly, makes Walter Hopps something > of a maverick in his profession. In her 2005 obituary of Hopps, New York Times critic Roberta Smith observed that Hopps's career \\"contributed significantly to the emergence of the museum as a place to show new art.\\" In 2001, the Menil Collection established the Walter Hopps Award for Curatorial Achievement, given every other year to a distinguished mid-career curator. The award includes a $20,000 stipend and the opportunity to deliver a lecture at the Menil Collection.

Throughout his playing career, he played for Inter, Verona, Atalanta, and Torino, as well as the Italy national football team. Club career Born in Milan, Bolchi made his debut at the age of 18 with F.C. Internazionale Milano in a Serie A away match lost 1‚Äì0 to S.S.C. Napoli on 18 May 1958. He played six seasons with the nerazzurri, with 109 caps and 10 goals, gaining the nickname Maciste, due to his imposing physique, strength, and hard-tackling style of play. He captained the side between 1961 and 1962 and obtained notable success during his spell with the club, winning the Serie A title in 1963, and the European Cup in 1964. He then played for Serie B side Verona, and returned to play in the top division for Atalanta and Torino, where he ended his playing career in 1970, also winning the Coppa Italia with the latter club in 1968. International career Bolchi appeared for the Italian team on four occasions, all in 1961. Managerial career Bolchi started his coaching career in 1971 with Pro Patria, then a Seconda Categoria club (at the time, Seconda Categoria was the sixth level of Italian football). In 1974, he had his first professional coaching job at Sorrento. He also coached Pistoiese, winning the 1976‚Äì77 Serie C title, earning promotion into Serie B. He first coached a Serie A team, Cesena, in 1982, but did not manage to save it from relegation. Since then, Bolchi made just two appearances as Serie A coach, despite his long career all over the country: in 1985‚Äì86, his third season as Bari's boss which followed two consecutive promotions from Serie C1 (winning the 1983‚Äì84 Serie C1 title) to the top tier of Italian football; however, Bolchi was not able to save the biancorossi. In 1988‚Äì89, he had his last Serie A job before 2007, as Pisa head coach, but he was sacked after the 22nd matchday. On 23 April 2007, with just five matches remaining before the end of the league, Bolchi was appointed head coach of Messina, a team he already coached in their 1975‚Äì76 Serie C campaign and, for six matches, at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, in Serie B. He did not manage to avoid relegation, also due to Messina's poor league table well before his appointment, and finally retired from football after the end of the season.

Early life  Peterson was born to a poor family in Mount Holly, New Jersey. One of ten children, he went to work at age 10 to help support the family, hauling brick at a kiln during the summers and chopping wood with his father in the winters. At age 14, he apprenticed as a blacksmith. The great Leonid shower storm of 1833 On the night of November 12, 1833, one of the more spectacular Leonid meteor showers on record (dubbed the \\"Falling Stars Phenomenon\\") hit the East Coast of the United States. In the middle of the night, Peterson woke to mobs screaming the end of the world was at hand. Similar scenes played out up and down the Eastern Seaboard.Jemison, T. Housel. A Prophet Among You. Pacific Press Publishing Association. Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. 1955. pp. 173-74. See also . But instead of rushing to the nearest church like most people, Peterson, who was not religious at the time‚Äîhe later described himself as \\"almost an infidel\\"‚Äîwent back to bed. At age 17, Peterson went to work on a farm, where he attended some school. While at school, he met his future wife, Ann Dennis.  Marriage and family  Peterson and his wife moved to Sreeveville, New Jersey, where he worked on a farm near town. He recalled that he \\"did not have an enemy that I knew of, and was respected by everyone that knew me, as an honest, respectable man with a reasonable amount of intelligence.\\" At the age of 24, Peterson hauled coal for a man in Burlington who told him \\"of a strange people, whom he had just visited in Illinois.\\" The man had been converted to their faith. He provided Peterson with a pamphlet from the group, the Mormons. That night, Peterson read the pamphlet aloud while his wife sewed. They were both convinced to join the religion. He later recalled that after joining \\"all turned against me, and I was ridiculed, called a fool and shunned by nearly everyone.\\" His employer even staged an intervention, where he was told to leave the religion or lose his employment. Peterson chose the latter.  Conversion  The family determined to join the Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo. On the way, they met short-lived leader John C. Bennett on a steamboat in Ohio, who warned Peterson that Joseph Smith would take his wife as soon as he arrived. Once in Nauvoo, Charles found work with William Law, breaking hemp for one cent a day. He eventually found more- lucrative employment in a lead mine in Galena, Illinois, about 150 miles to the north. This new job required him to leave his family in Nauvoo. When he returned to Nauvoo for good in the Spring of 1844, he joined the Nauvoo Legion. On September 12, 1844, Ann died at age 26, leaving him with 4 small children, six years and under. Charles was also 26. Stricken by grief, Peterson wondered how he could look after the children and continue to provide them a living, which included working most of the day and fishing at night. Brigham Young suggested something Peterson had not thought of: \\"Hunt another wife.\\"\\"A Sketch of the Life and Labors of Charles Sreeve Peterson\\". familysearch.org. . Accessed 19 September 2014. On March 22, 1845, Charles married Mary Ann Patten, a 23-year-old from rural Pennsylvania. They eventually had three children together. In 1849, he began practicing plural marriage when he married Mary's younger half-sister, Ann, in Iowa. They eventually had 11 children together.  Settling Utah  The Petersons were driven from Nauvoo with the rest of the Mormons in 1846. Charles gave his team and wagon to the first company of pioneers and stayed behind to put his blacksmithing skills to work making more wagons. Finally, in 1849 Charles and his family crossed the plains. In 1852 they settled in Alpine, Utah, where he served as that settlement's first leader. In 1855, Charles and his families moved to Morgan Valley in northern Utah. Unlike most other Utah settlements at the time, Charles wasn't sent by Brigham Young to begin a new community. Instead, he was persuaded by Thomas Jefferson Thurston, who had discovered the valley a short time earlier. Brigham Young later encouraged others to settle there as well. The Petersons were the first settlers in the valley, which is surrounded on all sides by steep mountains. To get their wagons into the valley, Peterson and his sons dug and graded a new road through a narrow entrance to Weber Canyon known as \\"Devil's Gate\\". In 1846, early adopters of the Hastings Cutoff had used the same entrance only in reverse, as an exit on their way from Fort Bridger to California.Alexander, Thomas G. \\"The Hastings Cutoff\\". Utah, The Right Place. Utah History to Go. historytogo.Utah.gov. See . Accessed 25 April 2007. Passing through was so difficult that Hastings advised the Donner Party to avoid it in the hope of saving time. However, their alternate route through Emigration Canyon slowed them down even more. The Transcontinental Railroad later came through Weber Canyon.\\"Interesting Facts\\". Morgan Historical Society. morganhistoricalsociety.com. See . Accessed 25 April 2007. A few other families soon joined the Petersons, and the first white child born in Morgan County was born in a cabin built in 1857 by Charles' oldest son, George Henry.The child was a boy, Charles Russell Stevens. The cabin was moved to Morgan City in 1931 and has been preserved by the Daughters of Utah Pioneers. The cabin is at 48 South State Street in Morgan, Utah. Their settlement became a town called Weber City, and was later renamed to Peterson in honor of Peterson.Papanikolas, Helen. Peoples of Utah. Utah State Historical Society, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1976, p. 170. In 1861, Charles became the Bishop over the settlement. The Utah Territorial Legislature appointed him probate judge. He also served as the postmaster and operated a tannery and a blacksmith shop in the town. Yaqui tribe When the Legislature made the valley its own county in 1862, Peterson organized the county court. He served as a representative in the Legislature from 1864 to 1866. In the Spring of 1870, he married another wife, Margaret Crispin, who bore him three children. Two years later, he married Mary Thompson, who bore him 10 children.  Settling Arizona  In his early sixties, Peterson moved to Fielding, Utah, in the hope of setting up a large farming operation for his families. When none of them liked the area, he joined two of his oldest sons in Mesa, Arizona, to scout for a new site. He moved his families to Mesa in August 1883. In November 1881, Peterson was the first in a search party to spot David Patten Kimball, the head of the church in Arizona who had become lost near SeymourSeymour was a town 10 miles south of Wickenburg. It was established June 20, 1879, and discontinued around 1883. It was situated on the shore of the Hassayampa River opposite a stamping mill set up by James Seymour of New York. Town residents scattered after the mill shut down in 1879-80. See https://books.google.com/books?id=Hf97Akn8l9kC&printsec;=frontcover in the Salt River Valley.Whitney, Orson F. Life of Heber C.

Kimball, and great-grandfather of Quentin L. Cook. He was one of the young men who helped carry the Martin Handcart Company across the Sweetwater River.  Mormon colonies in Mexico  Peterson's grave in Mesa, Arizona, 2009 In 1884, David K. Udall and a few others were indicted in Arizona for unlawful cohabitation. As pressure mounted from the recently passed Edmunds Act, Peterson went to Mexico with Brigham Young, Jr., and others to negotiate land purchases for Mormon settlers in Mexico with the Mexican government and the Yaqui tribe. When Udall was convicted on perjury charges the next year (after serving three months in federal prison, he was granted a full pardon by Grover Cleveland), Charles moved with his families to Mexico. They returned to Mesa two years later, where Charles died in 1889 at the age of 71.

Although there is a widespread belief that the name Lanikai means \\"heavenly sea\\", that is a misconception and a grammatical error, since in the Hawaiian language, the qualifier (lani) comes after the noun (kai). The name Lanikai was invented in the 1920 ªs by the developer Charles Frazier, who owned 300 acres of beachfront property in the area known to Native Hawaiians as Ka ª≈çhao. This small half-mile strip of beach is consistently ranked among the best beaches in the world. Adjacent to Lanikai Beach is a primarily upper- class residential area because of this it is accessible through public beach access paths. Although the beach itself is public property, it is not state land and is not a county beach park like many beaches in Hawaii. There is no public parking lot and the area lacks facilities like restrooms, showers or lifeguards.Lanikai Beaches, Oahu As of July 1, 2014, parking violation fines have increased from $35 to $200 in an effort to keep people from illegally parking in the residential area surrounding the beach accesses. Parking violations are strictly enforced and include, but are not limited to, no parking within four feet of a driveway entrance or apron, blocking the unimproved pedestrian right of way (where a sidewalk would normally be), within 30 feet of a stop sign, within ten feet of a fire hydrant, or on or within 20 feet of a crosswalk. However, there are legal parking areas in downtown Kailua. During the weekdays, the beach is less crowded compared to the weekends, although it is still very difficult to find parking close to one of the public beach accesses. On weekends, the beach becomes extremely crowded and during vacation seasons such as winter and summer, the beach is almost completely packed every single day. Lanikai is a popular spot for photo shoots as renowned models and photographers frequent the place on nice days. What makes Lanikai Beach popular for photographers is having the two Islands in the background called the Na Mokulua or \\"mokes\\". Kayakers will often row out to land on the larger northern island, but no one is allowed to land on the southern island as it is a bird sanctuary. Water temperatures are generally 75‚Äì80 ¬∞F (24‚Äì26 ¬∞C) so you can spend plenty of time in the water. It has extremely soft powdery clean white sand. Lanikai Beach is regularly voted as one of the best beaches in America and is the only beach in the USA that was voted as one of the best beaches in the world. Due to its position on the Windward or east side of the island, Lanikai is recognized as being great place to watch the moonrise over the Mokuluas, especially during the full moon. Occasionally during the year the sun will rise directly between the Na Mokulua islands.

Early life and education Halil Savda was born in Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey (in the Cizre district of ≈ûƒ±rnak province). Savda is a graduate of primary school. Savda‚Äôs Conscientious Objection to Military Service When Savda involuntarily arrived at the √áorlu military base in late November 2004, he immediately refused to join his assigned military unit. Savda argued that he could not physically serve as a soldier because of the torture he endured in jail since 1993. He then wrote a letter to the Turkish commander declaring himself to be a conscientious objector - demanding that Turkey recognize the right to conscientious objection. On 26 November 2004 Savda was arrested at the √áorlu Military Prosecutor‚Äôs office where he declared once again that he would not ‚Äúserve in the military as it contradicted his conscience and beliefs.‚Äù Halil Savda Index On 16 December 2004 Savda appeared before the √áorlu Military Court. At trial, Savda argued ‚ÄúI believe that the responsibility of war does not only belong to those who wage it, but to everyone who condones it. With my conscientious objection, I would like to show that I do not want to bear this responsibility and that by refusing to be silent about militarism I am refusing to be a part of it.‚Äù The Military Court found Savda guilty of ‚Äúinsisting on disobeying‚Äù his requirement as a Turkish citizen to serve the Turkish military. The court ordered his immediate arrest, and transferred Savda from the military unit to Corlu Military Prison. However, he was released from custody less than two weeks later. After being released, Savda began to publicly campaign against the Turkish law requiring military participation. On 23 October 2006, Savda announced the founding of the Conscientious Objection Platform (‚ÄúCOP‚Äù), declaring that its objective is ‚Äúthe legalization of conscientious objection‚Äù in Turkey. On 7 December 2006, less than two months after forming the COP, Halil Savda was arrested and detained once again when he attended a trial session in √áorlu Military Court on charges of ‚Äúpersistent disobedience‚Äù of Turkish law. A week after his arrest, attorney Kadriye Doƒüru went to visit him at the military prison but was refused access. According to Doƒüru, there was no reasonable justification for her being denied access, and that ‚Äúher meeting was hindered on completely arbitrary grounds‚Äù. She asked the military prosecutor for justification for being denied admission, and the prosecutor responded that ‚Äúhe is not in the position to give (a justification)‚Äù.Attorney Doƒüru later published her recollection of the events at the military prison: ‚ÄúHe (the commander) told me that my name is not noted in Halil Savda‚Äôs letter of attorney and that I therefore can‚Äôt see him. I reminded him, that Savda has the status of ‚Äúdetainee‚Äù and that there is no legislation to hinder me meeting him. The commander told me that I will need a permission by the military prosecutor in order to see Halil Savda. I went to the prosecutorship. The military prosecutor said, that I can‚Äôt see Savda and that he has started to serve his two days solitary confinement today. I asked for the justification and he replied that he is not in the position to give one.‚Äù According to Doƒüru, ‚ÄúNeither the code of criminal procedure, the military criminal code, nor the code of military criminal procedure include any clause which could be used to hinder a detainee in prison from meeting a lawyer. This situation is an obstruction of the right to defense.‚Äù On 25 January 2007, Savda‚Äôs trial attorney, Suna Co≈ükun, was able to get Savda released from custody while his trial was ongoing. However, upon being released, Savda was ordered to the Tekirdaƒü Be≈üiktepe 8th Mechanized Brigade. With knowledge of Savda‚Äôs beliefs, his 2004 conviction, and his ongoing trial, the brigade officer ordered Savda to wear a military uniform. Savda repeated that he was a conscientious objector and that he would not perform military service, which included wearing a military uniform. Upon this statement, Halil was presented to the √áorlu military prosecutor with the charge of ‚Äúinsistent insubordination.‚Äù The prosecutor sent Savda back to the military unit where Savda would be subjected to severe harassment. At the disciplinary ward of the 8th Mechanized Brigade, a sergeant major, two guardians and an officer pushed Savda to the wall face- on, kicked his legs apart and began hitting him ‚Äì causing his face to swell. Savda was placed in a room at the military base where he was forced to sleep without bed or blankets. In response, Savda protested his inhumane treatment by conducting a five day hunger strike. Savda was ultimately convicted by the √áorlu Military Court for disobeying orders (for refusing to wear the military uniform) and desertion (for failing to report to his military unit). On 15 March 2007 the court sentenced Savda to 15 months imprisonment. On 12 April 2007 the court sentenced him to an additional six months imprisonment, bringing his prison time up to 21 and ¬Ω months.CO-Alerts: TK14682-120407: Turkey: Conscientious objector Halil Savda sentenced twice ‚Äì to a total of 21.5 months in prison In accordance with Turkish practice, the court did not go into the reasoning for the sentence. The judicial justification for a second sentence may be released when the written judgment is made available. Nevertheless, even when he is released from prison, Halil Savda will likely not be set free. Based on historical practice, Savda will either be sent back to his military unit, or be forced to live a clandestine life. Criticism of the military court ruling The international community expressed concern with the manner in which the Turkish government and military have dealt with conscientious objectors. European Court of Human Rights The Savda sentence arguably goes against the spirit of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights from January 2006. At that time, the European Court of Human Rights found that Turkey had violated article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically the prohibition of degrading treatment, in a case dealing with conscientious objector Osman Murat √úlke.\\"Chamber Judgement √úlke vs. Turkey\\" , Accessed June 7, 2006. The Court in √úlke's case noted: ‚ÄúThe numerous criminal prosecutions against the applicant, the cumulative effects of the criminal convictions which resulted from them and the constant alternation between prosecutions and terms of imprisonment, together with the possibility that he would be liable to prosecution for the rest of his life, had been disproportionate to the aim of ensuring that he did his military service. They were more calculated to repressing the applicant‚Äôs intellectual personality, inspiring in him feelings of fear, anguish and vulnerability capable of humiliating and debasing him and breaking his resistance and will. The clandestine life amounting almost to ‚Äúcivil death‚Äù which the applicant had been compelled to adopt was incompatible with the punishment regime of a democratic society.‚Äù \\"Chamber Judgement √úlke vs. Turkey\\" , Accessed June 7, 2006. Although the ECHR has found Turkey guilty in √úlke's conscientious objector case, no step has been taken by the government of Turkey to make legal changes to comply with the ruling. According to the COP, the treatment of Savda reasonably suggests that Turkey is ignoring the ruling made by the ECHR in 2006. Turkey continues to punish individuals concurrently for the same offense. It is arguable that unless there is a change in the law, or a change of heart on the part of the military and their courts, conscientious objectors in Turkey will be condemned to endlessly repeated convictions for the same act, an effective life imprisonment sentence. War Resisters‚Äô International According to War Resisters‚Äô International, the 15 March 2007 sentence of Savda constitutes a violation of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights allowing for freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, both of which Turkey has signed and ratified. Furthermore, the WSI argues that the 12 April 2007 sentence violates not only the aforementioned articles, but also constitutes a violation of Article 14 paragraph 7 of the ICCPR, which states that ‚Äúno one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country‚Äù.http://english- cyprus.indymedia.org/newswire/display/421/index.php The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention The U.N. Working Group is of the opinion that ‚Äúthere is, since, after the initial conviction, the person exhibits, for reasons of conscience, a constant resolve not to obey the subsequent summons, so that there is ‚Äòone and the same action entailing the same consequences and, therefore, the offence is the same and not a new one‚Äô‚Äù (Decision of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, 18 September 1999, No. 2, No. 130/95). The Working Group concludes that ‚Äúto interpret such a refusal as being perhaps provisional (selective) would, in a country where the rule of law prevails, be tantamount to compelling someone to change his mind for fear of being deprived of his liberty if not for life, at least until the date at which citizens cease to be liable to military service.‚Äù Amnesty International In 2012, Amnesty International designated Savda a prisoner of conscience, \\"detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression\\". The group called for his immediate and unconditional release. Conscription in Turkey In Turkey, compulsory military service, or conscription, is enshrined in Article 72 of the 1982 Turkish Constitution. According to Article 72, ‚ÄúFatherland service is the right and duty of every Turk‚Äù. Mandatory service applies to all male citizens from 20 to 41 years of age, but the length of service varies depending on the individual‚Äôs education and occupation. Individuals without a higher education must serve 15 months (the amount Savda would have to serve). Those with a university degree either serve 12 months as a reserve officer or serve six months as a short term private. Those citizens who have worked outside Turkey for at least three consecutive years can pay a certain fee (approximately 5,000 Euros) and serve only 21 days of basic training instead of the typical 15-month service. Conscientious objection in Turkey The issue of conscientious objection is a highly debated and controversial issue in Turkey. Turkey and Azerbaijan are the only two members of the Council of Europe that still refuse to recognize conscientious objection. Although Article 24.1 of the 1982 Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of conscience, it does not extend to the right to conscientious objection to military service. In 1991, the Turkish Constitutional Court explicitly ruled that the freedom of conscience mentioned in Article 24 does not include the right to conscientious objection to military service. Article 63 of the Turkish Military Penal Code punishes conscientious objectors for avoiding military service. Furthermore, Article 318 allows these individuals to be punished up to 2 years if they attract media attention or publish articles about their refusal to perform military service. Despite Turkey‚Äôs position on conscientious objection, a small number of individuals have publicly refused to perform military service for non- religious, pacifist reasons. The first known conscientious objector in Turkey was √úlke, a Turkish citizen who grew up in Germany and returned to Turkey. In 1995 he publicly declared that he was a conscientious objector and refused to perform military service. √úlke has been continuously subjected to recurring punishments related to his conscientious objector status.European ruling about Osman Murat √úlke Since √úlke, dozens of others have followed. Between 1995 and 2004 approximately 40 men openly declared themselves as conscientious objectors, mostly by making a public statement or giving media interviews about their reasons for refusing military service. Among the most notable, aside from √úlke and Savda, were Mehmet Tarhan and Perihan Magden. Mehmet Tarhan, a gay anarchist and conscientious objector, was imprisoned for refusing military service in Turkey. He was sentenced to four years in a military prison but was unexpectedly released in March 2006. Journalist Perihan Magden was tried by a Turkish court for supporting Tarhan and advocating conscientious objection as a human right, but was acquitted.

The film follows a group of hikers who travel into the Oregon mountains to visit property inherited by one of them, only to be hunted by a ruthless backwoods killer. The film was shot in the Silver Falls State Park in Silverton, Oregon. Despite not being a commercial success when released, the film received positive reviews, with many praising the atmosphere and cinematography. The film has gained a cult following over the years.  Plot  In a rural, mountainous region of Oregon, drunken hunters Ty and Vachel come across an abandoned church, which they explore. After Ty sees their truck being crashed into a tree, Vachel is castrated with a serrated machete by a chuckling assailant who then dons Vachel's hat and jacket. Ty, seeing the murderer exit of the church, quietly flees off into the forest. Meanwhile, forest ranger Roy McLean encounters a van of five college-aged adults heading to rural property which one of them has inherited. Despite his insistence that they not venture up the mountain, the five continue along. Among them are Warren; his girlfriend Constance; Jonathan, and his girlfriend, Megan; and Daniel, Jonathan's brother. On their way up the mountain, they hit a deer, and encounter Ty stumbling through the woods on his way down the mountain; they dismiss his warnings of \\"demons,\\" as he is visibly drunk. After reaching a point where the van cannot drive any further, the group set out on foot and make a campsite; at night, while around the fire, Constance, Megan, and Daniel hear noises around them and become frightened, only to find that Jonathan and Warren are playing a prank. The next morning, they hike along Silver Creek to a waterfall, where they see a young girl named Merry Cat Logan singing before noticing their presence and running into the woods. Megan and Jonathan go skinny dipping at the bottom of the falls, unaware that someone else has entered the water. Megan feels hands touching her and assumes it to be Jonathan, until she sees him on shore, whereupon she panics and swims to safety. When the group splits up to go exploring, Jonathan spots Merry and chases after her. She runs to a clearing but sees something that frightens her and hides behind some trees. Jonathan assumes it is the rope bridge over the waterfall ahead and begins to go across, only to be confronted by the killer, who cuts his hand with his machete. The killer severs the bridge and Jonathan plummets into the water below. Unable to swim, he attempts to climb back up over the ledge using the rope. When he reaches the ledge, the killer kicks him in the face, and he falls to his demise. Meanwhile, Megan and Daniel are taking photographs in the woods, and come across the church and a graveyard. Daniel, who has lost his glasses, sees a figure emerging through the trees, and assumes it to be Jonathan. He and Megan pretend to kiss as a joke, but as the figure comes closer, Daniel realizes it is not his brother. The figure stabs Daniel, and Megan flees into the church, where she watches through the window as the killer investigates Daniel's camera. Suddenly, another identical man emerges behind her inside the church; Megan realizes that the two are identical twins. She is murdered in the church while the other twin photographs her death from outside the window. Warren and Constance (now barefoot and in shorts) return to the camp, but cannot find anyone else. While wading through the river, they encounter Jonathan's body floating downstream, and pull him out. As night approaches, Warren leaves Constance at the campsite to retrieve the car keys from Jonathan's body, but cannot find them; nearby, he finds Jonathan's body against a tree. Meanwhile, Ty finally encounters Roy in the woods and tells him about the twins at the church. Roy goes out on his horse to find the teens, and comes across Merry's family. They tell him that the twins were actually their own and their mother died during childbirth, so he mated with his daughter and had Merry. Left alone, Constance is attacked by one of the twins, who chases her up a tree. The twin cuts down the tree, and just before he is about to kill Constance, Roy shoots him and he tells the couple to go pack their items. They go back to camp, as Merry runs through the woods to find them. At camp, the other twin stabs Warren and tries to kill Constance, who rams her fist down his throat, choking him to death. Warren begins to sob and Merry watches from the trees, as the sun rises in the forest.  Cast  Production =Conception The film's original script, based on a story by Jonas Middleton (aka. Joseph Middleton), was titled The Tennessee Mountain Murders, and later The Last Ritual, and had heavy religious themes behind the twin killers' motives, which director Jeff Lieberman felt were awful. It also included a sixth camper named Eileen and a different fate for Megan, which entailed her being tossed to her death over a cliff. It also included a climax involving Connie being forced to handle rattlesnakes by the inbred villains before becoming one of their wives; this version of the script also had more involvement from the Logan family, who were part of the scheme. Lieberman rigorously rewrote the screenplay from page one by himself to eliminate all the religious overtones in favor of a more thriller-based plot. Lieberman was heavily influenced by Deliverance (1972) while writing the film. Filming Silver Falls State Park served as the primary filming location The film was shot on location in 1980 at the Silver Falls State Park in Sublimity, Oregon, just outside nearby Salem, and an hour away from Portland, Oregon. Due to the film's low budget, filming time ranged from 14‚Äì15 hours per day.Just Before Dawn: Lions, Tigers and Inbred Twins Documentary [DVD]. Shriek Factory/Media Blasters. 2005. According to actor Chris Lemmon, the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens occurred during filming; by Lemmon's account, he and the rest of the cast were gone for the day on a trip to the Oregon coast when the eruption occurred. Per a June 1980 newspaper article, however, filming was officially slated to begin on July 7, on a budget of approximately $1 million. Despite its authentic, weathered appearance, the church used in the film was actually built for the production. Director Jeff Lieberman said that countless strangers showed up at the filming location on the day that the scene with Jamie Rose swimming topless was to be filmed. Lieberman said that word of this shoot had apparently gotten out among the local forest rangers.MattFini's Halloween Top 10 Lists: Overlooked Slashers Several odd occurrences happened during the shooting of the film; particularly, while shooting in the woods one evening, the lighting went out without explanation, leaving the cast and crew in complete darkness. After several minutes the producer yelled out 'let there be light!', and the lights immediately returned without explanation. According to director Lieberman, despite the numerous reviews of Just Before Dawn that implied it was inspired by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), he had not seen either film at the time of making Just Before Dawn. Lieberman also stated that he was influenced by Ingmar Bergman when assembling some of the film's compositions. Filming officially completed on August 9, 1980.  Soundtrack  The eerie whistling motif heard in Brad Fiedel's music score is a reference to the rescue whistle that Warren carries in the film. According to Fiedel, many of the ominous sounds in the music score were actually electronically altered audio clips of himself vocalizing droning noises. Release Initially, Universal Pictures expressed serious interest in purchasing the film but eventually backed out. Instead, the film was distributed by Picturmedia, a small independent company. Just Before Dawn was released theatrically on November 27, 1981 in the United States, showing in Miami, Florida. It again screened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania beginning on October 8, 1982. The film was also released in France, where it was released under the title Survivance in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of John Boorman's Deliverance.Review of the French edition of the DVD (French)  Critical response  Jim Davidson of The Pittsburgh Press panned the film, writing: \\"The only suspense in this appalling 1980 movie... lies in anticipating the who and when of the next stabbing,\\" adding that \\"Director Jeff Lieberman uses forest locations and a full set of dark filters that disguise the cheapness of the production.\\" Todd Martin from HorrorNews.net gave the film a positive review, praising the film's script, soundtrack, and bleak tone, calling it \\"one of the most underrated slasher flicks of all time\\". Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade C+. In his review of the film, Schwwartz wrote, \\"Fans of slasher films should be drawn to the blood and gore that is so beautifully shot and is not as graphic as it could have been. If not a devotee of this genre, you will probably find it repulsive, slack and moronic.\\" Justin Kerswell from Hysteria Lives! gave the film 4/5 stars, praising the film's acting, characters, cinematography, and direction; calling it \\"A superb film which stands head- and-shoulders above the usual backwoods slasher movie.\\" AllMovie's review of the film was favorable, writing, \\"Anyone lucky enough to fish out a copy of director Jeff Lieberman's Just Before Dawn will certainly find themselves richly rewarded.\\"  Home media  Just Before Dawn was released on DVD in 2005 from Media Blasters on their Shriek Show imprint in a 2-disc special edition and features a director's commentary, as well as a documentary on the making of the film.

It was directed by William Castle and written by Eric Taylor and Audrey Wisburg. The film stars Warner Baxter, Adele Roberts, Mona Barrie and Martin Kosleck. It is also known as Exposed by the crime doctor. Plot Renowned psychiatrist and criminologist Dr. Robert Ordway, the \\"Crime Doctor\\" is called on an emergency to a party at his next door neighbor, where a man, Walter Foster, suffers from a diabetic seizure and has collapsed on the floor. Robert administers insulin to the man, using the man's own case, but a short while after the injection is made the man dies. Suspecting something out of the ordinary, Robert calls on his friend, Inspector Burns, who works within the homicide division. Burns concludes that the man was poisoned. Robert's services is used to aid in the following investigation, and he gets a list of the guests at the party. He starts questioning them, one by one, beginning with the dead man's sister, Claire Foster. She tells him she has no clue to what her brother meant by his last words: \\"I've given you one face.\\" Nhxup is Claire's lover, Jack Swayne, owner of a health institute. He and Walter did not get along well, and Walter was opposed to him marrying his sister. Jack also tells Robert that Walter had financial problems, and Robert pays a visit to the attorney who handled Walter's affairs, Allen S. Tobin. He learns that Walter had spent most of what he had inherited from his father and also wanted to borrow money from his sister. Claire calls Robert and asks him to come to her apartment right away. Apparaently he doesn't get there fast enough, since he finds the home empty and Claire has been kidnapped. Robert goes on to investigate both the murder and the kidnapping. When he visits his neighbor Harriet, she reveals that she is divorcing her husband, Clyde, and selling their house. Robert talks her real estate agent, Alec Girard to have this information confirmed. Later in the day he gets a visit from Clyde, who tells him all about Harriet's romantic involvement with Walter. According to Clyde, Harriet had given Walter money from her own account. Clyde ends with telling Robert about the other woman Walter was seeing, Connie Day. Robert finds out that Connie works in a mortuary. He calls and sets up a meeting with her, but Connie is locked into a room at her office by one of the other employees. The person trapping her is Gypsy Corcelli, who suspects that Connie is involved in a scam to blackmail the owner of the mortuary, Karl Ganns. Gypsy disguises herself as a man, Casper, and goes to visit Robert, posing as a man who is concerned of his brother Louie's mental health. As soon as Gypsy and Louie enters Robert's office, Louie shoots Robert in the head. Robert's vision is impaired but he is not seriously wounded. After the shot, Gypsy pushes Louie out through the window, where he plunges to his death. Gypsy tells Robert that his brother had escaped from an asylum. Since there are no fingerprints after Casper's visit, Robert suspects that a plastic surgeon might be involved. Robert gets his eyesight back, but pretends to be still blinded. He manages to match the signature he got from Casper to Gypsy's and finds out that Gypsy is a hardened criminal, who must have had plastic surgery to change his facial features. Robert poses as a criminal himself, Pete Hastings, to get close to Gypsy. He tells Gypsy he wants to change his appearance and is sent to the Ganns mortuary. Before Robert arrives, Gypsy hears a news report on the radio that notorious criminal Pete Hastings is dead, and calls Ganns ahead to warn him. When Robert arrives to the mortuary, Ganns tries to poison him with an injection, but Robert manages to break free and knock out Ganns. The police arrive to arrest both Ganns and Gypsy, andboth Claire and Connie are found dead in the localities. Still the head of the criminal operation, the plastic surgeon, seems to be on the loose. All the remaining suspects are invited to a party at Robert's house, where he continues to pretend he is blind. After all the other guests have gone, Alec Girard comes back and says he has forgotten his glasses. He spikes a drink for Robert with poison and waits for Robert to swallow it. Then he confesses to Robert that he killed Walter because he had knowledge about Girard's past as a surgeon. Walter became a problem when he started blackmailing Girard. Girard is unaware that the police are listening to the conversation in the next room, and as soon as he is done they rush in to arrest him. The poison is then pumped out from Robert's stomach.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80035/Just-Before-Dawn/ Cast * Warner Baxter as Dr. Robert Ordway * Adele Roberts as Claire Foster (as Adelle Roberts) * Martin Kosleck as Karl Ganss * Mona Barrie as Harriet Travers * Marvin Miller as Casper * Charles D.

Culture The Rambla de Catalunya has always been a street noted for its art galleries, theatres and cinemas. Some of which have disappeared or been transformed with the passing of the years, but there are still two cinemas on the street. Unfortunately the Teatre Barcelona, once one of the most iconic theatres in the city, has had to be pulled down. Transport Like its more famous cousin, La Rambla, the Rambla de Catalunya has a wide central pedestrianised area. This is flanked by two narrow service roads, which in turn are flanked by narrow pedestrian walkways in front of the buildings. Unlike La Rambla, the central pedestrian walkway is interrupted by cross-streets. The nearest Barcelona Metro stations are: * Catalunya, immediately adjacent to Pla√ßa Catalunya, is a major interchange station served by several metro and suburban railway lines. * Diagonal, near the intersection with Avinguda Diagonal, is another major interchange, with the platforms on various lines linked by long underground passageways. This is the only station with an access directly to the Rambla de Catalunya. * Passeig de Gr√†cia is one city block east of the midpoint of the street.

It is also called hen and chicken fern and, in the MƒÅori language, pikopiko, mouku or mauku. Its fronds are eaten as a vegetable. Hen and chicken ferns grow small bulbils on top of their fronds. Once grown to about 5 cm (2 in), these offspring fall off and, provided the soil they land in is kept moist, develop a root system and grow into new ferns. This additional means of reproduction can be employed with greater ease than propagation by spores. There are a number of similar Southern Hemisphere species which have a similar mode of reproduction, including A. daucifolium. The hen and chicken fern commonly grows in most bush areas in New Zealand. It thrives in many situations from shade to partial sunlight. Similar species It is often confused with A. gracillimum which is a fern species native to both New Zealand and Australia. A. gracillimum is the fertile allotetraploid hybrid of A. bulbiferum and A. hookerianum, and sometimes back-crosses with A. bulbiferum. A. bulbiferum is generally larger and found in wetter areas. The wings on its leaf axes are more pronounced, most pinnules are fused to the pinna axis rather than stalked, and it bears bulbils more frequently and abundantly than A. gracillimum. Plants sold commercially as A. bulbiferum are popular, including as an indoor plant, tolerating areas with low light. However, DNA evidence has shown these plants are most commonly hybrids between the New Zealand A. bulbiferum and the Australian A. dimorphum. They are much larger than typical A. bulbiferum and the fronds with and without sporangia differ in the degree of dissection. The spores do not germinate but the plants propagate readily by means of the bulbils. These plants should be known as A. √ó lucrosum Perrie, Shepherd & Brownsey, and should not be used in revegetation projects where indigenous vegetation is required.

Another view of the complex. The Waldspirale is a residential building complex in Darmstadt, Germany, built in the 1990s. The name translates into English as forest spiral, reflecting both the general plan of the building and the fact that it has a green roof. It was designed by Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser, planned and implemented by architect Heinz M. Springmann, and constructed by the Bauverein Darmstadt company. The building was completed in 2000.  Description  The Waldspirale apartment building is located in Darmstadt's B√ºrgerparkviertel. It contains 105 apartments and a parking garage. In the past, the topmost part of the building has had restaurants, cafes and bars for people to visit. Currently, there are no open amenities for visitors. The inner courtyard contains a playground for the children of the residents and a small artificial lake. Peculiarities of the U-shaped building are the unique facade, which does not follow a regular grid organization, and the windows, which appear as if they were \\"aus der Reihe tanzen,\\" (dancing out of line)Nina Hellenkemper, Der Todestag von Friedensreich Hundertwasser http://www.lernzeit.de/sendung.phtml?detail=430529 19 February 2000.

The diagonal roof, planted with grass, shrubs, flowers and trees, rises like a ramp along the U-form. At its highest point, the building has 12 floors.  Design  The windows of the Waldspirale, which number over 1000, are all unique: no two windows are the same. Similarly, different handles are attached in each apartment to the doors and windows. Some of the apartments are decorated in Friedensreich Hundertwasser's personal style and exhibit the colourful tiles in the bath and kitchen that are characteristic of his work. Furthermore, all the corners are rounded off in these apartments along the roof and walls in an application of Hundertwasser's dogma \\"gegen die gerade Linie\\"Pg. 94, Pierre Restany, Hundertwasser: The Painter-king With the Five Skins Taschen, October 2000.Pgs. 240-241, Karsten Harries, The Ethical Function of Architecture MIT Press, 1997. or \\"against the straight line.\\" For cost reasons, only a few of the apartments' interiors were designed individually. From the outside, the typical elements of Hundertwasser's personal style attract attention: the gilded onion domes, the absence of straight lines and sharp corners, the multicoloured painting of the building in earth tones and the colourful ceramic columns.

His paintings are all based around floral arrangements; hence the name Fiori (flowers).  Biography  He was the second son of Sisto Nuzzi, a landowner from Penna in Teverina, and his wife Faustina Salini, sister of the still-life painter Tommaso Salini.Giuseppe Bartocci, \\"Della patria del pittore Mario Nuzzi\\", in Atti e memorie della Deputazione di storia patria per le Marche, 1961.Laura Bartoni \\"Le vie degli artisti: residenze e botteghe nella Roma barocca dai registri di Sant'Andrea della Fratte (1650-1699)\\", Nuova cultura, Roma, 2013 In 1618, his father took the family back to Penna, where they engaged in floriculture and Mario amused himself by painting the flowers. This led, in 1620, to an apprenticeship in the workshop of his uncle Tommaso.Francesco Solinas, Flora Romana. Fiori e cultura nell'arte di Mario de' Fiori (exhibition catalog), Roma 2010 Mario remained there until 1625, when his uncle died. While there, he was influenced by the works of Caravaggio, who had been one of his uncle's associates. In 1628, he married Ortensia de Curtis, from a family of English origin. They had one son. Floral Still-life Once established, he created amicable working relationships with Cassiano dal Pozzo and the Barberini family; all noted patrons of the arts, who not only collected but commissioned many significant works. Notably, illustrations for De florum cultura by Giovanni Battista Ferrari, which were commissioned by Cardinal Francesco Barberini. His popularity with the Barberinis led to other notable clients in the church, including Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi (who would become Pope Clement IX), and Cardinal Mario Theodoli, who promoted his works in France. He also received orders from the banker, Agostino Chigi. During this period, his works began to show Flemish influence; especially that of Daniel Seghers. An especially important contact was made in 1644, when he met Giancarlo de' Medici, who had just been appointed a Cardinal and was a passionate botanist. His commissions for Nuzzi inaugurated the Medici still-life collection and helped diffuse Nuzzi's works throughout Tuscany, where they influenced Giovanni Stanchi, Bartolommeo Ligozzi, Bartolomeo Bimbi and Andrea Scacciati.M.

In 1646, he was elected a member of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon.\\"Mario Nuzzi\\" by Arianna Petraccia in the Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 79, 2013 In 1648, he became a widower. Two years later, he married Susanna Passeri. Curiously, his marriage certificate gives his name as \\"de' Fiori\\". From 1651 to 1667, they had six children. In 1657, he was finally accepted as a member of the Accademia di San Luca. After 1658, he did decorative work for Cardinal Flavio Chigi; painitng flowers on mirrors and basanite columns. He also collaborated with other artists to paint flowers with figures at the Palazzo Chigi in Ariccia. These paintings represent the Four Seasons and each artist was assigned to assist with one of them: Filippo Lauri (Spring), Carlo Maratti (Summer), Giacinto Brandi (Fall) and Bernardino Mei (Winter). They painted the figures and Nuzzi provided the flowers. Such projects made him increasingly famous and wealthy.

() Bob's Big Boy is a restaurant chain founded by Bob Wian in Southern California in 1936, originally named Bob's Pantry. It is now part of Big Boy Restaurant Group, the current primary trademark owner and franchisor of the Big Boy system. At its peak in 1989, there were over 240 Bob's locations throughout the United States, most belonging to Marriott. By August 2019, only five Bob's Big Boy Restaurants remain in operation, all in Southern California. Those five locations are in Burbank (Toluca Lake), Calimesa, Downey, Norco, and Northridge. Two of these restaurants are now protected historic landmarks: the Burbank location on Riverside Drive and the Downey location, previously known as Johnie's Broiler. In August 2020, the addition of a Bob's Big Boy in Indian Springs, Nevada was announced in partnership with Terrible Herbst, with an opening planned for November 2020. The restaurant is named after Wian and the Big Boy hamburger, which he created six months after opening his original location. Slicing a bun into three slices and adding two hamburger patties, Wian had created the original double-deck hamburger.  History = Bob Wian before Big Boy  Bob Wian entered Glendale High School as the Great Depression started in 1929. When his father's furniture business went bankrupt, Wian washed dishes in the school cafeteria to pay for lunch. Not being a committed student ‚Äì he never took homework home ‚Äì classmates voted Wian most unlikely to succeed. However, his father's business failure and classmates' doubts would lead Wian to success. After graduation in 1933, Wian found work as the overnight dishwasher at a Los Angeles White Log Coffee Shop, a West Coast chain similar to White Castle. Suddenly he was interested in how a restaurant worked and how it could be improved; he became determined to own a restaurant or even a chain. He was intent on proving his classmates wrong. Wian was promoted to fry cook and then a manager. He learned the White Log system, its merchandising and pricing of foods, and use of a central commissary; Wian would later apply these concepts to Big Boy. He would also adopt White Log's pancake batter recipe. At White Log he befriended fellow fry cook Bennie Washam, who would later sketch the original Big Boy mascot. Bob Wian, founder of Bob's Big Boy, about 1948 Wanting wider experience, Wian quit and took a dishwashing job with his favorite Glendale restaurant, Lionel Sternberger's Rite Spot. Again he was promoted to counterman and fry cook. The man who hired Wian and was his boss, Leonard Dunagen, would later be hired by Wian and became vice president of Bob's Big Boy. Wian discovered how Rite Spot made its chili, hamburgers, and red hamburger relish ‚Äì the same relish Wian would use on the Big Boy hamburger. And he learned the importance of consistency in foods served. The Rite Spot also offered curb service, as Bob's Big Boy would several years later. (His sister Dottie was a carhop at the Rite Spot before moving to Bob's Big Boy.) However, Wian's first drive-in work was at a Pig Stand. The restaurants used pig-shaped die-cut menus and some had a big pig in front; similarly, Bob's would use Big Boy shaped die-cut menus and later display large Big Boy statues out in front. Wian also patronized other restaurants looking for additional menu items, attempting to recreate the favored items at home, and sometimes prodding food suppliers for how they were made. Bob's hot fudge sundae, for example, was adopted from the sundae served at C. C. Brown's Ice Cream Parlor. Wian claimed that there was nothing new at Bob's Big Boy ‚Äì excepting the double-deck Big Boy hamburger ‚Äì and that he was building Big Boy in his mind while at these previous jobs. Confident from his restaurant employment and encouraged by his father, he was already looking for a location when The Pantry was placed for sale.  Bob's Pantry  In August 1936, Wian quit his job at the Rite Spot and sold his 1933 DeSoto Roadster for $300 to make the down payment on a 10-stool hamburger stand in Glendale called The Pantry. He cleaned the place until it \\"shine[d] like a brand new penny\\", borrowed $50 from his father for meat and supplies, and reopened as Bob's Pantry. Six months later, Wian assembled his special double-decker hamburger. Created as a joke for a customer wanting something different, the novel hamburger began drawing business. The \\"snappy\\" name given to the popular sandwich provided a new name for his restaurant: Bob's Big Boy.  Bob's Big Boy  Bob Wian: 1937‚Äì1967 = Wian opened a second drive-in in Burbank in 1938, launching drive-in curb service at both locations. During World War II, Wian experienced shortages of both meat and manpower, and one of the four Bob's then in operation closed. Soon after the war ‚Äì in 1946 ‚Äì Wian formed Robert C. Wian Enterprises to assume his restaurant business. In the late 1940s, Wian licensed two operators in the East to sell his Big Boy hamburger, Frisch's Big Boy in Cincinnati and Eat'n Park Big Boy in Pittsburgh; this served Wian's goal to procure and maintain a national trademark. Note: it is a federal trademark which requires a national presence and which Wian sought. In 1951, the third licensee Alex Schoenbaum of Shoney's Big Boy sold Wian on a formal franchising system, and with the popularity of the drive-in restaurant, a series of franchising and subfranchising Big Boy followed in the 1950s. The franchisees were required to sell the Big Boy hamburger and use their own name with Big Boy, not Bob's. \\"BEEP ... BEEP ... To Bob's\\" spaceship ad in the alt= By 1951, eight Bob's Big Boys were in operation. Note: advertisement showing four restaurants in Glendale and one each in Burbank, Eagle Rock, Toluca Lake, and Van Nuys, California. The Bob's imprint of the first (1956) edition of Adventures of the Big Boy comic book lists ten locations, including one in Arizona, while a legal filing claims twelve locations. The 18th Bob's opened in 1963, and the chain's 1965 menu lists 23 California restaurants (including one opening in late 1965 and another in 1966) and six Arizona restaurants, which represented about 5% of the national Big Boy chain. Wian provided his workers health insurance and a profit-sharing plan, Note: Shows image of new McAllister designed drive in, describes Commissary, employee Pension Plan. which included the option of employees to franchise a Bob's. In 1955 the first such unit opened in Phoenix, another opened in Tucson in 1962 Alternative links: clipping 1 clipping 2 via NewspaperArchive.com. and three more locations by 1968. (By 1974 there were nine Phoenix metropolitan area Bob's, including one under construction, when the units were acquired by JB's Big Boy for $2.7 million. ) = Marriott: 1967‚Äì1987 = In 1961, a merger was briefly explored with the John R. Thompson Co., a Chicago-based restaurant operator. Five years later another merger was proposed, and in May 1967, Big Boy was sold to the Marriott Corporation. In addition to the trademark, the sale included Wian's 22 company-owned Bob's Big Boys. (Another 580 franchised Big Boy restaurants operated in 38 states nationwide. ) After the merger, Wian remained as president of Marriott's new \\"Big Boy Restaurants of America\\" division. Used to dealing with franchisees and store managers on a personal level, he became overwhelmed with the increasing size of the chain, describing it as \\"this monster I built\\". Also unhappy with Marriott's new focus on rapid growth and corporate profits, over his approach and practices, Wian became discouraged and resigned as president in May 1968. He accepted membership on Marriott's board but, his guidance never sought, Wian likewise quit that position in the summer of 1969. Although he attended the 1972 annual Big Boy Executive Conference, Wian generally avoided Bob's Big Boys and refused invitations to special events at the restaurants. He remained close friends with longtime associates at Big Boy. Marriott began rapid expansion using the Bob's name that it now owned. Note: An exception at that time was that \\"Bob's Big Boy\\" was used for Nevada and Arizona restaurants owned by JB's Big Boy. By 1971 there were 49 California Bob's, and by 1979, 132. It bought the Ken's Big Boy franchise in the Washington, DC-Baltimore metropolitan area in 1969 and JB's Big Boy's franchise in New Jersey in 1975, rebranding them as Bob's. In the mid-1970s Bob's Big Boy expanded into Alaska and Hawaii. Marriott also bought the 39-unit Manners Big Boy chain in 1974 which may have been renamed Bob's Big Boy in 1979. The 26 operating Cleveland-area restaurants were sold to and rebranded Elias Brothers Big Boy in 1985. = In 1987 Marriott sold the Big Boy trademark to Elias Brothers, the Michigan Big Boy franchisee, but retained the Bob's Big Boy name and restaurants as a franchisee. At the time, Marriott operated 208 Bob's Big Boys, including company-owned Bob's in Maryland, Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Many of these eastern Bob's were sited at rest stops on interstate toll roads, often conversions of recently purchased Howard Johnson's restaurants, while others were in territory that belonged to previous franchisees. Note: Maryland territory was once assigned to the past franchise: Ken's Big Boy. Several Bob's Big Boy restaurants, such as five in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area and two along the Ohio Turnpike were not owned by Marriott. Marriott kept its company-owned Bob's units under franchise after the sale to Elias Brothers, and the number of such Bob's increased to 238 by 1989 when Marriott decided to divest itself of its food service operations. In 1991, already having converted some San Diego stores to Allie's, named after J. Willard Marriott's wife Alice, it sold 104 California Bob's (to a company which outbid Elias Brothers) removing the units from the Bob's chain and the Big Boy system. clipping 2, clipping 3, clipping 4. Toll road Bob's Big Boys remained in service longer due to Marriott's contractual obligations, but are no longer in operation. Privately-owned Eastern U.S. Bob's were also sold. = : 2000‚Äì2018 = When Robert Liggett (i.e., Big Boy Restaurants International) bought Big Boy from the bankrupt Elias Brothers in 2000, ten western Bob's Big Boys were in operation, dropping to eight by 2006. (The last Bob's in Hawaii closed after suffering a fire in 2009.) Now limited to California, Bob's grew to 16 restaurants by 2011, but started to decline again. Although Big Boy Restaurants International expected to open 140 California units by 2018, only five Bob's Big Boy Restaurants remain, all in the Greater Los Angeles Area of Southern California. = : 2018-present = In 2018, Liggett sold the parent company which was renamed Big Boy Restaurant Group. The company franchises both Bob's Big Boy and non‚Äìbranded Big Boy restaurants. = Bob Wian started a food manufacturing company, the \\"Specialty Products Division\\" to manufacture and sell Bob's Big Boy branded salad dressings, relish, and seasoning salt. This division was purchased along with the restaurant chain by Marriott Corporation, who sold it to entrepreneur Kathy Taggares in June, 1987. She changed the name to K.T.'s Kitchens and continued manufacturing products for the restaurants and for retail stores. Taggares manufactured 10,000 gallons of salad dressing a day utilizing natural products and French cheeses. She noted that only 20% of her sales came from the 223 Big Boy restaurants open at the time. ‚ÄúI basically bought a $6-million company with $200,000 in cash,‚Äù Taggares told the Los Angeles Times in 1989.

The style's often referred to as 'Googie architecture', which originated in Southern California. The building features a curving windowed facade, expansive roof overhangs with 1950s \\"free-form\\" style of cantilevered roofs, and tall display signs. The towering Bob's sign is an integral part of the building design and its most prominent feature.\\" The styling is said to have \\"made McAllister's reputation,\\" and he is credited with creating the restaurant's circular drive-through design. The restaurant was designated a California Point of Historical Interest in 1993. McAllister worked to preserve the structure as a historic landmark (McAllister was also the architect for the original Lawry's restaurant on La Cienega Boulevard in Beverly Hills, amongst other buildings). The Riverside Drive venue was designed as a drive-in, in which car hops brought food to the cars, and now operates a drive-thru window. In 1993, the tower sign was renovated, the dining room updated and an outdoor dining area was added. Carhop service was reintroduced on weekends and a weekly classic car show's hosted in the parking lot. Bob Hope and other film personalities including Mickey Rooney, Debbie Reynolds and Jonathan Winters were once regulars at the restaurant. Hope frequented the Burbank drive-in as it afforded him privacy. The Beatles dined at the Burbank location during their 1965 U.S. tour. For many years, a plaque has described the event; the plaque has been stolen many times by fans, and replaced each time. Many restaurant regulars call this booth \\"the Beatles Booth.\\" This location was known as \\"Bob's #6\\". Glendale The original Bob's Big Boy (initially called Bob's Pantry) was the 10-stool hamburger stand in Glendale, California, which founder Bob Wian purchased in 1936 and expanded into a drive-in restaurant. It eventually outgrew itself, and was replaced by a larger Bob's restaurant similar in style to the Burbank location. The larger restaurant opened in 1956 and could accommodate 90 customers inside seated in booths and at the counter, along with a separate area to serve additional take-out patrons, while the drive-in could service 55 cars at a time. The building was designed by architects Wayne McAllister and William C. Wagner, and was one of McAllister's last designs before resigning from architecture in 1956. This location was known as \\"Bob's #1\\" and remained as a Bob's until it was closed and demolished in 1989. A second Glendale Bob's was located at the corner of West Broadway and Orange Street. It closed and a later Bob's Coffee Shop was opened about two blocks away on the ground floor of a building located at the northwest corner of East Broadway and Maryland Avenue. This location was known as \\"Bob's #4\\". Another Bob's Big Boy operated at 3212 La Crescenta Avenue in northern Glendale near the La Crescenta-Montrose community. Phoenix The first Phoenix, Arizona, Bob's Big Boy, established in 1954, was an exception to the California-based architecture. Located at Central Avenue and Thomas Road, the building employed horizontal overhanging roof lines and native stone at the entrance. Above was a large mural that resembled a Hopi sand painting of kachinas and a covered area to the east of the building for carhop service. Downey Bob's Big Boy Broiler in Downey, California, was once known as Johnie's Broiler. Also of Googie styling, the demolished structure was rebuilt based on the initial floor plan, and features carhop service, a drive-thru, and an original neon sign. It re-opened in 2009 as a Bob's Big Boy.  Nevada  In August 2020, Terrible Herbst and Big Boy Restaurant Group announced the opening of a Bob's Big Boy in Indian Springs, Nevada. Further expansion is planned with this initial restaurant projected to open in November 2020. Later architectural designs Beginning in the late 1950s, many Bob's Big Boy restaurants were designed by Armet & Davis, an architectural firm noted for its contributions to Googie architecture. The firm was hired in 1958 to produce stock plans for Bob's and various Big Boy franchises nationwide. Serious crimes The West Los Angeles location on La Cienega Blvd. was the scene of one of Los Angeles' worst crimes. On December 14, 1980, 11 people were forced into the walk-in freezer, robbed of approximately $1700 and shot, leaving three dead at the scene, another dying five months later, and four others wounded, one of whom is in mental incoherency. Carletha Stewart, a former employee, and her companions, Franklin Freeman and Ricky Sanders, were arrested in 1981, and convicted in 1982, receiving sentences ranging from death to 25 years to life. The crime motivated Jeffrey Bloom's 1986 TV movie The Right of the People which raised issues about the Second Amendment right to bear arms, right-to- carry laws, and defensive gun use. Another murder occurred at the Bob's Big Boy in the Playa del Rey neighborhood of southwestern Los Angeles. On April 30, 1990, the restaurant manager was shot dead in an attempted robbery.

It is one of the Anglo-French hound breeds which were created by crossing French scenthounds with English (Anglo) foxhounds. The name Petite V√©nerie does not mean that dogs of the breed are petite or small, but rather that it is used to hunt small game.  History and use  The Anglo-Fran√ßais de Petite V√©nerie was created from crosses of older Anglo-French hounds with Harrier (Beagle) and Poitevin, and also with the Petit Gascon-Saintongeois and the Petit bleu de Gascogne. The French hunting hounds have a very long history, with named local types being recorded in the 16th century. Unlike the larger hounds, the Anglo-Fran√ßais de Petite V√©nerie was not intended for hunting large game. It was primarily used in the Chasse- √†-Tir, where the pack (or sometimes an individual dog) circles the game animal and chases it back towards the waiting hunter. Before 1978 the breed was called the Petit Anglo-Fran√ßais, as it is the smallest of the Anglo-French hounds. The breed is recognised in its country of origin by the Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine (French Kennel Club)Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine, Anglo-Fran√ßais de Petite V√©nerie and internationally in 1983 by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in Group 6, Scenthounds. In France it is bred and kept primarily as a hunting dog, not as a pet or showdog. The breed has been exported to North America, where it is recognised by the United Kennel Club in its Scenthound Group. It is also registered by numerous minor registries and internet dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet. In Italy the breed has been used to hunt wild boar in the mountains of Liguria, giving a good account of itself.  Health and temperament  Because these are active hunting dogs that are normally kept in packs in rural areas, they may not be suitable for city or family living. No documented health problems, but the drop ears should be checked regularly, as the \\"warm moist environment under the drooping ear flap is perfect for fungal or bacterial growth.\\"Dogs, the Ultimate Care Guide, By Matthew Hoffman, pg 412, Rodale Books, 19 May 2000,  Similar names and related breeds  The name Anglo-Francais de Moyen V√©nerie is sometimes seen in North America, although no such breed is listed with the French Kennel Club or with the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale. It is listed with various minor kennel clubs in the United States, possibly through misunderstanding that the name Petite V√©nerie refers to small game, not a small dog and, when the American clubs noticed that the Petite V√©nerie was a medium- to large-sized dog, renamed it Moyen V√©nerie. Medium- to large-sized (moyen) French hounds include the Ariegeois, Beagle-Harrier, Chien d'Artois, Porcelaine, Petit Bleu de Gascogne, Petit Gascon Saintongeois, and the rough-coated Briquet Griffon Vend√©en, Griffon Bleu de Gascogne, Griffon Fauve de Bretagne, and Griffon Nivernais. Large French hounds used for hunting \\"medium-sized\\" and large game include the Billy, Chien Fran√ßais Tricolore, Chien Fran√ßais Blanc et Noir, Chien Fran√ßais Blanc et Orange, Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Tricolore, Grand Anglo- Fran√ßais Blanc et Noir, Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Blanc et Orange, Grand Bleu de Gascogne, Grand Gascon Saintongeois, Grand Griffon Vend√©en, and Poitevin.

It is situated in Salford, Greater Manchester, England. History In 1953, two bibliophiles, Eddie (Edmund) Frow and Ruth Haines, met at a Communist Party Summer School. In 1956, they set up home together and the merger of their book collections was the beginning of the Working Class Movement Library. They spent their spare time and money travelling around Britain, gathering new items for the collection. By 1960, the collection was being consulted by historians and academics, and they had attracted the support of other collectors of labour movement material. In 1964, they gained charitable trust status. By the mid 1980s, the collection had filled their semi in Trafford. Salford City Council agreed to support the library and, in 1987, gave the WCML, and the Frows, a new home in a former nurses' home, Jubilee House, situated near the University of Salford. Designed and constructed in 1897 by Henry Lord (who also built the Peel Building opposite) it was built to celebrate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. In 2007, the relationship changed when the trust took full responsibility for the housing and staffing of the collection with the council providing a lease of the building and an annual financial grant. The WCML is otherwise funded by trade union and individual subscription. Collection The focus of the collection is the history of the political, industrial, social and cultural institutions of the working classes which were created by the Industrial Revolution. The three main parts are the trade union movement, the co-operative movement and the political parties and campaigns of the left. The WCML houses 30,000 books as well as journals, newspapers, pamphlets, leaflets, banners, pottery, photographs, personal papers, archives of organisations, trade union emblems, badges and other artifacts. The library has substantial and historically significant holdings on Thomas Paine and the radical movement of the 1790s, Peterloo Massacre, Chartism, ILP and Clarion movement, the campaign for women's suffrage, the General Strike, National Unemployed Workers' Movement, International Brigades, the 1970s radical press, the Miners' Strike of 1984-85 and much else. Whilst principally concerned with Britain, the library also has a major collection on Irish history from the late 18th century onwards, derived initially from the libraries of two historians; C. Desmond Greaves and T. A. Jackson. The collection includes diverse cultural material including poetry, novels, prints, playscripts, songbooks and audio-visual material. Since 1985, the WCML has been the official archive of the GMB union. It also has a large collection of material from the engineering and the various textile unions, especially the North west regional branches. It also holds varying amounts of material from dozens of other trade unions, old and new. As well as holding local and national material from the mainstream UK co-operative movement, the WCML also holds archival material from local branches of the Co-operative guilds and periodicals of co-partnership and workers‚Äô co-operative organisations. The main political parties represented are the Labour Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain, of whom, the WCML holds large collections of pamphlets, periodicals and ephemera. Many of the smaller parties are represented by collections of similar material. Campaign groups are similarly represented, as well as collections of archive material from bodies as diverse as the National League of the Blind and Disabled, Manchester CND, Manchester Unity Theatre, Big Flame and the Jubilee Group.

Early life  Hajo Holborn was born the son of Ludwig Holborn, the German physicist and \\"Direktor der Physikalisch-Technischen Reichsanstalt,\\" and became a student of Friedrich Meinecke at Berlin University, where he achieved a doctor of philosophy in 1924. After establishing at Heidelberg in 1926 as lecturer in medieval and modern history, he became Privatdozent there until he was called back to Berlin as Carnegie Professor of History and International Relationships at the private Deutsche Hochschule f√ºr Politik.

In 1967, Holborn became the first president of the American Historical Association not born in the United States. Several specialists of German and European history in America, including Peter Gay, were students of Holborn.  Family  Like their father, Hajo Holborn's children pursued successful careers in academic scholarship. His son Fred Holborn (born 1928) was a senior adjunct professor of American Foreign Policy at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University before his death in 2005. Holborn's daughter, Hanna Holborn Gray (born 1930), is a historian of political thought in the Renaissance and Reformation. She is the Harry Pratt Judson Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago and was the University's President for 15 years.  Work  Prior to his emigration, Holborn was commissioned by the government to compose a history of the constitution of the Weimar Republic, resulting in the work \\"The Weimar Republic and the Birth of the German Democratic Party: The Hajo Holborn Papers, 1849‚Äì1956.\\" Other works by Holborn include the History of Modern Germany series, spanning three volumes and covering a four-century period from the Reformation and culminating in the capitulation of Hitler's regime in 1945.

Karpasia ( Latinized as Carpasia, and also known as Karpasion (sometimes mistaken for Karpathos), was an ancient town in Cyprus, situated in the northern shore of the Karpas Peninsula, at a distance of 3 km from the modern town of Rizokarpaso. According to tradition, it was founded by the Phoenician King Pygmalion of Tyre. It had a harbour, whose moles remain visible to this day. According to archaeological evidence, the earliest possible date for the foundation of the town is the 7th century BC. It was first mentioned in literature in 399 BC. The town was mentioned by the writers of antiquity, including Strabo. The city is also mentioned in the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, which is papyrus fragments in Greek with the history of ancient Greece.Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, ¬ß20.1- 20.5 In 306 BC, the town was the site of landing for Demetrius I of Macedon, whose forces stormed Carpasia and the neighbouring town of Urania, before proceeding to Salamis.

History The Portuguese left a legacy in Cobue, but there was still only a 5% literacy rate among black people when they left after the war of independence in 1975. After independence there was a substantial increase in secondary school enrolment but the economy remained poor, with the Portuguese pulling out their capital and their skills, and then a few years of flooding and drought. Today however the little town is mainly run by tourism from Niassa. The town of Cobue has an old ruined Roman Catholic church and school. Although the church was only built in the 1950s, it was burned down during the civil war for independence, which lasted from the early 1960s to 1974. During wartime the school served as a base for Frelimo and today there is still a danger from landmines on the grounds. A new roof was laid, and the church reopened in 2012, though structural damage and evidence of bullet holes remain. It is in use today, one of the rooms tidied with chairs neatly in a row, with table for an altar was now used for weekly mass in Cobue. The last attack on Cobue was in May 1986 during the Mozambican Civil War, when Frelimo forces occupied the coastline and came under attack from the RENAMO, of the Mozambique National Resistance Organisation, a military unit of dissident Mozambican soldiers controlled by the Rhodesian army. On a day that the Frelimo were celebrating a wedding, Renamo forces attacked Cobu√© and killed many people. The Renamo rebels had a reputation for violence, and schools and hospitals were razed and some educated professionals in the town such as teachers and doctors were executed and were victim to savage acts. Manda Wilderness Reserve Nearby Cobue is the Manda Wilderness Reserve, a conservation area alongside Lake Niassa which is privately funded by the nearby Nkwichi Lodge and the Government of Sweden who has interests in the area which whilst opening up the area to tourists, they work at promoting sustainable development in the area, The reserve has a notable population of birds, ranging from Ospreys, palm nut vultures to owls and eagles. The reserve has a dhow named Miss Nkwichi operated by the Nkwichi Lodge which offers trips out onto Lake Niassa.

The UAE Ministry of Education is responsible for public schools in Dubai. Currently, more than 90% of school education in Dubai takes place in the private sector, served by 194 private schools offering 17 different curricula to more than 280,000 students from 182 nationalities. Dubai has 26 international branch campuses of universities from 12 different countries - including the UK, Australia and India. More than 30,000 students attend these universities, with the majority studying business, engineering and media & design. The Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) was founded in 2006 to develop education and human resource sectors in Dubai, and license educational institutes.  Public Schooling  Public schools are all gender segregated. Primary and secondary education is free of cost for all Emiratis and compulsory for boys and girls at the all grades. The medium of instruction in public schools is English, with the exceptions of Islamic Studies and Arabic, where Arabic is the medium of instruction.  Private Schooling  As of 2017, there are 194 private schools in Dubai that offer one of the following curricula (arranged by number of schools following curriculum): British, Indian, American, the UAE Ministry of Education Curriculum, International Baccalaureate, Iranian, French, Filipino, Pakistani, SABIS, IAT, German, Russian, Japanese, and Canadian. In total, 273,599 students from 187 different nationalities were enrolled in private schools in the 2016/17 academic year. This is heavily weighted towards younger year groups with 42% in primary education, 25% in secondary, 15% in tertiary, and 18% in kindergarten. The British and Indian curricula alone account for 64% of all enrollment in Dubai-based private schools. Tuition at these private schools range from AED 1,725 to AED 107,200 per year, and Dubai's annual revenue from private schooling fees is AED 5.35bn. 39% of students pay less than AED 10,000 in tuition per year. There is some correlation between fees and the rating of the school, and this has strengthened with the KHDA ruling on school fees that allows top rated Outstanding schools to put up fees at a higher percentage than those rated more poorly. A list of the highest rated schools in Dubai with fees may be found here. Schools in the UAE teach in English. All students take Arabic classes, either as a primary or secondary language. Muslim and Arab students must also take Islamic studies.  Primary education  Primary education is compulsory from the age of 5 by the Ministry of Education in the UAE. Most schools offers both primary and secondary instruction so students do not need to transfer to a separate school location upon graduating from primary school. American curriculum runs from Kindergarten (5 years old) to Grade 8 (14 years old). British curriculum runs from Year 1 (4‚Äì5 years old) to Year 9 (14 years old). International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme is for ages 3‚Äì12.  Secondary education  Secondary school is from grades 6 to 9. Most of the secondary schools require students to take standardized tests such as Advanced Placement, SAT, IB Diploma, IGCSE, GCE Advanced level or CBSE. Other options include vocational education PEARSON BTEC level 2 Diplomas and Level 3 Extended Diplomas. A new curriculum being offered is the IB Career-related Programme which can include a BTEC and is offered at 6 schools in UAE.  Training Centers in Dubai  Nothing less than half of all training centers and specialized postgraduate education institutes in the UAE is located in Dubai, the largest and most populous city of the country. They provide training options for students of all ages on various programs. Training centers that offer courses in commerce and management (e.g. Atton Institute ) aviation and air transport (e.g. Aviation Training Center ), medicine (e.g. Prime Medical Training Center ) are much sought after, health and safety training centers (e.g. Arbrit Safety Training and Consultancy ), as well as Arabic language courses for expatriates ), and English courses preparing their participants for IELTS or TOEFL (e.g. Express English language training center ). In the main, learning at such centers is arranged in the form of short (3-5 days) intensive courses and training. Some training centers offer in-house training for corporate clients. Dubai also often hosts thematic seminars, conferences and even Expo 2020 is to take place here. The work of professional training centers in Dubai is regulated by the local authority, Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA). Each company that intends to perform vocational training in the territory of the Emirate of Dubai must obtain a license from KHDA. All necessary information about the training center (phone, email, address, etc.) is available the KHDA website. Here is what the training center‚Äôs page looks like. Many of the training centers are located in the specialized free economic zones of the Dubai Academic City and Dubai Knowledge Village. Option Training Institute and Learnovate training center offers exquisite guidance and tutoring programs for various university entrance exams. These programs trailblazing study tools and very intensive skill building strategies for each component of the GMAT, GRE, SAT, TOEFL, IELTS, ACT, AP, Subject SAT, UCAT and LNAT exams.  Tertiary education  A sizable number of foreign accredited universities have been set up in Dubai. Most of their campuses are located at Dubai International Academic City, a purpose built free zone for tertiary academic institutions. The Harvard Medical School Dubai Center (HMSDC) Institute for Postgraduate Education and Research has been established as well in Dubai Health Care City. The RIT Dubai campus is located in Dubai Silicon Oasis. In 2010, Michigan State University Dubai closed all undergraduate programs.

Song information The song is narrated by a woman who suffers from depression in late August of each year. It is then revealed the cause of her depression; the following day (August 23, hence the title) is the twentieth birthday of her rebellious teenage daughter who she has not seen for years. She longs to kiss and embrace her daughter, but she is certain that it will not happen. The daughter has, presumably, run away from home because of her indifference towards her mother. Curiously, August 23 is the date of Toller's birthday. This song may refer to Paula‚Äôs personal story as her mother has abandoned her when she was 5 years old. The music was written by Paula on her 25‚Äô birthday. The song starts with the phrase ‚Äú20 years ago you‚Äôre born‚Äù, meaning in reality the anniversary of the detachment of her mother from her family, as her mother had ‚Äúreborn‚Äù. In the song, Paula induces that she has an old photo from her mother and says that now she had grown up she hasn‚Äôt many similarities with her. It is likely that her mother suffered of depression and that she showed a unhappy face in the photo mentioned, as the following lyrics says ‚Äúyour sad mien feeds my pain‚Äù. Her mother also may have looked posh as it is mentioned in the following sentence ‚Äúyour princess‚Äô attitude, where have you got it from?‚Äù Therefore the song may be a subtle message, a sad outburst from an internal child longing contact to her lost mother, as a present for her birthday - ‚Äútomorrow is 23 (August), 8 days to the end of the month. So long I haven‚Äôt seen you, I would like to have your kiss one more time‚Äù. Grammar inaccuracy The title of the song is inaccurate according to the prescriptive grammar for Portuguese. Accordingly, the verb should have been used in its plural form (amanh√£ s√£o 23) or in its singular form but preceded by the explicit object (amanh√£ √© dia 23).Ferreira, Mauro. Aprender e Praticar Gram√°tica. pg. 538. S√£o Paulo: FTD, 2003. The composers, however, must have been aware of this and decided to use this sentence on the song because it is widely used in casual language.

His dedication to making religious books available to fellow Catholics suffering under the English Penal Laws came at great personal cost. He is best remembered for publishing an edition of the Douay Bible with extended commentary, compiled chiefly by his brother George Leo Haydock. Originally published in 1811 and still in print, it is one of the most enduring contributions to Catholic biblical studies. Family background Haydock was born on 21 February 1772 in Cottam, Preston, Lancashire in northern England. The Haydock family's prominence in British history antedates Henry VIII's split with Rome as established by the service in Parliament of Christopher Haydock (1499?-1566?). Although most prominent British families embraced the new Protestant religion, many Haydock descendants would rank among the most vocal and influential of those who remained faithful to Catholicism. The Lancashire area especially was slow to relinquish its Faith. Speaking of Lancashire, Lord Burghley, advisor to Queen Elizabeth I complained, The Papists every where are growen so confident, that they contempne Magistrats and their authoritie. In later centuries Lancashire would retain a small but determined Catholic population supported by families of the landed gentry, sometimes hosting secret Masses in their homes. The Haydocks were among the most prominent of these families and became legendary in their service to the Catholic Recusant movement. During the Elizabethan persecution, Father George Haydock (1556‚Äì1584), a \\"seminary priest\\", suffered martyrdom. He was beatified in 1987, earning the title ‚ÄúBlessed.‚Äù Early in the 18th century, Father Cuthbert Haydock (1684‚Äì1763) said secret Masses in a chapel hidden in the attic of Lane End House, Mawdesley, the home of his sister and brother-in-law. Thomas Haydock was part of a unique generation whose combined contributions to this family tradition would be extraordinary. His father was a namesake of Blessed George Haydock. His two brothers both became priests. Older brother James Haydock (1765‚Äì1809) died caring for the sick of his congregation during a typhus epidemic. Younger brother George Leo (1774‚Äì1849), in addition to his work on the Bible, spent his career pastoring poor rural missions. A sister, Margaret Haydock (1767? - 1854), joined the Augustinian nuns, taking the name Sister Stanislaus. Attempts to become a priest After receiving his elementary education at a school established for Catholic students at Mowbreck Hall, Thomas was sent in 1785 to the English College, Douai, France, where he joined his brother, George. This institution was established for Catholic exiles in the 16th century to provide secondary education and preparation for the priesthood. His studies were interrupted in 1793, when the French revolutionary government declared war with England, closed the English College, and imprisoned some of its pro-England students. Both Haydock brothers managed to elude the authorities and escape back to England. Continuing his pursuit of ordination, Thomas next went to the English College, Lisbon. His superiors there did not feel he had a priestly vocation and sent him home in 1795. Undeterred, he went to the new seminary established at Crook Hall, Durham with his brother George in 1796. Again, his vocation was questioned. Described as ‚Äúeasy going‚Äù (see also the ‚ÄúTragic Personal Life‚Äù section below), he seems to have been judged by his superiors as constitutionally unsuited for the risks and hardships of the Catholic priesthood in Penal Period England. The eloquence and dedication Thomas expresses in his letters certainly support his sincerity; and his three attempts at the priesthood show his tenacity. However, against the wishes of his older and recently ordained brother James, he was finally persuaded to leave the seminary. Family friend and former Douay professor Benedict Rayment (1764‚Äì1842), who would later serve as editor of some of Haydock's published works, remarked that of the three Haydock brothers seeking the priesthood, ‚Äò‚ÄôThomas would have been the best‚Äô‚Äô. Catholic Publisher An 1806 Advertisement for Thomas Haydock, Publisher Haydock moved to Manchester to begin his secular career. He opened a language school that proved successful. However, his love of literature drew him to publishing. Despite the Penal Laws it was possible by Haydock‚Äôs time for Catholic publishers to work openly in England. In addition, the market for Catholic works was improving in the Manchester area. Expanded local commercial dealings required a more literate population, which included many Catholics. A local pastor, Rev. Rowland Broomhead (1787-1820) was placing a strong emphasis on religious instruction, requiring a supply of Haydock‚Äôs books and pamphlets. Encouraged by his elder brother James, he began his publishing career in 1799 with a new edition of The Garden of the Soul, a popular prayer book by Richard Challoner (1691‚Äì1781), and Letter on Papal Supremacy to the Rev. Geo. Bruning (author not stated). A recent study documents 74 books showing Haydock's name as printer, publisher, or bookseller on the title page by 1831. Contemporary advertisements indicate other works whose actual publication cannot be verified. Since many of Haydock‚Äôs books were small and cheaply bound, some may not have survived and now be lost to history. Haydock‚Äôs works were mostly devotional, e.g., The Imitation of Christ (1800), A Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs (1807), and Pious Reflections for Every Day in the Month (1811). Haydock sometimes collaborated with former Douay associates. In one case Father Thomas Penswick (1772‚Äì1836), a former classmate, translated The Love of Jesus in the Adorable Sacrament of the Altar (1801) from the French of Henry-Mary Boudon. (Ironically, Penswick, who later became Vicar Apostolic of the Northern District, would have a disagreement with Thomas‚Äô brother George, resulting in the latter's temporary suspension from his priestly functions.) Haydock also published controversial works such as The Biblicals Routed! or, the Able and Spirited Defence of the Roman Catholic Religion, by Patrick Spence (1827), and a work of poetry, The Nymphs of Drumkerin; or, Love and Scalteen!! A Humerous Poem by H. I. Comus, (1827). Page from Thomas Haydock's Divine Office, 1806 One of Haydock's more notable works appeared in 1806. Entitled The Divine Office for the Use of the Laity, it appeared in two small volumes and was edited by Father Benedict Rayment q.v.. This work includes the Ordinary of the Mass and the daily Propers in parallel Latin and English columns. Maintaining national loyalty in the face of persecution, the Ordinary of the Mass in Haydock's edition dutifully calls for the officiating priest to say after the Last Gospel, Lord, save George our King. This is a reference to George III, ironically an opponent of ongoing efforts to liberalize the Penal Laws. The Haydock Bible The 1806 Divine Office cited above carries the following announcement of what would become Haydock's most important work: The Doway Bible and Rhemes Testament, with numerous notes, are now under correction, and will be put to press early in September, 1807. The Doway or Douay Bible (Douay-Rheims Bible) was the standard translation for English speaking Catholics. It was originally translated from the Latin Vulgate in the 16th century chiefly by Gregory Martin, one of the first professors at the English Catholic College affiliated to the university of Douai. It was revised and newly annotated in the 18th century by Richard Challoner q.v., a scholar from university of Douai. Shortly after Challoner's death, Father Bernard MacMahon (1736?-1816) published further revisions of the Douay-Rheims Bible. A large new edition of the Bible complete with an extended commentary seems a daunting project for a publisher of Haydock's limited means. He may have been encouraged by the success of a similar Protestant effort: the self- interpreting Bible of John Brown (Theologian, 1722‚Äì1787), first published in 1778 and frequently reprinted. The contemporary controversy swirling around efforts to repeal the Penal Laws and the place of Biblical exegetics in that controversy were certainly major encouraging factors for the proposed new Bible. In any case, Haydock's great enthusiasm for the Catholic cause was sufficient to overcome all obstacles. Haydock's old friend Father Benedict Rayment at first offered to compile the commentary for the new Bible, but soon withdrew. Haydock then enlisted his brother George, by now ordained and a pastor of the mission at Ugthorpe, for the project. Father Haydock used the standard Challoner-MacMahon text. His extended commentary was partly original and partly compiled from writings during the Patristic and later eras. Catholics believed the Bible, properly interpreted by the Church, could be used to combat Protestant attempts to dismantle the authority of Rome. As Father Haydock states in his Preface: To obviate the misinterpretations of the many heretical works which disgrace the Scripture, and deluge this unhappy country, has been one main design of the present undertaking. Publisher's Imprint: First edition of the Haydock Bible,1811 Production of the Bible would be delayed well beyond the original 1807 projected date. Thomas went to Dublin to settle some business affairs and to open a new establishment. He did not return to Manchester until 1810. In a peculiar turn of events, a competing Catholic Manchester publisher, Oswald Syers, had begun publishing his own Douay Bible in March 1811. Embarrassed by his delay, Haydock had to move quickly to begin his own edition four months later. Syers finished his edition first, by 1813. However, Haydock's more impressive edition, completed in 1814, quickly overtook it in popularity. Engraving Detail: First Edition of the Haydock Bible As were many editions of the Bible at the time, Haydock's was published and sold by subscription, a few leaves at a time, in fortnightly ‚Äúnumbers.‚Äù Subscribers would accumulate the numbers and ultimately have the completed Bible bound. As the Bible progressed, new general title pages were issued in 1811, 1812,1813, and 1823, showing variously Thomas Haydock's Manchester or Dublin locations. Most copies of the complete Bible would include leaves published from both locations. For his brother George, annotating the entire Bible under a demanding production schedule while continuing his pastoral duties at Ugthorpe proved too great a task. Therefore, ca. March, 1812, Father Rayment was again called on, and this time persuaded, to assist. He compiled the New Testament portion of the commentary with the assistance of colleagues. Pressure to meet deadlines was the likely cause of some errors. However, given Haydock's limited resources, his Bible must be considered a remarkable achievement. It was produced in impressive large folio with full page plates, and dedicated To that enlightened body of men, the Catholics of the United Kingdoms of England, Ireland and Scotland, in admiration of the steady zeal with which they have kept the deposit of faith bequeathed them by their forefathers, and handed down, without interruption or adulteration to their grateful posterity. The Bible received an enthusiastic welcome from English and Irish Catholics. At least 1,500 copies of the first edition were sold. Haydock's folio Bible would continue in circulation until at least 1823, with a separate New Testament appearing in 1831. Personal life Thomas Haydock had an enthusiasm for publishing, but was seriously lacking in business skills. He had a trustful nature that associates freely exploited, depriving him of profit and forcing him continually to operate on a shoestring. Although his Bible sold well, he lost money to his managers, clerks, and canvassers and was forced heavily into debt to an unscrupulous lender. Former Douay classmate Father (later Bishop) Robert Gradwell (1777‚Äì1860) wrote in August 1817 that Haydock was living in Dublin, ‚Äúlow in the world.‚Äù In 1818 he was arrested for debt and served four months in prison. The experience did not discourage him from continuing his publishing business. By 1822 he was able to issue the first volume of a new edition of the Bible, a more modest undertaking this time, in a smaller octavo format and without the extended commentary of the folio edition. He had to take on several partners to complete the Bible's second volume in 1824. This edition had many misprints, including the notable substitution of fornications for fortifications in II Corinthians 10:4. He had no known involvement with an American folio edition of the Haydock Bible published in Philadelphia in 1825. Circa 1818 Haydock married Mary Lynch or Lynde of Dublin. Unfortunately, tragedy would dog his family life, just as it did his business. Mary died in 1823. Their three children all died young. The name of only one is known: George (1822‚Äì1840). Curiously, some books dated 1827 have the imprint, Thomas Haydock & Son. The apparent inconsistency between the publication date and the likely ages of any sons that could have been living at the time is a mystery. Memorial Monument to Thomas Haydock dedicated May 15, 2016 at St. Mary's Newhouse Church, Newsham, Lancashire. Haydock struggled on with publishing at least until 1831, when he was able to reissue the New Testament portion of his original folio Bible. No dated works after that year are known, although he published undated works that may have appeared later. In 1832 he made an unsuccessful attempt to begin a journal called The Catholic Penny Magazine. At some point, he opened a school in Dublin where he resumed teaching until 1840. He left Dublin probably about that year and moved first to Liverpool, then to Preston. He could only watch as other publishers enjoyed success with new editions of his Bible: two British editions, one in 1845-48, another ca. 1853, and an American edition in 1852-4. He died at Preston in 1859, aged 87, with an estate valued at ‚Äúless than 100 Pounds Sterling.‚Äù He was buried in the Haydock family plot at St. Mary's Church, Newsham. Haydock‚Äôs Enduring Legacy ca. 1853: Example of the Haydock Bible Edition Used in the Kennedy Inaugural Even with his unflagging optimism, Haydock probably could never have imagined the long-term success the Bible he had first published would achieve. After his death, new editions continued to appear on both sides of the Atlantic, keeping it in print until at least 1910. In 1961, the 150th anniversary of Haydock's first edition, the first Catholic President of the United States, John F. Kennedy (1917‚Äì1963) would take his inaugural oath of office on a copy of a Haydock Bible owned by his mother's family, the Fitzgeralds. Late in the 20th century, a new series of editions began to appear, prompted by the interest of traditionalist Catholics. They became concerned that modern Catholic exegesis is diluting the Faith that the Haydock family and the Catholic Recusant movement fought so hard to preserve and to hand down without interruption or adulteration to their grateful posterity. The Haydock Bible has reached its bicentennial anniversary in 2011 not only still in print, but also quite at home in the digital age, appearing on CDs and on-line (see link below). For a detailed history of the many editions of the Haydock Bible and the changes that were made to it over the years, see the related article, George Leo Haydock.

Biography  He was born in 1930 in Agrinio where he lived until he became 18 years old. His family was descended from Samos. His parents met each other in Smyrna (now Izmir, Turkey), shortly before the Asia Minor Catastrophe. The Asia Minor Catastrophe influenced his work later in his life (in 1972, he co-wrote the song Mikra Asia (ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒ¨ ŒëœÉŒØŒ± \\"Asia Minor\\") along with Apostolos Kaldaras). In 1940 (during the outbreak of World War II), Pythagoras started attending high school at Agrinio All-male High school. During the German occupation of Greece, he was hiding in Valtos. In 1944, he joined ELAS. He graduated from high school after the end of the war. In 1945, he moved to Athens. He attended the Drama School of the Athens Conservatory, where he was a student of Dimitris Rontiris. He later worked for sometime in theatre, and later, in 1958, he became a playwright. In 1973, he became an irregular member of the Greek Playwrights Club. In 1974, he became an associate member and, in 1975, a regular member of that club. He had been using the mononym \\"Pythagoras\\" since his high school years.Angelos Axiotis Pythagoras: 30 chorinia tragoudia (Œ†œÖŒ∏Œ±Œ≥œåœÅŒ±œÇ: 30 œáœÅœåŒΩŒπŒ± œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥ŒπŒ± \\"Pythagoras: 30 Years of Music\\".

Lindau belongs to the Gemeinde (municipality) of Katlenburg-Lindau and to the Landkreis (district) of Northeim. The village is known to many space physicists and radio engineers around the world, as the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (known as \\"Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy\\" until June 2004) was based there until 2014, when it moved to G√∂ttingen, also in Lower Saxony.'Neubau' on MPS website, viewed 2014-07-09 Geography Lindau lies on an area of level farmland between the Oder and Rhume rivers. History Lindau was mentioned in writing for the first time in 1184. Around 1322 Otto II of Woldenberg, bishop of Hildesheim, established the Muthaus, today the oldest building of the municipality of Gemeinde Katlenburg-Lindau, and in which the Lindau administration was accommodated until 1741. In the 19th Century Lindau's economy grew with a jute spinning mill set up by the Greve company (1872) and the brewery. The fire of Easter 1911 In the afternoon of 15 April 1911, Easter Sunday, Lindau experienced its largest and most devastating fire. In a farmyard in the Unterflecken area of the village, two boys had made a fire. Since it was very windy, the fire spread to the farm buildings and those of a bricklayer. Primitive fire fighting equipment and the distance from the local river led to the entire Unterflecken being burnt. Sparks ignited other houses and stored chemicals exploded. 42 houses and 30 auxiliary buildings were destroyed and many were never rebuilt. In the village marketplace the Mariendenkmal monument was erected. In the same year, a local volunteer fire brigade was established. Weimar Republic (1918-1933) Lindau's predominantly catholic population influenced the village's voting pattern . (A census from the year 1934 indicated there were 1487 inhabitants, of whom 85.5% were Catholic, only 14.5% Lutheran while no Jewish inhabitants were recorded.) The Zentrumspartei centrist party, abbreviated 'Zentrum', held a special supremacy in the district during the period of the Weimar Republic. In 1920 Zentrum gained 69.8% of Lindau's Reichstag votes. This high vote was maintained through all the years of the Weimar Republic until 1932, when with the last free elections this party still gained 60.8% of the vote while in many other places the Nazi Party had long been the strongest political power. The Nazis recorded just two votes (0.3%) for the first time in 1928 and were insignificant at first in subsequent years. In November 1932 the Nazis were no longer to be ignored, at 21.9% the second strongest party in Lindau after the Zentrum. A local Nazi group formed in 1930 (the district's first had been formed in 1925 in Duderstadt). The last months of the Weimar Republic were shaped by violent political arguments in Lindau, with many party meetings and banners in the village. A news item from this time reports that a Lindau SA member was hurt ‚Äúby a political opponent, with a key, on the head.‚Äù Lindau during national socialism (1933-1945) No documents remain from the March 1933 elections, but it is assumed that Lindau voted along customary lines. At first the Lindau population remained sceptically opposed to the new ruling powers. However, the concordat between the German Reich and the Vatican encouraged many Catholic voters. Gradually national socialism became acceptable among them. In May 1933 the first Nazi mayor was appointed. The municipality had no more influence on policy. The new ruling powers determined everything. In November of the same year Reichstag elections took place. However it was only possible to vote 'yes' or 'no'. With these elections 910 Lindauers voted for the Nazis: 98%. Only 19 voters (approx 2%) were either invalid or 'no' votes. Job creation measures led to new roads and more people. Among other things in 1938 the market place was paved and was used as a stage for many political demonstrations. The economy flourished, the Greve string factory for example got many orders from the armed forces during preparations for the Second World War. Second World War (1939-1945) An early influence of the outbreak of World War II was the arrival of women and children from large cities of the Saarland in December 1939. During the war many prisoners of war came to Lindau, among others Frenchmen and Poles, who were used in agriculture. In 1945 a group of Canadian airmen crashed. The Second World War cost 111 Lindau soldiers' lives, nearly twice as high as the casualties in the First World War of 1914-1918. The post-war period (1945-1949) One of the first steps after the end of the war was the release of prisoners of war. In June 1945 approximately 200 British personnel were deployed in Lindau after the Americans had left and they remained until 1946. Gradually life in Lindau began to normalise. On 3 June a new kindergarten was inaugurated and on 5 June the public library, after all National Socialist material had been removed, opened in the parsonage building. The school suffered from a shortage of teachers and textbooks \\"For learning books the school children possess nothing except for a Bible, Catechism and maybe a reader,\\" wrote a teacher at that time. Between the English occupiers and the Lindau population there existed a good relationship. The British held friendly matches with the FC Lindau soccer club. After the war a research institute relocated to Lindau, where buildings of the Technical University of Hannover already existed. The convoy arrived on the 2nd and 3 March 1946. This was to become the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research. On 16 March 1946 the village school converted back into a catholic school after 88% of parents voted for this. However the Protestant children got their own religious education. The high number of refugees from the large cities was problematic. Food, accommodation and work were scarce. The number of refugees constantly increased, bringing the population to 2400. All houses were heavily occupied, and the relationship between Lindauers and refugees was not always good. Between 1946 and 1948 the Fleckenstra√üe road was paved, and the church tower was repaired in 1948. Development from 1949 until today The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research became a significant component of the village, attracting many international visitors After the Second World War Lindau developed to the north and the entire infrastructure was improved. In 1957 the village got a multipurpose hall, (reconditioned in 2006). A new elementary school was established in 1965 which serves today as a Hauptschule and Realschule. A new kindergarten was built in 1969. Lindau got its own sports field, and a new fire station was built in 1971 as well as asphalted roads equipped with modern lighting. In 1969 Lindau joined the Rhumetal district drainage project, completed in 1976. On 1 January 1973 as part of administrative reform of Lower Saxony the district of Duderstadt was dissolved, from which Lindau was placed in Landkreis Northeim (district). Lindau also lost the status of a municipality as together with six other villages the united municipality Gemeinde Katlenburg-Lindau was created. Lindau had become part of a predominantly Lutheran area and it is reported that the bell was tolled at the (catholic) village church. In 1983 Lindau joined a natural gas network while the Peter und Paul Kirche catholic church was renovated during a seven-year closure. The mill stream created in 1872 by the company Greve for water power at the oast house was filled in 1984. In 1985 Lindau opened a large sportsground with a grandstand for 250 spectators. In 1987 the district of Northeim built a \\"center for innovation\\" next to the Max Planck Institute, to offer production facilities for high tech companies. In the years 1946, 1947, 1981 and 1994 Lindau was afflicted by heavy flooding of the Rhume, which caused severe damage. The flood dam built in 1995 has so far prevented similar events. In 2014, the Max Planck Institute relocated to G√∂ttingen. Aircraft crash over Lindau On 29 October 1979 just after 5pm a US Grumman OV-1 Mohawk reconnaissance aircraft crashed near highway 247 to Bilshausen and set a stable on fire. Both pilots ejected safely after diverting the aircraft from densely populated parts of Lindau.

The album was seen as a departure from their previous effort Holes in the Wall (DB Records, 2002) and paved the way for their third full-length LP, No Need To Be Down-Hearted. Critical reception The American Adventure received mixed reviews upon release. Jack Rabid of Allmusic noted a distinct change of sound from that of the band's debut album, Holes in the Wall, but it was a change that he felt worked to good effect; \\"They abandon any semblance of their first LP's clockwork consistency for a bumpy ride of an LP that shifts gears from song to song, or mid-song abruptly but successfully throughout\\". He went on to draw comparisons with the baroque music of The Beach Boys and \\"'70s Pink Floyd comfortable numbness\\". Andrew McGregor writing for the BBC praised the uniqueness of The Electric Soft Parade sound, but found fault with the album's lyrical content; \\"there's surely no need to adopt their 'stating-the-bleeding- obvious in a Moon/June/Balloon stylee' approach. \\"Existing is easy, living is hard\\" from the otherwise fine closing track \\"Exist\\" is a clich√© too far, with unfortunate echoes of \\"Why\\" by Annie Lennox.\\" In her review for RT√â, Anne- Louise Foley labelled the album \\"dull\\", stating that it is \\"nowhere as interesting as it thinks it is\\" and singling out \\"The American Adventure\\" as the main offender in her 2-star review; \\"[t]he White brothers shoot themselves in the foot with the overblown prog monstrosity that is the title track. Long and meandering (though it does manage to escape from the sound swamp near the end), it's the kind of song that only a mother or devout PR man could love.\\" Despite her reservations about the album as a whole, she found merit in the LP's second single, \\"Lose Yr Frown\\", declaring it \\"the best thing on offer, with a catchy chorus that trips off Alex's guitar with an upbeat ease. It's what the young band do best and they should remember this\\". Stylus Magazine's Kilian Murphy thought that The American Adventure was despondently disappointing overall, citing \\"time spent on the road plugging their debut long-player\\" as the over-riding factor which had \\"caused the Parade to lose some of their fizz\\", but he also felt that the album also had its good points, too; \\"Thankfully, not everything on the American Adventure suffers from such despondency. Opening track \\"Things I've Done Before\\" may not let much lyrical light in (...), but it's equipped with a killer riff and a sense of momentum that is lost later in the album (...) while \\"Bruxellisation\\" is a rich, heartbreaking ballad in the Doves mould.\\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian declared the album musically \\"adventurous\\" in her complimentary review, and, although the songwriting lacked uniformity, the album was a success; Josh Rogan, writing for Yahoo! Music, described The American Adventure as \\"a roller coaster ride well worth taking\\" that had \\"clearly been lovingly constructed and largely well executed\\" with \\"a strong sense of focus and quality control\\".

He was a member of the team that played Derbyshire's first match in May 1871. Hickton was born in Hardstoft, Derbyshire. He first played for the Salford-based Broughton club in 1867 and began his first-class career for Lancashire in the same year. In a match against MCC at Lords, which was so badly interrupted by the weather, that mops and pails were used clear water off the pitch, Hickton took 5 for 69 and 6 for 22. He continued to play in county matches between Lancashire and the small number of registered county sides at the time. In his time as a bowler at Lancashire, he took 144 wickets for 2022 runs, and in 1870 he achieved a clean sweep of 10-46 in a match against Hampshire. In 1871 Hickton decided to move to Derbyshire and join the newly established Derbyshire County Cricket Club in their opening season in a bowling line-up that included Dove Gregory and John Platts. Hickton's first match for Derbyshire, the first County Match played by the team, was against his old team Lancashire. Hickton made a good account of himself, taking four wickets in the first innings of the match. Hickton played in both matches against Lancashire in the 1872 season, whereas a good score in his one match against lancashire in the 1873 season put him top of the batting averages. In the 1874 season he played only two matches but took 17 wickets with 6-15 against Kent and 6-63 against Lancashire. In the 1875 season, he played six of the seven matches and took 32 wickets with 5-38 against United North of England. In the 1876 season he played four of seven matches but took eleven wickets of his twenty-two wickets in one match against Kent with 5-52 and 6-41. He played in all matches with the team in the 1877 season, when he took 40 wickets with 5-37 against Lancashire, 6-47 against Kent and 5-44 against Hampshire. As with earlier seasons, Hickton was kept of the top bowler spot by William Mycroft. Hickton managed just eleven wickets in eleven matches in the 1878 season and retired from first-class cricket. He continued his association with Broughton until 1897. Hickton's benefit match took place on 20 July 1883 between Lancashire and eighteen of the Broughton Club. Hickton was a right-arm round-arm fast bowler and took 284 first-class wickets at an average of 14.15 and a best performance of 10-46. He was a lower-order right-handed batsman and played 103 innings in 60 matches with a top score of 63 and an average of 12.25. He was also a deft slip fielder.William Hickton at Cricket Archive Hickton died at Lower Broughton, Salford, at the age of 58.

He served as the first President of both the University of Missouri and the University of Wisconsin as well as president of Indiana University. Early life John Lathrop was born in Sherburne, New York in 1799. He attended Yale University, graduating in 1819 and teaching for three years at Farmington, Connecticut. He later became a tutor at his alma mater from 1822 until 1826 when he was admitted to the bar and practiced at Middletown, Connecticut. He also spent some time teaching in Norwich, Vermont and Gardiner, Maine. In 1829 he became professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York. He was married to Frances E. student of Sarah Pierce's Litchfield Female Academy. Her mother was a sister to Harvard University president John Thornton Kirkland and daughter of Samuel Kirkland, founder of Hamilton College. His son is Gardiner Lathrop who was founder of the Kansas City law firm Lathrop & Gage. Academic career=First term at the University of Missouri The University of Missouri was founded in 1839 as the first public or state university west of the Mississippi River. Professor Lathrop was chosen as its first president in 1840, a position he held until 1849. He is credited with laying the foundations for the university's first century. University of Wisconsin In 1849, Lathrop was elected the first chancellor of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. During his tenure as chancellor, he established the academic setting at the university, and he recommended the university's seal and motto, \\"Numen Lumen.\\" He was nominated for the position of first President of the University of Michigan in 1852 after Henry Barnard declined the job, but Henry Philip Tappan was elected instead. He resigned in 1858 due to problems with the regents and legislature, but remained the acting chancellor until Henry Barnard officially became the chancellor in 1859. Indiana University Upon the death of Indiana University's first president Andrew Wylie in 1851, the Board of Trustees sought Lathrop as his replacement. Elsewhere occupied, he declined. Upon the abrupt departure of President William Mitchel Daily in 1859, the Indiana University Board of Trustees once again sought to fill the office with Lathrop. This time, he accepted, and took office on September 20, 1859. His inauguration took place July 11, 1860 and directly thereafter he submitted his resignation to the Board. Second term at the University of Missouri After resigning the presidency of Indiana University in 1859 after only one year, he returned to the University of Missouri as a professor of English literature. He was re- elected president in 1865, the only president ever to hold two separate terms, and held that office until his death in Columbia, Missouri in 1866.

Tristania conferta), is an evergreen tree native to Australia, though it is cultivated in the United States and elsewhere. Common names include brush box, Queensland box, Brisbane box, pink box, box scrub, and vinegartree. Its natural range in Australia is north-east New South Wales and coastal Queensland but it is commonly used as a street tree in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and other cities in eastern Australia. Description In the wild its habitat ranges from moist open forest and rainforest ecotones, where it might reach heights of 40 metres or more, to coastal headlands where it acquires a stunted, wind-sheared habit. Dome-like in shape, it has a denser foliage with dark green, leathery leaves and hence provides more shade than eucalyptus trees. Moreover, it is considered safer than eucalypts because it rarely sheds limbs. Habitat It is considered useful as a street tree, due to its disease and pest resilience, its high tolerance for smog, drought and poor drainage, and the fact that it needs only moderate-to-light upkeep.Friends of the Urban Forest http://www.fuf.net/tree/brisbane-box/ It often requires lopping to accommodate overhead power lines, but survives pruning quite well.Shire of Yarra Ranges, Streetscape Strategy In form it is used as a replacement for the weedy Camphor Laurel (Cinnamomum camphora) while having a low potential for being weedy itself. The tree is one of the hardiest and most successful street trees within wider Sydney and elsewhere. Taxonomy The species was formally described in 1812 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown, based on plant material collected from the Hunter River region in New South Wales. Brown named the species Tristania confertia. The species was transferred to the genus Lophostemon in 1982.

They originate from pioneer neurons, and have the main function of laying down the initial growing path that subsequent growing axons, dubbed follower axons, from other neurons will eventually follow. Several theories relating to the structure and function of pioneer axons are currently being explored. The first theory is that pioneer axons are specialized structures, and that they play a crucial role in guiding follower axons. The second is that pioneer axons are no different from follower axons, and that they play no role in guiding follower axons. Anatomically, there are no differences between pioneer and follower axons, although there are morphological differences. The mechanisms of pioneer axons and their role in axon guidance is currently being explored. In addition, many studies are being conducted in model organisms, such grasshoppers, zebrafish, and fruit flies to study the effects of manipulations of pioneer axons on neuronal development.  History  Santiago Ramon y Cajal, considered the father of modern neuroscience, was one of the first to physically observe growing axons. Moreover, he observed that axons grew in a structured, guided manner. He advocated that axons were guided by chemotactic cues. Indeed, later experiments showed that in both invertebrate and vertebrate models, axons grew along pre-determined routes to create a reproducible scaffold of nerves. Ramon y Cajal's views faced some competition from those of Paul Alfred Weiss, his contemporary neuroscientist during the 1920s and 1930s. Weiss argued that functional specificity did not depend on specific axon connections, and that nonspecific mechanical cues participated in guiding axons. Subsequent investigations into chemotactics cues that started in the 1970s eventually proved that Ramon y Cajal's initial ideas were intuitive and ahead of his time.Raper, J., & Mason, C. (2010). Cellular Strategies of Axonal Pathfinding. [Article]. Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology, 2(9). doi: a00193310.1101/cshperspect.a001933  Mechanisms of growth  The mechanism of growth of pioneer neurons has been investigated in the central and peripheral nervous systems of invertebrate animals. Observations of axon growth during the early embryonic period have led to conclusions that axons are actively guided to specific locations. Within these animal models, several factors have been identified as playing a role in determining the direction of growth. Guidepost cells are specialized early differentiating sensory cells. These cells are essential in providing navigational information to pioneer axons. Arrays of pioneer neurons create short segments of pioneer axons extending distal to proximal within an appendage. The resulting trajectories are due to pioneer axons growing from guidepost to guidepost cells. In addition, pioneer axons can act as guidepost cells to more distant pioneer neurons. Studies that involved selective destruction of guidepost cells resulted in pioneer axons becoming unable to navigate normally to the CNS from the PNS. Instead, the pioneer axons assumed alternate configurations and followed different trajectories. In addition, without the guidepost cells, the pioneer axons did not find the stereotyped route that pioneer axons would normally navigate.Bentley, D., & Caudy, M. (1983). Pioneer axons lose directed growth after selective killing of guidepost cells. Nature, 304(5921), 62‚Äì65. It has been shown that glial cells also play a role in axon guidance in various ways. In particular, glial cells demonstrate an interaction with the growth cones of pioneer axons. The route of extending growth cones has been shown to be abundant in glial cells, which are in turn part of a cellular mesh including other intermediate neurons and filopodia. Glial cells also participate in the fasciculation and defasciculation of axons, which are essential in shaping the pathways that are eventually followed.Hidalgo, A., & Booth, G. E. (2000). Glia dictate pioneer axon trajectories in the Drosophila embryonic CNS. [Article]. Development, 127(2), 393‚Äì402. A proposed mechanism involves the creation of a scaffold made out of interface glia, which growth cones contact during the establishment of axon tracts. Ablation of the interface glia leads to a complete loss of longitudinal pioneer axon tracts. In addition, ablation of glia in later embryonic development also interfered with guidance of follower axons, showing that glial cells are necessary in maintaining scaffold needed for contacting growth cones.Hidalgo, A., Urban, J., & Brand, A. H. (1995). Targeted ablation of glia disrupts axon tract formation in the Drosophila CNS. Development, 121(11), 3703‚Äì3712.  Chemotactic influences  A variety of chemotactic cues provide essential signaling directing the directional growth of pioneer axons. Chemotactic cues are unique in that they can be multifunctional and versatile. A single chemotactic cue can both act as an attractant or repellent to pioneer axons, and may work from either a distance or within the immediate vicinity. More specifically, the interactions between chemotactic cues and growth cones can offer a possible explanation for the diversity that is observed in their behavior. Guidance molecules are heavily involved in steering the directions of growth cones. For example, guidance molecules can initiate, extend, stabilize, or retract individual filopodia, as well as attract various adhesion molecules to impact their physical state. Some of the various chemotactic cues that have been explored in the mechanisms of pioneer axons include netrin, ephrin, semaphorin, Slit-Robo, and Notch. Receptors for these molecules have also been studied. Netrins primarily function as attractions of pioneer axons towards the midline. They can act from a distance as much as a few millimeters, as well as act in short range. Netrins can also act as a repellant. Unique among chemoattractants is that the function of netrin has been conserved among a variety of species across 600 million years. Like netrin, ephrin can function as both an attractant and repellant. Ephrins primarily play a role in setting a gradient along the anterior-poster axis for the guidance of developing retinal axons. Semaphorins, which were first identified on specific axons in the grasshopper CNS, function primarily as short-range inhibitory cues that steer pioneer axons away from less ideal regions. Receptor complexes for semaphorins include neuropilins and plexins.Dickson, B. J. (2002). Molecular mechanisms of axon guidance. Science, 298(5600), 1959‚Äì1964. doi: 10.1126/science.1072165 The Slit-Robo cell signaling pathway plays an important role in guiding pioneer axons, especially pioneer longitudinal axons. These axons, which function to connect major parts of the CNS, are mainly present during embryonic development. The Slit family mainly functions as a repellent towards longitudinal axons, guiding them away from the ventral midline. The loss of Slit in Drosophila caused the presence of longitudinal axons in the midline. In conjunction with the Robo receptor, Slit signaling played a role in determining tract positions parallel to the midline for longitudinal axons to follow during development. The loss of either Slit or Robo caused dysfunction in the development of longitudinal pioneer neurons in the midbrain and hindbrain of Drosophila.Mastick, G. S., Farmer, W. T., Altick, A. L., Nural, H. F., Dugan, J. P., Kidd, T., & Charron, F. (2010). Longitudinal axons are guided by Slit/Robo signals from the floor plate. Cell Adh Migr, 4(3), 337‚Äì341. Furthermore, it has been shown that Robo plays a diversified role in pioneer axon guidance in different areas of the brain during embryonic development. Primarily, Robo 1 is crucial towards pioneer longitudinal axon guidance in the ventral tract, while Robo 2 is important in the dorsal tract.Kim, M., Roesener, A. P., Mendonca, P. R., & Mastick, G. S. (2011). Robo1 and Robo2 have distinct roles in pioneer longitudinal axon guidance. Dev Biol, 358(1), 181‚Äì188. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.07.025 The signaling associated with the receptor Notch, as well as non-canonical Notch/Abl signaling, have been shown to play a role in the development of longitudinal pioneer neurons in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord. The Notch receptor has been shown to interact with interface glia to form a path that longitudinal pioneer neurons can follow. Notch/Abl signaling in the pioneer neurons increases the motility of the growth cones of longitudinal pioneer axons while stimulating filopodia development. It has also been noted that Notch signaling is also important in the migration of neurons in the mammalian cortex.Kuzina, I., Song, J. K., & Giniger, E. (2011). How Notch establishes longitudinal axon connections between successive segments of the Drosophila CNS. Development, 138(9), 1839‚Äì1849. doi: 10.1242/dev.062471  Anatomy  The directed growth of axons depends on structure at the end of the tip of a growing axon referred to as a growth cone. Growth cones, in brief, are motile structures that explore the environment and ultimately guide the extension of the axon. The response of growth cones to various signaling molecules dictates the correct pathway and direction of growth of the axon. Growth cones possess a sheetlike expansion at the tip called the lamellipodium, from which extend fine processes called filopodia. The growth cone is necessary for the construction of neural pathways. Although pioneer axons and follower axons both possess growth cones, there are several morphological differences related to the function of pioneer axons. The structure of the growth cone changes whenever an axon reaches a territory not previously innervated, or if a choice in direction is required. Mainly, the lamellipodium increase in size and extend numerous filopodia in order to collect as much sensory information as possible.Purves, D., Augustine, G. J., Fitzpatrick, D., Hall, W. C., LaMantia, A.-S., McNamara, J. O., & White, L. E. (2008). Neuroscience (4 ed.). Sunderland: Sinauer Associates Inc.  Role in neuronal development  The role of pioneer axons in neuronal development has been studied extensively in various invertebrate and vertebrate systems in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Although these experiments have shed light on the functions of the pioneer axons, the results reveal conflicting information into the extent of the effect of pioneer axons on proper development. In addition, other studies have shown that certain cells that interact with pioneer axons are also crucial in the eventual development of neural pathways, and that loss of these cells results in improper navigation of pioneer axons. Furthermore, identical pathways and homologous neurons across different species reflect different pathfinding abilities of growth cones in pioneer neurons. Axonal pathfinding and fasciculation behaviour in the embryonic ventral nerve cord of Drosophila. An investigation was conducted looking into the role of pioneer axons in the formation of both CNS and PNS axon pathways in a Drosophila embryo. Using a method to ablate specific neurons, the ablation of the aCC axon, which plays a role in pioneering the intersegmental nerve in the Drosophila PNS, resulted in the three typical follower axons becoming delayed and prone to pathfinding errors. Despite these consequences, eventually the pathway was formed in the majority of subjects. Ablation of the pioneer axons that formed the longitudinal tracts in the Drosophila CNS resulted in similar difficulties in the formation and organization of longitudinal pathways in 70% of observed segments. Ultimately, like in the PNS, the longitudinal pathways formed in about 80% of observed segments. Thus, it was shown that the pioneer axons played a role in the development of the CNS and PNS, and without the pioneer axons, the growth of the followers was delayed. Remarkably, the majority of the tracts formed, indicating that other factors play a role in axon guidance that can correct for the loss of pioneer neurons.Lin, D. M., Auld, V. J., & Goodman, C. S. (1995). Targeted neuronal cell ablation in the Drosophila embryo: pathfinding by follower growth cones in the absence of pioneers. Neuron, 14(4), 707‚Äì715. Although studies of the mechanisms of pioneer axons have mostly been in invertebrate models, studies have also begun exploring the role of pioneer axons in the development of large vertebrate axon tracts. The primary model for these experiments has been in the zebrafish. Like in Drosophila, there is evidence to show that although pioneer axons play an important role in guiding the growth cones of follower axons, they may not be completely essential. The brain of the early zebrafish presents an ideal environment in which to study the behavior of developing axon tracts. The earliest differentiating pioneer neurons create a scaffold, with which growth cones of follower axons interact with. Deletion of pioneer axons which create the scaffold have an effect on the growth cones of the neurons of the nucleus of the posterior commissure, in that they cannot follow the normal path of extending ventrally, then posteriorly. Despite the compromised pioneer neuron scaffold, the follower growth cones extend ventrally normally. However, around half of the followers do not follow the posterior longitudinal path correctly, while the other half do. This suggests that other cues other than those from pioneer axons play a role in guiding follower axon growth, and that pioneer axons may play different roles in different parts of neuronal development.Patel, C. K., Rodriguez, L. C., & Kuwada, J. Y. (1994). Axonal outgrowth within the abnormal scaffold of brain tracts in a zebrafish mutant. J Neurobiol, 25(4), 345‚Äì360. doi: 10.1002/neu.480250402 In a different study, replacement or removal of the early-born retinal ganglion cells, which function as pioneer neurons, had a significantly deleterious effect on the ability of later axons to exit the eye. Subsequent axon-axon interactions were also shown to be necessary, as misrouting of retinal axons led to chiasm defasciculaiton, telencephalic and ventral hindbrain projections, or aberrant crossing in the posterior commissure.Pittman, A. J., Law, M. Y., & Chien, C. B. (2008). Pathfinding in a large vertebrate axon tract: isotypic interactions guide retinotectal axons at multiple choice points.

It was characterised by nausea and vomiting exacerbated by the sight or smell of food and, unlike the usual gastro-intestinal infections, by constipation rather than diarrhoea. Fever and myalgia were also symptoms. Severe cases developed inanition and even death. It was seen in travelers in the outback rather than in cities or towns, but occasionally entire settlements were affected, such as occurred in Toowoomba in 1903. The aboriginal population knew to avoid the ailment by not drinking from certain water sources and by taking water from soaks or pits dug in the dry sandy bed of a stream. It is postulated that the disease may be due to ingestion of cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) toxins, in particular cylindrospermopsin, a toxin from Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and other cyanobacteria, which is a hepatotoxin. The symptoms of the disease are consistent with a hepatitis or liver disorder, and Cylindrospermopsis is known to be widespread in inland Australian water sources. The toxin is not destroyed by boiling and, although it would flavor water, this flavor would be masked by tea, the common beverage in the Australian bush. Provision of safe drinking water sources in Australia, with the development of bores and covered tanks to collect rainwater, explain the demise of a once-common illness.  References  *Cumpston JHL.

The Ottoman Navy ordered her from the British Thames Iron Works, and she was laid down in 1868, launched in 1869, and commissioned in 1870. She was armed with four guns, was powered by a single-screw compound steam engine with a top speed of . Feth-i B√ºlend saw action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, where she battled the Russian steamer Vesta in an inconclusive engagement. The Ottoman fleet was laid up for most of the next twenty years, and Feth-i B√ºlend saw no activity during this period. Modernized in 1890, she was nevertheless still not in condition for active service at the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897. She was therefore heavily rebuilt in Germany between 1903 and 1907. At the start of the First Balkan War in 1912, the ship was stationed in Salonica; the ship was disarmed so the guns could be used to strengthen the port's fortifications. On the night of 31 October, a Greek torpedo boat slipped into the harbor and sank Feth-i B√ºlend, killing seven of her crew.  Design  Line-drawing of Feth-i B√ºlend Feth-i B√ºlend was long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . The hull was constructed with iron, and displaced normally and BOM. She had a crew of 16 officers and 153 enlisted men. The ship was powered by a single horizontal compound engine which drove one screw propeller. Steam was provided by six coal-fired box boilers that were trunked into a single funnel amidships. The engine was rated at and produced a top speed of , though by 1877 she was only capable of . Decades of poor maintenance had reduced the ship's speed to by 1892. Feth-i B√ºlend carried of coal. A supplementary sailing rig was also fitted. The ship was armed with a battery of four muzzle-loading Armstrong guns mounted in a central, armored casemate, two guns per side. The guns were positioned so as to allow any two to fire directly ahead, astern, or to either broadside. The casemate had heavy armor protection, with the gun battery protected by 222 mm of iron plating. The upper section of the casemate had thinner armor, at thick. The hull had a complete armored belt at the waterline, which extended .6 m (2 ft) above the line and 1.2 m (4 ft) below. The above-water portion was 222 mm thick, while the submerged part was 150 mm thick.  Service history =Construction and the Russo-Turkish War Feth-i B√ºlend, meaning \\"Great Victory\\", was ordered in 1867 from the Thames Iron Works, Blackwall Yard in London and was laid down in May 1868. She was launched in 1869 and began sea trials in 1870, being commissioned into the Ottoman Navy later that year. Upon completion, Feth-i B√ºlend and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in stabilizing the island in the aftermath of the Cretan Revolt of 1866-1869\\\\. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals. Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. Painting depicting Feth-i B√ºlends (left) battle with Vesta (center) Feth-i B√ºlend saw extensive service in the Black Sea during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, based primarily at Batumi. She took part in the bombardment of Russian positions and capture of the Black Sea port of Sokhumi on 14‚Äì16 May 1877. On 23 July, she engaged the Russian armed steamer Vesta in an inconclusive action. Poor visibility from smoke and escaping steam forced the ships to disengage, both with slight damage and few casualties. On the 31st, Feth-i B√ºlend, her sister ship , the steam frigate , and several other ships departed Sochum for Trabzon to bring ground troops to Varna to defend against an expected Russian attack across the Danube. The Ottoman fleet then returned to Batumi, where it remained largely inactive. During a patrol on 25 August, Feth-i B√ºlend encountered the Russian yacht Livadia, but the Russian vessel fled before Feth-i B√ºlend could close to effective range. Inactivity in the 1880s and 1890s Following the Ottoman defeat in 1878, the ship was laid up in Constantinople. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Feth-i B√ºlend was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . The fleet remained inactive at the Golden Horn for twenty years, though in October 1889, Feth-i B√ºlend left the Golden Horn to escort the German Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, during a state visit to the Ottoman Empire. She accompanied Wilhelm as he cruised though the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmara to Constantinople. Feth-i B√ºlend was refitted at the Imperial Arsenal in 1890. During this refit, several small guns were installed, including a pair of Krupp guns, two guns, two guns, and one Nordenfelt gun. In 1892, Feth-i B√ºlend and the ironclad were ordered to reinforce the Cretan Squadron during a period of unrest on the island, but neither vessel was capable of going to sea, owing to leaky boiler tubes. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, the Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Feth-i B√ºlend, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Reconstruction and loss Following the end of the war, the government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program. The first stage was to rebuild the older armored warships, including Feth-i B√ºlend. The Ottomans contacted several foreign shipyards; initially, Krupp's Germaniawerft received the contract to rebuild Feth-i B√ºlend on 11 August 1900, but by December 1902, the Ottomans had reached an agreement with Armstrong-Ansaldo in Genoa to rebuild the vessel. The work was conducted between 1903 and 1907. The ship was reboilered with a pair of water-tube boilers manufactured by the Imperial Arsenal, which improved speed slightly to . Her armament was completely replaced with new, quick-firing guns manufactured by Krupp. Four 15 cm SK L/40 guns were mounted in the casemate, and six guns and six guns were installed on the upper deck. At the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War of 1911‚Äì1912, Feth-i B√ºlend was assigned to the Reserve Division, and she saw no action during the conflict. Instead, she was disarmed and most of her weapons --including all four 15 cm guns, and four each of the 75 mm and 57 mm guns-- were used to bolster the defenses of Salonica's harbor. The guns were manned by 90 of the ship's crew. The ship itself was converted to a barracks ship. At the time of the outbreak of the First Balkan War on 18 October 1912, the ship's commander was Captain (Binba≈üi) Aziz Mahmut Bey, who also functioned as the naval garrison commander. On the night of 31 October, the Greek torpedo boat No. 11 passed by the shore batteries and searchlights and through the mine barrages at 22:20. She launched three torpedoes at 23:30 against Feth-i B√ºlend. One torpedo missed, hitting the quay, but the two others hit the ship, causing her to capsize and sink. Seven of its crew, including the ship's imam, were killed in the sinking, while the Greek vessel exited the harbor by the same route without further incident.

Also used as the logo for the LCC The Lutheran Church of China (LCC; ) was a Lutheran church body in China from 1920 to 1951. It was established as a result of the consultations between the various Lutheran missionary bodies in China that was initiated during the China Centenary Missionary Conference held in Shanghai in 1907.Carlberg, Gustav: \\"The Changing China Scene : The Story of the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Its Church and Political Setting Over a Period of Forty-Five Years, 1913-1958\\", Hong Kong: Lutheran Literature Society, 1958 The church survived as an organised body after the Chinese Civil War but was gradually absorbed into the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China. History The early Chinese Lutheran churches were the result of the work of western mission societies in the 19th century. Until 1907, no less than 25 European and American Lutheran mission bodies were working in China; most of them independently from each other and some within other organisations like the China Inland Mission. Early history (1831-1847) Karl G√ºtzlaff (also known by his Chinese name, ÈÉ≠ÂØ¶Ëáò or Gu≈ç Sh√≠l√† in Pinyin) is generally regarded as the first Lutheran missionary to China. Originally accredited to the Netherlands Missionary Society, G√ºtzlaff first arrived in East Asia in 1823. As China adopted a strict closed-door policy in that period, he was unable to set foot on China until 1831. Arriving in Tianjin, he was able to distribute some religious pamphlets and gospel tracts. Although G√ºtzlaff's methods and results were controversial,China Insight Newsletter: \\"American Presbyterian Mission Press, 1867, repr., Taipei: Ch'eng-wen Publishing Company, 1966 his major contribution included the promotion of the Chinese mission field to European mission societies, particularly Lutheran bodies. The first Lutheran missions (1847-1890) Following G√ºtzlaff's appeal, three German mission societies; the Barmen Mission (later known as the Rhenish Missionary Society or Á¶ÆË≥¢ÊúÉ), the Berlin Missionary Society () and the Basel Mission () sent missionaries to China. On March 19, 1847, Theodore Hamberg () and Rudolph Lechler (); both of the Basel Mission; together with Heinrich K√∂ster () and Ferdinand Gen√§hr (); both of the Barmen Mission; arrived in Hong Kong and under G√ºtzlaff's guidance began working in different areas of Guangdong province. The Basel missionaries concentrated among the Hakka speaking people in the eastern part of the province whereas the Barmen missionaries worked among the Cantonese speakers of the western part of the province. The churches they founded were called the Chongzhen Church (Tsung-Tsin Church or Â¥áÁúüÊúÉ) and Lixian Church (Rhenish Church or Á¶ÆË≥¢ÊúÉ) respectively. The Berlin Missionary Society sent its first missionary to China in 1851 and initially confined its work to the Hakka speaking people in Guangdong province. It eventually extended its work to the Mandarin speaking people in Jiangxi province and Shandong province. The church they founded was eventually called the Yuegan Church ().Tang, Christopher (ÊπØÊ∏Ö): \\"The First Hundred Years Of Protestant Mission In China (Published in Chinese as ‰∏≠ÂúãÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÁôæÂπ¥Âè≤)\\", page 276, Hong Kong: Taosheng Publishing House, 1987 Other Lutheran missions (1890-1907) Between 1890 and 1907, a number of American and Scandinavian Lutheran mission societies established a presence in China. The notable ones include:Hsiao, Andrew: \\"A Brief History of the Chinese Lutheran Church\\", Hong Kong: Taosheng Publishing House, 1999, University of San Francisco: The Ricci 21st Century Roundtable on the History of Christianity in China, The Ricci Institute (URL last accessed on April 24, 2007) *American Lutheran Mission (1890) :- Mission in the provinces of Henan and Hubei :- Started the Yu'e Lutheran Church (Ë±´ÈÑÇ‰ø°Áæ©ÊúÉ) *Hauge's Synod Mission or È¥ªÊÅ©ÊúÉ (1891) :- Mission in Hubei province :- Work later merged in 1917 with the American Lutheran Mission as the United Lutheran Mission (Ë±´ÈÑÇ‰ø°Áæ©ÊúÉ) American Theological Library Association: \\"Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church.

According to the Index of Missions released during the conference, 25 mission bodies with a Lutheran background were working in China. The Boxer Rebellion of 1900 and other experiences acted as an impetus to encourage the various Lutheran bodies to unite into a single organisation to effectively work in China. The entrance of new Lutheran missions into China after 1907 like the Evangelical Lutheran Mission for China or Á¶èÈü≥ÈÅìË∑ØÂæ∑Êïô (1913), the Lutheran Free Church Mission or ‰ø°Áæ©ÂÖ¨ÁêÜÊúÉ (1917) and the Church of Sweden Mission or ÊπòÂåóÁëûËèØ‰ø°Áæ©ÊúÉ (1918) added an extra sense of urgency to the need for a nationwide Lutheran union. In May 1907, a Lutheran missionary consultation was held with representatives from 10 Lutheran mission bodies. While there was a general agreement that Lutheran unity be achieved, practical concerns such as the linguistic differences of the mission fields, the diverse national backgrounds of the missionaries and a poor nationwide transportation system were voiced. It was however agreed that union should be sought first by adopting the name Xinyi (), meaning Faith and Righteousness, to emphasise on Luther's doctrine of justification by faith, union be first achieved in the field of literature and education and that the five mission bodies working in the central Chinese provinces would spearhead the creation of a united Lutheran body. The result of this consultation was the creation of a Union Lutheran Conference (ULC) which was mandated to follow up and implement the proposals of unity that had been discussed. On August 28‚Äì30, 1908, the first ULC meeting was held in Jigongshan or Cockerel Mountain (Wade-Giles: Kikungshan; Traditional ChineseÔπïÈõûÂÖ¨Â±±), Henan and during this and subsequent conferences, a number of plans were drafted to publish books, compiling a hymnal, designing worship liturgies, establishing schools and establishing a national Lutheran Church. To realise these plans, it was decided that priority should be given towards establishing a union Lutheran seminary. On March 29, 1913, the Lutheran Theological Seminary or ‰ø°Áæ©Á•ûÂ≠∏Èô¢ (LTS) was opened in Shekou (Shekow), Hubei. The seminary was sponsored by the American Lutheran Mission, the Hauge's Synod Mission, the Norwegian Missionary Society and the Finnish Missionary Society. Oscar R. Wold of the Hauge Synod Mission was elected the first president and the campus was dedicated on October 19 of the same year. The seminary also served as a publishing house and on September 15, 1913 published The Lutheran Bulletin that served the various Lutheran bodies throughout China. In 1915, the Temporary Committee of the Lutheran Church of China was formed and took up the task of establishing a single national Lutheran Church. By the second ULC meeting in 1917, all preparations, including a draft constitution was finalised.Cf. \\"Proceedings of the Union Lutheran Conference\\", Kikungshan, August 23‚Äì27, 1917 However, in 1915, another Lutheran mission in China began, affiliated with the member synods of the Synodical Conference, which did not participate in the merger. Later, during the communist era this separate mission ceased organized activity, and its church workers set up in Hong Kong instead. The Lutheran Church of China (1920-1951) The united Lutheran Church of China was formally established on August 22, 1920 in Jigongshan, Henan and the first General Assembly of the LCC was also convened there. =First General Assembly (1920)= The first assembly convened on August 22‚Äì29, 1920 in Jigongshan, Henan and officially adopted the constitution of the LCC. Five mission bodies took part in the founding of the LCC and the mission churches founded by these bodies became the LCC's first five synods : *Xiangbei Synod () :- Church of Sweden Mission :- Northern Hunan *Xiangxi Synod () :- Finnish Missionary Society :- Western Hunan *Xiangzhong Synod () :- Norwegian Missionary Society :- Central Hunan *Yu‚Äôe Synod () :- United Lutheran Mission :- Henan and Hubei *Yuzhong Synod () :- Augustana Synod Mission :- Central Henan Oscar Wold was elected the first president of the LCC and a resolution was passed to request all LCC synods as well as other churches in China to observe the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival; which falls on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Chinese calendar; as a Day of Thanksgiving.Cf. \\"Proceedings of the First General Assembly of the Lutheran Church of China\\", 1920Cf. \\"Proceedings of the Church Council of the Lutheran Church of China\\", page 42, 1921 =Second General Assembly (1924)= The assembly was convened a year late in Taohualun, Hunan on March 30 to April 2, 1924 due to the political unrests in Hunan. The Lutheran College that was promised by the Church of Sweden during the previous assembly was located here together with other institutions of the LCC as it was the working base of both the Norwegian Missionary Society and the Xiangzhong Synod. Unfortunately the Lutheran College could not survive the political upheavals that ravaged China during that period and was closed in 1931. Two new synods were added to the LCC during this assembly:Cf. \\"Proceedings of the Second General Assembly of the Lutheran Church of China\\", 1924 *Yudong Synod () :- Lutheran Free Church Mission :- Eastern Henan *Yuenan Synod () :- Schleswig-Holstein Evangelical Lutheran Mission :- Southern Guangdong The management of the Lutheran Board of Publication was also transferred to the LCC and marked the first step towards the indigenisation of Chinese Lutheran literature work. =Third General Assembly (1928)= Continued political unrest in China delayed the convening of the third assembly from the fall of 1926 to May 1928. The venue was also changed from Xuchang, Henan to the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Shekou. A revised Lutheran Book of Worship & Liturgy was adopted by this assembly and the following synods were added:Cf. \\"Proceedings of the Third General Assembly of the Lutheran Church of China\\", Shekou, 1928 *Yuegan Synod () :- Berlin Missionary Society :- Guangdong & Jiangxi *Ludong Synod () :- United Lutheran Church of America :- Shandong *Dongbei Synod () :- Danish Mission Society :- Manchuria & the Northeast =Fourth General Assembly (1931)= The assembly was convened in Qingdao, Shandong on June 21‚Äì28, 1931. Among the important resolutions passed during this assembly was the establishment of a 1:1 quota for Chinese and non-Chinese representatives from each Synod to the National Council and the establishment of the Qingdao Lutheran Bible School for Women.Cf. \\"Minutes of the Fourth Assembly of the Lutheran Church of China\\", pp. 7-26, 1931 =Fifth General Assembly (1934)= The assembly was convened in the YMCA, Shanghai on June 10‚Äì15, 1934. Regulations and principles were drafted and approved regarding the invitation of non Lutheran revivalists. This was in view of the growing revivalist movement in China marked by the ministries of individuals like John Sung, Wang Mingdao and others which had affected many Lutheran churches; both positively and negatively.Cf. \\"Proceedings of the Fifth General Assembly of the Lutheran Church of China\\", Shanghai, June 10‚Äì28, 1934 =Sixth General Assembly (1937)= This was the last pre-war assembly to be convened, and it was held on June 13‚Äì18, 1937, in Loyang, Henan. Far-reaching plans were made, including the release of a statement on social issues from a Lutheran perspective, the establishing of a Youth Committee and the expansion of theological training and literature work. Also notable was the decision made to excommunicate members who participated in the practice of concubinage and polygyny.Cf. \\"Minutes of the Sixth Assembly of the Lutheran Church of China\\", 1937 =Seventh General Assembly (1946)= The assembly was originally scheduled to be held in Guangzhou, Guangdong in 1940 but had to be postponed due to the Sino-Japanese War. It was finally held on October 21‚Äì25, 1946 in the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Shekou. According to an incomplete survey, church membership increased by 62% from the reported membership of 47,473 in the last assembly to 76,953 right after the war.Cf. \\"Minutes of the Seventh Assembly of the Lutheran Church of China : LCC Statistics\\", Shekou, 1946 Several important resolutions were also passed including a decision to apply for membership in the newly formed Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and to send a delegation to the First Assembly of the LWF to be held in Lund, Sweden in 1947 and to invite the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod related Evangelical Lutheran Mission for China to join the Lutheran Board of Publications. The following synods were also accepted to the LCC : *Yu‚Äôeshaan Synod () :- Norwegian Lutheran China Mission Association :- Hubei, Henan and Shaanxi *Shaannan Synod () :- Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Free Church Mission :- Southern Shaanxi Due to changing circumstances and the rapid development of the Chinese Civil War, the Seventh General Assembly, proved to be last full assembly held by the Lutheran Church of China. =Eight General Assembly (1949)= Due to the fall of most of mainland China to the forces of the Communist Party of China, and the continued fighting in other parts of China, the scheduled assembly that was to be held in Guangzhou, Guangdong on October 10, 1949 could not be held. An attempt to move the assembly to Hong Kong also turned out to be impossible. The National President, Peng Fu, who was in Hong Kong at that time, finally decided to hold a National Council meeting instead. The 27th Council met in Tao Fong Shan, Shatin, Hong Kong on November 4‚Äì5, 1949. Tao Fong Shan has been the centre of the Christian Mission to Buddhists () since 1930 and was also the temporary campus of the Lutheran Theological Seminary after its evacuation from Shekou on December 1, 1948. Four new members were accepted into the LCC:Cf. \\"Minutes of the 27th Meeting of the Lutheran Church Council\\", Taofongshan, Shatin, Hong Kong, China; November 4‚Äì5, 1949 * Yuxi Church (Yuxi Synod / Ë±´Ë•øÂçÄÊúÉ) :- American Lutheran Brethren Mission :- Eastern Henan * Lixian Synod (Yuedong Synod / Á≤µÊù±ÂçÄÊúÉ) :- Rhenish Missionary Society :- Eastern Guangdong * Chongzhen Synod (Yuexi Synod / Á≤µË•øÂçÄÊúÉ) :- Basel Mission :- Western Guangdong * Daoyou Synod (Hong Kong Synod / È¶ôÊ∏ØÂçÄÊúÉ) :- Christian Mission to Buddhists :- Hong Kong By LCC regulations, these four synods were to be renamed according to the area that they worked in (see names in parentheses above). However, since both the Rhenish and Basel missions have been at work for more than 100 years, and the nature of the work of the Daoyouhui had been very different, it was difficult to decide on which names that the new Synods were to adopt.\\"Minutes of the 27th Meeting of the Lutheran Church Council\\", Taofongshan, Shatin, Hong Kong, China; November 4‚Äì5, 1949, page 20, \\"Report of the Basel Mission\\" However, as the political situation in China was changing, this matter was eventually dropped altogether. By now, the large majority of the Lutheran missions working in China at that time had joined the LCC and according to incomplete statistics published, the LCC had a total of 104,799 members making it one of the largest Protestant churches in China.\\"Minutes of the 27th Meeting of the Lutheran Church Council\\", Taofongshan, Shatin, Hong Kong, China; November 4‚Äì5, 1949, \\"Appendix I: Synods and Missions of the Lutheran Church of China\\" The Lutheran Church in China (1950-1951) On January 25, 1951, with the National President unable to return to China, the LCC called an extended Council meeting in Hankou under the leadership of Yu Jun, the National Vice-President. In this meeting, it was decided that:Tian Feng Weekly, Issue 253, March 3, 1951 * The name of the LCC be changed from Zhonghua Xinyihui () or the Lutheran Church of China to Zhongguo Xinyihui () or The Lutheran Church in China (TLCC); * To abolish the 16 synods and reorganise the TLCC into five geographical zones; * To dismiss Peng Fu as National President and replace him with Yu Jun; * To carry out the principles of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement with determination; * To join the National Council of Churches in China; * To sever all ties with any missions, churches and organisations based in Hong Kong; * To stop sending students to the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Hong Kong and invite patriotic students to return to China. This episode effectively ended the existence of the LCC as an entity in China and by 1958, the TLCC was also abolished with the introduction of union worship and imposition of \\"post-denominationalism\\" by the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.Amity News Service: Frequently asked questions about the Protestant church in China (URL last accessed on April 24, 2007)Protestant Churches in China : About Us (URL last accessed on April 24, 2007) Organisation and structure The LCC was organised on four levels; the National Assembly, Synod, District and Congregation. The General Assembly was to meet once every three years to elect a National Council headed by a National President. The Synod and District levels met annually to elect a Synod Council and District Council respectively and the Congregations elected a Deacons Board annually. Presidents * 1920-1924 : Rev Oscar R. Wold (Yu'e Synod) * 1924-1928 : Rev Arstrup Larsen (Yu'e Synod) * 1928 : Rev Oscar R. Wold (Yu'e Synod) : died in office * 1928-1931 : Rev Zu Qiwu (Xiangzhong Synod) * 1931-1937 : Rev Zhu Haorang (Yu'e Synod) * 1937-1951 : Rev Dr Peng Fu (Yu'e Synod) Legacy of the LCC Although the LCC only lasted 30 years as an organised entity in China, her legacy to the development of Lutheranism in East Asia has been substantial. Many Lutheran Churches in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore trace their beginnings to the work and missions of the LCC. Hong Kong Of the eight Lutheran churches in Hong Kong, six can trace the legacy of the LCC in their work : * Tsung Tsin Mission of Hong Kong () website :The church was established by missionaries of the Basel Mission and was a district of the Chongzhen Church in eastern Guangdong. The mission joined the LCC as part of the Chongzhen (Yuexi) Synod in 1949 until the dissolution of the LCC in 1951. In 1952, it registered with the Hong Kong government under a new constitution. * Chinese Rhenish Church Hong Kong Synod () website :The church was established by missionaries of the Barmen Missionary Society and was a district of the Lixian Church in western Guangdong. The church joined the LCC as part of the Lixian (Yuedong) Synod in 1949 until the dissolution of the LCC in 1951. On June 1, 1951, it was registered as an independent church with the Hong Kong government. * Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hong Kong () website :The work was begun by students and faculty of the Lutheran Theological Seminary together with the expelled missionaries from China, who had laboured together with the LCC. By pedigree, it can be viewed as the successor church to the LCC. It was formally established on February 24, 1954 with the Rev Dr Peng Fu as its first president. * Hong Kong and Macau Lutheran Church () website :The work was begun by missionaries from the Norwegian Lutheran Mission who had previously worked with the Yu'eshaan Synod and had evacuated to Hong Kong after 1949. They were joined by the Rev Liu Daosheng, the previous President of the Yu'eshaan Synod, who was stranded in China due to the sudden change in the political status of China. In 1960, the Yu'eshaan Lutheran Church became the Norwegian Lutheran Mission. They were one of the founding members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hong Kong but withdrew in 1969 due to a disagreement. In 1978, the Mission decided to begin transferring its operations to a self-supporting local church and on November 18 of the same year, the Hong Kong and Macau Lutheran Church was officially established. * South Guangdong Lutheran Church () website :The church is a successor of the work of the Yuenan Synod of the LCC. In 1962, following a sudden increase in refugees from China, Rev Leung Sin-Sang, a member of the former Yuenan Synod was called by the North Elbian Mission Centre to start work in Hong Kong. He initially focussed on the refugees from Hepu, one of the districts of the former Yuenan Synod. * Christian Mission to Buddhists () website :The mission was the former Daoyou Synod of the LCC. It now functions more as an organisation than as a church although congregational work still exists on a small scale. A monastery was built in Tao Fong Shan in 1936 and still remains a popular retreat centre in Hong Kong. In 1984, the Tao Fong Shan Lutheran congregation became a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hong Kong. The Institute of Sino-Christian Studies was established in 1995 to promote the contextualization of Christian theology in Chinese culture and to further develop dialogue with other cultures and religions. Taiwan There are six Lutheran churches in Taiwan, of which five can trace the legacy of the LCC in their work: * Taiwan Lutheran Church () website :The church was started by the work of former LCC members and expelled missionaries from China who had worked with the LCC. In April 1950, Chin Chung-an, a medical doctor from Xian conducted family meetings in his residence in Kaoshiung. On June 3, 1951, the Kaoshiung congregation was established and 59 people were baptised. On November 1, 1954, the church was officially established. * Lutheran Church of the Republic of China () :Similar to the Hong Kong and Macau Lutheran Church, this church was started by missionaries from the Norwegian Lutheran Mission who had previously worked with the Yu‚Äôeshaan Synod. In 1952, Sigrun Omestad began work in Taipei and later that year, Rev Liu Daosheng, who had previously worked with the mission in Hong Kong was called to serve as pastor. In 1978, the Mission decided to begin transferring its operations to a self-supporting local church and by 1985, the church was officially established as an independent organisation. * Chinese Lutheran Brethren Church () :In 1951, A. E. Nyhus, a missionary of the Lutheran Brethren China Mission who had worked with the Yuxi Synod of the LCC arrived in Taiwan. He was joined later that year by Rev Tu Chang-Wu, the former president of the Yuxi Synod and work began among the family members of the military. In 1958, an independent church was established. * China Lutheran Gospel Church () :In 1954, the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Free Church Mission (NLF) sent the Rev J. T. Johansen, Jr who had previously worked with the Shaannan Synod of the LCC to work under the Taiwan Lutheran Church (TLC). In 1961, the NLF decided to separate from the TLC and conduct their work independently. The mission was established as the China Lutheran Gospel Church in August 1973 with the Rev Xiong Ming-Xiang elected as the first chairman. * Lutheran Church of Taiwan (Republic of China) () :On September 4, 1955, the Rev Toivo Koskikallio, president of the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Hong Kong was asked by the Finnish Missionary Society to study the establishment of a mission in Taiwan. In October 1956, in response to Koskikallio's study, the FMS sent the Rev P√§iv√∂ Parviainen and Ms Elma Aaltonen to Taiwan. All three missionaries have worked with the Xiangxi Synod of the LCC before. On April 3, 1977, the Lutheran Church of Taiwan was established and the Rev Ye Bo-Xiang was elected President. Malaysia Of the four Lutheran churches in Malaysia, two can trace the legacy of the LCC in their work: * Basel Christian Church of Malaysia () :The Basel Christian Church of Malaysia (BCCM) was established among the Hakka speaking refugees of the failed Taiping Rebellion in China. As the leader of the Rebellion, Hong Xiuquan, was a Hakka speaking Christian, the Hakka speaking Basel Mission was viewed with great suspicion by the Qing Government of China. When the British North Borneo Company sought to recruit Chinese labourers to develop North Borneo, Rudolph Lechler of the Basel Mission enthusiastically supported the scheme. The first Chinese Basel Christians arrived in Lausan, North Borneo in 1882 and the Lausan Church was built in 1886. In 1925, the Borneo Self- Governing Basel Church was established with the Rev Huang Tian-Yu elected as the first president. In 1966, the present name was adopted and the BCCM is now the largest LCC pedigreed Lutheran Church with 45,000 members. * Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore () website :In 1952, the Lutheran World Federation convened the First Southeast Asia Lutheran Consultation in Penang, appealing to Lutheran churches worldwide to respond to the spiritual needs of more than 500,000 ethnic Chinese who were stranded in New Villages set up by the Malayan government to counter the threat posed by the Communist Party of Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. Among the first who responded was Dr Paul Anspach (formerly of the Yu-e Synod of the LCC) of the United Lutheran Church in America and Dr Peng Fu (previous president of the LCC) who represented the Hong Kong Lutheran churches. The Lutheran Church in Malaysia was established in 1963. After the expulsion of Singapore from the Malaysian Federation in 1965, the name was changed to the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore (LCMS). In 1996, the Singapore District of the LCMS became an independent body known as the Lutheran Church in Singapore. Singapore The Lutheran churches in Singapore are organised under one national body which originated as a mission by LCC related missionaries and workers. * Lutheran Church in Singapore () website :In 1960, the United Lutheran Church in America mission in Malaya extended its work to Singapore and the mission became a national church in 1963 adopting the name the Lutheran Church in Malaysia. Singapore separated from the Malaysian Federation in 1965 and the church was renamed the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore (LCMS). The churches in Singapore formed the Singapore District of the LCMS until it became an independent national church in 1996 with the name the Lutheran Church in Singapore.

Starring Patrick Swayze as Allan Quartermain (it is spelled Allan Quartermain in the credits, unlike the book, which has Allan Quatermain) and Alison Doody as Elizabeth Maitland, the film was produced by Hallmark Entertainment, and originally aired June 6, 2004 on Hallmark Channel. Plot= Part One  In Africa, wealthy businessman Mr Bitter is on safari with his guides, Allan Quatermain and Bruce McNabb. He wishes to kill a family of elephants but Quartermain insists otherwise. Mcnabb betrays and subdues Quatermain while the others open fire. Later, the wounded mother elephant destroys their camp and kills Bitter, dying shortly after just as Quatermain prepares to euthanise it. He whispers \\"sorry, girl.\\" Samuel Maitland, a wealthy British explorer, writes a letter to his daughter Elizabeth, enclosing a map to the fabled mines of King Solomon. Shortly after sending the letter, he is captured by native KuaKuani tribesman. Their warlock, Twala, seeks more power and believes he can obtain it by finding the Stone of the Ancestors, an artifact hidden in Solomon's mines. Quatermain returns to London wishing to spend time with his son, Harry. However, Harry's grandparents have filed for custody, declaring Quatermain an unfit parent. His lawyer tells him that, without a substantial amount of money, he cannot win the case so he goes to the bar. There, Elizabeth Maitland and Captain Good, her uncle and Bodyguard, find him and ask for his help. He refuses and they leave him her card, but once he realises who her father is he agrees to help. Quatermain finds Elizabeth being attacked by a Russian man, Sergei, whom he fends off. The pair return to Elizabeth's hotel room to find it ransacked. Only then Elizabeth reveals that she must travel to Africa to trade the map for her father's life. Arriving in Africa, Quartermain enlists the help of his acquaintances, Ventvogel, Khiva, and, after a brief fight, his close friend Sir Henry Curtis. Meanwhile, three Russian men tasked with retrieving the map - Col. Ivan Fleekov, Petre and Sergei - enlist McNabb as their guide, telling him they may have to kill Quartermain to which he agrees. Quartermain and Elizabeth come to respect one another as the journey progresses, especially after he saves her from a leopard that invades her tent one morning. When the group reach the drop-off location, however, they find their contact dead and an imposter in his place. They are ambushed by the Russians and Quartermain must make a dangerous ride through a crossfire to save miss Maitland. McNabb has a shot on Quartermain but does not take it, resulting in Petre being shot in the abdomen. After seeking the counsel of a witch doctor the group realise they must cross the great Sahara desert. Quartermain talks to an African man who has been seen following them throughout he whole journey, and he introduces himself as Umbopa, saying he can be of help and has crossed the great desert before. They agree for him to travel with the group. After McNabb fails to fall for a ruse involving multiple tracks, the Russians gain ground and the group apparently set up camp, but as the Russians close in on the camp it becomes apparent that it, too, is a trick and is empty. The Russians fall behind again. As they begin to catch up in the desert, Quatermain's group find a rock formation of a cobra, which leads them to a tomb containing the key to Solomon's mines. However, while Quartermain and the others retrieve the key, the Russians arrive, incapacitate Captain Good and kidnap miss Maitland.  Part Two  Both groups press on through the desert making for an oasis. Petre succumbs to his injuries and dies, while both parties nearly die of thirst. After Quatermain's party reach the oasis first, they ambush the Russians leading to a tense standoff. Elizabeth creates a distraction and escapes leading to an exchange of fire in which Ventvogel is injured and the Russians seize the map and the key. After Umbopo leads them through the valleys on the other side of the desert and they gain ground on the Russians, the group sets a trap to retrieve the map. The trap initially succeeds, and McNabb is forced at gunpoint to drop the bag containing the map and key, as he and the Russians are driven off by gunfire. Khiva makes a run for the bag but is shot by both Sergei and Fleekov. Quatermain rescues the badly wounded Khiva while Henry and Ventvogel fatally shoot Sergei. As the firefight continues, Elizabeth tries to retrieve the map as McNabb prepares to kill her. However, Quatermain disarms McNabb and shoots him in the shoulder, then wounds the colonel. Khiva dies from his injuries and the others mourn him. Quatermain's group continues toward the Kuakuani village, followed by Fleekov and McNabb, who survived their injuries. After being ambushed by warriors, Umbopa reveals his true name to be Ignosi, the rightful warlock. The warriors escort the group, as well as McNabb and Fleekov who were also captured, to their village where Ignosi challenges Twala to Nomolos; a fight to the death, for the throne. Elizabeth is reunited with her father who has survived his captivity. It is revealed that Ignosi and Twala do not fight each other personally, but rather select a representative. Ignosi has chosen Quatermain. On the morning of the fight, McNabb and Fleekov escape their bindings and search for the key as the Nomolos begins. Initially it is evenly matched but Twala's warrior gains the upper hand and almost kills Quatermain. Quatermain manages to turn the fight around and prepares to make the killing blow, but instead he slams the axe into the ground near the warriors head as a show of mercy. Ignosi congratulates him on winning, but Twala attempts to kill him by throwing a spear. Henry sees the danger and intervenes, saving Quatermain by taking the spear himself. Quatermain tries to help but Henry dies, saying \\"Take good care of that lass.\\" Enraged, Quatermain prepares to kill Twala but Ignosi intervenes. To their surprise, the warriors all close in and murder Twala without orders. Fleekov and McNabb find the key but are discovered by Gagool, the Kuakuani witch doctor. She kills Fleekov with magic, entrancing him and forcing him to asphyxiate, but lets McNabb go, telling him he may find what he seeks, but he will never possess it. Gagool approaches Ignosi and is allowed to remain witch doctor of the tribe after Samuel vouches for her. She presents Ignosi with the key to the mines, which he gives to Quatermain. He explains that whilstever there is interest in the mines his people will not be safe, and asks Quatermain and Elizabeth to destroy the stone of the ancestors. The pair travel to the mines where McNabb ambushes them and engages Quatermain in a fight. He is killed after Quatermain throws him down a flight of stairs onto one of many spring loaded spears that protrude from the floor when triggered. Quatermain and Elizabeth find the stone but when they touch it the cavern seals them in. Awaiting death, Quatermain proposes to Elizabeth to which she says yes, and suddenly they remember a shaft of sunlight lancing into the mine indicating a way out. They take a ring off a statue, triggering the start of an avalanche, and begin to climb out of the mine, throwing the stone back in behind them. They barely escape as the entire mine collapses. Months later Quatermain and Elizabeth are married and live in a cottage on the savanna, with Harry living with them.

Rider Haggard. It stars Richard Chamberlain, Sharon Stone, Herbert Lom and John Rhys-Davies. It was adapted by Gene Quintano and James R. Silke and directed by J. Lee Thompson. This version of the story was a light, comedic take, deliberately referring to, and parodying Indiana Jones (in which franchise actor Rhys-Davies appeared in two installments). It was filmed outside Harare in Zimbabwe.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089421/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt It was followed by a sequel (filmed back-to-back) Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (1986) and was to be followed by a sequel that was never produced: the first attempt would have been based on She and Allan, another Haggard novel, and then a second attempt to have been titled Allan Quatermain and the Jewel of the East and directed by producer Golan. Plot Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) has hired Allan Quatermain to find her father, believed lost on an expedition to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies), who is a long-standing adversary of Quatermain. Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, but Quatermain's group manages to rescue Professor Huston, who confirms the mines are indeed real and he implores Quatermain to stop Bockner and Dogati from finding them. After a few harrowing encounters with both the Germans and some of the local native tribes, they finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Bockner and Dogati attack the village in full force. Amid the ensuing chaos, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. Quatermain and Umbopo give chase after them and they are in turn pursued by Bockner and Dogati. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then shoots down all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal. Umbopo explains that Gagoola had attempted to sacrifice Jesse in order to keep her power as the Kukuanas' ruler because of Jesse's strong resemblance to the Queen of Sheba. Then Gagoola appears and taunts Umbopo, who pursues her through the caverns. As Bockner and his men arrive next, Quatermain and Jesse flee for safety, but end up in the cavern's treasure chamber, which is full of raw diamonds and other priceless treasures. As they gather some of the diamonds to take with them, Bockner hears their voices from outside the chamber, but before he can enter, Gagoola activates a hidden rock switch and seals Quatermain and Jesse inside the chamber. The switch also triggers a trap that causes the ceiling of the chamber, which is lined with stalactites to lower on them. Quatermain and Jesse manage to stop the ceiling trap, but then the chamber begins filling up with water. Just as the chamber fills completely, a lit stick of dynamite set by Bockner outside the chamber door explodes, sending them both spewing out of the chamber in the resulting flood to safety. Bockner enters the chamber and quickly lays claim to the treasure, only to be confronted by a wounded, but very much alive, Dogati, who was wearing a protective vest that shielded him from the bullets. He then forces Bockner to swallow some of the diamonds, intending to cut him open to retrieve them later on. Meanwhile, Umbopo finally corners Gagoola. But rather than face his judgment, she instead leaps down one of the volcano's shafts and is incinerated when she lands in the molten lava below. However, the reaction causes a series of eruptions throughout the mines. Dogati is partially buried when the treasure chamber's ceiling collapses, but Bockner is unharmed. He gloats to Dogati after claiming a few more diamonds for himself, then leaves the chamber. But not before firing his gun at the ruined ceiling, burying Dogati alive. Quatermain, Jesse and Umbopo quickly flee for their lives through the collapsing caverns. They cross over a small booby- trapped lake (which one of Bockner's men fell victim to earlier), only to be stopped by Bockner, who demands they surrender their diamonds to him. Quatermain places the diamonds on the central stepping stone that triggers the trap and tells Bockner to come take the diamonds himself if he wants them. Bockner does so and falls into the lake, only to be seized in the jaws of a Mokele-mbembe and dragged beneath the water. The trap resets itself and the diamonds rise back to the surface, but Umbopo warns Quatermain and Jesse not to take them, saying they belong to the mountain. The trio continue their escape through the caverns, which becomes even more dangerous as the lava chamber they are in is full of fire and falling rocks. Quatermain tells Umbopo to take Jesse through to safety while he follows them. But before he can do so, he is struck down by Dogati, who survived the cave-in. A brutal fight between them ensues, but Quatermain gains the upper hand at the last instant, sending Dogati falling into the chamber's lava pit to his death. Quatermain manages to escape from the mines at the last minute, just as the volcano explodes, sealing the entrance forever. Returning to the village, Umbopo assumes his rightful place as the ruler of the Kukuanas and he and his people bid a fond farewell to Quatermain and Jesse. As they exit the village, they each reveal they had kept a diamond from the mines as a souvenir of their adventure and the movie ends with them kissing outside the village gates.

King Solomon's Mines is not a remake of the old Stewart Granger trek through the jungle. It's a sensational script. It's very much a Raiders of the Lost Ark type of movie ‚Äì very tongue-in-cheek and full of adventures and stunts.... Bullets flying, lions eating people, witches up in the trees. All that stuff.\\" Kathleen Turner was reportedly offered $1.5 million to play the female lead but turned it down because the role was too similar to the one she played in Romancing the Stone. Sharon Stone was cast due to a misunderstanding; The Cannon Group CEO Menahem Golan had demanded they get \\"that Stone woman\\", but he had meant Turner. The film was shot on location in Zimbabwe over ten months. The crew included many Israelis and South Africans which caused some objections from the local Arab population. The Arab League protested the depiction of all the Arab characters as slavers. Richard Chamberlain said, \\"I happen to think that people are people and I don't care where they come from as long as they do a good job.... This is a comedy, and one of the best defenses against out-of-date stereotypes is to poke fun at them. It shows how absurd they are. \\"I usually get heavy material\\", said Chamberlain, but this movie is funny. There are not too many lines to learn, he said, and the time is taken up with \\"being chased by natives and animals, cooked in pots\\", and escaping the perils of \\"crocodiles, witch-queens, deadly swamps\\" and so forth. It was shot simultaneously with a sequel. Soundtrack The film's score was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, and performed by the Hungarian State Opera Orchestra. Restless Records issued an album on LP and cassette; Milan later released it on compact disc minus the cue \\"The Ritual\\" and paired with Alan Silvestri's The Delta Force. In 1991 Intrada Records released an expanded version, later reissued in 1997; Prometheus released the complete score in 2006.

Critical King Solomon's Mines holds a 13% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 3.7/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 29 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Though it made a profit, the film was panned by critics, many of whom felt it was not as good as the 1950 film version with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. It was nominated for two Razzie Awards, including Worst Supporting Actor for Herbert Lom and Worst Musical Score for Goldsmith. Sequels The direct sequel, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, was released in 1987 with both Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone returning. Director J. Lee Thompson did not return, choosing instead to direct Murphy's Law with Charles Bronson. The sequel was directed by television veteran Gary Nelson and was a critical and box office disappointment. The Cannon Group had originally planned a trilogy of films, the third film was to be an adaptation of She and Allan but this was ultimately abandoned after the extreme negative reception of Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, coupled with the financial difficulties of the company at the time. In 2011, a new sequel was proposed by Menahem Golan called Allan Quatermain and the Jewel of the East. The script was written by Menahem Golan and Richard Albiston, to be directed by Golan himself. The plot concerned Quatermain attempting to rescue his daughter from Chinese treasure hunters in the Congo. According to the 2015 documentary Golan: A Farewell to Mr. Cinema, Richard Chamberlain had agreed to return as the title character, but Golan died before the film began shooting. Releases MGM released the film on DVD on February 10, 2004. On December 3, 2014, Umbrella Entertainment in Australia released a Region 4 DVD of the movie.

Diplomatic relations improved following the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and the establishment of an Islamic Republic. Iran and North Korea pledge cooperation in educational, scientific, and cultural spheres. Some media reports claim this cooperation extends to nuclear cooperation, though official U.S. government publicationsCongressional Research Service, \\"Iran-North Korea-Syria Ballistic Missile and Nuclear Cooperation,\\" February 26, 2016, and academic studies have disputed this.Patrick McEachern and Jaclyn O'Brien McEachern, North Korea, Iran and the Challenge to International Order (Routledge, 2017), The United States has been greatly concerned by North Korea's arms deals with Iran, which started during the 1980s with North Korea acting as a third party in arms deals between the Communist bloc and Iran, as well as selling domestically produced weapons to Iran, and North Korea continues selling missiles to Iran. North Korea and Iran are the remaining two members of George W. Bush's \\"Axis of evil\\", which has led to many of the concerns regarding Iran‚ÄìNorth Korea relations. The United States of America designates both nations as State Sponsors of Terrorism, and they reciprocate this shared enmity. Despite this, Iran is one of the only countries in the world that has a good relationship with both North and South Korea. History The Persian- Korean relationship started with cultural exchanges date back to the Three Kingdoms of Korea era, more than 1600 years ago by the way of the Silk Road. A dark blue glass was found in the Cheonmachong Tomb, one of Silla's royal tombs unearthed in Gyeongju, and an exotic golden sword was found in Gyerim-ro, a street also located in Gyeongju. These relics are presumed to have been sent to Silla from ancient Iran or Persia through the Silk Road. It was only the Koryeo Dynasty during King Hyeonjong's reign when trade with Persia was officially recorded in Korean history. But in academic circles, it is presumed that both countries had active cultural exchanges during the 7th century Silla era which means the relationship between Korea and Iran dates to 1500 years ago. \\"If a history book written by the Persian scholar Khurdadbid, it states that Silla is located at the eastern end of China and reads 'In this beautiful country Silla, there is much gold, majestetic cities and hardworking people. Their culture is comparable with Persia'. Other items uncovered during the excavation include a silver bowl engraved with an image of the Persian goddess Anahita; a golden dagger from Persia; clay busts; and figurines portraying Middle Eastern merchants. Samguk Sagi‚Äîthe official chronicle of the Three Kingdoms era, compiled in 1145‚Äîcontains further descriptions of commercial items sold by Middle Eastern merchants and widely used in Silla society. Throughout the years, the Imperial State of Iran had no relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its early years, particularly due to Iran having relations with the Republic of Korea that were established in 1962. Both countries were allied in the U.S.-led Western Bloc during the Cold War. In 1979, the pro-U.S. monarchy was deposed and was replaced with an Islamic Republic. Despite the two countries' shared antagonism to U.S. foreign policies, the specific national interests of the North Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran were often considerably different from each other. For instance, North Korea, though it provided Iran with military assistance during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (an act that induced Baghdad to break diplomatic relations with Pyongyang), made repeated attempts to normalize its relations with the Iraqi government. In 1982, the North Korean authorities secretly invited an Iraqi delegation to Pyongyang, but the Iraqi government sent only an unofficial representative. The talks failed, but the attempt revealed that North Korea was not ideologically committed to Iran's crusade against Saddam Hussein. The Iranian leaders decided to maintain diplomatic relations with both North and South Korea. During the recent inter-Korean security crises (like the ROKS Cheonan sinking and the Bombardment of Yeonpyeong), Iranian news agencies usually quoted the statements of the Korean Central News Agency in parallel with the statements made by Western and South Korean politicians, without showing any detectable preference for either side.Bal√°zs Szalontai, Cracks in the North Korea-Iran Axis. Elements of dissonance in the rhetoric of the Tehran-Pyongyang partnership. NK News, August 5, 2014. Nor were the two states in full concord in adopting a position toward the various manifestations of international terrorism. On the one hand, both Iran and the North Korea provided military assistance to Hezbollah in Lebanon, and they actively sided with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad against the Syrian wing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant during the Syrian Civil War. North Korea and Iran held substantially different views about the conflicts in which the Taliban, the Boko Haram, and the Iraqi wing of ISIL were involved. While the North Korea stressed that U.S. efforts to suppress these organizations constituted interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Iraq, the Iranian leaders, who regarded Sunni Salafi extremism as a direct threat to their own interests, repeatedly accused America of not striving hard enough to eliminate these groups or even seeking to reach an agreement with them.Balazs Szalontai, \\"Consent, discord in North Korean, Iranian attitudes toward international terrorism\\", NK News, August 17, 2015.Balazs Szalontai, \\"The specter of terrorism in North Korean, Iranian propaganda\\", NK News, August 25, 2015.

Weapons sales between North Korea and Iran increased significantly during the Iran-Iraq war. This weapons sale relationship has expanded into further military cooperation including in the development of and exchange of nuclear technology. This relationship has also involved Syria. During the Persian Gulf War North Korea is said to have supplied Iran with a range of arms including artillery, anti- aircraft machine guns, mortars, ammunition, tanks, small arms, naval mines and anti-tank and surface-to-air missile systems. In December 2009, in contravention of an arms embargo imposed on North Korea, a shipment of North Korean arms, said to be en route for Iran, according to the Congressional Research Service, was intercepted in Thailand. These weapons included rocket launchers and surface-to-air missile parts. In addition to weapons, North Korea and Iran have an active exchange of military expertise particularly in relation to special operations and underground facilities. North Korea is thought to have trained Iranian operators in these advanced infiltration techniques. In March 2013 North Korea and Iran, as well as Syria, blocked a UN Arms Trade Treaty aimed at setting \\"standards for all cross-border transfers of conventional weapons\\". Arms expert Jeffrey Lewis claims that the second stage of North Korea's Hwasong-14 ICBM is similar to the upper stages designed for the Iranian space launch vehicles.https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/North- Korea-crisis/Could-Iran-be-behind-North-Korea-s-nuclear-missile-advances  See also  * Foreign relations of Iran * Foreign relations of North Korea  References  McEachern, Patrick and Jaclyn O'Brien McEachern.

He was a candidate in the 2018 Florida Gubernatorial election, but was eliminated in the primary, finishing in fourth place behind eventual nominee Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, whom Greene later endorsed. Early life Greene was born in 1954 in Worcester, Massachusetts to a working class Jewish family.Forbes: The Reluctant Billionaire by Susan Kitchens September 11, 2008 His father ran a business selling textile mill machinery. His mother was a Hebrew school instructor who taught Greene to \\"save his pennies, look for value, and never pay retail.\\" He graduated from Doherty Memorial High School in Worcester after his family moved to Florida in 1970 when his father lost his business, staying with his great-aunt while he finished school. In Florida, his father worked refilling vending machines and his mother worked as a waitress. Greene worked many jobs to put himself through college at Johns Hopkins University, graduating in three years with a B.A. in economics and sociology. Later he attended Harvard Business School, where he earned his Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree in 1977. Greene lived in Southern California in the 1980s and 1990s and ran in the 1982 Republican primary for the 23rd Congressional District race. Greene lost the primary to David Armor who then lost to incumbent Democrat Anthony C. Beilenson. Career Greene began investing in real estate while in business school, and built a successful real estate business from being a busboy at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach. In mid-2006, Greene, worried about the possible collapse of the real estate market, spoke with John Paulson, a fellow investor who discussed with Greene his investing strategy. They agreed that the real estate market was unstable and a bubble might be forming in housing. After the meeting, Greene engaged in a similar investing strategy to that of Paulson, which involved a series of unconventional investments trading credit default swaps. The return on Greene's investments ultimately saved his business, and put him on Forbes 400 list. 2010 US Senate campaign On April 30, 2010, Greene announced his intention to run as a Democrat for the United States Senate seat held by George LeMieux, saying, \\"I am an outsider, the only candidate who isn't a career politician.

Carl Krebs graduated from the Metropolitanskole in 1907, and completed his medical studies in 1913. He was then resident in the surgical department of St. Joseph‚Äôs Hospital. As a student he competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics as part of the Danish team that won the bronze medal in the men's free system team gymnastics event. In 1914 he joined the Danish Army, not as a medical officer but as a recruit, and was promoted to Second Lieutenant in The Royal Life Guards a year later. Carl Krebs worked for the Danish Red Cross and the Danish Foreign Ministry in Russia from 1916 to 1920 monitoring conditions in Russian POW camps. While there, he participated in an expedition to Central Asia (Mongolia and Tannu Uriankhai), and in February 1918 was sent on a secret aid mission to Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) in Crimea, mother of the last Russian monarch, Emperor Nicholas II. In 1921 he was with the Danish Ambulance service in Poland during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. In 1922 he returned to Russia as leader of the Danish Red Cross delegation in Fridtjof Nansen's efforts to alleviate the Russian Famine of 1921-22. In 1922 Carl Krebs organized and led an expedition to establish a farming, mining and fur trading settlement near Erdenebulgan in the Kh√∂vsg√∂l province of northern Mongolia, however the enterprise never prospered. The other members of the expedition, which included Henning Haslund-Christensen, left by 1928 and Carl Krebs remained to raise horses as well as practice medicine. Subject to increasing harassment by the communist authorities in the 1930s, he was eventually forced to leave in 1937. After his return to Denmark he published his memoir En Dansker i Mongoliet. Carl Krebs worked as a war surgeon in World War, from 1939 to 1940 with the Danish Ambulance service in Finland and later from 1941 to 1943 with the Finnish Army. In 1940 he was employed by the (then neutral) United States at their Berlin Embassy to monitor conditions of Allied Prisoners held in German camps. In 1945 he served as Denmark's representative for the Red Cross, in the evacuation of Danish and Norwegian prisoners in Germany with \\"de hvide busser\\", or \\"the White Buses\\", a transport organization that brought Danish and Norwegian concentration camp prisoners from Germany to Sweden during the last months of World War II. From 1950 to 1951 he led the second part of the 3rd Danish Central Asian Expedition, which included travelling through the Rupshu region of the Indian Himalayas.

For example, a body is made up of its constituent organs, and a society is made up of its constituent social roles. Organic unity was propounded by the philosopher Plato as a theory of literature. He explored the idea in such works as The Republic, Phaedrus, and Gorgias. But it was Aristotle, one of Plato's students, who advanced the idea and discussed it more explicitly. In Aristotle's Poetics he likened drama narrative's and action to organic form, presenting it as ‚Äúa complete whole, with its several incidents so closely connected that the transposal or withdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate the whole.‚Äù Plato is suggesting removing all love interest, wit, conventional expectations, rhetoric or ornament out of a literary criticism and philosophy. Plato's Republic takes the natural principle birds of a feather flock together as a premise for organic form. In Poetics (c. 335 BCE), Aristotle describes organic unity by explaining how writing relies internally on narration and drama to be cohesive; but without balance between the two sides, the work suffers. The main theme of organic unity relies on a free spirited style of writing and by following any guidelines or genre-based habits, the true nature of a work becomes stifled and unreliable on an artistic plane.(Encyclop√¶dia Britannica) The concept of organic unity gained popularity through the New Critics movement. Cleanth Brooks (1906‚Äì94) played an integral role in modernizing the organic unity principle. In The Well Wrought Urn, Brooks used the poem \\"The Canonization\\" by John Donne as an example to relate the importance of a work‚Äôs ability to flow and maintain a theme, so that the work gains momentum from beginning to end. Organic unity is the common thread that keeps a theme from becoming broken and disjointed as a work moves forward.(Brooks) See also * Organicism * Unity of opposites * The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (1947) References Category:Literary concepts ","title":"Organic unity"},{"id":"10862501","text":"Grand trait√© d‚Äôinstrumentation et d‚Äôorchestration modernes, abbreviated in English as the Treatise on Instrumentation (sometimes Treatise on Orchestration) is a technical study of Western musical instruments written by Hector Berlioz. It was first published in 1844 after being serialised in many parts prior to this date and had a chapter added by Berlioz on conducting in 1855. In 1904, Richard Strauss was asked to update the text to include some modern instruments and added musical examples from Wagner, and in 1905 the updated Treatise with a new preface by Strauss was published in German.Instrumentationslehre, Hector Berlioz and Richard Strauss, CF Peters, Edition Peters 3120, Leipzig 1905 The 1905 edition was translated into English in 1948. The book discusses the various technical aspects of instruments, such as chromatic range, tone quality, and limitations. An explanation of the role of particular instruments within the orchestra is also provided. The book also provides orchestral excerpts from classical scores to give examples of techniques discussed. These examples are sometimes of works by Berlioz himself, while Mozart, Wagner, Beethoven, and Gluck are also frequently cited. Many composers studied the work closely, such as Mussorgsky, Mahler, R.

A favourite of Elizabeth I, he was Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and the Anglican Bishop of Killaloe. Birth John Ryder was born in 1562, the son of Edward de Rythre of Carrington, Cheshire. His great-grandfather, Thomas de Rythre (d.1552) of Scarcroft, was Cofferer to the Household of King Edward VI and a first cousin of Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, through their grandfather Sir William de Rythre (1408‚Äì1476) of Ryther Castle, Scarcroft and Harewood Castle. Bishop Ryder was the first of his family to spell his name Ryder, rather than de Rythre/Ryther. His first cousin, Mary Ryther (daughter of the Lord Mayor of London) and her husband Sir Thomas Lake were the great-grandparents of the Duchess of Chandos. Career in the Church Ryder was educated at Jesus College, Oxford (B.A, M.A.).[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/alumni- oxon/1500-1714/pp1277-1295 Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Rokeby-Ryves] Afterwards he was Rector of Bermondsey (1581‚Äì1583) and of South Ockendon (1583‚Äì1590). At Oxford, 1589, he published his English-Latin Dictionary. He added over four thousand words which hitherto had no record of translation. In this huge undertaking, he was greatly aided by his friend Henry Radclyffe, 4th Earl of Sussex. Soon afterwards he published an account of the Spanish Armada in Ireland. Through his relation, William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, he was appointed to the valuable living of Winwick, Lancashire. Ryder also held the patronage of Elizabeth I of England and was described as \\"a great, personal favourite\\" of hers. Through her he was first appointed to a prebend in the Chapter of Dublin to pacify the more senior clerics in Ireland so that he could be officially eligible for the position of Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, which the Queen desired for him. In 1597, following the death of Bishop Richard Meredith and in accordance with Her Majesty's wishes, he was appointed Dean of St. Patrick's, a position he later exchanged for that of Archdeacon of Meath in 1608. In 1598, the Queen gave him the Prebendary of Geashill, which fell under the Cathedral of Kildare. In 1612, he was consecrated Bishop of Killaloe, a position he held until his death, 12 November 1632. He is buried at Killaloe Cathedral, Co. Clare. He left behind him the \\"character of a learned and religious prelate\\". Scholarship Between 1599 and 1614 Ryder continued a public controversy with Henry Fitzsimon, an Irish Jesuit, on the subject of the relationship between contemporary Protestantism and the Christianity of the early Church. Although Fitzsimon ran the risk of being prosecuted, and potentially sentenced to death, for heresy or treason, he was \\"merely bundled out of the country\\", suggesting, it has been said, that, \\"Dublin would appear to have been a safer place to voice dissent than London, Paris, or Rome\\" (Brian Jackson, in Ciaran Brady and Jane Ohlmeyer, eds, British Interventions in Early Modern Ireland [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005], p. 103).From 1599 to 1614, Ryder had been joined by the Primate of All Ireland, James Ussher, and Meredith Hanmer in succeeding to have Fitzsimon expelled from Ireland. Besides his famous English-Latin Dictionary (1589) and Account of the Spanish Armada in Ireland, Ryder was the author of two further publications: A Friendly Caveat to Irish Catholiques Concerning Christ's Corporall Presence etc. (1602) and A Claim of Antiquity in behalf of the Protestant Religion (London, 1608). He published a postscript to the latter following an attack by his opponent in this controversy, Henry Fitzsimon. Family Ryder was married to Fridswold Crosby, who died 26 January 1615, the daughter of Edward Crosby of Crosby Place, Staffordshire. Their only son, Thomas Ryder, was Secretary to the British Legation at Paris and the father of Henry Ryder (d.1695) of Wyanstown, Co. Dublin who also became the Bishop of Killaloe.

He organized the Greek defensive lines during the Battle of Pindus that led to Italian defeat in the first stage of the Greco-Italian War of 1940. Early life He was born in the village of Kechrianika outside of Sparta, Laconia prefecture in 1897. After graduating from military school, he saw action in World War I, distinguishing himself in the battle of Skra-di- Legen and the battle of Doiran. After taking part in the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922), Davakis wrote a number of works on military history and armoured warfare while also teaching at military academies. Greco-Italian War Davakis was a colonel when Italy attacked Greece on 28 October 1940. As commander of the Pindus detachment (ŒëœÄœåœÉœÄŒ±œÉŒºŒ± Œ†ŒØŒΩŒ¥ŒøœÖ), he successfully repelled the Italian Julia Alpine Division's attack in late October 1940 but was seriously injured in November of the same year, when he counter-attacked, nearly destroying it. Davakis' detachment, composed of two infantry battalions of the 51st Infantry Regiment, one cavalry troop and one artillery battery, was the first Greek unit that received the \\"blow\\" of the Italian invasion. Davakis' forces were overstretched, covering a 30 km front on mountainous terrain. His unit resisted the Julia Division's advance for two days, by which time sufficient reinforcements could be brought up to contain and defeat the Italians. Wounding and death On 2 November 1940, near the village of Samarina, while directing his unit, Davakis was hit in the chest suffering serious lung injury and lapsing into a coma. Although he regained consciousness two days later, he remained hospitalized in battlefield. In December 1942, he was arrested by the Italian occupation authorities, along with other Greek officers, suspected of participation in the Greek Resistance. The officers were to be shipped to POW camps in Italy on the liner Citt√† di Genova, but the ship was torpedoed and sank off southern Albania in January 1943.

Biography=Early years Frank Varrichione was born January 14, 1932 at Natick, Massachusetts.\\"Frank Varrichione: Career Stats,\\" National Football League, www.nfl.com/ His parents, Joseph and Mary Varrichione, were born in Italy and emigrated to the United States in 1913 ‚Äî first arriving in Boston before moving slightly more than 20 miles inland to the town of Natick.Jim Sargent, \\"Frank Varrichione,\\" The Coffin Corner, vol. 21, no. 5 (1999), pg. 1. He was the youngest of ten children in a Roman Catholic family. Large and strong from his early boyhood years, Varrichione took up football as a 9th grade student at Natick High School. He graduated early and then was enrolled in a Catholic prep school, St. Thomas Acquinas in Rochester, New York, where he attracted the attention of recruiters for the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Collegiate career Following graduation at St. Thomas Acquinas, Varrichione was enrolled on scholarship to Notre Dame. He was a 210-pound Freshman on the 1951 team, slated for immediate use on a depleted offensive line for what was expected to be one of the youngest varsity teams in school history.Hugh Fullerton, Jr., \\"'51 Teams May Be Youngest in Irish History,\\" Ironwood Daily Globe, May 9, 1951, pg. 7.

Pittsburgh Steelers As a four-year starter for the high-profile Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Varrichione was a highly sought-after player in the 1955 NFL Draft. He was selected in the 1st Round by the Pittsburgh Steelers, the league's 6th pick overall, and the first offensive lineman chosen.\\"1955 NFL Draft,\\" Pro-Football Reference.com, www.pro-football-reference.com/ Informed of his selection by a Pittsburgh newspaper writer via telephone, Varrichione predicted no difficulty in coming to financial terms with the Steelers and indicated a desire to play professional football for \\"as long as I can last.\\"Varrichione Happy Over Choice by Steeler Club: Irish Tackle Predicts No Contract Trouble,\\" Monongahela [PA] Daily Republican, January 25, 1955, pg. 2.

The six-year veteran Pro Bowler seemed poised to finish his career in Steeler black and gold. Los Angeles Rams In April 1961, Varrichione's world was turned upside down when the Pittsburgh Steelers with which he had just signed a three-year deal traded his contract to the Los Angeles Rams for that of defensive tackle Lou Michaels, a 1958 first round pick who was just starting to come into his own as an NFL defensive star.AP, \\"Rams Trade Michaels for Frank Varrichione,\\" April 28, 1961, pg. 11. The Steelers had hated to part company with a top offensive lineman like Varrichione, head coach Buddy Parker told the press at the time of the transaction, but the deal had to be done to provide vitally needed defensive strength.UPI, \\"Tackle Traded to Los Angeles,\\" Zanesville [OH] Times Recorder, April 30, 1961, pg. 31. The exchange was an even one, with no other considerations changing hands. It would be the Rams with whom Varrichione played the rest of his career. Due to family considerations, Varrichione threatened retirement following the 1961 season.\\"Varrichione May Give Up Football,\\" December 18, 1961, pg. 18. \\"My wife is expecting her fourth child, and this traveling around is awfully tough,\\" he told the press. \\"She doesn't want me to play anymore.\\" Despite initially telling Rams general manager Elroy \\"Crazylegs\\" Hirsch that he planned to quit, Varrichione eventually relented and by the start of training camp for the 1962 campaign, he was ready to don the blue and gold of the Rams again. Together with his Rams teammate Joe Carollo, a fellow Notre Dame alum, Varrichione played every single offensive play of the 1963 NFL season ‚Äî 14 games in all.Paul Zimmerman, \\"Los Angeles Rams,\\" in William H.

During his Steeler playing days he ran a drive-in restaurant in Natick, while he took to selling real estate during the off season in his Ram playing days. Varrichone retired from football in 1965 and moved to Michigan, where he worked in sales for a trucking firm. After three years there, Varrichione returned to Natick to take over the family's paint contracting business there. He retired briefly in 1986 but came back two years later to run a coffee shop with his wife, finally retiring for good in 1992. In 1995 Varrichione was named to the Boston section of the Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame.Sargent, \\"Frank Varrichione,\\" pg. 5. Varrichione died on January 6, 2018, at the age of 85.

The hospital was established in 1899 as Alice Home on the campus of Lake Forest College, and in 1942 a new hospital was built in its current location as Lake Forest Hospital. On February 1, 2010, Lake Forest Hospital completed an affiliation agreement with Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and became Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital. The 201-bed hospital is on a campus in Lake Forest and provides a comprehensive array of inpatient and outpatient medical and surgical services. At the main campus in Lake Forest, services include an inpatient hospital, a women's center providing maternity and breast care services, a health and fitness center and a nursing care facility. The hospital has 700 board-certified physicians specializing in 90 specialties on its medical staff. Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital is a partner of Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, one of the nation‚Äôs top-ranked children‚Äôs hospitals. Lurie Children's Outpatient Center and Lurie Children's hospitalists and neonatologists provide infant and pediatric care 24 hours a day to patients at Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital.  History = Alice Home  In 1882, no hospital existed in Lake Forest, Illinois, a small town best known as a summer getaway for Chicago residents. Dr. Alfred C. Haven, a recent newcomer to the town, was Lake Forest's only physician, and the closest hospital was located in Waukegan, Illinois. With the assistance of James G.K. McClure, Lake Forest University (later known as Lake Forest College) President and First Presbyterian Church Pastor, Dr. Haven raised both financial backing and public support for a hospital on the Lake Forest University campus. In 1889, Alice Home opened as the community hospital. In 1908, Alice Home expanded by building Contagious Hospital, an isolating, separate hospital to care for patients affected by outbreaks of tuberculosis, scarlet fever, typhoid, measles, mumps, diphtheria and whooping cough. In 1918, the Hospital Association of Lake Forest was certified as a legally organized not-for-profit organization, independent of Lake Forest College. In 1921, this association, along with the City of Lake Forest, Lake Forest College, and Alice Home and Contagious Hospital trustees, agreed to consolidate Alice Home and Contagious Hospital into one entity.  Lake Forest Hospital  By 1940, Lake Forest had radically changed from a summer destination to a year-round, permanent residence for many families. The significant increase in population strained Alice Home's resources. Between 1939 and 1940, the clinical staff at Alice Home managed more than 600 operations, 2,000 outpatients and 3,000 lab tests. Without the ability to expand further onto the college campus, community members and hospital staff began considering the establishment of a new, larger institution to meet these growing needs. Mrs. Mary Dick, wife of the late Albert Blake Dick Sr., lived alone on the Westmoreland Farm (named after the family's origins in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania) in Lake Forest, Illinois. In 1940, A.B. Dick Jr., her son, successfully convinced his mother that 23 acres of the family farmland ought to be donated for the new hospital. The road leading to the hospital was renamed Westmoreland Road in honor of the Dick family's generosity. Despite war rations, 300 individuals donated $800,000 for the construction of the hospital, including John G. Shedd and the McCormick families, and Lake Forest Hospital opened on November 1, 1942. By 1959, Lake Forest Hospital expanded from 65 to 101 beds and incorporated a hospital pharmacy. Two new wings were added at the west end of the hospital in 1967. The City of Lake Forest continued to expand and the hospital provided the growing region with new technology and specialized care. In the late 1960s, Lake Forest Hospital acquired a cobalt machine to improve cancer treatment, an advancement unheard of for a community hospital at the time. By 1979, Lake Forest Hospital established the Westmoreland Long-term Care Center (now Westmoreland Nursing Center), speech and audiology departments, the Center for Pain Treatment and Rehabilitation and the department for Blood Component Therapy. With the opening of the McGaw Medical Building in 1981, Lake Forest Hospital became the first comprehensive healthcare campus in the region. By the late 1980s, Lake Forest Hospital consolidated outpatient surgical services, established the first cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation program in Lake County, constructed its emergency helipad, upgraded radiology to include nuclear medicine and achieved a Level II trauma designation. Off- campus medical facilities, providing closer access to care, included the addition of a facility in Vernon Hills in 1986 and medical offices in Gurnee and Libertyville in 1991 and 1997, respectively. In a continuing effort to move away from treating disease and towards fostering holistic health, the hospital opened two health and fitness centers: one on the Lake Forest Hospital campus (1994) and another in Lindenhurst (2000) In 2004, the Hunter Family Center for Women's Health, encompassing the Waud Family Maternity Services and the Posy Krehbiel Breast Care Center, opened. In 2004, the hospital opened an outpatient facility in Grayslake. The new campus offered acute care delivered by board-certified emergency room physicians, audiology and speech therapy, imaging, cardiac and laboratory testing, physical and occupational therapy, and physician offices. Less than six years after opening, the Grayslake Acute Care Center became an Emergency Center. In 2010, a new Cancer Center was added and in 2011 a Surgery Center opened at the campus. On April 1, 2009, the hospital expanded its network of diagnostic imaging centers, adding services in Gurnee-Tower Court, Libertyville, and Glenview.  Northwestern Memorial HealthCare affiliation  On February 1, 2010, Lake Forest Hospital and Northwestern Memorial HealthCare announced an affiliation agreement to form a premier integrated healthcare system for Chicago. Lake Forest Hospital was renamed Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital and became a subsidiary of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare.  Locations and services = Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital  The main hospital is located on a 160-acre campus at 660 North Westmoreland Road in Lake Forest. Also on the campus is the Westmoreland Nursing Center, Bays (900) Medical Office Building, McGaw (800) Medical Office Building, 700 Medical Office Buildings, Dearhaven Child Care and Learning Center, and the Lake Forest Health & Fitness Center.  Northwestern Grayslake  The Northwestern Grayslake campus facility opened in 2004. Located at 1475 East Belvidere Road (Route 120) in Grayslake, Illinois, this location evolved quickly from an acute care center to a full-service outpatient campus. This location offers an Emergency Center, a Cancer Center and a Surgery Center. Additional outpatient services include: * Audiology * Diagnostic Cardiology * Diagnostic Imaging * Emergency Center * Laboratory Services * Rehabilitative Services * Speech Pathology  Satellite medical offices  Outpatient clinical services are delivered at facilities in Glenview, Gurnee-Brookside, Gurnee-Tower Court, Libertyville, Lindenhurst and Vernon Hills.  Health & fitness centers  Lake Forest Health & Fitness Center, located on the campus of Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital, and Lindenhurst Health & Fitness Center in Lindenhurst, Illinois are both owned and operated by the hospital.  Recognition & awards  For eight consecutive years, Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital has been named the Consumer Choice Hospital for Lake and Kenosha counties according to a survey by National Research Corporation for having the best doctors, best image and reputation, best overall quality and being the most preferred for all health needs. In 2011, Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital received two designations for its breast imaging facilities and its overall breast care. The hospital was awarded the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Accreditation. In addition, the hospital and Northwestern Grayslake were given a full three-year accreditation designation by the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC). In 2010, Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital earned Magnet Recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). Only six percent of hospitals across the country, and fewer than 400 hospitals worldwide, have achieved this distinction. The hospital offers an accredited Outpatient Diabetes Education Program, certified by the American Association of Diabetes Education. The program is the first in Illinois to receive this recognition. The Wellness 180Àö program at Lake Forest Health & Fitness Center won a 2010 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Medical Fitness Association for its innovation in warding off heart disease and Type II Diabetes.

His poetry evolved from romanticism to a reflective direction and conceptual character. He was greatly influenced by French poetry of the time and he introduced Rub√©n Dar√≠o to adapt the Alexandrian verse to the Castilian metre in addition to entering the story, poetry and essays. The trajectory of his poetry is similar to the one of his theater, as he demonstrates in his dramas Jupiter (1885), Ursino (1889), Count of San Salvador or the God of the things (1901), Lucia Lasso or the Pirates (1914) and the Ivory Tower (1920), and the dramatic poem Princess Catal√° (1944).  Childhood  A son of Francisco Antonio Gavidia and of Eloisa Guandique de Gavidia, was born in the municipality of Cacahuatique, today Ciudad Barrios, San Miguel, El Salvador. Due to the loss of the original birth certificate, there was a debate about the year of his birth. According to Hugo Lindo, the year 1865 was chosen because there were indications that supported this theory, but there are other data that approach the year to 1863. In fact, according to a Decree of the Legislative Assembly of the Republic of El Salvador, the latter is recognized as the date of his birth. Due to the death of his mother, when it counted on 8 years of age, Francisco Gavidia moved to the property of his father located in the north of the San Miguel department of San Miguel, in the present municipality of Ciudad Barrios. In 1880, he obtained the Bachelor's degree in Sciences and Letters, and then moved to San Salvador where he entered the Faculty of Jurisprudence of the University of El Salvador. However, he left the race after a year, to become a self-taught.  Links with Rub√©n Dar√≠o  By 1882, he was a member of the literary group \\"La Juventud\\" and already showed a strong interest in French verses. It was in that same year, according to numerous sources, that knew to Rub√©n Dar√≠o. Both developed a strong friendship until the point that in 1890, Gavidia was godfather of weddings of Dar√≠o.  Career  Countless books in Spanish and French passed through his hands. In order to recover from the illness caused by overwork and mental fatigue resulting from his intense intellectual activity, he was sent to Paris by order of the president Rafael Zald√≠var. Gavidia had a large cultural heritage and was able to find a place in the city of Gavidia. It mentions that he dominated perfectly the German, French, English, Italian, Portuguese, Hebrew, Latin and Greek, besides the Mayan-Quich√© language for which he got to develop a grammar in order to popularize the language. He also developed a language, called \\"Salvador\\", which sought to become universal, but received very little support from the intellectuals of his time, despite everything, Gavidia published some poems in \\"Los Argonautas\\" \\"Language Salvador\\", among which stand out \\"The Argonauts\\" and \\"A Marconi\\". The year 1887 contracted marriage with the daughter of the journalist Carlos Bonilla. A year later, he founded the newspaper \\"El semanario noticioso\\", which was published every Thursday, as well as the Academy of Sciences and Fine Arts of San Salvador. After the overthrow of the general Francisco Men√©ndez Valdivieso, Gavidia exiled of the country and continued his journalistic activity in Costa Rica, where he was director of \\"La Prensa Libre\\" between 1891 and 1892; and later in Guatemala worked like co-redactor of \\"El bien p√∫blico\\" of the city of Quetzaltenango. When he returned to El Salvador, he served as editor of the Diario Oficial (1894), Director of Primary Public Education (1896) and Minister of Public Instruction (1898). In 1895 he founded the Parliamentary Party, and also served as a professor at the Normal School of Ladies, the National Institute of Men, and the University of El Salvador. He founded the magazine Los Andes. From 1906 to 1919, he held the position of titular director of the National Library Francisco Gavidia. In 1912, he became a member of the Ateneo of El Salvador.  Works  The work of Gavidia reaches encyclopedic proportions. He worked in poetry, theater, history, music, essay, pedagogy, philosophy, politics, journalism, literary criticism and translation. His vast knowledge was nurtured from classical literature, siglo de oro espa√±ol the Golden Age, French culture and his language, and the reading of German, Italian and Oriental authors. He came to create a new language to be universally understood, which had the name \\"Salvador Language\\". In addition, he was a precursor in the treatment of indigenous issues and ideologist of the unionismo centroamericano. In a country whose art received a strong European influence, Gavidia honored the Salvadoran identity and ethnic values, broke with that pattern and from there, other writers decided to follow that literary line. One can observe its influence in artists like Salarru√©, Claudia Lars and Arturo Ambrogi. He introduced the story with a literary identity typical of its reality, an amalgam of pre-Columbian Indian themes such as legends and myths, is also considered the precursor of Salvadoran theater. Between its dramaturgy stands Ursino, the tower of ivory and Jupiter. The longing for identity, freedom and justice is also reflected in his poetry, which at the time many failed to assimilate because the desire to universalize Salvadoran idiosyncrasy was a fact not understandable for his time and for his peers. Already in his work \\"Versos\\", he uses some of the main characteristics of vocabulary, rhythm and poetical metre that, soon after, would encode and to devote masterfully Rub√©n Dar√≠o. Subsequently, Gavidia evolved in the particular modulation of his own poetic voice, until he came to the cultivation of a conceptual reflection that reaches its maximum splendor in the poem entitled \\"S√≥teer o Tierra de preseas\\" (1949), a modern epic song that, to a large extent, constitutes his masterpiece and his great literary legacy. But between that initial romantic stage and this profound lyrical introspection of his age provecta fits a copious creative production and essay that went through many different stages and was contagious of multiple aesthetic trends. Indeed, Gavidia himself was able to evolve from a late romanticism (or a pre-modernist glimpse) into dramas such as \\"Jupiter\\" (1885) or \\"Ursino\\" (1889), to a conceptual epic manifested in the dramatic poem entitled La princesa Cital√° (1944). On average, there are some plays as different from one another, such as Conde de San Salvador or El Dios de las Cosas (1901), Luc√≠a Lasso o Los piratas (1914), La torre de marfil (1920) and H√©spero (1931). Some of his works are: * Poes√≠a (poetic booklet, 1877). * Versos (poetry, 1884). * Ursino (theater, 1887). * J√∫piter (theater, 1895). * The encomendero and other short stories (1901) * Study and summary of the Discourse on the method of Descartes, (1901). * Traditions (on the homonymous work of Ricardo Palma, 1901). * Count of San Salvador or the God of Las Casas (novel, 1901). * 1814 (ensayo, 1905). * Works (volume I, 1913). * Modern History of El Salvador (two volumes, 1917 and 1918). * Songbook of the XIX Century (1929-1930). * Tales and narrations (1931). * Hesperia (theater, 1931). * Speeches, studies and conferences (1941). * La princesa Cital√° (theater, 1946). * Tale of sailors ' (1947). * S√≥teer or Land of Preseas (1949).  Achievements  He is also known for being the advisor of the poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o, a pupil who shared sorrows and joys with the Salvadoran teacher, and who knew the experiment of Gavidia to adapt the Alexandrian verse to the Castilian metric, which gave rise to the modernist renovation of Spanish American poetry. Dario wrote in his autobiography: The Salvadoran government declared Francisco Gavidia as \\"Salvadoran merit√≠simo\\" in 1933 and in 1939 the city of San Miguel paid him a tribute that included the baptism with his name of the theater of the city. In 1937, Gavidia was a member of the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of El Salvador, Dependency of the League of Nations and in 1941 the University of El Salvador granted him the Doctorate Honoris Causa. At the end of his life, he was awarded the highest national award in El Salvador, the order \\"Jose Mat√≠as Delgado\\", which he received from the hands of President Oscar Osorio in his sickbed at Rosales Hospital, a few days before die.

Born in Ahuachap√°n, his only book is J√≠caras Tristes (Sad Vessels), a collection of 96 poems. It is one of the most published books of poetry in El Salvador. Espino died in San Salvador. His poetry has been described as part of the El Salvadoran development of costumbrismo. The author is widely read and commented on in El Salvador but not usually studied or analyzed in his poetical expression. Espino assumes the national historical problem of the clash of social strata by looking through the colors, flavors and perfumes in the land and the culture of the country at the time he wrote his poems. His book of poems has a poetic and delicate tone with lyrical vision; presented/displayed with a simple style that is easy to understand and feel, therefore, without formal complications. He wrote sonnets, romance and free verses. His work is very youthful and for that reason it may seem to lack creative vision according to some critics. The critics are wrong in such an opinion, of course, at least from the Salvadoran point of view. Espino's poetry is more descriptive and visual in it content than any other poetry of Salvadoran poets, maybe with the only exception of Salarru√©. An interesting note about Espino's poetry is that he did not live to see his poetry published.

History Jepara city views around the year 1650 People believed to have come from South Yunnan region migrated into the northern tip of Java during a time when Jepara was still separated by the Juwana Strait. 1858 map of Jepara In the 16th century, Jepara was an important port; in early 1513, its king, Yunnus (Pati Unus) led an attack against Portuguese Malacca. His force is said to have been made up of one hundred ships and 5000 men from Jepara and Palembang but was defeated. Between 1518 and 1521 he apparently ruled over Demak. The rule of Ratu ('Queen') Kalinyamat in the latter 16th century was, however, Jepara's most influential. Jepara again attacked Malacca in 1551 this time with Johor but was defeated, and in 1574 besieged Malacca for three months. It was the site of an English Fort in the 17th century. It is the birthplace of Indonesian national heroine Kartini.
