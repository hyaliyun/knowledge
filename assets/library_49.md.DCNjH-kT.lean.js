Murray created the first MindTravel experience in 2013. He invited a group to his living room for a live performance of his provocative, improvisational, real-time compositions at the piano and then asked them what they thought of the experience. Moved by their emotional response and the power of music to take the group on a deep inner journey, he moved forward to bring it to the world. Whether it‚Äôs for 100 people or 1000 people, this magical experience takes audiences on a profound journey as composer and pianist Murray Hidary‚Äôs real-time compositions are beamed directly into the MindTravel headphones that the audience wears. It‚Äôs a perfect way to take in the majestic surroundings while also experiencing a musical revelation spontaneously improvised, infused with wisdom traditions, theoretical physics and the power of communal elevation. At its core, MindTravel creates the space and permission to feel and connect. It is an exploration of the notion that bringing the lessons of music into our daily lives can radically improve our clarity, our ability to reflect and relax, and that with music as our teacher ‚Äì we can peel back layers of our Self yet unseen.

Cast=Gallery 63 Staff * Paul Brown - Owner. Paul is a second-generation auction house owner. He at first had no desire to pursue it as a career but changed his mind after working at a car wash and earning a college degree in literature. Paul took a job with his father's Atlanta-based auction house in 1989. In 2005 he bought Gallery 63, just north of the Atlanta city limits. * Cindy Shook - Manager. Cindy and Paul first worked together at his father's auction house in the early 1990s. She functions as both office manager and inventory manager, tagging and cataloging items for each sale. On August 16th, 2020, Cindy was killed in a single engine plane crash off the coast of Alaska. * Jon Hammond - Assistant Manager/Picker. As a \\"picker\\" Jon not only helps process items at the Gallery but will often go in search of items to sell on consignment. A college English major, he bested nearly one hundred other applicants for the position of assistant manager. * Delfino Ramos - Repairman. Often items brought to the auction house are in need of cleanup or repairs‚Äîboth major and minor‚Äîto increase their sale value. Delfino has been with Gallery 63 since Paul Brown purchased the business. * Jason Brooks and Guerry Wise - Auctioneers. Recurring cast * Bob Brown - Paul's father and owner of the Red Baron antique store/auction house (where Paul worked and learned the auction business in his youth). Bob was a semi-regular on the show in the first two seasons, and featured in the opening. * Elijah Brown - Paul's son and Bob's grandson. Elijah works at Gallery 63 part-time as an assistant to Cindy and Jon, and attends high school. He is usually seen in the background holding items up for the bidders to see at the auctions, and also does some office work. He has been featured in a few episodes, learning the auction business from his father and grandfather. * Steve and Ernie Garrett - A pair of antique pickers from Michigan, the Garrett brothers debuted on the show in season 3. They tour the country looking for items to buy, and then sell them at the auctions for profit. * Dr. Lori - The Ph.D. antiques appraiser (Dr. Lori Verderame, the former museum director and university professor) who evaluates many different types of objects. Dr. Lori tells the Gallery 63 staff about the history of an object and what bidders should pay for the object at the auction. She appraises approximately 20,000 objects a year to audiences nationwide. Dr. Lori debuted on the show in Season 3. * Greg from Greg's Vintage Guitars Atlanta has been on the show several times giving advice and appraisal information to the staff when they have received vintage and newer guitars and other stringed instruments to sell at the auctions.

The company provides a collaborative engineering forum for companies to share engineering resource and funding to solve common problems on Arm software. Linaro works on software that is close to the silicon such as kernel, multimedia, power management, graphics and security. The company aims to provide stable, tested tools and code for multiple software distributions to use to reduce low-level fragmentation of embedded Linux software. It also provides engineering and investment in upstream open source projects and support to silicon companies in upstreaming code to be used with their system-on-a-chips (SoC). Since the 3.10 Linux kernel release, Linaro has consistently been listed in the top ten contributors to the Linux Kernel. Every six months, Linaro hosts the engineering conference Linaro Connect, where leading hardware and software companies in the Arm ecosystem come together to collaborate, hack and develop technical road maps and strategy.  History  The founding of Linaro was announced at Computex in June 2010 by Arm, Freescale Semiconductor, IBM, Samsung, ST-Ericsson, and Texas Instruments in a joint press conference. Linaro was formed to provide ‚Äùnew resources and industry alignment for open source software developers using Linux on the world‚Äôs most sophisticated semiconductor System-on-Chips (SoCs).‚Äù The aim was to enable device manufacturers to get products to market faster by freeing up engineering time spent on non-differentiating, low-level software, speeding up development time and improving performance. Since its formation, Linaro has continued to deliver tools, security and Linux kernel quality to the Arm ecosystem as a whole. In addition, the company has created groups tasked with addressing fragmentation in the following market segments: Datacenter & Cloud, IoT & Embedded, Edge & Fog Computing, Consumer (Android), Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Vehicles. In 2012, Linaro formed the Linaro Datacenter & Cloud Group (formerly known as the Linaro Enterprise Group) to drive adoption of Arm in the server market. In February 2013, Linaro launched the Linaro Networking Group, tasked with ‚Äúaccelerating Linux development for Arm processors in cloud and mobile infrastructure‚Äù. This group went on to start the OpenDataPlane initiative which ‚Äúdefined a set of APIs to be used across the full range of processor architectures and networking offloads available‚Äù. In 2018, project governance of the OpenDataPlane project was moved to the Openfastpath Foundation. In February 2014, Linaro formed the Linaro Security Working group to ‚Äúcreate open source Android and Linux reference designs for Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology.‚Äù Shortly after its formation, the Security Working Group took over project governance of OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment), initially a proprietary TEE project developed by ST-Ericsson. In May 2014, Linaro launched the Linaro Digital Home Group, focused on Arm-based media gateways and STBs (Set Top Boxes). A few months later in July 2014, the Linaro Consumer Group (formerly known as the Linaro Mobile Group) was formed to consolidate and optimize open source software for mobile platforms on Arm. In 2015, Linaro launched the 96Boards initiative, the ‚Äúfirst open hardware specification that provides a platform for the delivery of compatible low cost, small footprint 32-bit and 64-bit Cortex-A boards from the full range of Arm SoC vendors‚Äù In 2016, Linaro launched the Linaro IoT and Embedded Group, with the aim of developing ‚Äúend-to-end open source reference software for IoT devices and applications.‚Äù In 2018, Linaro restructured the engineering groups to align with the technological landscape. As a result, the Linaro Networking Group and the Linaro Digital Home Group were both disbanded and the Linaro Edge & Fog Computing Group created. Linaro also launched two strategic initiatives - one focused on Artificial Intelligence and one focused on Autonomous Vehicles. In 2019, Li Gong was appointed Linaro CEO.  Engineering Activities = Arm ecosystem Engineering  Linaro's Core Engineering Team is focused on co- maintaining the Arm ecosystem. The team works directly with upstream projects supporting core technologies including Linux Kernel core features, power management, security, toolchain support (both GCC and LLVM) and multimedia features. It makes regular public releases along with a number of reference builds of kernels and userspace for various Linux distributions (including Android and Ubuntu) on member SoCs. The Core Engineering team also maintains the automated testing system called LAVA (Linaro Automated Validation Architecture) which Linaro developed. LAVA is for automated testing of the open source components that are used in the major Linux-based software platforms. A lab running LAVA and a wide variety of Arm hardware is run for the use of Linaro and member company engineers.  Segment specific engineering  The remaining work done by Linaro is split into groups focusing on particular markets where Arm processors are used. These include: = Datacenter & Cloud = The Linaro Datacenter & Cloud Group (LDCG) focuses on Linux development for Arm servers. The team's mission is to bring competing companies together to work on common solutions to problems and enable OEM's, commercial Linux providers and System on Chip (SOC) vendors to collaborate in a neutral environment on the development of the core software needed by the rapidly emerging market for low-power hyperscale servers. Since its formation, the group has evolved, now also enabling and optimizing applications and projects like Apache ODPi, OpenStack, Ceph and CNCF. In 2016, Linaro announced the launch of the Linaro Developer Cloud, where engineers can access Arm Powered, server-class hardware running development environments such as Debian, CentOS, Ubuntu and RHEL. The initiative is managed by the Linaro Datacenter & Cloud Group. = Edge & Fog Computing = The Linaro Edge & Fog Computing Group (LEDGE) is working to accelerate the adoption of Arm technologies in Edge & Fog Computing ecosystems. = Consumer = The Linaro Consumer Group (LCG) focuses on development for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. The primary aim of the group is to improve the AOSP ecosystem through collaborative activities that benefit members across all Android use cases. = IoT & Embedded = In September 2016 Linaro announced the Linaro IoT and Embedded Group (LITE) that focuses on delivering end to end open source reference software for more secure connected products, ranging from sensors and connected controllers to smart devices and gateways, for the industrial and consumer markets. = HPC = Linaro's mission in HPC is to drive the Adoption of Arm in HPC through standardisation, interoperability, orchestration and use case development. This involves automating OpenHPC CI and releases, compiler performance, SVE enablement and hardware deployment. = Artificial Intelligence = Linaro launched the Artificial Intelligence Initiative in 2018 with the aim of providing best-in-class Deep Learning performance by leveraging Neural Network acceleration in IP and SoCs from the Arm ecosystem. = Autonomous Vehicles = Linaro created the Autonomous Vehicles initiative in order to provide a collaborative space where automotive industry can come together to work on common problems.  96Boards  In February 2015, Linaro formed the Linaro Community Boards Group (LCG) to support the new 96Boards initiative. 96Boards is an open platform specification that provides a platform for the delivery of compatible low- cost, small footprint 32-bit and 64-bit Cortex-A boards. A fixed set of minimum interfaces are required by the specifications, for example the Consumer Edition (CE) specification requires standard USB, micro-SD, HDMI, power, and low- and high-speed peripheral connectors. Vendors may add customized hardware and feature sets provided the form factor and minimum set of interfaces are supported. Since the original Consumer Edition (CE) release there have been specifications for Enterprise (EE), IoT (IE) and SoM developed. On April 27, 2017, a board adhering to the 96Board Consumer Edition Open Standard became a development platform for the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). = Specifications and implementations = As of August 2019, there are four published 96Boards specifications for low-cost Armv7-A and Armv8-A development boards: * The Consumer Edition (CE) targets the mobile, embedded and digital home segments. * The Enterprise Edition (EE) targets the networking and server segments. * The Internet of Things Edition (IE) is designed to support development in the IoT space. *The SoM Edition (SoM) is focused on Wireless and Compute solutions.  Platforms  Linaro runs and continuously tests its output on member platforms. For the Armv7-A code, these include TI's OMAP 3 and OMAP 4, Samsung's Exynos, and ST- Ericsson's NovaThor U8500. For development on platforms prior to silicon availability, e.g. big.LITTLE development starting at the end of 2011 and Armv8-A work begun in 2012.  Products  There are two types of software downloads available from Linaro: # There are monthly versions of upstream software, such as GCC or QEMU. # Linaro maintains public staging trees of upstream code they are working on.  License  All code developed within Linaro working groups is open source and therefore available under standard Open Source Initiative (OSI) license terms.

History For much of the 20th century, rail transport in Europe was dominated by national monopolies; these effectively excluded competitors from their networks. Starting in 1991, the EU developed legislation to open railways up to competition, which would help them regain modal share from road and air transport. Legislation=Directive 2004/49/EC 2004/49/EC is the Railway Safety Directive; it has since been amended by Directive 2008/110/EC. It harmonised safety principles, including procedures for granting safety approval to railway operators and infrastructure owners. Directive 2004/50/EC Directive 2004/50/EC harmonised interoperability requirements, particularly for high-speed rail. It amended Directives 96/48 and 2001/16; it has since been updated by 2008/57/EC. Directive 2004/51/EC Directive 2004/51/EC allowed open access for freight services, nationally and internationally, starting in January 2007 Regulation (EC) 881/2004 Regulation 881/2004 created the European Railway Agency, to coordinate safety and interoperability efforts.

It is characterized by numerous naps throughout the 24-hour period, no main nighttime sleep episode and irregularity from day to day. Sufferers have no pattern of when they are awake or asleep, may have poor quality sleep, and often may be very sleepy while they are awake. The total time asleep per 24 hours is normal for the person's age. The disorder is serious‚Äîan invisible disability. It can create social, familial, and work problems, making it hard for a person to maintain relationships and responsibilities, and may make a person home-bound and isolated. Causes ISWD has various causes, including neurological disorders such as dementia (particularly Alzheimer's Disease), brain damage, or intellectual disabilities. It is thought that sufferers have a weak circadian clock. The risk for the disorder increases with age, but only due to increased prevalence of co-morbid medical disorders. Diagnosis A sleep diary with nighttime in the middle and the weekend in the middle, to better notice trends A sleep diary should be kept to aid in diagnosis and for chronicling the sleep schedule during treatment. Other ways to monitor the sleep schedule are actigraphy or use of a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine that can log sleeping times The following are possible warning signs: * sleeping off and on in a series of naps during the day and at night, with no regular pattern but with normal total sleep time, * difficulty getting restorative sleep, and * excessive daytime sleepiness. Because of the changes in sleep/wake time, and because this is a rare disorder, initially it can seem like another circadian rhythm sleep disorder such as non-24-hour sleep‚Äìwake disorder or like insomnia. Initial visit with sleep physician A physician specializing in sleep medicine may ask patients about their medical history; for example: neurological problems, prescription or non-prescription medications taken, alcohol use, family history, and any other sleep problems. A thorough medical and neurological exam is indicated. The patient will be asked to complete a sleep diary, recording natural sleep and wake up times, over several weeks. Sleep rating with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale may be used. Medical testing A neurological condition or another medical problem may be suspected, in which case, blood tests, a CT scan or an MRI may be used. An overnight sleep study is usually not needed to detect this disorder, but may be indicated if other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder, seem likely. The overnight sleep study is called polysomnography. It charts brain waves, heart beat, muscle activity, and breathing during sleep. It also records arm and leg movement. It will show if there are other sleep disorders that are causing or increasing the problems with ISWD. Management Treatment for irregular sleep‚Äìwake rhythm tries to enable the body clock in the brain, such that a normal long sleep period at night can be achieved. Education about sleep hygiene is important, and counseling can be helpful. Melatonin, vitamin B12, sleep aids, wake aids, and other medications may also be used. Exposure to light during the daytime and activities occurring at regular times each day may help to restore a normal rhythm. The management of this disorder may vary for different subgroups of patients. Affected individuals with dementia should not be prescribed sleep- promoting medications (sedatives) for ISWD due to the increased prevalence of adverse effects in this group outweighing the possible benefits. Circadian rhythm labeled Research There is currently a great deal of active research on various aspects of circadian rhythm; this often occurs at major universities in conjunction with sleep research clinics at major hospitals. An example is the program with Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. This research includes programs that are staffed by researchers from various departments at the university, including psychiatry, neurology, chemistry, biology. Other major sleep research centers are in Tel Aviv in Israel, Munich in Germany and in Japan. A wide variety of sleep disorders are actively being researched. Measuring body temperature or melatonin levels may be used. Some hospitals do blood tests for melatonin levels. Saliva tests for melatonin are now available for online purchase; its metabolites can also be tested in urine. Nomenclature The current formally correct name of the disorder is Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder: Irregular Sleep Wake Rhythm Type. This disorder has been referred to by many other terms, including: Irregular Sleep Wake Pattern, irregular sleep wake syndrome, Irregular Sleep Wake Rhythm (ISWRD), Irregular Sleep Wake Cycle, Irregular Sleep Wake Schedule and Irregular Sleep Wake Disorder (ISWD). Sometimes the words sleep and wake are hyphenated (sleep-wake), sometimes joined with an en dash (sleep‚Äìwake) and sometimes open (sleep wake). Sometimes the words are capitalized and sometimes they are not.

During this period he was chief editor of the most important Croatian newspaper and magazine, Spremnost. Early life Mortigjija was born in Dubrovnik, then part of the Austria-Hungary, on 7 April 1913. He attended elementary school and high school in his native town. As a high school student, he began to publish poems, reviews, articles and debates in several Croatian newspapers and magazines. After completing high school in 1931, he enrolled in University of Zagreb, studying history and geography. He completed study in 1940, just before World War II. During his study at the University of Zagreb he continued publishing and served as the editor of various journals between 1933 and 1936.Melina Luƒçiƒá: Tias Mortigjija, Moj ≈æivotopis (Priredio Trpimir Macan), Ocjene i prikazi, Fontes (Zagreb) 2, str. 465-495, Portal znanstvenih ƒçasopisa Republike Hrvatske, Retrieved: september 7. 2010. Mortigjija was appointed as an assistant in the department of economic history at the High Economic and Commercial school in Zagreb, but never worked in the position because he was too busy doing editorial work. In his autobiography, Mortigjija said that in his youth he was a keen Yugoslavian, but his opinion changed in 1928 after Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá's attack on the Yugoslav Parliament. The assassinations turned Mortigjija to Croatian nationalism. Mortigjija was inspired by the ideas of Ante Starƒçeviƒá who argued in the mid-1800s for an independent Croatian state. Career during the Independent State of Croatia Beginning with the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941, Mortigjija was editor of the most important national newspaper, Hrvatski narod. In February 1942 he left the newspaper to work as director and chief editor of the newly founded weekly magazine Spremnost, a journal of the Usta≈°e movement. Mortigjija was a member of the Usta≈°e movement since 1941, serving as a reserve sergeant and later captain, although he never did subscribe to Usta≈°e ideology. Hrvatski narod and Spremnost were typical puppet papersA Labus: Saveznici u tisku NDH 1943 ‚Äì 1945.*, Retrieved: september 2, 2010. that followed the policy of the Axis powers and in particular the Third Reich. They published anti-Jewish propaganda which quoted text from Deutsche Zeitung‚ÄîGerman language newspapers printed by the Nazi party through Franz Eher Nachfolger.Ivo Horvat: Ne mo≈æe se rehabilitirati novinstvo koje je slu≈æilo totalitaristiƒçkoj politici i praksi usta≈°koga re≈æima (22. travnja 2004.), Vjesnik online, Retrieved: september 7. 2010. The papers also printed articles about the Serbs, Gypsies and other \\"inferior\\" races. In December 1944 Martigjiga was dismissed from Spremnost, replaced by Franjo Nevistiƒá. When the collapse of the Independent Croatian State was imminent, Mortigjija and thirty other journalists fled to Austria on 6 May 1945. While in the refugee camp, Mortigjija accepted a job to organize social activities, events, and lectures on Croatian history. He organized a committee of the Initiative-Croat refugees in Carinthia. He began publishing a newspaper on 1 March 1946 that would become the voice of Croatian refugees in Austria. Trial and death At the request of authorities of the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the British occupation forces in Austria delivered Mortigjija into Yugoslavia on 2 September 1946. Mortigjija was investigated and put on trial in Zagreb. He was found guilty and was sentenced to \\"death by firing squad and the loss of all civil rights\\". The Supreme Court upheld the conviction on 8 September 1947. He was executed on 23 October 1947 in the area of Samobor. Later retrial In the late 1990s Tias Mortigjija's son, Mato Mortigjija, petitioned the courts for a new trial for his father. Mato Mortigjija's lawyer, Antun Mihoƒçeviƒá, argued a long trial at the County Court in Zagreb.

Mortigjija's case is seen as a test case. In 1945, over 40 journalists were executed and 47 were banned from public work. Similar retrials for some of these journalists are expected. The verdict provoked a divided reaction by the public. Croatian daily newspaper Vjesnik published editorials that denounced the work of Nazi sympathizers such as Mortigjiga.

The verdict was greeted in some emigrant circles as a rare example of correcting injustice committed during by the communist Yugoslavian government.

The Cemetery Cemetery entrance, Blackhorse Avenue Battalion badges are marked on the headstones along with the name of the person buried, their rank and the date of their death, while a very few have personal inscriptions. The Royal Dublin Fusiliers have a large number of their members and their closest relatives buried in the graveyard. Mature trees and well- maintained lawns create a reflective atmosphere. Situated beside the Phoenix Park, the cemetery's current comparative anonymity has more to do with those buried there than with its location. It was forgotten after independence in a country forged from a bitter conflict with Great Britain, as many viewed Irishmen who had fought in the British Army as traitors. Some of the graves were re-located to this site at a later date (nine from King George V Hospital grounds, two from Trinity College grounds, three from Portobello (Barracks) Cemetery, two from Drogheda (Little Calvary) Cemetery and one from Oranmore Old Graveyard). The Irish Times posited upon \\"one of the 1916 Rising's unresolved mysteries. Why did the bodies of five British officers lie, apparently unclaimed and forgotten, in waste ground in central Dublin for 46 years?\\" Their bodies were then discovered and interred in Grangegorman. The Irish National War Memorial Gardens dedicated to the memory of the 49,400 Irish soldiers who gave their lives in the \\"Great War, 1914‚Äì1918\\" is approximately 1 km away in Islandbridge at the other side of Phoenix Park. A Screen Wall Memorial of a simple design standing nearly two metres high and fifteen metres long has been built of Irish limestone to commemorate the names of those war casualties whose graves lie elsewhere in Ireland and can no longer be maintained. Arranged before this memorial are the headstones of the war dead buried in Cork Military Cemetery but now commemorated here.Irish War Memorials Project - listing of monuments in Ireland, irishwarmemorials.ie; accessed 23 June 2014. A Turkish Hazel was planted in the cemetery in 2005 by the ambassadors of Turkey, New Zealand and Australia to Ireland to mark the 90th Anniversary of the Gallipoli landings on 25 April 1915. The cemetery is currently managed by the Office of Public Works to Commonwealth War Graves Commission standards and is the largest military cemetery in Ireland. History The cemetery was opened in 1876 to serve as a graveyard for the soldiers of what was then Marlborough Barracks (now McKee Barracks) and their families. Since the British Army did not repatriate soldiers killed overseas until recently it contains the remains of soldiers from across the British Empire who died naturally or were killed in action in Ireland. It also contains the remains of some killed in the Crimea. After 1923 only servicemen and their next of kin could be buried there. World War I Headstones to three New Zealand soldiers, casualties of World War I World War One casualties are throughout the graveyard, and two of them are \\"known only to God\\" i.e. unidentified. The Australian folk memory of the First World War can be seen in the annual Anzac Day commemoration at the cemetery. The cemetery holds the remains of Victoria Cross recipient Martin Doyle (1849‚Äì1940).Fighting Irish The graves reveal some details about those interred there. Perhaps the best example is the row of burials of soldiers all killed on 10 October 1918. On that day a mail boat, the RMS Leinster, was torpedoed as it left Dublin and many soldiers on board were killed. Easter Rising Memorial to 2nd Lieut. G. Gray, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, killed in action during the Easter Rising The graves of those who were killed between April 24 and the first week of May include those of some of the 118 soldiers who were killed in the course of the 1916 rising. There are numerous graves of Sherwood Foresters and South Staffordshire Regiment personnel who suffered serious casualties when they attempted to cross Mount Street Bridge on the Grand Canal. Also included are Algernon Lucas and Basil Henry Worsley Worswick, subalterns of the King Edward's Horse, both (alongside two civilians) arrested and shot by their own side (pickets of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers), who mistakenly thought they were intruders aiding rebels in the Guinness brewery. CWGC article 'Battles this Month; April 1916 - The Easter Rising, cwgc.org; accessed 4 March 2015. According to the Irish Times, \\"Families came to Dublin Castle in May 1916 to reclaim the bodies and funerals were arranged. Bodies which were not claimed were given military funerals and reinterred in the British military cemetery at Blackhorse Avenue, Grangegorman.\\" Later Conflicts RAF flyer killed during World War II The last major conflict in the 26 counties involving the British Army was the Irish War of Independence. There are graves of soldiers killed between 1919 and 1921. There are also the graves of 12 British military personnel (one of whom is an unidentified airman) who died in World War II. The last burial took place in 1999.

Lesser was one of the last surviving British veterans of the Spanish Civil War, and went on to serve as chair of the International Brigade Memorial Trust (IBMT), and write for the Daily Worker and its successor, the Morning Star. Early life Lesser was born Manassah or Manasseh Lesser, the son of Polish immigrants and the eldest of eight children, in the London Borough of Hackney on 19 March 1915. He was raised as a practising Orthodox Jew and attended South Hackney Central School and George Green's School, then won a scholarship to attend University College London (UCL) in 1934, where he initially studied history before switching to Egyptology. He acknowledged in a 2007 interview that he was already \\"a bit Bolshevised\\" by the time he arrived at UCL. In 1935 Lesser joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), a decision he credited to the party's anti-fascist stance; and participated in demonstrations against the British Union of Fascists in London. While at UCL, Lesser also joined the Officers' Training Corps (OTC), something he later described as \\"something that I always have great difficulty explaining,\\" and trained with the Royal Scots at Dover Castle. He justified joining the OTC by quoting Vladimir Lenin's maxim \\"An oppressed class which does not strive to learn to use arms, to acquire arms, only deserves to be treated like slaves\\", and later attributed the decision to a desire \\"to see how it worked and to learn how to fire a gun\\". He also later said that his training in the OTC, which was conducted in rural environments based on the experiences of the British Army in the First World War, was of little use in Spain where the fighting took place in cities. Spanish Civil War=Departure and Madrid Lesser planned, in July 1936, to embark on an excavation under the supervision of Flinders Petrie. However, at the request of the CPGB, and the specific request of the party's general secretary Harry Pollitt, Lesser was among the first group of 30 British volunteers to depart for Spain in 1936, telling his mother he had gone to Egypt for his studies. He later recalled his having done so as \\"a gesture of solidarity\\" having observed the rise of fascism in Europe. He was also motivated by the Non-Intervention Agreement signed by the British government, which prevented the Second Spanish Republic from purchasing arms internationally. The CPGB gave Lesser money for a ticket to Paris and an address to report to when he arrived; from the Paris- Gare de Lyon he travelled by train to Perpignan. He took the pseudonym \\"Raimundo Casado\\" while crossing the Pyrenees, and travelled to Figueres, then Barcelona, then to the headquarters of the International Brigades in Albacete, where he trained. It was at this time that he took the name \\"Sam\\" and reversed \\"Lesser\\" to form \\"Russell.\\" Alongside Lesser in the first group of British volunteers were John Cornford, Bernard Knox and Jock Cunningham. After the nationalists broke through the Madrid Front, Lesser travelled overnight to Madrid. His first experience of combat came as part of a British unit in a French battalion in the Casa de Campo university campus in Madrid in October 1936,, which also included Cornford, Knox, the writer John Sommerfield and the German refugee artist Jan Kurzke,The Good Comrade, The Memoirs of Kate Mangan & Jan Kurzke, International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam. Their unit was stationed on the front line close to the Philosophy and Letters building. The building had previously been occupied by Moroccan soldiers who had overrun Buenaventura Durruti's anarchist Durruti Column. As the British unit advanced into the building they fought alongside members of Durruti's militia and a group of miners from Asturias, and occupied the building for a week. Of the original 30 members of Lesser's unit, only six survived until mid-December, when they returned to Albacete. Lopera and injury In December 1936, Lesser joined a reconstituted British company alongside the other four English survivors of his former unit. They were sent across Spain to And√∫jar then went south to Lopera, where in January 1937 (having previously suffered a shrapnel- inflicted head wound) Lesser was hit by bullets in the back and foot, likely to have come from his own machine gun company. \\"I didn't know at the time where I'd been wounded ‚Äì in which part of my body ‚Äì except that when I tried to get up I couldn't. I just fell down\\", he later recalled. As his comrades had been forced to withdraw, Lesser remained in place until his friend Cunningham, who had insisted on looking for him, found him and, unable to locate a stretcher, dragged him away from the fighting. He was driven to a hospital in Linares. Cornford and Ralph Winston Fox were also killed near to Lesser in Lopera. While recovering, he learned Spanish, was introduced to Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, and worked in the office of the newly-formed British Battalion in Albacete during the Battle of Jarama. After the battle Lesser returned to Britain to seek proper medical treatment, carrying the list of casualties from Jarama. Upon his recovery, Lesser went to Paris, where he worked in the International Brigades recruitment office, assisting in the organisation of newly arrived volunteers and later leading a group of female volunteers to Spain in a fisherman's boat. He then went to Barcelona where he was told to rejoin the International Brigades, but failed a medical examination and was told that he would be unable to fight, a setback which led to a career in journalism. Speaking about his experience in Spain to historian Max Arthur in 2009, Lesser said, \\"Asked if I would do it all again, I used to give an unequivocal reply that of course I would. But now I don't know if I would. I'm a very old man now and one of the things I experienced was that those of us who survived Spain experienced different sorts of treatment when we got back.\\" Journalism=Radio and early Daily Worker career With no prior experience of journalism, Lesser began producing and broadcasting propaganda radio programmes for the Republican cause. He was responsible for English language broadcasts at a Barcelona headquarters established to broadcast on shortwave in German, Italian, Portuguese and English. During this time the Daily Worker published an interview with Independent Labour Party volunteer Frank Frankford, conducted by Lesser, which had been edited to suggest that Frankford was accusing the Trotskyist POUM of fraternisation with fascists; and which claimed the POUM battalion commander was a fascist agent and that arms used in the May Days had been supplied by the Nationalists. Frankford later told Bernard Crick that Lesser had embellished his words but that \\"there are things still to be explained\\" and that fraternisation did occur. Crick speculated that the claims attributed to Frankford, in particular the admission that he had \\"committed the crime of taking part in the armed rising of Fascists against the anti-Fascist Government\\", may have been the inspiration for the \\"bizarre and pathetic\\" confessions made by characters in George Orwell's Animal Farm. Lesser then became a correspondent for the Daily Worker in Barcelona, using \\"Sam Russell\\" as his byline and covering the Republicans' retreat at the border town of Figueres. Barcelona was at the time under attack from Benito Mussolini's forces (which had a base in Majorca), who, Lesser wrote, > bombed our area of Barcelona, and I shall never forget the smell there when > I went outside. There was one wonderful row of lime trees ‚Äì a beautiful > scent when they're in flower ... The gutter was literally flowing with > blood, and the smell of the blood of these poor people was mixed with the > smell of the lime trees. He left Barcelona the day before the city fell to the Nationalists in January 1939. Lesser was the Daily Worker's correspondent in Paris and Brussels, leaving Paris after the banning of the Communist Party following the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and fleeing Belgium after the Nazi invasion in May 1940. He returned to Britain, where the wounds he had received in Spain prevented him from serving in the British Army. Instead, he worked for four years as an inspector in a Napier & Son aircraft factory in west London, also serving as a shop steward. He rejoined the newspaper in the final months of the war and in 1945, following the lifting of the government's ban on publication of the Daily Worker, he flew in a Royal Air Force Avro Lancaster bomber dropping food supplies in the Netherlands. Moscow correspondent and foreign editor Writing for the Daily Worker, Lesser visited Jersey following its occupation, covered the 1952 show trial of Communist Party of Czechoslovakia general secretary Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω, and witnessed Nikita Khrushchev's rise to power. Living in the Soviet Union as the Daily Worker's Moscow correspondent from 1955 until 1959, he became friends with spies Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, two of the Cambridge Five, and travelled from Moscow to report on the Soviet invasion following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Lesser replaced Peter Fryer in Budapest after Fryer resigned in protest at his reports, which supported the rebellion, having been rewritten by the paper. Though Lesser's first despatch from Budapest, headlined \\"Kadar reveals the facts\\", was sympathetic to Soviet-installed Prime Minister J√°nos K√°d√°r, his attempts to report on the realities of everyday life led the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to request his withdrawal from Moscow, which was refused by the British party. Having been tipped off regarding the content of Khrushchev's report \\"On the Personality Cult and its Consequences\\" (known as the \\"Secret Speech\\") and being aware that a Reuters journalist planned to file the story once outside of Russia, he sought verification from the Soviet Communist Party, arguing that it would be better a sympathetic journalist such as himself to tell the story than for it to be first reported in the capitalist press. He was told, however, that \\"just because you are a friend doesn't mean you can look in our cupboard.\\" He later said that despite his having filed a 12-page report to his London newsroom, only a few paragraphs appeared in the paper. As foreign editor, Lesser was based in London but reported from Nigeria, where he covered the 1960 independence celebrations, and from Cuba during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, where he conducted a five- hour-long interview with Che Guevara. Guevara told him that if the missiles had been under Cuban control, Cuba would have retaliated against perceived aggression from the United States by firing on American boats and cities. In 1963 he published a pamphlet on the execution of the Spanish Communist politician Juli√°n Grimau entitled Murder in Madrid, which sold over 5000 copies. Lesser later reported from Prague during the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, of which he was critical; and from North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Lesser was in Chile during the 1973 coup d'etat, his report of which began \\"I saw democracy murdered in Chile by a rabble of Rip van Winkle general and admirals recruited by the CIA to impose a savage military dictatorship on a people which had seen and welcomed the dawn of a new era\\". Tribune's obituary for Lesser named his 1973 report from Chile as \\"possibly his finest hour ‚Äì a great testament to his reporting skills and political commitment.\\" He also reported on the beginnings of a new democracy in Spain following Francisco Franco's death in 1975. During his career with the Daily Worker and Morning Star, Lesser held the positions of home reporter, diplomatic correspondent, Moscow correspondent and foreign editor. He retired in 1984 at the age of 69, but continued contributing articles to Seven Days, the Communist Party's own weekly newspaper. Personal life Lesser's younger brother Frank also served in the International Brigades, and preceded his older brother as Moscow correspondent for the Daily Worker after the Second World War. While in Barcelona, Lesser met Margaret Powell, a nurse. Powell, who was born in 1913 in Llangenny, Wales, arrived in Spain in 1937 and worked in International Brigade hospitals in Aragon, and at the end of the war was interned in a French concentration camp with Spanish refugees. She later worked with Quakers attending refugees, for which the Spanish Republican government in exile made her a Dame of the Order of Loyalty to the Spanish Republic. After the end of the civil war she helped to found Britain's first nurses' union, worked as a nurse in the rearguard during the Second World War, volunteered to help Yugoslavian refugees in Egypt, and worked with refugees and in maternity clinics in Germany. Lesser married Daily Worker switchboard operator Nell Jones in 1943, but shortly after renewed his acquaintance with Powell. He divorced Jones and married Powell in 1950. She lived with Lesser in Moscow during his time as a correspondent there, and on their return to England resumed nursing and was active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Margaret died in 1990. She and Lesser had one daughter, Ruth. Later life=Political allegiances Though he initially supported Khrushchev's reforms, he cited his experience surrounding the \\"Secret Speech\\" and the Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia, as experiences which changed him politically, and later acknowledged that he was troubled by his own credulity in reporting the Sl√°nsk√Ω show trial. In the 1980s, splits developed in the Communist Party and the Morning Star between traditionalists and the dominant Eurocommunists. Lesser, in his capacity as the National Union of Journalists' Father of the Chapel, joined the Eurocommunist wing in opposition to Morning Star editor Tony Chater. The Communist Party was dissolved in 1991, and Lesser joined the Labour Party. Also in the 1990s, Lesser backed the post-Communist Democratic Left organisation. In November 2000, Lesser described himself not as a communist but as a socialist, and acknowledged that some friends considered him a Blairite. He said that having lived in Lambeth, he could \\"see the terrible, terrible damage that was done to the Labour party by the ultra-left,\\" and felt that Clause IV of the Labour Party Constitution, which called for state ownership of industry before its revision in 1995, was outdated. Poetry In 2007 Lesser's poetry was featured alongside other British war poets who wrote during the Civil War in Poetas ingleses del siglo XX, an anthology of British poets edited by Carmelo Medina Casado and published in Madrid in 2007. His poetry was previously unpublished. He also wrote an autobiography, which was never published. Spanish citizenship and IBMT In his retirement Lesser frequently visited Spain. In 1996 he was among the International Brigade veterans who returned to Spain to be offered honorary Spanish citizenship, an experience he described as \\"remarkable, really remarkable,\\" and commented \\"I don't mind admitting I was moved to tears.\\" The offer, however, made to all surviving veterans of the International Brigades, was accompanied by the proviso that the veterans would have to renounce their own nationalities, which few were prepared to do. Lesser was a founding member of the International Brigade Memorial Trust (IBMT), an organisation established in 2001 to educate the public in the history of the International Brigades and remember those who died in the Spanish Civil War. Lesser was chair of the IBMT from 2006, succeeding fellow International Brigade veteran Jack Jones who became IBMT President. Following Jones's death in April 2009 Lesser refused to succeed him and remained chair until his death. Following the re-election of Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero's (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) government (see 2008 Spanish general election) the Cortes Generales passed legislation confirming the right of the surviving brigadiers to Spanish citizenship without renouncing their own nationalities. On 9 June 2009 Lesser and Lou Kenton were among seven volunteers (six from Britain and one from Ireland) who received Spanish passports and citizenship as a gesture of thanks. Carles Casajuana, Spain's ambassador to Britain, told the veterans that \\"Your efforts were not in vain. Your ideals are part of the foundations of our democracy in Spain today.\\" Lesser gave a speech in fluent Spanish, linking the Spanish Civil War to the fight against the British National Party, who he argued \\"have the same filthy policy of racism, which started off in Germany with Hitler's campaign against the Jews.\\" He also spoke of his sadness that so few of his comrades were still alive to witness the gesture, and quoted Laurence Binyon's \\"Ode of Remembrance\\": > Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. > At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them. At the end of his speech Lesser gave a raised fist salute. In his book Unlikely Warriors, historian Richard Baxell wrote that Lesser \\"spoke clearly and eloquently ... though an occasional catch in his voice betrayed the emotional intensity of the occasion.\\" Tribune's obituary remarked that the speech showed \\"He may have moved away from communism to become an admirer of Tony Blair, but this was the old Sam Lesser fire.\\" In July 2009 he appeared at the International Brigade memorial in Lambeth's Jubilee Gardens, where he paid tribute to Jones, and on 7 May 2010 he appeared at the unveiling of a plaque honouring the 90 members of the International Brigades killed at the Battle of the Ebro, where he gave a speech in Spanish condemning the lack of support shown to Republican volunteers by representatives of the British government. In his final weeks Lesser opened an exhibition about the International Brigades at the Marx Memorial Library and chaired an IBMT committee meeting in London. Lesser died in London on 2 October 2010 at the age of 95, leaving instructions for his ashes to be scattered near the International Brigade memorial at Montju√Øc in Barcelona.

The site dates back to 1642 when Savill Gaskin started the second ferry service in Hampton Roads to carry passengers on the Lynnhaven River to the nearby county courthouse and to visit plantations along the waterway. A cannon was used to signal the ferry, which had 11 total stops along the river. The first ferry service was started nearby by Adam Thoroughgood. [citation needed] The house, which is reputedly haunted by 11 spirits, has been used as a plantation, courthouse, school, and post office. It is currently a museum and educational center. A Summer History Camp, which educates youths about life in the 18th and 19th centuries, is also held on the site. Description The area was initially cleared by the local Indians in the 16th century and many of their artifacts have been found on the site. The third Princess Anne County courthouse, the first brick courthouse in the county, was built on this site, complete with stocks and pillory. This third courthouse was in existence from 1735 until the construction of the Walke Mansion. The Walke Mansion 1751-1828 owned by William Walke was destroyed by fire on September 12th, 1828. Walke may have run a tavern here during the American Revolution. The current house was built in 1830. Its exterior is Federal style three-course American bond brickwork; all of the bricks were from the ruins of the Walke Mansion. A West Bay addition was built in 1850. The house has 10 rooms with heart-of-pine flooring and several original features. It was once covered with oyster shell stucco. The rear of the home faces the western branch of the Lynnhaven River. The house occupies owned by the city and is encompassed by of open space owned by a homeowners association. There are some small gardens on the property and in the back yard is a large Southern Magnolia planted on April 6, 1863 by Sally Rebecca Walke in memory of her fianc√©' John, her fallen Confederate officer. Renovation Resident Virginia Higgins moved out of Ferry Plantation in 1986 and turned deed over to the City of Virginia Beach. The Ferry Plantation House was abandoned from 1986 to 1996. A group of citizens saved the house from demolition around 1996. Investors bought it in 1994, but their deal to sell it fell through in 1996 when the Virginia Beach City Council said the house could not be a private residence due to deed restrictions. The deed to the property was eventually turned over to the City of Virginia Beach in June 1996, and the Friends of the Ferry Plantation House, Inc. began renovating the house in 1996 in partnership with the City of Virginia Beach. Court House bars (one set and shackles) are still on one window to date. The house was listed in the Virginia Landmarks Register (Virginia Historic Landmark) in 2004 and the US National Register of Historic Places in 2005 and The +Virginia State Register. Belinda Nash has been on the board of directors of the FOFPH since 1996 and the director since 1999. Nash is one of the many volunteers that continue to work to allow The Ferry Plantation House to be enjoyed by so many, including summer camps and many social events that share its history and artifacts. Hauntings The house is reportedly haunted by 11 spirits; spirit tours are available, including one during Halloween called \\"The Stroll of Lost Souls\\". Reported spirits include those of people who perished in an 1810 ship wreck at the ferry landing, a former slave, Sally Rebecca Walke who mourns her fianc√©' a fallen soldier, and the Lady in White, who reportedly died of a broken neck from falling down the stairs, as well as the artist Thomas Williamson, owner of the Manor House who was married to a Walke has been reported seen at the top of the stairs painting. Paranormal groups come to the house to do research. Sounds of dragging chains have been reported, possibly from the days of the old courthouse. Grace Sherwood, the \\"Witch of Pungo\\", was tried by ducking near here and the museum sponsors the annual Grace Sherwood Festival, which includes viewing of the reenactment of the ducking. The actual ducking of Sherwood was at the end of what is now Witchduck Road, 200 yards out in the river from what is now a private home. The House has a Red Maple and marker in honor of Sherwood in the side yard.

Joachim Camerarius the Younger (German \\"Kammermeister\\") (November 6, 1534 - October 11, 1598, Nuremberg) was a German physician, botanist, zoologist and humanist scholar. Life He was born in Nuremberg, the son of the famed humanist Joachim Camerarius the elder (1500‚Äì1574). The younger Camerarius‚Äôs association with the luminaries of later sixteenth-century German intelligentsia was secured by his father‚Äôs network of influential friends‚Äîincluding Philip Melanchthon and Johannes Crato von Krafftheim. After his early studies at Wittenberg and Leipzig, Camerarius turned to medical pursuits under the tutelage of Crato. Following in Crato‚Äôs footsteps, he pursued medical studies at the University of Padua before taking his doctorate at the University of Bologna in 1562. He returned to Nuremberg where he established his medical practice. In 1592 the Nuremberg city council established the Collegium Medicum. Camerarius served as dean of the medical college until his death. He corresponded with such notables as Gaspard Bauhin, Carolus Clusius, Thomas Erastus, and Konrad Gessner. Works Symbolorvm and emblematvm Though trained in the strict Galenic school of philosophically based medicine, Camerarius also displayed the naturalistic proclivity of his exemplars Gessner and Pietro Andrea Mattioli. His works include a Synopsis [...] commentariorum de peste (which includes his own De recta et necessaria ratione, praeservandi a pestis contagio) (Nuremberg, 1583), Hortus Medicus et Philosophicus (Frankfurt/M., 1598) and Symbola et emblemata (Centuria, I: 1590, II: 1595, III :1596, IV: 1604; ed. Wolfgang Harms and Ulla-Britta Kuechen, Graz, 1988). His son Ludwig Camerarius (1573‚Äì1651) brought out a posthumous edition of this work that added a fourth ‚Äúcentury‚Äù of symbols and emblems drawn from aquatic animals and reptiles to the three previously published ‚Äúcenturies‚Äù taken from herbs and plants, four-legged animals, and birds and insects. Joachim Camerarius also published a very popular edition of Mattioli‚Äôs commentaries on Dioscorides (Kreutterbuch, Frankfurt/M., 1586, etc.).

Construction started in 1956 and the power station was commissioned in 1959 with an initial nameplate capacity of It is the second of two plants built by Hydro-Qu√©bec on the Betsiamites. Bersimis-2 was preceded by Bersimis-1, built upstream between 1953 and 1956. With upgrades and further river diversions, Bersimis-2's installed capacity has been increased over time to its current capacity of  Geography  The Betsiamites River, also known as the Bersimis, is located halfway between the Saguenay and Outardes rivers, on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, downstream from Quebec City. With the exception of an Innu reserve at Betsiamites, at the mouth of the river, the area is scarcely populated. The word Betsiamites or Pessamit is from the innu language and means \\"the assembly place of the lampreys\\". Bersimis was not used by either the Innus, the French or the French Canadians, but was introduced by British admiral Henry Wolsey Bayfield, in his hydrographic surveys of the Saint Lawrence River of 1837. The Hudson's Bay Company used the name when opened a trading post in 1855, as did the post office in 1863. After 2 decades of efforts, residents and the Quebec government convinced the federal government to start using Betsiamites in 1919. But administrative use of Bersimis continued for decades and Hydro-Qu√©bec used it in the 1950s to name its facility in the area. Located in the Central Laurentians ecoregion of the Boreal Shield Ecozone, the hinterland is heavily forested and dominated by softwood species: black spruce (Picea mariana), balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white spruce (Picea glauca). In 1937, the Quebec government granted a forest concession to the Anglo Canadian Pulp & Paper Co. to supply its Forestville mill, on the coast. The area is described as \\"a sportsman's paradise, where fish, moose, bear and a host of other game creatures abound\\".  Background  With a continued surge of demand, electricity supplies remained a concern at Hydro-Qu√©bec and other Quebec-based utilities in the mid-1950s, but the commissioning of the first 3 units at Bersimis-1 in the last quarter of 1956 somewhat alleviated the problem. Not wanting to get caught in another potential shortage situation, company managers decided to proceed early with two more shovel ready projects: the first one was third and final phase of the Beauharnois generating station, southwest of Montreal which was made possible by the simultaneous construction of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, and Bersimis-2. The decision to build the second plant on the north shore early had the extra benefit of having both labor and equipment in place.

If standards are met, accredited status is granted by the agency. In most countries around the world, the function of educational accreditation for higher education is conducted by a government organization, such as a ministry of education. In the United States, however, the quality assurance process is independent of government and performed by private agencies.Dr. Marjorie Peace Lenn, Global Trends in Quality Assurance in Higher Education , World Education News and Reviews, v. 5, no. 2, Spring 1992, pages 1 and 21 The United States-based Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), a non-governmental organization, maintains an international directory which contains contact information of about 467 quality assurance bodies, accreditation bodies and ministries of education in 175 countries. The quality assurance and accreditation bodies have been authorized to operate by their respective governments either as agencies of the government or as private (non-governmental) organizations. In September 2012, University World News reported the launching on an international division of the council.http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120919165946970  Canada  Canada does not have a system of national or regional accreditation. Provincial legislation and membership in the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada are substitutes. Some universities seek evaluation from American regional accreditation agencies.  France  In France, the main accreditation authority is the Ministry of National Education. * Accreditation by collation of academic degrees ‚Äì the first-tier accreditation. Whereas institutions of higher education issues diplomas, only the ministry can award degrees. It is the main accreditation level and automatically awarded to public universities. * Accreditation by visa ‚Äì the second-tier accreditation.

In some education fields, the ministry must take official advise from special bodies.

Greece  In Greece, the accreditation authority/national recognition body is the HQA ‚Äì Hellenic Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency which was established by Law 3374/2005 and 4009/2011 and belongs to the Ministry of Education, Research and Religious Affairs. It is the government supervisory and coordinating agency of the quality assurance framework applied in Hellenic Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Accreditation is compulsory for all universities in Greece. The HQA accredits programs of study for undergraduate degree and postgraduate degree and quality management systems (system accreditation) from state or state recognized HEIs in Greece. The right of conferring or granting university degrees shall be exercised only by a State University established. Thus, any institute which has not been created by an accreditation of Ministry of Education of Greece and HQA state agency according Greece State Legislature or has not been granted the status of a Deemed-to-be-University, is not entitled to award a university status degree. In Greece it is illegal to offer a qualification that is or might seem to be a university degree because all Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) in Greece are public (state) operating with government approval.  Hong Kong  The Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualificati is appointed by the Secretary for Education of Education Bureau as the Accreditation Authority and QR Authority under the Qualifications Framework of Hong Kong (HKQF). Assessment is made with reference to local and internationally recognised standards through a process of peer review. The HKCAAVQ will issue an accreditation report on the outcome of the accreditation activity.  India  Accreditation is compulsory for all universities in India except those created through an act of Parliament. Without accreditation, \\"It is emphasized that these fake institutions have no legal entity to call themselves as University/Vishwvidyalaya and to award ‚Äòdegrees‚Äô which are not treated as valid for academic/employment purposes.\\" The University Grants Commission Act, 1956 explains, > \\"the right of conferring or granting degrees shall be exercised only by a > University established or incorporated by or under a Central Act or a State > Act or an Institution deemed to be University or an institution specially > empowered by an Act of the Parliament to confer or grant degrees. Thus, any > institution which has not been created by an enactment of Parliament or a > State Legislature or has not been granted the status of a Deemed-to-be- > University, is not entitled to award a degree.\\" Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission. In 2012, Seattle Times wrote about \\"Poorly regulated, unaccredited and often entirely fake colleges have sprung up\\" around India in response to \\"demand for higher education accelerates, driven by rising aspirations and a bulging population of young people.\\" India's higher-education commission reported that of more than 31,000 higher-education institutions, only 4,532 schools were accredited.  Ireland  The later stages of Ireland's National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) relate to third-level education in the state. Universities in Ireland are self-regulating and accredit their own courses; they were established by the state (by royal charter or primary legislation) as were many other publicly funded higher education providers, such as the institutes of technology (ITs). Some courses delivered by non-university institutions are accredited by one of the universities, others by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), an agency of the Department of Education established in 2012 to replace earlier accreditation bodies the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and Further Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC and FETAC). QQI delegates its power to some providers, including most ITs. The NFQ also recognises many foreign accreditation bodies, such as the UK's NCFE and City and Guilds of London Institute. Many further education colleges in Ireland offer courses accredited by UK universities. In 2010, when reviewing American College Dublin's accreditation, HETAC objected to its advertising its affiliation to the US-based \\"Irish American University\\" on the ground that the Universities Act 1997 restricts the use of the label \\"university\\".  Israel  The Council for Higher Education is, by a 1958 law, the only institution qualified to accredit universities and colleges in Israel. The council acts as a reviewer of the activity of the academic centers in Israel and sets terms and requirements for every degree given.  Italy  The formal system for accreditation of State University programs in Italy began in 1933, with the ( R.D. 31.8.1933, n.1592, art. 167). This law accredits a set of Universities, faculties, and courses. A further modification was the Law 14 agosto 1982, n. 590, where a set of new Universities were accredited. A new system of accreditation was approved by Law 9 maggio 1989, n. 168. It involves two separate but correlated programs that were instituted at the same time: First, each University went through a four-step process to adopt and approve its own Regolamenti Didattici di Ateneo (RDA). The RDA establishes the rules for the organization of teaching at the university, including establishing the requirements and objectives of each degree program, the curricula, credits awarded and requirements and objectives of examinations. The RDA's were developed in consultation with representatives of the individual university, the regional coordinating committee (CRC), employers and the National University Council and are ultimately approved by the Ministry of Education (MIUR). Second, a series of formal, objective standards was adopted as minimum requirements for approval of any programs. In addition, there are other forms of accreditation in Italy. These include: (i) accreditation of degree programs in engineering by the Council of Presidents of the Italian Faculties of Engineering called SINAI, a national system for accrediting such programs; (ii) accreditation of MBA programs by the independent agency, Association for Business Management Training (ASFOR)and (iii) a program for accreditation of non-state university programs, which, since 1996, as involved a process of formal legal approval, involving an independent review by the National Committee for Evaluation of the University System (CNVSU) and then issuance of a formal ministerial decree approving by the issuance of degrees by the university.Finocchetti, C and Capucci, S, \\"Accreditation in the Italian University System\\" Information Center on Academic Mobility and Performance (CIMEA) (March 2003)  Japan  In 2004, following a long postwar period of independent quality assurance of select member institutions by the JUAA, the Japanese government via the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology began to certify third party bodies as quality assurance agencies for Japanese degrees. As of 2016, 13 organizations are certified to accredit tertiary institutions, of which three accredit standard academic universities. These three bodies are: *ja: Japan University Accreditation Association (JUAA) *NIAD-QE *ja: Japan Institution for Higher Education Evaluation (JIHEE)  Kenya  The Commission for University Education (CUE), formerly known as the Commission for Higher Education (CHE), is in charge of the programs accreditation and the award of charters to institutions of higher learning. The commission also serves as the monitoring and evaluation body to ensure compliance towards quality of education offered by institutions under charter.  Malaysia  Accreditation was done by the Lembaga Akreditasi Negara (National Accreditation Board), a statutory body created through an act of Parliament, for certificates, diplomas and degree courses provided by private higher educational institutions (defined as institutions providing tertiary or post-secondary education) until 2007 when the body was replaced with the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA). Prior to the enactment of the legislations that provided for the establishment of these bodies, no specific framework for accreditation existed and institutions only required a valid registration status from the Ministry of Education of Malaysia.  Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium)  The Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO) is a binational organization formed by treaty in 2003 to independently ensure the quality of higher education in the Netherlands and Flanders by assessing and accrediting programs. As a result of separate legislation in the two jurisdictions, accreditation policies and procedures differ between the two countries.Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders official website  Pakistan  The main accreditation body for higher education is Higher Education Commission (HEC) which is the primary regulator of higher education in Pakistan (formerly called the University Grant Commission (UGC)). It regulates and formulates laws governing all the degree awarding institutes in Pakistan. It also facilitates the development of higher educational system and upgrade the universities of Pakistan to be the centers of education, research and development.  Philippines  Portugal  The Portuguese Ag√™ncia de Acredita√ß√£o (state-managed Accreditation Agency) for higher education is, since 2007, responsible for the publication of the national ranking of higher education institutions and degrees. Within the Bologna process a state agency was set up by the Portuguese Government to offer central and regulated accreditation. Previously, Portugal had used a system of professional accreditation and degree recognition by sector, with a number of associations, Unions and Professional Orders (Ordens Profissionais): the Ordem dos M√©dicos (for medical doctors), the Ordem dos Engenheiros (for engineers) and the Portuguese Bar Association (for lawyers). The Sindicato dos Engenheiros T√©cnicos (for technical engineers), was created as the professional association of technical engineers, who were not full chartered engineers, having as mandatory qualification a simple short-cycle 3-year bachelor's degree (bacharelato) awarded by the Portuguese polytechnical institutes and now discontinued since the mid-2000s. The Associa√ß√£o de T√©cnicos de Contas (for accounting technicians), the C√¢mara de Revisores Oficiais de Contas (for financial auditors, similar to Chartered Accountants) and the Sindicato dos Enfermeiros (for nurses) are examples of organizations which were oriented towards professions that at least until the 1990s did not demand a specific academic degree. For example, to be member of the C√¢mara de Revisores Oficiais de Contas (for financial auditors), candidates needed to have two years of experience and must have a degree in a range of possible area (Economics, Finance, Business Administration, Accounting or Law). Like in other similar international associations (Chartered Accountant), the C√¢mara de Revisores Oficiais de Contas have very selective examinations. Some organizations (starting as Associations or Unions) were upgraded later into Ordens like, for example, the Ordem dos Farmac√™uticos (for pharmacists), the Ordem dos Arquitectos (for architects), the Ordem dos Bi√≥logos (for biologists), the Ordem dos Economistas (for economists), the Ordem dos Enfermeiros (for nurses) and the Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas (for chartered accountants and financial auditors). In addition, the state through the ministry for higher education, has usually been the central highest accreditation entity and thus it is illegal to award degrees without government approval. For many years, there were state-accredited institutions, both public and private, awarding unaccredited degrees by the Ordens. This dubious situation changed in the mid-2000s with the deep reorganization imposed by the Bologna process implementation in Portugal, the creation of the new central state-managed Accreditation Agency and the foundation of many regulated new Ordens covering dozens of professions until then unregulated by this type of professional organization. In 1999, over 15,000 students enrolled in Portuguese higher learning institutions and newly graduates in the fields of engineering and architecture, were enrolled or were awarded a degree in a non-accredited course. Those students and graduates with no official recognition were not admitted to any Ordem and were unable to develop professional activity in their presumed field of expertise (e.g. architect; chemical, electrical or civil/structural engineer; lawyer; accountant; and financial auditor, among other professionals). At the same time, only one accredited engineering course was offered by a private university and over 90% of the accredited courses with recognition in the fields of engineering, architecture and law were exclusively provided by state-run universities.15 mil alunos frequentam cursos n√£o reconhecidos - Expresso (N¬∫1382), 24 April 1999, accessed December 2006 In 2007, the compulsory closing of some problematic and unreliable private higher education institutions (like the defunct Independente University and the Moderna University) which in general had been accredited by the state during the boom of private teaching of the 1990s, but usually without providing any accredited degrees in accordance with the requirements of the main Ordens was seen as a remedy of last resort in order to prevent a further loss of credibility among some sectors within the non-public university higher education. Pedro Sousa Tavares, Governo desencadeia saneamento das privadas, Di√°rio de Not√≠cias (26 May 2007)  Russia  In Russia accreditation/national recognition is directly overseen by the Ministry of Education and Science of Russian Federation. Since 1981, Russia has followed the UNESCO international regulations to ensure Russian institutions and international institutions meet high quality standards. It is illegal for a school to operate without government approval. The Russian Federation has a three-step recognition system: # License # Accreditation # Attestation There exist additional agencies, such as the Agency for Higher Education Quality Assurance and Career Development (AKKORK), which conducts independent assessment of quality assurance of higher education institutions. AKKORK is an independent professional agency in the field of consultancy, conduct of the reviews, accreditation and certification of education institutions. In accordance with the Russian legislation in such activities as: state supervision over compliance with legislation of the Russian Federation on education, control over compliance with licensing requirements and conditions, state control over the education quality could be involved experts and expert organizations, accredited in accordance with rules approved by the Government of the Russian Federation. AKKORK on July 8, 2011 received the proper accreditation in the Federal Service for Supervision in Education and Science.http://www.akkork.ru/e/about/ National Accreditation Agency (NAA) of the Ministry of Education and Science also operates under the authority of Federal Service of Supervision in Education and Science.http://obrnadzor.gov.ru/ NAA is recognized as the organisation in Russia responsible for dissemination of knowledge and information on procedures of the state accreditation of HEIs. It develops materials and methodological recommendations for conducting self-evaluations and external reviews, trains experts, conducts research into the development of QA of higher education in Russia, prepares the final reports on the quality of the HEI.https://hedclub.com/ru/library/the_chinese_model_of_assessingthe_quality_of_highe_112359 Wu, Yan. (2017) The Chinese Model of Assessing the Quality of Higher Education: Procedures, Criteria, Practices. Higher Education Discovery. pp.22-33.  South Africa  In South Africa all higher education institutions are required to register with the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET). All qualifications are registered by the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) in line with the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). The Higher Education Quality Committee (HEQC) of the Council on Higher Education (CHE) accredits programs leading to a NQF registered qualification. All programs offered by South African higher education institutions must be accredited.Retrieved 23 October 2011  South Korea  It is illegal to falsely claim a degree in South Korea if it does not meet accredited approval. For example, in March 2006, prosecutors in Seoul \\"broken up a crime ring selling bogus music diplomas from Russia, which helped many land university jobs and seats in orchestras.\\" People who falsely used these degrees were criminally charged.  Thailand  Thailand has a system of national accreditation. The agency who takes care of such accreditation is Office of the Higher Education Commission. The details regarding quality assurance can be found in Handbook for Internal Quality Assurance for Higher Education Institutions.‡∏Ñ‡∏π‡πà‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏®‡∏∂‡∏Å‡∏©‡∏≤‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏®‡∏∂‡∏Å‡∏©‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏°‡∏®‡∏∂‡∏Å‡∏©‡∏≤ ‡∏û.‡∏®. 2557 http://www.mua.go.th/users/bhes/QAMUA58/qa%20manual58/iqa_2558.pdf She also has criteria for international qualification, especially those who have obtained degrees abroad. In addition, since Thailand is an active member of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the educational collaboration is also strengthened in Southeast Asian states.  United Kingdom  In the UK it is illegal to offer a qualification that is or might seem to be a UK degree unless the awarding body is a \\"recognised body\\" authorised by a Royal Charter or by or under an Act of Parliament to grant degrees, a \\"listed body\\" authorised by a recognised body to offer courses leading to a degree from that recognised body or the qualification is a \\"recognised award\\" designated by order of the Secretary of State. Prosecutions under the Education Reform Act are rare, as many unaccredited awarding bodies are based outside UK jurisdiction. It is also worth noting in this context that the Business Names Act 1985 made it an offence for any business in the UK to use the word \\"university\\" in its name without the formal approval of the Privy Council.Evidence given by Charles Clarke, then Secretary of State for Education and Skills MP, to the Parliamentary Select committee on Education and Skills, 7 July 2004 Private higher education (HE) and further education (FE) institutions (here distinguished from the qualifications that they offer) are unregulated, but may choose to become accredited by various non-regulatory bodies such as the British Accreditation Council or the British Council and Accreditation Service for International Colleges in order to demonstrate third-party assessment of the quality of education they offer. The Universities Funding Council and Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council established in the UK under the Education Reform Act 1988 have responsibility for the public funding of the FE and HE sector. Prosecutions under legislation other than the Education Reform Act 1988 do occur. In 2004, Thames Valley College in London was prosecuted under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 for offering degrees from the 'University of North America', a limited liability company set up by themselves in the US with no academic staff and no premises other than a mail forwarding service.Alex Thompson, 2004.

United States  The US Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) (a non-governmental organization) both recognize accrediting bodies for institutions of higher education, but US Department of Education recognition is necessary for access to financial aid and federally guaranteed student loans under Title IV. They also provide guidelinesCHEA Recognition Policy and Procedures http://www.chea.org/pdf/Recognition_Policy-June_28_2010-FINAL.pdf as well as resources and relevant data regarding these accreditors.

Among patients receiving cancer treatment other than surgery, it is essentially universal. Fatigue is a normal and expected side effect of most forms of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and biotherapy. On average, cancer-related fatigue is \\"more severe, more distressing, and less likely to be relieved by rest\\" than fatigue experienced by healthy people. It can range from mild to severe, and may be either temporary or a long-term effect. Fatigue may be a symptom of the cancer, or it may be the result of treatments for the cancer. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of cancer- related fatigue is poorly understood. It may be caused by the cancer or the effects it has on the body, by the body's response to the cancer, or by the cancer treatments. Fatigue is a common symptom of cancer. Some fatigue is caused by cancer treatments. This may show a characteristic pattern. For example, people on many chemotherapy regimens often feel more fatigue in the week after treatments, and less fatigue as they recover from that round of medications. People receiving radiation therapy, by contrast, often find their fatigue steadily increases until the end of treatment. Proposed mechanisms by which cancer can cause fatigue include an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, disruption of circadian rhythms, muscle loss and cancer wasting, and genetic problems. Additionally, some forms of cancer may cause fatigue through more direct mechanisms, such as a leukemia that causes anemia by preventing the bone marrow from producing blood cells efficiently. A relationship between Interleukin 6 and fatigue has been observed in studies, albeit inconsistently. Increased markers of sympathetic nervous system activity are also associated with cancer related fatigue. Screening The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends that every cancer patient be systematically screened for fatigue at the first visit with an oncologist, throughout treatment, and afterwards. Screening typically involves a simple question, like \\"On a scale of one to ten, how tired have you felt during the last week?\\" More detailed information may be collected in a symptom journal. Diagnosis Some causes of cancer-related fatigue are treatable, and evaluation is directed towards identifying these treatable causes. Treatable causes of cancer-related fatigue include: anemia, pain, emotional distress, sleep disturbances, nutritional disturbances, decreased physical fitness and activity, side effects from medications (e.g., sedatives), abuse of alcohol or other substances. Additionally, other medical conditions, such as infections, heart disease, or endocrine dysfunction (e.g., hot flashes), can cause fatigue, and may also need treatment. Definition The National Comprehensive Cancer Network defines cancer-related fatigue as \\"a distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning\\". Cancer-related fatigue is a chronic fatigue (persistent fatigue not relieved by rest), but it is not related to chronic fatigue syndrome. Management Treatment depends on the patient's overall situation. A patient who is in active treatment may have different priorities than a person who has completed treatment, or who is at the end of life. Some management strategies may help all patients and could be supported by the work of an Occupational Therapist. These include scheduling high- priority tasks during the patient's best time of day, using labor-saving devices, delegating tasks to caregivers, and avoiding unimportant activities, so that the patient will have more energy available for other activities. Patients who are not at the end of life may benefit from physical exercise or physical therapy. Engaging in moderate activity reduces fatigue.Jose Stephy, Diwan Sanjay Kumar. Effect of standardized exercise program on reported fatigue in patients of cancer receiving chemotherapy. Clinical Cancer Investigation Journal 3(5): 373-376 While antidepressants are ineffective at reducing fatigue in non-depressed cancer patients, the stimulant methylphenidate (Ritalin) may reduce fatigue in some patients. At the end of life, fatigue is usually associated with other symptoms, especially anemia, side effects from many medications and previous treatments, and poor nutritional status. Pain, difficulty breathing, and fatigue form a common symptom cluster. Fatigue often increases as patients with advanced cancer approach death. As a result, people who are dying often sleep much more than a healthy person. Addressing specific causes If the fatigue is caused or exacerbated by a specific medical condition, such as anemia, then treatment of that medical condition should reduce the fatigue. * Anemia: Loss of oxygen- carrying red blood cells is a common cause of fatigue. Medications to improve blood production or blood transfusions frequently reduce fatigue. * Pain: A variety of approaches to managing cancer pain may be used, particularly analgesic medications. * Emotional distress: Anxiety and depression are strongly associated with fatigue in cancer patients. Psychosocial treatments directed at reducing stress and increasing coping skills may reduce fatigue. Additionally, some patients in active treatment worry that the fatigue indicates treatment failure, and this anxiety may increase their fatigue in a vicious cycle. Education about fatigue as a normal side effect can reassure the patient. Up to 25% of cancer patients will experience depression. * Sleep disturbances: Patients who do not sleep well are more tired than others. Cancer patients commonly experience insomnia or hypersomnia. Sleep disturbances may be caused by sleeping too much during the day, by restless leg syndrome, by pain, by anxiety, or by other medical conditions, like obstructive sleep apnea or menopause. Practicing good sleep hygiene may reduce fatigue by improving sleep quality. * Nutritional disturbances: Patients may have difficulty eating, may not be absorbing food well, or may have chosen an extreme diet as an alternative cancer treatment. Loss of appetite, diarrhea and vomiting may result in the patient consuming too few calories or becoming dehydrated. * Lack of physical activity: Decreased physical activity can make fatigue worse by reducing endurance and muscle strength. Participating in regular aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity both during and after cancer treatment may reduce cancer-related fatigue. Current physical activity guidelines recommend adults with cancer to engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate- intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous- intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination. It is also recommended to perform muscle-strengthening physical activity two to three times a week, although there are studies showing that aerobic training is better at mitigating symptoms of cancer-related fatigue and reduces the risk of post exercise malaise. Physical activities should be tailored to individual needs and physical abilities. * Side effects from medications: Fatigue and sleepiness are known side effects with some kinds of medications. Sometimes a change of medication, the dose, or the timing of the medication may result in less fatigue. For example, an antihistamine might be taken shortly before sleep, rather than in the middle of the day. * Substance abuse: Alcohol, marijuana, and many other drugs can produce fatigue as a side effect. * Other medical conditions: Cancer and its treatment usually put intense physical stress on the body, which can exacerbate other medical conditions. Additionally, fatigue may result from an infection. Prognosis Fatigue caused by the cancer or its treatment often resolves if treatment is successful. However, some patients experience long-term or chronic fatigue. When strict definitions are used, about 20% of long-term, disease-free cancer survivors report fatigue. Under looser definitions, up to half of cancer survivors report fatigue. However, these studies are largely limited to patients with breast cancer, or peripheral stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant patients, and the incidence may be different for survivors of other cancers. Experiencing fatigue before treatment, being depressed or anxious, getting too little exercise, and having other medical conditions are all associated with higher levels of fatigue in post-treatment cancer survivors. Receiving multiple types of treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, is associated with more fatigue. Older adults have a higher risk of long-term fatigue.

Hopley used corporal punishment with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor's part, but instead beat the boy to death. An inquest into Cancellor's death began when his brother requested an autopsy. As a result of the inquest Hopley was arrested and charged with manslaughter. He was found guilty at trial and sentenced to four years in prison, although he insisted that his actions were justifiable and that he was not guilty of any crime. The trial was sensationalised by the Victorian press and incited debate over the use of corporal punishment in schools. After Hopley's release and subsequent divorce trial, he largely disappeared from the public record. The case became an important legal precedent in the United Kingdom for discussions of corporal punishment in schools and reasonable limits on discipline. Background Thomas Hopley, aged 41 at the time of the incident, was a schoolmaster in Eastbourne who ran a private boarding school from his home at 22 Grand Parade. He was well educated and from a middle-class family, the son of a Royal Navy surgeon and brother of artist Edward Hopley, author Catherine C. Hopley, and editor John Hopley. His household was fairly well off, and he and his wife kept several servants. He had two children, the first of which had brain damage - \\"popular rumour\\" blamed this on \\"his unconventionally bracing notions of neonatal care\\". Hopley was described by writer Algernon Charles Swinburne as \\"a person of high attainments and irreproachable character\\". He expressed \\"utopian\\" educational ideals shared by many Victorian educational theorists. He wrote pamphlets on education topics which included \\"Lectures on the Education of Man\\", \\"Help towards the physical, intellectual and moral elevation of all classes of society\\", and \\"Wrongs which cry out for redress\\" advocating the abolition of child labour. In October 1859, he was offered ¬£180 a year to teach Reginald Channell Cancellor, a \\"robust\\" boy who had been \\"given up as ineducable\\". Reginald was the son of John Henry Cancellor (1799‚Äì1860), a master of the Court of Common Pleas and a \\"man of fair position\\" from Barnes, Surrey. The boy had previously been a student at a private school in St. Leonards and under a private tutor. He was not a good student, with contemporary sources suggesting he \\"had water on the brain\\" and describing him as \\"stolid and stupid\\". Hopley attributed Cancellor's failure to learn to stubbornness. On 18 April 1860 he asked the boy's father for permission to use \\"severe corporal punishment\\" to obtain compliance, with permission granted two days later. Hopley did not possess the cane traditionally used to administer corporal punishment to students, so instead he used a skipping rope and a walking stick. Death Cancellor was found dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April 1860. His body was covered, with long stockings over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial. Rumours began to circulate among the Hopleys' servants, suggesting that Hopley's wife had spent the night prior to the body's discovery cleaning up evidence of her husband's beating of the boy. Reginald's older brother, Reverend John Henry Cancellor Jr. (1834‚Äì1900), arrived in Eastbourne from Send, Surrey, on 25 April. He noticed discrepancies in the reports of his brother's death and requested an autopsy. Hopley asked prominent physician Sir Charles Locock, an acquaintance of the Cancellor family and an obstetrician to the Queen, to examine the body and verify death by natural causes; Locock believed that Hopley was responsible for the death. A complete inquest into Cancellor's death was initiated. His body was taken for autopsy on 28 April and was found to be covered in blood under the gloves and stockings. His thighs were \\"reduced to a perfect jelly\\" and his body was covered in bruises and cuts, including two inch-deep holes in his right leg, deep enough to allow the medical examiner, Robert Willis, to touch the bone underneath. Willis reported that other than these injuries, the boy was healthy and his internal organs (including the heart) were free of disease. He thus concluded that Cancellor had not died of natural causes, as Hopley had suggested, and noted that the boy had obviously been beaten shortly before his death. A female servant named Ellen Fowler, when questioned by investigators, reported that she had heard Cancellor screaming and being beaten from 10 pm until midnight and that, shortly thereafter, he abruptly fell silent. She also noted traces of blood in the house and on Hopley's candlestick, which was left outside Cancellor's bedroom, and evidence that Cancellor's and Hopley's clothes had been washed soon before the former was pronounced dead. Two other servants testified in the inquiry and gave similar accounts. The inquest was unable to determine Cancellor's exact cause of death, but noted several inconsistencies in Hopley's explanation of events. He had failed to summon a doctor immediately and, upon questioning, had given outlandish excuses for his failure to do so. Hopley attempted to explain away the blood on the candlestick by attributing it to a broken blister on his hand, but did not offer an explanation for Cancellor's injuries. Hopley aroused further suspicion when he asked journalists present at the inquest not to include details of the corporal punishment in their stories, \\"in order to spare the feelings of the deceased family as of my own\\". Cancellor's family was deeply affected by the case, as they had been \\"disinclined\\" to see Cancellor beaten; his father died of a \\"broken heart\\" shortly after the inquest. Trial Caricature of Hopley's barrister, William Ballantine Hopley was arrested in early May and, after a seven-hour preliminary hearing, was released on 16 June on a ¬£2,000 bail. He and his then-pregnant wife spent the period between the initial hearing and the trial at Uckfield. Hopley was confident that he would be found not guilty. He began composing a pamphlet titled Facts Bearing on the Death of Reginald Channell Cancellor, to be published after the trial; it was published by an associate of Hopley's after his conviction and detailed Hopley's explanation of Cancellor's death and his justification for his treatment of the boy. The press was extremely hostile, calling for a murder charge to be laid against him. He received a large amount of hate mail from anonymous members of the public. Hopley's trial took place at Lewes Assizes on 23 July 1860, before the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench Sir Alexander Cockburn and a jury. The prosecutors were John Humffreys Parry and William Jerome Knapp; Hopley was defended by the serjeant-at-law William Ballantine, who subsequently described Hopley as \\"distorted\\". Throughout his trial, Hopley described himself as reluctant to use corporal punishment. In describing the events preceding Cancellor's death, Hopley stated that he started crying while beating Cancellor, after which Cancellor presented his lesson and \\"Hopley took his head on his breast and prayed with him\\". Hopley presented testimonials from past students who described him as \\"kindly\\" and who noted an infrequent use of violence. Hopley claimed to be a paedagogical follower of John Locke, who had decried the use of corporal punishment except in cases of extreme obstinacy on the part of the student. He argued that, through the application of this theory, the beating that killed Cancellor had been a necessary one. Robert Willis testified at the trial that there was no possibility that Cancellor's death had been a result of natural causes. He presented a detailed description of the boy's injuries, suggesting that they had been sustained over several hours. He also revealed that Cancellor's skull cavity contained six to eight ounces of fluid, attributing to this fluid the boy's seeming inability to learn as described by Hopley, but rejected any suggestions that it may have contributed to Cancellor's death. Cancellor's brother, Fowler, and Locock all testified against Hopley; Locock's testimony was particularly hostile, suggesting that Hopley's incompetent response to interviews was \\"tantamount to an admission of guilt\\". Other witnesses included the Hopleys' laundress, Roberts, three members of the coastguard who had seen lights on in the house late at night, a local constable, and the town registrar. Chief Justice Alexander Cockburn Ballantine's conduct during the trial was flawed, and he believed Hopley was insane. Although he promoted the testimonials of former students and argued that a schoolmaster was unlikely to \\"so lightly jeopardize his ambitions\\", he congratulated Locock on the accuracy of his testimony in open court. Ballantine did not call key witnesses such as Edward Philpott, another student of Hopley's who had been at the house that night. Philpott slept in the bedroom beside Cancellor's and had reported hearing no unusual noises or screams from Cancellor's room on the night of his death. Neither did Ballantine call Professor John Eric Erichsen of University College Hospital, who had conducted a second autopsy on Cancellor on 11 May and suggested that \\"the misleading appearance of the body was attributable to an undiagnosed blood condition akin to haemophilia\\". In his memoir Some experiences of a barrister's life, published in 1883, Ballantine offered a highly sensationalised account of Cancellor's death: \\"the wretched half-witted victim of a lunatic's system of education was deliberately mangled to death\\". Hopley was convicted of manslaughter, not murder, because of his position as a schoolteacher \\"endowed with parental authority\\". Sir Alexander Cockburn, the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, presented a summary of the decision: Cockburn further suggested that Hopley should have realised Cancellor's cognitive deficiencies and taken these into account in his treatment of the boy. Hopley was sentenced to four years of penal servitude, and was incarcerated in Portsea and Chatham. After being indicted, he wrote of himself that \\"while anguish shook the frame, the conscience suffered not one pang. I searched and searched among the deepest secrets of my soul, and could not blame myself ... I could look up tranquilly into the face of heaven who knew me to be Not Guilty.\\"Quoted in He believed that his actions were justifiable because he had undertaken them in his duty as schoolteacher. He portrayed himself as a victim of public opinion, claiming that \\"a mournful accident was swelled up into a bloody midnight murder, and how it has been brought about that my unfortunate name has been branded, not simply through the United Kingdom, but through the civilised world, as one of the most execrable monsters or of madmen.\\" He published a pamphlet arguing that Locock had perjured himself and had conspired with Fowler to influence the outcome of the trial. Reaction and aftermath Hopley was sent to Millbank Prison to serve his sentence. The trial was sensationalised by contemporary media. The press derided Hopley as \\"monstrous\\", and criticised schoolteachers in general and private schoolteachers in particular. Newspapers published graphic accounts of Cancellor's injuries and autopsy and further exaggerated the early rumours surrounding his death. Cancellor's was the first death by corporal punishment to have received broad public interest. To prevent overcrowding, the court issued tickets for admission to the public gallery during the trial; the courtroom was full an hour before the trial began. After Hopley's conviction, he issued at least two pamphlets on model education from gaol, which were poorly received by the public. Hopley's fame was short-lived; a month after his conviction, the press was focused on another case of corporal punishment, that of Caroline Lefevre, whose arms were allegedly burnt by her teacher. Following Hopley's release from prison, he became immediately embroiled in a sensationalised divorce trial. His wife, Fanny, had petitioned for divorce on the grounds that he was \\"unloving\\" and had mistreated her. She claimed that Hopley had married her as an \\"educational experiment\\", presenting Hopley's educational theories as evidence of his \\"lunacy\\". She had been 18 years old to Hopley's 36 at the time of their marriage in 1855. According to her statements during the trial, Hopley frequently criticised her writing and insisted that the couple's three children should be raised as \\"second Christs\\". She accused him of physically abusing her from the time of her first pregnancy, beating their first child only days after its birth (the child was later found to be \\"brain-damaged\\"), and suggesting that during his prison sentence she should be confined to a workhouse. Hopley responded by claiming that he set rules only to ensure the maintenance of his household and the wellbeing of his family, and produced a set of romantic letters he had received from Fanny during his incarceration as evidence of her unforced affection for him. The jury found Hopley guilty of cruelty in July 1864, but suggested that Fanny had condoned his treatment of her. The judge therefore ruled that her case was insufficient to grant a divorce. The verdict sparked outrage among the public, who believed that \\"a great injustice had been done\\", and that Fanny should not be forced to remain married to an abusive convicted killer. Fanny left England shortly afterwards, allegedly to avoid having to continue living with Hopley. Hopley largely withdrew from the public eye after the trial, becoming a private tutor in London and publishing pamphlets on spiritualism in the late 1860s. He died at University College Hospital on 24 June 1876. A retrospective editorial published in The Times in 1960 concluded that Hopley was not \\"the villain which some persons pictured him to be\\"; it noted that at the time of his arrest Hopley had been planning the construction of a \\"model school\\" in Brighton and that he had examined architect's drawings of the school after beating Cancellor. In 1865, Cancellor's death was used in a medical journal article discussing adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, but that he was consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness. R v Hopley was used as an archetypal case for legal commentaries about corporal punishment until physical discipline was officially banned in British schools over a century later. According to education professor Marie Parker-Jenkins, R v Hopley is \\"the most quoted case of the 19th century involving the issue of corporal punishment\\". The case is credited with prompting outcry against corporal punishment among the general public, although contemporary education journals rejected the possibility of abolishing corporal punishment. Hopley's defence, known as \\"reasonable chastisement\\", became a frequently used response to charges of corporal punishment and was incorporated into the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Cockburn's requirement for \\"moderate and reasonable\\" punishment was established as a legal limit to corporal punishment and is still employed in modern legal scholarship.

Circa 2000, the service that distributed Native American programming to radio stations via the Public Radio Satellite System was called AIROS. Koahnic relied on AIROS to distribute several of its programs. In 2005, Indian Country Today described AIROS as primarily a distributor and Koahnic primarily a program content provider. Then Koahnic won the contract to use the satellite network, and renamed the service Native Voice One. Koahnic took over the service on 1 July 2006. In 2014, the Smithsonian Institution listed two organizations as operating Native American networks via satellite: Native Voice One and Sat√©lite Radio Biling√ºe. The latter serves Spanish language radio listeners in the United States, some of which are Native American.

Common in North America and Europe, it is often an opportunistic parasite, and has a wide range of hosts among deciduous trees, although it can also infect conifers. It can also live as a saprobe, deriving nutrients from decomposing wood. The mushroom is typically found growing in clusters at the base of trees and stumps. Both the cap and the stem are covered in small, pointed scales that are pointed downward and backward. The crowded gills are yellowish, then later rust-brown. The mushroom has an odor that, depending on the author, has been described as resembling garlic, lemon, radish, onion, or skunk. It has a strong taste, resembling radishes. Once thought to be edible, it is now considered and known to be poisonous, especially if consumed in combination with alcohol. The mushroom contains unique chemicals thought to help it infect plants by neutralizing defensive responses employed by them. The very similar P. squarrosoides differs in having a paler cap that is sticky between the scales, and smaller spores. Taxonomy The species was first described scientifically as Agaricus squarrosus in 1790 by George Christian Edler von Oldenburg Oeder, and later sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum. It was transferred to the genus Pholiota by the German Paul Kummer. It is the type species of the genus Pholiota. The specific epithet squarrosa is derived from Latin, and means \\"scurfy\\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"scaly Pholiota\\", the \\"shaggy scalycap\\", or the \\"shaggy Pholiota\\". Description View of gills and stems Like other Pholiota mushrooms, P. squarrosa has a scaly cap and stem. The cap ranges from in diameter, and depending on its age, can range in shape from bell-shaped to rounded to somewhat flattened. The cap color is yellowish-brown to tawny in older specimens. The scales on the cap are yellowish to tawny, and recurved. The stem is long by thick, and roughly equal in width throughout. The partial veil that covers the young gills forms a thick, woolly ring on the upper part of the stem. Above the level of the ring, the stem is bare, while below it is scaly like the cap. The gills are covered by a partial veil when young and have a greenish-brown color; mature gills are rusty brown. They are crowded closely together, attached to the stem (adnate), and usually notched (sinuate). The spore print is cinnamon or rusty brown. The spores are elliptic, smooth-walled, nonamyloid (not absorbing iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 6.6‚Äì8 by 3.7‚Äì4.4 Œºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, and four-spored, with dimensions of 16‚Äì25 by 5‚Äì7 Œºm. Edibility Fruit bodies have an odour described variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, and taste like radish. Although some older sources report P. squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect may be due to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol. Similar species Leucopholiota decorosa is a lookalike. Pholiota squarrosa is similar in appearance to species in the genus Armillaria, but the latter produces white spore prints. Another similar mushroom is Pholiota squarrosoides, which can be distinguished microscopically by its smaller spores, and macroscopically by the stickiness of the cap between the scales. P. squarrosoides also lacks the odor of P. squarrosa, and has flesh that is white, not yellow. Leucopholiota decorosa can also be misidentified with P. squarrosa; it has white, adnexed gills with finely scalloped edges, but it can be distinguished most reliably by its white, nonamyloid spores. Ecology, habitat and distribution Pholiota squarrosa is thought to be a white rot fungus, which use cellulose as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood. P. squarrosa is found in North America and Europe. The North American distribution extends north to Canada, and south to Mexico, where its appearance is restricted to coniferous forests. In the Netherlands, P. squarrosa is one of many mushrooms that can regularly be found fruiting on ancient timber wharves. The fruit bodies are used as a primary food source by the red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, and have a higher protein content than the other mushrooms typically consumed by this species. Decaying fruit bodies are also used as a food source by fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. Chemistry The fruit bodies contain unique chemical compounds that are derived from phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a main cause of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench reactive oxygen species produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection.

It can also be defined as a set of activities and processes to solve problems by using or applying the characteristics of game elements. Gamification commonly employs game design elements to improve user engagement, organizational productivity, flow, learning, crowdsourcing, knowledge retention, employee recruitment and evaluation, ease of use, usefulness of systems, physical exercise, traffic violations, voter apathy, and more. A collection of research on gamification shows that a majority of studies on gamification find it has positive effects on individuals. However, individual and contextual differences exist.  Techniques  Gamification techniques are intended to leverage people's natural desires for socializing, learning, mastery, competition, achievement, status, self-expression, altruism, or closure, or simply their response to the framing of a situation as game or play. Early gamification strategies use rewards for players who accomplish desired tasks or competition to engage players. Types of rewards include points, achievement badges or levels, the filling of a progress bar, or providing the user with virtual currency. Making the rewards for accomplishing tasks visible to other players or providing leader boards are ways of encouraging players to compete. Another approach to gamification is to make existing tasks feel more like games. Some techniques used in this approach include adding meaningful choice, onboarding with a tutorial, increasing challenge, and adding narrative.  Game design elements  Game design elements are the basic building blocks of gamification applications.Costa, C. J. (2019). Gamification. OAE ‚Äì Organizational Architect and Engineer Journal. https://doi.org/10.21428/b3658bca.8ffccebfDeterding, S., Dixon, D., Khaled, R., & Nacke, L. (2011). From Game Design Elements to Gamefulness: Defining \\"Gamification\\". Paper presented at the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference, Tampere. http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/ 2181037.2181040. Among these typical game design elements, are points, badges, leader-boards, performance graphs, meaningful stories, avatars, and teammates. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.  Points  Points are basic elements of a multitude of games and gamified applications.Zichermann, G., & Cunningham, C. (2011). Gamification by Design: Implementing game mechanics in web and mobile apps. Sebastopol: O'Reilly Media. They are typically rewarded for the successful accomplishment of specified activities within the gamified environmentWerbach, K., & Hunter, D. (2015). The gamification toolkit - dynamics, mechanics, and components for the win. Philadelphia: Wharton Digital Press. and they serve to numerically represent a player's progress.Werbach, K., & Hunter, D. (2012). For the Win: How game thinking can revolutionize your business. Philadelphia: Wharton Digital Press. Various kinds of points can be differentiated between, e.g. experience points, redeemable points, or reputation points, as can the different purposes that points serve. One of the most important purposes of points is to provide feedback. Points allow the players' in-game behavior to be measured, and they serve as continuous and immediate feedback and as a reward.Sailer, M., Hense, J., Mandl, H., & Klevers, M. (2013). Psychological perspectives on motivation through gamification. Interaction Design and Architecture(s) Journal, 19, 28e37.  Badges  Badges are defined as visual representations of achievements and can be earned and collected within the gamification environment. They confirm the players' achievements, symbolize their merits, and visibly show their accomplishment of levels or goals.Antin, J., & Churchill, E. F. (2011). Badges in social media: A social psychological perspective. Paper presented at the CHI 2011, Vancouver. Earning a badge can be dependent on a specific number of points or on particular activities within the game. Badges have many functions, serving as goals, if the prerequisites for winning them are known to the player, or as virtual status symbols. In the same way as points, badges also provide feedback, in that they indicate how the players have performed.Rigby, C. S., & Ryan, R. M. (2011). Glued to games: How video games draw us in and hold us spellbound. Santa barbara: Praeger. Badges can influence players' behavior, leading them to select certain routes and challenges in order to earn badges that are associated with them.Wang, H., & Sun, C.-T. (2011). Game reward systems: gaming experiences and social meanings. Paper presented at the DiGRA 2011 conference: Think Design Play, Hilversum. Additionally, as badges symbolize one's membership in a group of those who own this particular badge, they also can exert social influences on players and co-players, particularly if they are rare or hard to earn.  Leaderboards  Leaderboards rank players according to their relative success, measuring them against a certain success criterion.Costa, J. P., Wehbe, R. R., Robb, J., & Nacke, L. E. (2013). Time‚Äôs Up: Studying Leadboards For Engaging Punctual Behaviour. Paper presented at the Gamification 2013: 1st International Conference on Gameful Design, Research, and Applications, Stratfort. As such, leaderboards can help determine who performs best in a certain activityCrumlish, C., & Malone, E. (2009). Designing social interfaces: Principles, patterns, and practices for improving the user experience. Sebastopol: O'Reilly Media, Inc. and are thus competitive indicators of progress that relate the player's own performance to the performance of others. However, the motivational potential of leaderboards is mixed. Werbach and Hunter regard them as effective motivators if there are only a few points left to the next level or position, but as demotivators, if players find themselves at the bottom end of the leaderboard. Competition caused by leaderboards can create social pressure to increase the player's level of engagement and can consequently have a constructive effect on participation and learning. However, these positive effects of competition are more likely if the respective competitors are approximately at the same performance level.Landers, R. N., & Landers, A. K. (2014). An Empirical Test of the Theory of Gamified Learning: The Effect of Leaderboards on Time-on-Task and Academic Performance. Simulation & Gaming, 45(6), 769-785. doi 10.1177/1046878114563662 .  Performance graphs  Performance graphs, which are often used in simulation or strategy games, provide information about the players' performance compared to their preceding performance during a game. Thus, in contrast to leaderboards, performance graphs do not compare the player's performance to other players, but instead, evaluate the player's own performance over time. Unlike the social reference standard of leaderboards, performance graphs are based on an individual reference standard. By graphically displaying the player's performance over a fixed period, they focus on improvements. Motivation theory postulates that this fosters mastery orientation, which is particularly beneficial to learning.  Meaningful stories  Meaningful stories are game design elements that do not relate to the player's performance. The narrative context in which a gamified application can be embedded contextualizes activities and characters in the game and gives them meaning beyond the mere quest for points and achievements.Kapp, K. M. (2012). The gamification of learning and instruction: Game-based methods and strategies for training and education. San Francisco: Pfeiffer. A story can be communicated by a game's title (e.g., Space Invaders) or by complex storylines typical of contemporary role-playing video games (e.g., The Elder Scrolls Series). Narrative contexts can be oriented towards real, non-game contexts or act as analogies of real-world settings. The latter can enrich boring, barely stimulating contexts, and, consequently, inspire and motivate players particularly if the story is in line with their personal interests.Nicholson, S. (2015). A RECIPE for meaningful gamification. In T. Reiners, & L. C. Wood (Eds.), Gamification in education and business (pp. 1e20). New York: Springer. . As such, stories are also an important part in gamification applications, as they can alter the meaning of real-world activities by adding a narrative ‚Äòoverlay‚Äô, e.g. being hunted by zombies while going for a run.  Avatars  Avatars are visual representations of players within the game or gamification environment. Usually, they are chosen or even created by the player. Avatars can be designed quite simply as a mere pictogram, or they can be complexly animated, three- dimensional representations. Their main formal requirement is that they unmistakably identify the players and set them apart from other human or computer- controlled avatars. Avatars allow the players to adopt or create another identity and, in cooperative games, to become part of a community.  Teammates  Teammates, whether they are other real players or virtual non- player characters, can induce conflict, competition or cooperation. The latter can be fostered particularly by introducing teams, i.e. by creating defined groups of players that work together towards a shared objective.  Applications  Gamification has been applied to almost every aspect of life. Examples of gamification in business context include the U.S. Army, which uses military simulator America's Army as a recruitment tool, and M&M;'s \\"Eye Spy\\" pretzel game, launched in 2013 to amplify the company's pretzel marketing campaign by creating a fun way to \\"boost user engagement.\\" Another example can be seen in the American education system. Students are ranked in their class based on their earned grade-point average (GPA), which is comparable to earning a high score in video games. Students may also receive incentives, such as an honorable mention on the dean's list, the honor roll, and scholarships, which are equivalent to leveling-up a video game character or earning virtual currency or tools that augment game success. Job application processes sometimes use gamification as a way to hire employees by assessing their suitability through questionnaires and mini games that simulate the actual work environment of that company.  Marketing  Gamification has been widely applied in marketing. Over 70% of Forbes Global 2000 companies surveyed in 2013 said they planned to use gamification for the purposes of marketing and customer retention. For example, in November, 2011, Australian broadcast and online media partnership Yahoo!7 launched its Fango mobile app/SAP, which TV viewers use to interact with shows via techniques like check-ins and badges. Gamification has also been used in customer loyalty programs. In 2010, Starbucks gave custom Foursquare badges to people who checked in at multiple locations, and offered discounts to people who checked in most frequently at an individual store. As a general rule Gamification Marketing or Game Marketing usually falls under four primary categories; 1\\\\. Brandification (in-game advertising): Messages, images or videos promoting a Brand, Product or Service within a game's visuals components. According to NBCNews game creators Electronic Arts used \\"Madden 09\\" and \\"Burnout Paradise\\" to promote 'in-game' billboards encouraging players to vote. 2\\\\. Transmedia: The result of taking a media property and extending it into a different medium for both promotional and monetisation purposes. Nintendo's \\"007: GoldenEye\\" is a classic example. A video game created to advertise the originally titled movie. In the end, the promotional game brought in more money than the originally titled film. 3\\\\. Through-the-line (TTL) & Below-the-line (BTL): Text above, side or below main game screen (also known as an iFrame) advertising images or text. Example of this would be \\"I love Bees\\". 4\\\\. Advergames: Usually games based on popular mobile game templates, such as 'Candy Crush' or 'Temple Run'. These games are then recreated via platforms like WIX with software from the likes of Gamify, in order to promote Brands, Products and Services. Usually to encourage engagement, loyalty and product education. These usually involve social leaderboards and rewards that are advertised via social media platforms like Facebook's Top 10 games. Gamification also has been used as a tool for customer engagement, and for encouraging desirable website usage behaviour. Additionally, gamification is applicable to increasing engagement on sites built on social network services. For example, in August, 2010, the website builder DevHub announced an increase in the number of users who completed their online tasks from 10% to 80% after adding gamification elements. On the programming question-and-answer site Stack Overflow users receive points and/or badges for performing a variety of actions, including spreading links to questions and answers via Facebook and Twitter. A large number of different badges are available, and when a user's reputation points exceed various thresholds, the user gains additional privileges, eventually including moderator privileges.  Inspiration  Gamification can be used for ideation (structured brainstorming to produce new ideas). A study at MIT Sloan found that ideation games helped participants generate more and better ideas, and compared it to gauging the influence of academic papers by the numbers of citations received in subsequent research.  Health  Applications like Fitocracy and QUENTIQ (Dacadoo) use gamification to encourage their users to exercise more effectively and improve their overall health. Users are awarded varying numbers of points for activities they perform in their workouts, and gain levels based on points collected. Users can also complete quests (sets of related activities) and gain achievement badges for fitness milestones. Health Month adds aspects of social gaming by allowing successful users to restore points to users who have failed to meet certain goals. Public health researchers have studied the use of gamification in self-management of chronic diseases and common mental disorders, STD prevention, and infection prevention and control. In a review of health apps in the 2014 Apple App Store, more than 100 apps showed a positive correlation between gamification elements used and high user ratings. MyFitnessPal was named as the app that used the most gamification elements. Reviewers of the popular location-based game Pok√©mon Go praised the game for promoting physical exercise. Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was \\"secretly the best exercise app out there,\\" and that it changed her daily walking routine. Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pok√©mon Go. Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the \\"greatest unintentional health fad ever,\\" writing that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have imagined was that \\"it seems to be getting people moving.\\" One study showed users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, approximately 26% more than usual. Ingress is a similar game that also requires a player to be physically active. Zombies, Run!, a game in which the player is trying to survive a zombie apocalypse through a series of missions, requires the player to (physically) run, collect items to help the town survive, and listen to various audio narrations to uncover mysteries. Mobile, context-sensitive serious games for sports and health have been called exergames.  Work  Gamification has been used in an attempt to improve employee productivity in healthcare, financial services, transportation, government, and others. In general, enterprise gamification refers to work situations where \\"game thinking and game-based tools are used in a strategic manner to integrate with existing business processes or information systems. And these techniques are used to help drive positive employee and organizational outcomes.\\"  Crowdsourcing  Crowdsourcing has been gamified in games like Foldit, a game designed by the University of Washington, in which players compete to manipulate proteins into more efficient structures. A 2010 paper in science journal Nature credited Foldit's 57,000 players with providing useful results that matched or outperformed algorithmically computed solutions. The ESP Game is a game that is used to generate image metadata. Google Image Labeler is a version of the ESP Game that Google has licensed to generate its own image metadata. Research from the University of Bonn used gamification to increase wiki contributions by 62%.  Education and training Education and training are areas where there has been interest in gamification. Gamification has been attracting attention in the context of education and training as it offers variety of benefits associated with learning outcomes. Helms et al. developed a taxonomy of educational game elements based on eight broad categories and 26 unique game elements. The authors linked each game element to positive and negative educational outcomes. Microsoft released the game Ribbon Hero 2 as an add-on to their Office productivity suite to help train people to use it effectively. This project was described by Microsoft as one of the most popular projects its Office Labs division ever released. The New York City Department of Education with funding from the MacArthur Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has set up a school called Quest to Learn Center RD around game-based learning, seeking to make education more engaging and relevant to modern children. SAP has used games to educate their employees on sustainability. The US military and Unilever have also used gamification in their training. The Khan Academy is an example of the use of gamification techniques in online education. In August 2009, Gbanga launched the educational location-based game Gbanga Zooh for Zurich Zoo that asked participants to actively save endangered animals and physically bring them back to a zoo. Players maintained virtual habitats across the Canton of Zurich to attract and collect endangered species of animals. There is some indication that gamification can be particularly motivational for students with dyslexia in educational situations. Gamification is used in corporate training to motivate employees to apply what they learned in the training to their job, theoretically this should improve performance. According to a study conducted by Badgeville, 78% of workers are utilizing games-based motivation at work and nearly 91% say these systems improve their work experience by increasing engagement, awareness and productivity.  Politics and terrorist groups  Alix Levine, an American security consultant, reports that some techniques that a number of extremist websites such as Stormfront and various terrorism- related sites used to build loyalty and participation can be described as gamification. As an example, Levine mentioned reputation scores. The Chinese government has announced that it will begin using gamification to rate its citizens in 2020, implementing a Social Credit System in which citizens will earn points representing trustworthiness. Details of this project are still vague, but it has been reported that citizens will receive points for good behavior, such as making payments on time and educational attainments.  Technology design  Traditionally, researchers thought of motivations to use computer systems to be primarily driven by extrinsic purposes; however, many modern systems have their use driven primarily by intrinsic motivations. Examples of such systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, include online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, and so on. Such systems are excellent candidates for further 'gamification' in their design. Moreover, even traditional management information systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) are being 'gamified' such that both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations must increasingly be considered. As illustration, Microsoft has announced plans to use gamification techniques for its Windows Phone 7 operating system design. While businesses face the challenges of creating motivating gameplay strategies, what makes for effective gamification is a key question. One important type of technological design in gamification is the player centered design. Based on the design methodology user-centered design, its main goal is to promote greater connectivity and positive behavior change between technological consumers. It has five steps that help computer users connect with other people online to help them accomplish goals and other tasks they need to complete. The 5 steps are: an individual or company has to know their player (their target audience), identify their mission (their goal), understand human motivation (the personality, desires, and triggers of the target audience), apply mechanics (points, badges, leaderboards, etc.), and to manage, monitor, and measure the way they are using their mechanics to ensure it is helping them achieve the desired outcome of their goal and that their goal is specific and realistic.  Authentication  Gamification has also been applied to authentication. For example, the possibilities of using a game like Guitar Hero can help someone learn a password implicitly. Furthermore, games have been explored as a way to learn new and complicated passwords. It is suggested that these games could be used to \\"level up\\" a password, thereby improving its strength over time. Gamification has also been proposed as a way to select and manage archives. Recently, an Australian technology company called Wynbox has recorded success in the application of its gamification engine to the hotel booking process.  Online casino  Gamification has been used to some extent by online casinos. For example, the Casumo and Casino Heroes brands use an incremental reward system to extend the typical player lifecycle and to encourage repeat visits and cash deposits at the casino in return for rewards such as free spins and cash match bonuses on subsequent deposits.  History  Though the term \\"gamification\\" first appeared online in the context of computer software in 2008, it did not gain popularity until 2010. Even prior to the term coming into use, other fields borrowing elements from videogames was common; for example, some work in learning disabilities and scientific visualization adapted elements from videogames. The term \\"gamification\\" first gained widespread usage in 2010, in a more specific sense referring to incorporation of social/reward aspects of games into software. The technique captured the attention of venture capitalists, one of whom said he considered gamification the most promising area in gaming. Another observed that half of all companies seeking funding for consumer software applications mentioned game design in their presentations. Several researchers consider gamification closely related to earlier work on adapting game-design elements and techniques to non-game contexts. Deterding et al. survey research in human‚Äìcomputer interaction that uses game-derived elements for motivation and interface design, and Nelson argues for a connection to both the Soviet concept of socialist competition, and the American management trend of \\"fun at work\\". Fuchs points out that gamification might be driven by new forms of ludic interfaces. Gamification conferences have also retroactively incorporated simulation; e.g. Will Wright, designer of the 1989 video game SimCity, was the keynote speaker at the gamification conference Gsummit 2013. In addition to companies that use the technique, a number of businesses created gamification platforms. In October 2007, Bunchball, backed by Adobe Systems Incorporated, was the first company to provide game mechanics as a service, on Dunder Mifflin Infinity, the community site for the NBC TV show The Office. Bunchball customers have included Playboy, Chiquita, Bravo, and The USA Network. Badgeville, which offers gamification services, launched in late 2010, and raised $15 million in venture-capital funding in its first year of operation. Among established enterprise firms, SAP AG, Microsoft, IBM, SAP, LiveOps, Deloitte, and other companies have started using gamification in various applications and processes. Gamification 2013, an event exploring the future of gamification, was held at the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus in October 2013.  Legal restrictions  Through gamification's growing adoption and its nature as a data aggregator, multiple legal restrictions may apply to gamification. Some refer to the use of virtual currencies and virtual assets, data privacy laws and data protection, or labour laws. The use of virtual currencies, in contrast to traditional payment systems, is not regulated. The legal uncertainty surrounding the virtual currency schemes might constitute a challenge for public authorities, as these schemes can be used by criminals, fraudsters and money launderers to perform their illegal activities.  Criticism  University of Hamburg researcher Sebastian Deterding has characterized the initial popular strategies for gamification as not being fun and creating an artificial sense of achievement. He also says that gamification can encourage unintended behaviours. In a review of 132 of the top health and fitness apps in the Apple app store, in 2014, using gamification as a method to modify behavior, the authors concluded that \\"Despite the inclusion of at least some components of gamification, the mean scores of integration of gamification components were still below 50 percent. This was also true for the inclusion of game elements and the use of health behavior theory constructs, thus showing a lack of following any clear industry standard of effective gaming, gamification, or behavioral theory in health and fitness apps.\\" Concern was also expressed in a 2016 study analyzing outcome data from 1298 users who competed in gamified and incentivized exercise challenges while wearing wearable devices. In that study the authors conjectured that data may be highly skewed by cohorts of already healthy users, rather than the intended audiences of participants requiring behavioral intervention. Game designers like Jon Radoff and Margaret Robertson have also criticized gamification as excluding elements like storytelling and experiences and using simple reward systems in place of true game mechanics. Gamification practitioners have pointed out that while the initial popular designs were in fact mostly relying on simplistic reward approach, even those led to significant improvements in short-term engagement. This was supported by the first comprehensive study in 2014, which concluded that an increase in gamification elements correlated with an increase in motivation score, but not with capacity or opportunity/trigger scores. The same study called for standardization across the app industry on gamification principles to improve the effectiveness of health apps on the health outcomes of users. MIT Professor Kevin Slavin has described business research into gamification as flawed and misleading for those unfamiliar with gaming. Heather Chaplin, writing in Slate, describes gamification as \\"an allegedly populist idea that actually benefits corporate interests over those of ordinary people\\". Jane McGonigal has distanced her work from the label \\"gamification\\", listing rewards outside of gameplay as the central idea of gamification and distinguishing game applications where the gameplay itself is the reward under the term \\"gameful design\\". \\"Gamification\\" as a term has also been criticized. Ian Bogost has referred to the term as a marketing fad and suggested \\"exploitation-ware\\" as a more suitable name for the games used in marketing. Other opinions on the terminology criticism have made the case why the term gamification makes sense.

He was signed by the Arizona Rattlers as a street free agent in 2010. He attended Indian River State College, a school that did not have a football team, so he joined semi-pro football. He has also been a member of the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League, the Sacramento Mountain Lions in the UFL and the Philadelphia Soul, Iowa Barnstormers and Jacksonville Sharks of the AFL. Early years Scaccia was a dual sport letterman in football and soccer for four years (2000-2003) at St. Lucie West Centennial High School in Port St. Lucie, Florida. In football, he earned first-team all-state honors which included playing in the state's Outback Bowl as a senior, where he kicked a 51-yard field goal that broke the school's distance record (previously held by his older brother Massimo), and set another record with 35 of 38 kickoffs recorded as touchbacks. In soccer, he was named first-team All-American. After graduating high school, Scaccia received a football scholarship offer from the University of South Carolina, but turned it down after his mother was in a serious car accident and required his care. Amateur career=Fort Pierce Fire From 2005 to 2007, Scaccia played with the Fort Pierce Fire in the South States Football League (SSFL) as their starting placekicker and punter.

On March 29, 2009, Scaccia kicked a 68-yard field goal, which tied him for the second-longest kick of all-time and the longest ever without the use of a kicking tee. He was National Minor League Player of the Year, an All-Star team selection for the FFA both seasons, and was elected to the Minor League Hall of Fame.

Its mission is to \\"celebrate Danish roots and American dreams.\\" History In 1979, two professors from Dana College proposed to the Dana College Board of Regents that a museum dedicated to the preservation of Danish immigrant heritage should be created. This proposal was met with approval, and a year later the Danish American Heritage Society (DAHS) was asked to form an exploratory committee. In 1983, the exploratory committee chose to locate the museum in the Danish Villages of Elk Horn and Kimballton, Iowa. The board was officially incorporated in May and in July the Elk Horn Lutheran Church donated 20 acres for the museum site. The museum began accepting donations to its collection and operated out of a building on Elk Horn's main street for several years. The groundbreaking ceremony for the museum's current building occurred in 1988, but the museum building did not open to the public until June 1994. The museum changed its name from the Danish Immigrant Museum to the Museum of Danish America at its annual meeting on October 11, 2013. Today, museum's permanent collection consists of over 35,000 artifacts. Expansion On 22 September 2010, the Danish Villages of Elk Horn and Kimballton, Iowa, were selected to join the Iowa Great Places Program. Included in the Elk Horn-Kimballton Great Places proposal was the development of the Jens Jensen Prairie Landscape Park on the museum's grounds. Wayne Alwill, a farmer in Manning, Iowa, left the museum $1.3 million when he died in 2008. The park emulates and celebrates \\"the philosophy and artistic vision\\" of Jens Jensen (landscape architect). The park is designed by Jens Jensen's great-great grandson, also named Jens Jensen, and Bill Tishler, a professor emeritus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Jensen scholar. The park incorporates native plants and includes two council rings, a trademark of Jensen landscapes. In 2013, a pergola exhibit with interpretive panels was installed near the entrance to the park. Later that year, nine pieces of Danish-designed outdoor fitness equipment was added along the recreational trail that winds through the park. A free mobile app is available through the manufacturer, Norwell USA, to help users find the park, demonstrate how to use the equipment, time and track activity, and share via Facebook.  Exhibits  The main museum building has three levels. Lower level The museum's permanent exhibition, Across Oceans, Across Time, begins on the museum's lower level. The exhibit explores the experience of Danish immigrants and their descendants from 1840 to 1940. The lower level also contains the museum's visual storage area, where many of the museum's artifacts are stored behind glass walls. Main level The museum's permanent exhibition Across Oceans, Across Time continues on the ground level and covers the years from 1940 to the present day. This level also contains the Danish-American Artist Series exhibit, which showcases a different Danish- American artist every six months. Some recent artists featured in this series include artist Paul Solevad and conceptual artist Anni Holm. In addition to exhibits, this level of the museum houses the museum's Wall of Honor, the first piano owned by Danish immigrant performer Victor Borge, the museum gift shop and a Lego play area. Mezzanine level The mezzanine level houses the museum's temporary exhibits. Some recent temporary exhibits include Rescue of the Danish Jews, Victor Borge: A Centennial Celebration, and Church Basements and Children's Homes: Danish-American Missions Here and Abroad.  Off-site properties =Genealogy Center In 1996, the museum's research library opened in-house and was initially staffed by volunteers. A librarian was hired in 2002. The following year, the Genealogy Center opened at its current location on Elk Horn's Main Street. In addition to its collection and resources, the Genealogy Center offers translation and research services, as well as genealogy workshops, for a fee. The library has summer and winter hours, which are listed on the museum's official website. Jens Dixen House Located just north of the museum building is an authentic North Dakota homesteader's cabin once occupied by Danish immigrant Jens Dixen. Jens Dixen settled near Kenmare, North Dakota circa 1901. A schoolteacher and preacher, Jens Dixen offered instruction to boys from the local area out of this house. During spells of bad winter weather, some of his students would sleep in the small space above the main floor room. The Jens Dixen House was moved to the museum property in 1999 and restored by the Cedar Valley Danes. The house is open to visitors during the museum's regular operating hours. Bedstemor's House Bedstemor's House is a historic house museum located at the intersection of Union and College Street in Elk Horn, Iowa. The two- story Victorian home was built in 1908 by a Danish immigrant named Jens Otto Christiansen. The home was intended to be an engagement gift, but Christiansen's marriage proposal was rejected, and the house was rented out to local families instead. Christiansen sold the house to the Salem Old People's Home in 1933 for one dollar. From 1946 to 1982, a woman of Danish descent named Meta Mortensen lived in the home. In 1982, Mortensen sold the home to the Elk Horn-Kimballton Arts and Recreational Council. The Council named the house Bedstemor's House, which means Grandmother's House in Danish, and operated it as a house museum for seven years. Bedstemor's House was deeded to The Danish Immigrant Museum in April 1990. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 16 January 1997. Today, the house museum is interpreted circa 1910. Bedstemor's House is open daily during the summer months and open by appointment throughout the rest of the year. A 3-part documentary video entitled \\"The Story of Bedstemor's House\\" is accessible through the museum's official website.

Lily of the Alley was filmed in 1922 and given trade showings in early 1923, but its general release to cinemas was delayed until February 1924 due to various problems within the British film industry at the time. Background Lily of the Alley was experimental in form, with Edwards attempting the innovation of producing a coherent screen narrative entirely without the use of intertitles. The film is regarded as significant in cinema history as the earliest documented feature-length dramatic silent film to be made consisting solely of visual sequences without any titling to explain the action to audiences, pre- dating the next-known example (a 1923 German film called Schatten) by several months. The film's release was greeted with great interest, but contemporary reviews seem to suggest the finished product to have been a praiseworthy attempt rather than an unqualified success, with the subject matter of the ups and downs of a husband/wife relationship lending itself less well to the absence of titles than a more visually driven action or comic storyline would have. The Bioscope felt that Edwards' self-imposed restriction \\"leads to some rather far-fetched ways of conveying simple ideas\\", although The Times considered that the film was still \\"an intrinsically absorbing drama, coherently presented\\". Plot Only sketchy details of the film's plot appear to survive. Bill (Edwards) and Lily (White) are newly married. Bert works as a tea salesman and is of a naturally cheery disposition. Over time however, worries about the security of his job and income prey on his mind and he frets over not being able to provide for Lily. With his worries heightened by the fear that he is about to go blind, he falls into a deep depression and becomes a shadow of the happy soul he used to be. Lily becomes desperately anxious about him, and one night has a terrible nightmare in which she dreams that he loses first his sight and then his life (either in a fire, or by being robbed and murdered, depending on the source). However things eventually take a turn for the better and the couple welcome their new baby to the family. Cast * Henry Edwards as Bill * Chrissie White as Lily * Frank Stanmore as Alf * Mary Brough as Widow * Campbell Gullan as Sharkey * Lionel d'Aragon as Dad Preservation As a product of Hepworth Picture Plays, it is thought most likely that prints of Lily of the Alley would have been seized, along with all other film material in the possession of Cecil Hepworth, by administrators called in to wind up the company's affairs when Hepworth was declared bankrupt later in 1924. The film stock was then melted down to release its marketable silver nitrate content and it is presumed that most of the Hepworth company's full-length features of the 1910s and early 1920s were irretrievably lost at this time. No print of Lily of the Alley is held in the British Film Institute's National Archive, although they do possess a number of screenshots from the film on file. A modicum of hope remains that the film may one day surface unexpectedly (as was the case with Hepworth's 1920 feature Helen of Four Gates, rediscovered in a Canadian archive in 2008 after an absence of almost 90 years) and the film's official status is \\"missing, believed lost\\".

Members of this family utilise flavin mononucleotide as a cofactor and are often found to be homodimers. Members of this family include oxygen-insensitive NAD(P)H nitroreductase (flavin mononucleotide- dependent nitroreductase) (6,7-dihydropteridine reductase) () and NADH dehydrogenase (). A number of these proteins are described as oxidoreductases. They are primarily found in bacterial lineages though a number of eukaryotic homologs have been identified: C. elegans , D. melanogaster , , mouse and human . This protein is not found in photosynthetic eukaryotes. The sequences containing this entry in photosynthetic organisms are possible false positives. The nitroreductase of Enterobacter cloacae was identified by Bryant and Deluca in a strain isolated from a munitions facility, on the basis of its ability to metabolize TNT (trinitrotoluene). Since then many homologues have been identified and the family is now known to include members in diverse organisms, that catalize diverse reactions. The iodotyrosine deiodenase of mammals is a dehalogenase, the BluB of Sinorhizobium meliloti cannibalizes the bound flavin mononucleotideto furnish a critical intermediate in vitamin B12 biosynthesis. Crystal structures of the E. cloacae and E. coli enzymes have been published with a variety of substrates and analogues bound. An example of a potential cold-active enzyme for prodrug therapy was described using a cold- active nitroreductase, Ssap-NtrB (√áelik and Yetis, 2012). Despite Ssap-NtrB derived from a mesophilic bacterium, it showed optimal activity at 20¬∞C against cancer prodrugs. Authors comment that the cold-activity of this novel enzyme will be useful for therapies in combination with crymotherapy, exposing the target tissue to low temperatures in order to trigger the enzyme activity to activate the drug only where is required.

There were reportedly over 1,400 minibuses in the Kopaja fleet in mid-2012, more than half of which were estimated to be over 20 years old.Andreas D. Ardtiya, ' New Kopaja buses to offer Internet, air conditioning', The Jakarta Post, 6 July 2012. Kopaja buses have a rated capacity of 20-30 seats like the similar MetroMini service. Kopaja buses are green and white. But despite the nominal capacity of 20-30 passengers, Kopaja buses are often heavily overloaded. Safety is often compromised by this practice of overloading. In addition, the drivers are often reckless and do not pay attention to traffic signs and other traffic. See also, 'Taming minibus drivers', The Jakarta Post, 20 October 2012. Further, Kopaja diesel vehicles are often badly maintained and contribute significant amounts of pollution in Jakarta.Anita Rachman, 'Buses, Angkots and Rustpots Driving Jakarta Residents Crazy' , The Jakarta Globe, 7 May 2012. In late 2012, in response to criticisms the chairman of the Kopaja organisation admitted that around 70% of the Kopaja buses were not road worthy but said that improvements would need support from the Jakarta government.Lenny Tristia Tambun and Ronna Nirmala, 'Plans to Eliminate Bus Rental Scheme' , The Jakarta Globe, 18 October 2012. Despite these problems the Kopaja bus service, like other low- cost bus transport options such as the small local Angkot vans,Daniel Alan Bey, 'In Defence of the Angkot', The Jakarta Globe, 16 July 2012. is a key part of the Jakarta transport network. There are numerous routes which crisscross the city and link into the Transjakarta Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system.Novia D. Rulistia, 'Kopaja, Metromini operators get ready to join BRT system', The Jakarta Post, 20 December 2012. Fares, at Rp 2,000 per ride (around US 20 cents) for most services, are cheap. Efforts to upgrade the service by introducing newer air-conditioned Kopaja buses in 2012 have so far attracted limited custom because passengers are reluctant to pay the higher Rp 5,000 (about US 50 cents) price for the higher-quality buses.Lenny Tristia Tambun, 'New High-Tech Minibuses Hit Jakarta Streets' , The Jakarta Globe, 5 July 2012. Other attempts are made from time to time by the Jakarta Government to improve services; in late 2015, for example, it was announced that the Government would provide new, larger buses on one of the Kopaja routes (route S66) and tighten up fare arrangements on the route.'Jakarta works to improve Kopaja services', The Jakarta Post, 25 September 2015. Busker on a Jakarta bus It is not uncommon for buskers, often children, to jump aboard the Kopaja minibuses. However apart from hoping for a small contribution they rarely cause any trouble at all to passengers.Edison Lestari, 'My Jakarta: Bagus, Child Busker' , The Jakarta Globa, 3 February 2012 Routes Kopaja buses are numbered and travel along designated routes. The numbers are sometimes a little hard to spot since they are posted in a somewhat random fashion on the buses, usually on the front and back windows and sometimes (or alternatively) on the side windows as well. There are also designated bus stops but the bus stops are rarely used. Rather, passengers just wave down the slowly travelling passing buses and later just indicate the spot where they wish to alight. Conductors hanging out of the front or rear doors of the Kopaja, who are often shouting the destination as the buses travel along (such as, \\"Senen, Senen, Senen\\" on route No P.20 listed below), facilitate these arrangements. The route that a Kopaja bus is following is usually listed on the front window of the bus (such as Tn. Abang - Ragunan for route No P.19 below). But somewhat confusingly, most buses have large garish names plastered across the front window as well such as Mawar (Rose), Bunga (Flower), Ikhlas (Sincere), Firdaus (Paradise) and even Sexy. These names, which often tend to obscure other details such as the route number and name, are merely decorations and do not provide information of any particular kind to commuters. List of routes The following is the set of routes currently in service. The bus numbers and routes sometime show prefix letters which indicate the following: * P = Central Jakarta (Jakarta Pusat) * B = West Jakarta (Jakarta Barat) * S = South Jakarta (Jakarta Selatan) * T = East Jakarta (Jakarta Timur) * U = North Jakarta (Jakarta Utara) The routes are the following: ; P.16 : Tanah Abang - Slipi Jaya - Kemanggisan - Kedoya - Ciledug ; P.19 : Tanah Abang - Landmark - Karet Pasar Baru - Blok M - Fatmawati - Kemang - Ampera - Ragunan Depan ; P.20 : Lebak Bulus - TB.

In 1917, the U.S. Navy chartered her for use as a patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned on 15 April 1917 as USS Politesse (SP-662).

If the market price is lower than the agreed price, the government would subsidize the difference. Despite the critics about being a populist, the program is mainly beneficial to the poor and does not interfere with the market price which lets the economy run by itself and does not destroy the market mechanism.

Its major competitors are KFC, McDonald's, A&W;, and Texas Chicken, and as of March 2019 it runs 269 locations across Indonesia. History A branch in Jakarta, 2004. Note that the old logo was used. A branch in Yogyakarta, 2011. The chain was established in 1983 in Jakarta as a franchise of the American-based Pioneer Take Out, Link via LexisNexis. has an American name and is now entirely Indonesian owned. The chain is supplied by the same group, the Sierad Group, which also supplies chicken to Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken. It is the main brand of PT Pioneerindo Gourmet International Tbk which was listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange in 1994. The firm also runs Sapo Oriental and Cal Donat outlets in Jakarta, and employs 1,400 people. Studies conducted by the Jakarta Post reveal that it is the fifth most popular fast food chain in Indonesia after Restoran Sederhana, KFC, McDonald's and Pizza Hut. As the westernization of Indonesia took off in the 1990s, California Fried Chicken took advantage of the growth of American-style malls in the country, reaching 90 by 1998. It is now common to see branches of the chain in malls or near supermarkets, often in direct competition with neighboring branches of the global brands of the above-mentioned and Dunkin' Donuts. According to an article in Adweek, California Fried Chicken was founded by three Indonesians who wanted to introduce the taste of Pioneer Chicken to their homeland that they had enjoyed during their stay in California while attending the University of Southern California. The Los Angeles Times mentioned that California Fried Chicken had stores in China during the 1990s. However, these stores do not appear to currently exist. In 2008, the firm opened new outlets in Salatiga and Central Java, marketed in a way which meets local demands by serving traditional Indonesian food staples of fried noodles and rice with chicken. Logo The logo and marketing of California Fried Chicken is very similar to that of a carriage. Like the KFC logo, CFC uses red and white with the letters CFC and features a cartoon old western white and blue wagon in a yellow circular background. Its advertising slogan is \\"Bukan Cuma Ayam\\" which is featured in the logo, meaning \\"Not Just Chicken\\". Reception Although the chain has become a major success, it has not been without its criticism as globalization of American culture takes full swing. It has been criticized for \\"being a KFC clone\\".

When he was asked by the people, he was already stuttering because of too many tears until he hiccups. He had always thought that if that time he used a horse; his father would be definitely alive by this second.

Gwichyaa Gwichin (alternate spelling: Gwich'yaa Gwichin or Kutchakutchin, translation: \\"those who dwell on the Flats\\") are a Gwich'in people who live in the Yukon Flats area of Alaska, USA. This includes the Fort Yukon (originally \\"Gwicyaa Zhee\\"; translation: \\"house on the Flats\\") area on both banks of the Yukon River from Birch Creek to Porcupine River;\\" the Senati area of the middle Yukon River, the namesake of Sahneuti, Gwich'in chief and fur trader; and Venetie. Etymology The Gwichyaa Gwichin have been known by many other names, including: Eert-kai-lee (1892), Fort Indians, Ik-kil-lin (1892), Itohali (11th Census, Alaska, 1893), It-kagh-lie, It-ka-lyariiin (1877), I't-ka-lyi, Itkpe'lit (1876), Itkpeleit, Itku'dlln, Koo-cha-koo-chin (1866), Kot-a-Kutchin (1874), Kotch-a-Kutchins (1869), Kouehca Kouttohin (1891), KutchaaKuttchin (1865), Kutcha-kutchl (1851), Kutch a Kutchin (1862), Kutchia-Kuttehin (1876), Kutsha-Kutahi (1854), Lowland people (1869), Na-Kotchpo-tsohig-Kouttchin (1891), O-til'-tin (1887), Toukon Louchioux Indians, Yukon Flats Kutchin (1936). History The Gwichyaa Gwichin are the easternmost of the Gwichin groups. In addition to the Kutchakutchin, there were four other main Kutchin groups in the upper Yukon- Porcupine regions: the Han (H√§n Hw√´ch'in) (erroneously as Hankutchin grouped as an Kutchin group, upper Yukon), the Natsikutchin (Chandalar River drainage), the Tranjikutchin (Black River), and the Ventakutchin (Crow River area). Two bands of the main tribe are extinct, the Tatsakutchin of Rampart, Alaska and Tennuthkutchin of Birch Creek. In 1827, Hudson's Bay Company Chief Factor, Peter Warren Dease gathered information from the Gwichyaa Gwichin. They told him that no other tribe but themselves frequent the Peel River and that they come upstream in barges every year as far as Arctic Red River for trade. In 1928, Mooney estimated the 1740 population to be 500. Culture Jones described the Kutchakutchin as being split into three clans: Tchitcheah (Chitsa), Tengeratsey (Tangesatsa), and Natsahi (Natesa). At one time, a man was required to marry outside his caste, but eventually the custom fell into disuse. Other former customs included polygamy, slavery, and burning their dead. Hodge described the Kutchakutchin as being partially nomadic. Their traditional livelihood was based on hunting and trapping. After the introduction of the trading post, the Gwichyaa became traders as well. Their standard of value was the Nakieik, a string of beads . A string's value was equivalent to one or more beaver skins. The dwellings were made of deerskins pieced together over curved poles in the shape of inverted teacups. Men cooked while women performed other tasks. Because they lacked pottery, the Gwichyaa's used other materials such as wood, matting, horns, or bark. Wooden troughs functioned as dishes while horns functioned as drinking pieces. Kettles were obtained from the Hankutchin. Present-day Gwichyaa Gwichin rely on hunting (bear, caribou, moose, waterfowl) and fishing (salmon, whitefish) for subsistence. They make an income from trapping and selling handicrafts. Recognition On 4 April 1975 Canada Post issued 'Dance of the Kutcha- Kutchin' in the Indians of Canada, Indians of the Subarctic series. The stamp was designed by Georges Beaupr√© based on a drawing by Alexander Hunter Murray (1851) in Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa, Ontario.

Taking the form of a conversation between the tester and test-taker, the test measures how well a person speaks a language by assessing their performance of a range of language tasks against specified criteria. In the United States, the criteria for each of ten proficiency levels are described in the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines, devised by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL). In an OPI, the test-taker is interviewed by a certified ACTFL tester, who guides the conversation to explore the abilities and limits of the individual‚Äôs oral target language abilities. During the course of the interview, the interviewee is guided to engage in a variety of tasks such as describing, narrating, and hypothesizing. The interview is recorded and scored by the interviewer as well as a second certified tester using the following scale: Superior, Advanced High, Advanced Mid, Advanced Low, Intermediate High, Intermediate Mid, Intermediate Low, Novice High, Novice Mid, Novice Low. The OPI test format consists of four stages. In the first stage, otherwise known as the \\"Warm-up\\" stage, the interviewee is put at ease and provides the interviewer with information they can use later in the interview. The interviewer may ask \\"What are some things that interest you?\\" This stage is also used to indicate the interviewee's skill level before moving further into the interview. The second stage, called \\"Level Checks,\\" helps identify what the interviewee can do and finds the highest level of sustained performance by the speaker (floor). Questions at the second stage might be,\\"Which cryptocurrency would you buy?\\" or \\"How is cryptocurrency changing the way we interact monetarily?\\" The third stage, known as \\"Probes\\" shows the interviewer what the interviewee cannot do, and finds the lowest level of performance which they are unable to sustain for prolonged periods of time (ceiling). Questions at the third stage might be, \\"Is Cryptocurrency a waste of money? Why or why not?\\" or \\"Explain to me why Cryptocurrency has more or less value.\\" An effective OPI will show an interviewee what they can and can't do with their speech in the target language. The fourth and final stage, known as the \\"Wind-down,\\" is designed to ease the interviewee and bring them to a comfortable level of speaking. The interviewer may end the interview by asking, \\"Do you have any plans for this weekend?\\" As the interviewer wraps up the interview, the interviewee will feel a sense of confidence as they exit the interview. https://www.languagetesting.com/oral-proficiency-interview-opi The levels of ACTFL‚Äôs scale can be conceived as an inverse triangle, with the ‚ÄúSuperior‚Äù rating at the top representing a wide range of skill in linguistic structures, vocabulary, and fluency. The Novice Low category forms the bottom point of the triangle, showing little functional knowledge of the language. Each progressive category represents broader skills and depth of knowledge. While one can progress relatively quickly through the Novice levels, progress is much slower through the upper ratings. OPI is generally used for native speakers of English, but it was adopted in South Korea after the computer version was developed by the Korean computer company Credu. In September 2009, 40,000 people applied to take the test in South Korea. Oral Proficiency Interview - computer Oral Proficiency Interview - computer (OPIc) is a computerized test of English-usage skills developed by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) and Language Testing International (LTI). It is a computer-based version of the OPI. OPIc is a kind of test business interview. The one-hour test is a series of recorded questions which are assessed by computer. The test scores have seven levels. The evaluations are done by ACTFL professionals in the United States.

The Sheriff is responsible for providing a variety of functions associated with the judicial process and enforcement of law. The head of the organization is Sheriff Eric Scheffler History The old Atlantic County Courthouse in Mays Landing in 2006 Atlantic County was formed out of parts of Gloucester County on February 7, 1837. The first Board of Chosen Freeholders was established that same year, and decided on Mays Landing as the location for the county seat. Governor Philemon Dickerson appointed Isaac Smith as the first Sheriff of Atlantic County. Sheriff Isaac Smith served as an appointed official until he was duly elected in the fall of 1837. At the time a sheriff's term in office was only one year. Sheriff Smith served three one-year terms. The sheriff's term in office was eventually changed to three years, but consecutive terms were not allowed until a constitutional change in 1947. This first county jail was located on River Road in Mays Landing on the property of Captain John Pennington. Until a permanent building was constructed, court was held at Pennington‚Äôs Inn. In 1838 the first courthouse was built on Main Street in Mays Landing where the building remains today; although, it now serves as office space for the County Clerk and County Surrogate. The original building was only 40‚Äô x 40‚Äô, and now consists of Courtroom #2. The permanent jail was constructed in 1840. The building was designed by well-known Philadelphia architect Thomas Ustick Walter. Throughout the years new jails were built to keep up with the growing inmate population. Larger facilities were built in 1932 and 1962. In 1985 the current Atlantic County Justice Facility was opened. A few years later, in 1987, the jail operations split from the sheriff‚Äôs office and the Department of Public Safety was created. In the early days of the sheriff‚Äôs office, at least three executions were conducted by the sheriff. These executions were conducted at the ‚Äúhanging tree‚Äù on Main Street in Mays Landing at the site of the old courthouse. The last was conducted September 20, 1907, when Joseph Labriola was hung for murder by Sheriff Smith E. Johnson. Sheriff Smith E. Johnson served as Sheriff until 1908, when he was succeeded by his undersheriff, and son, Enoch ‚ÄúNucky‚Äù Johnson. Sheriff Enoch Johnson served in the position until he was ousted by a court order in 1911. Nucky Johnson went on to become a well-known political boss and racketeer. Nucky has been fictionalized as the main character in the HBO television series Boardwalk Empire.

Early life Wilkinson was born in Hurricane, Utah and raised as a Mormon. He grew up playing basketball but his home also had a high jump pit, and consequently Wilkinson became an excellent high jumper (he got so good, in fact, that he placed fourth at the NCAA Division I track and field championships in 1945.) He attended East High School in Salt Lake City, and when Wilkinson was a sophomore he only stood . By the time he enrolled in college, however, he had grown to , which more suited his ability to play basketball at the next level. College=Utah (1943‚Äì1944) Wilkinson matriculated at the University of Utah in the fall of 1943. He had stopped growing at but still possessed the dribbling and shooting abilities he had honed as a smaller high school player. As a very tall guard for that era, he helped lead the Redskins (now known as the Utes) to the NCAA tournament. The Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team, who had originally qualified for the NCAA tournament, was victimized by an auto accident. Prior to the tournament, two of Arkansas' starters were injured when their station wagon broke down after returning from a scrimmage in Fort Smith, Arkansas. While attempting to fix a flat tire, Deno Nichols and Ben Jones were injured when another car rammed into the back of the station wagon. Both players were injured and the severity of the accident caused Arkansas to withdraw from the upcoming NCAA tournament. In need of a replacement, the NCAA committee turned to Utah, despite the fact that the Redskins had four losses and had just lost their first-round game in the NIT tournament. Utah had one player, Lyman Condie, a medical student, who quit the team to midway through the season to pursue medical school. Additionally, all of Utah's players were raised within 30 miles of the Utah campus. These players included Arnie Ferrin, Fred Sheffield, and Wat Misaka who was of Japanese descent. Utah defeated Missouri in the opening round, 45‚Äì35, and then defeated Iowa State, 40‚Äì31, in the Final Four (back then, only eight teams qualified for the tournament). In the NCAA Championship game, Utah and Dartmouth played one another evenly. The game went into overtime, and Utah prevailed 42‚Äì40 for the school's first (and still only) men's national basketball championship. Wilkinson scored seven points in the game, including the game's winning basket in the extra period with five seconds remaining. Standing at the top of the key, he received a pass from Bob Lewis and then shot. The ball bounced off the front of the rim and dropped into the net, securing Utah the national championship. Iowa (1944‚Äì1947) Herb Wilkinson transferred to the University of Iowa after one season at Utah. He wanted to be a dentist, but Utah did not have a dental school. Clay, his older brother, was discovered playing basketball at a Cedar Rapids YMCA by Iowa coach \\"Pops\\" Harrison and told Harrison that he would play for Iowa if he could bring his younger brother to play. The next day, Harrison saw Herb's picture on the front page of the newspaper with his teammates lifting him on their shoulders for having made the championship-winning shot. He called Clay and asked, \\"Is that your little brother?\\" When Clay said yes, Harrison responded, \\"Hell, bring him along.\\" The Wilkinson brothers' first season at Iowa was in 1944‚Äì45. They joined incoming freshman star Murray Wier and three solid sophomores‚ÄîDick Ives, Jack Spencer and Dave Danner‚Äîin what would be a Big Ten Conference-winning season. The Hawkeyes finished 17‚Äì1 overall (11‚Äì1 in conference play) and their only loss came to Illinois by one point. Herb averaged 9.6 points per game (ppg) while Clay, a junior, averaged 11.5 ppg as the team's starting center. Despite Clay's slightly better numbers, Herb was honored as a consensus Second Team All-American along with fellow sophomore teammate Ives. It was Herb's ball-handling, leadership, and ability to score long-range shots that would deflate opponents' morale that played a large part in his selection. That year's team was also the first in school history to win an outright Big Ten championship. Over the next two seasons, Wilkinson's junior and senior seasons, the Hawkeyes finished with 14‚Äì4 (8‚Äì4) and 12‚Äì7 (5‚Äì7) records, respectively. Herb said, \\"We were good enough to win the Big Ten title all three years. It's kind of sickening that we didn't. But Clay had to have an operation‚Äîhe'd fallen on his tailbone one year‚Äîand Danner had some back problems. Still, we were good enough to win the championship more than just that first year.\\" He averaged 8.3 ppg and 9.3 ppg those years, and although he was not a consensus selection, Wilkinson earned his second and third consecutive Helms Foundation All-American honors. When Herb Wilkinson's college basketball career ended after the 1946‚Äì47 season, he had become Iowa's only three-time First Team All-Big Ten and three-time All-American honoree in addition to having won a national championship as a freshman while at Utah. He finished his Iowa career with 489 points in 53 games. He scored a career-high 22 points against Indiana on February 22, 1947. Wilkinson would later be named to the University of Iowa All-Century Team. Later life For the first year after graduation, Wilkinson was studying in an anesthesiology program, deciding to forgo a professional basketball career. Then, the Minneapolis Lakers of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) made him such a good offer that he decided to give it a shot. Being a very religious and devout Mormon, he agreed to play on the condition that he had Sundays off. Wilkinson said: \\"One Sunday I wasn't there and the owner asked where I was. The coach said he doesn't play on Sundays, and the owner sent me a note saying I had to play on Sundays or he would release me. I'm not sure he was serious, but I quit basketball and went off on a mission for two years.\\" After his mission, Wilkinson finished his schooling and became a dentist instead. Wilkinson chalked up his personal success in life to his national championship season with Utah as a freshman. \\"Anything like that gives you more confidence to do other things in life,\\" he says. \\"You think, Gee, if we won the NCAAs and weren't expected to, we could probably do a lot of other things we didn't think we could do.\\" References Category:1923 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American dentists Category:American Latter Day Saints Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players at the 1944 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from Utah Category:College men's track and field athletes in the United States Category:Guards (basketball) Category:Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Salt Lake City Category:St. Louis Bombers (NBA) draft picks Category:Utah Utes men's basketball players Category:People from Hurricane, Utah ","title":"Herb Wilkinson"},{"id":"29090844","text":"Es Teler 77 is a fast food chain established in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1982.

Watson was born in Australia on 8 October 1877 to a farming family who lived near Yambuk, Victoria. On 23 March 1898 he married his neighbor and childhood sweetheart, Elizabeth Mary Shanks. In 1900 his family was introduced to Seventh-day Adventist doctrines. Charles resisted accepting these doctrines until 1902, when he found no biblical support for Sunday observance and was baptized by W. A. Hennig. Watson had been a successful wool buyer, but quit the business in 1907 to attend Australasian Missionary College in order to study for the ministry. He graduated from this school in 1909 and was ordained into Seventh-day Adventist ministry on 14 September 1912. Watson was appointed president of the Queensland Conference. He was succeeded in this position in 1914 by Edwin Butz. His business sense and aptitude for remembering names and faces had gained him a reputation for administrative skill, and in 1915 he was elected president of the Australasian Union Conference. During this time he preached in Australia, Fiji, Tahiti, and the United States of America. From 1922 until 1926 he served as vice-president and associate treasurer of the General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists.

The band recorded the album in conjunction with many guest musicians, notably members of Holland's Instant Composers Pool (ICP) for whom the album is partially named, the other part being that the Dutch term for \\"free improvisation\\" literally translates to \\"instant composition.\\" Background The Ex had long collaborated with ICP members and featured those recordings on the double album Joggers and Smoggers and on the box set 6. Instant marked the band's first album of entirely instrumental and improvised music. Instant's 32 tracks feature shifting duos and trios of musicians performing on a wide array of conventional (electric guitars, reeds, brass, etc.) and non-conventional (e.g., toffee-tin bass) instruments. Though the entire album could have fit onto one 70-minute CD, the band formatted it for a briefer listening experience with each of Instant's 35-minute discs containing 16 short tracks. Reception Dean McFarlane's review for Allmusic is quite positive (in contrast to the middling score), calling it a culmination of the \\"stridently avant-garde direction\\" the band had taken \\"beginning with the Joggers and Smoggers album and explored extensively with cellist Tom Cora -- from the punchy chaotic punk rock of the band's '80s releases to total free improvisation.\\" He writes that the \\"collection covers a lot of ground, from noisy vignettes in the vein of Fred Frith and Chris Cutler's workouts to subdued passages that recall even atonal avant-garde classical works; AMM and Derek Bailey also spring to mind. Instant is not all free-form, however -- in fact, the forms are held together by vague folk themes and the band's classic angular Captain Beefheart-like arrangements.\\" He concludes by writing that the \\"two-CD set is certainly substantial in covering the band's multifaceted work, and with a group this unique and with so many compelling approaches that mix folk, punk, free jazz, and ethnic forms in such a singular fashion, there are few other recordings of this nature around.\\" Trouser Press was similarly positive, calling it \\"[n]icely annotated, bravely executed and totally cool.\\" Track listing Disc 1 # \\"If the Hat Fits the Suit\\" # \\"Duo Rumpus\\" # \\"Kloptimog Twist\\" # \\"Baars vs. Karekiet\\" # \\"Keng Lil Surf\\" # \\"Duo Triptych Too\\" # \\"Lip Up, Stump\\" # \\"So Low, Solex?\\" # \\"Skoplje Bop\\" # \\"Buildance\\" # \\"Bratunac\\" # \\"Horsemeal\\" # \\"Expoobident\\" # \\"Slow Sleeper # \\"Duo Loom\\" # \\"Te- Au-O-Tonga\\" Disc 2 # \\"Travel On, Poor Bob\\" # \\"What Inflexibility?\\" # \\"Bon-Go Tell You Git-La La\\" # \\"Duo Variola\\" # \\"Meanwhile Back in Ozone Street\\" # \\"Smuiger\\" # \\"Rusticles\\" # \\"Atoll\\" # \\"Exile O'phonics\\" # \\"Danse Maudit\\" # \\"Knit Knack + Zoom\\" # \\"Oh Muted Foghorn\\" # \\"Duo Tonebone + Hitgit\\" # \\"The Turtle the Hare\\" # \\"Karremans' Last Measure\\" # \\"ThereWereSonicBangsInTheSongsISang,ThereWasNothingTicklingNoOne\\" Personnel=The Ex *Terrie (guitar) *Luc (bass *Andy (guitar, viola) *Katrin (drums) *Han Buhrs (harmonica, guitar, toffee-tin bass) *G.W.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and now functions as a community meeting space. Description and history The Cornish Odd Fellows Hall is set on the south side of High Road, opposite a small park at the triangular junction of High Street, Main Street, and McCubrey Way in the town center. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, roughly rectangular, with a steeply-pitched hip roof and clapboard siding. Facing roughly northwest, its northern corner has a four-story tower with a clock at the third level and Gothic lancet-arched windows at the fourth level, with a pyramidal roof. A three-story gabled pavilion projects at the center of the main facade, with a double-door entrance on the first floor and Colonial Revival Palladian windows on the second and third floors. The interior of the building has tongue-and-groove wainscoting, molded architrave trim, and a painted pressed-metal ceiling. Built in 1902 by local craftsmen, the building is unusual in the state as a rural example of large-scale distinctive vernacular architecture.

The family name is sometimes given as \\"von Engelhardt\\". History The legendary founder of the Engelhardt dynasty, Carl Bernhard von Engelhardt (1159‚Äì1230), served as a knight in the Third Crusade, which was launched to liberate the Holy Sepulchre. During that campaign, he is said to have received the surname Engelhardt ('angelic strength') for saving the life of the French king Philip II Augustus in the Siege of Acre. The documented origins of the family lie in Switzerland, where Heinrich von Engelhardt is mentioned in the years 1383‚Äì1390 as a citizen and councillor in Zurich. In the early fifteenth century, Georg von Engelhardt lived in Livonia. From him descend all the nobles and barons of the Engelhardt family in the Russian Empire. The first Engelhardt to become a Russian subject was Werner von Engelhardt, who had previously served in the army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He converted to the Russian State religion, accepting Orthodoxy and taking the baptismal name, Yeremey Kasparovich Engelgardt. He died before 1672. His son Sigismund (Stepan, upon Orthodox baptism) was a Muscovite noble and stolnik (personal attendant upon the Tsar) and a lieutenant in the Smolensk gentry. Other sons of Werner (Yeremey) were Georg (Yuri) and Johann (Ivan), who also served as stolniks. The noble family of Engelhardt is recorded in Book VI of the genealogy of the province of Smolensk, and its coat of arms is included in Part VI of the General Armorial. The baronial line of Engelhardt is recorded in Part V of the genealogy books of the provinces of Yaroslava, Ekaterinoslavskaya, and Kursk. While most of the Baltic branches of the family remained predominantly Lutheran and Germanised, the other branches that lived in Russia became highly Russified and many family members had since converted to Orthodoxy. Accomplishments The house of Engelhardt has produced many distinguished and well known charitable works ‚Äî the building of churches and hospitals, large donations to universities, public libraries and observatories (including the donation of ancient manuscripts), free land for the construction of railways and other public purposes, and the liberation of serfs. The Engelhardt name has been attached to a scientific institute in Moscow, the observatory of Kazan University, the gold medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the main railway station in Smolensk, a crater on the moon, an asteroid, and a star in the constellation Cygnus. The Potemkin nieces Elena Aleksandrovna, the sister of Grigory Potemkin, was married to Vasily Andreyevich Engelhardt. Their six daughters, being nieces of Potemkin, were imperial favorites and featured prominently in the court of Catherine II and the subsequent reign. Potemkin doted on his nieces (and, it is generally assumed in the case of Barbara, Alexandra, and Catherine, had sexual relations) and bequeathed to them some of his great wealth. The six Potemkin nieces were: *Barbara Engelhardt (1752‚Äì1815), who married Prince Sergey Feodorovich Golitsyn (1749‚Äì1810). *Alexandra Engelhardt (1754‚Äì1838), who married Count Franciszek Ksawery Branicki (1730‚Äì1819). *Anna Sofia Engelhardt (175?‚Äì1820), who married Mikhail Mikhailovich Zhukov (1728‚Äì1803), Governor of Astrakhan. *Nadejda Engelhardt (1759‚Äì1823), whose first marriage in 1775 was to Colonel Pavel Alekseevich Izmailov (d. 1781) and second to Peter Shepelev (1737‚Äì1828). *Catherine Engelhardt (1761‚Äì1829), whose first marriage was to Count Paul Martynovich Skavronsky and second to Count Giulio Litta. *Tatiana Engelhardt (1769‚Äì1841), whose first marriage was to Count Mikhail Sergeevich Potemkin (1744‚Äì1791), her mother's and her uncle's cousin, and second in 1793 to Prince Nikolai Borisovich Yusupov (1750‚Äì1831).

Built in 1905‚Äì1906 for the New Zealand Express Company, it was at the time the tallest commercial building in Christchurch. A Category I heritage building, it suffered serious structural damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and was condemned to be demolished. Demolition began on 19 October, and was completed in February 2011. History Manchester Courts under construction in 1906 Manchester Courts was commissioned by the New Zealand Express Company, which had its headquarters in Dunedin with offices throughout the country. They worked in freight forwarding, customs, shipping and express forwarding agents. At the beginning of the 20th century, they were a major employer in New Zealand. The company engaged architects Sidney and Alfred Luttrell with the design of their Christchurch head offices. The architects had been in the country since 1902, and they are credited with introducing the Chicago skyscraper architectural style to New Zealand, and blending it with Edwardian architecture. The Luttrells' buildings also included the same commissioners' 1908 New Zealand Express House (now Consultancy House) in The Exchange, Dunedin ‚Äî the city's first skyscraper ‚Äî which shares many features with Manchester Courts.Knight, H. and Wales, N. (1988) Buildings of Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe. From 1991 it had a Category I classification with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. In 1986‚Äì1987, the building was refurbished, had its parapet removed and was reclad in steel. Structural design Manchester Courts is believed to have been the first steel reinforced commercial building in Christchurch. The foundations and the two lower stories were made from reinforced concrete. The upper five stories had external unreinforced brick columns that were load bearing, while the interior was made of steel framing. Demolition The north face showed large cracks and broken windows Manchester Courts suffered significant structural damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake (4 September). The masonry columns were left badly cracked on level three and four and showed shear failure. According to the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering, this was due to the load transfer from the reinforced concrete floor to the unreinforced brick columns, and was further caused by the two storey building adjoining on the south side stopping to provide lateral support at that height. Diagonal cracking on the top floor indicated damage from torsional forces. The building was deemed unsafe and was one of just two historic CBD buildings the City Council initially proposed for immediate demolition. That decision was reversed hours later when the building's owner proposed to dismantle the building over several weeks. A cordon was established around the building to guarantee public safety. Christchurch City Council voted 10 to 2 at their 6 October 2010 meeting that the building was a safety hazard and should thus be demolished. The council's CEO was given powers to issue a demolition warrant, which avoided the usual resource consent process that could take up to 18 months. The demolition warrant could be granted under section 129 of the Building Act 2004, where \\"immediate danger to the safety of people is likely\\". Consequently, resource consent was not required for the demolition. Detail showing damage to one masonry column Heritage enthusiasts and others protested against demolition, arguing that the masonry columns would have been reinforced with steel, and that the council should obtain its own engineering report, not rely on that commissioned by the building's owner. The owner presented evidence of further damage in aftershocks and pressed for urgent demolition, saying he had been advised that the building was showing signs of impending failure. The fate of Manchester Courts attracted significant media attention. TV One had the demolition decision as their anchor story for their 6 pm news. Demolition started on 19 October, and was nearing completion in January 2011. The building, significantly weakened by the removal of key structural supports by demolition engineers, withstood a number of large aftershocks without collapsing. During the demolition, an opponent of the demolition said he had photographs showing that the building did indeed contain substantial steel reinforcement. The building's owner said that less steel had been found than expected, and the mayor stood by the decision to demolish.

Ltd. (RML AgTech), formerly known as Reuters Market Light (founded & earlier led by Amit Mehra) is a business to provide Technology & Data Analytics Solutions to farmers and the agriculture value chain. The service is Decision Support Technology designed to provide farmers with personalised agricultural data analytics from pre-sowing to post-harvest stages through App earlier SMS on their mobile phones in their local language supported through call centres and on ground intervention. About 3.4 million Indian farmers from an estimated 60,000 villages have used this service across 18 states. Through sharing among farmers, it is estimated to have reached 15-20 million farmers. RML AgTech covers over 450 crop and crop varieties and more than 1300 markets. With this service, individual farmers gained up to INR 200,000 ($4000) of additional profits, and savings of nearly INR 400,000 ($8000), marking a significant return on their investment. History Thomson Reuters (then Reuters) began with a one-page idea of a Reuters employee to use mobile solutions to address the state of farmers around the developing world. Initial research suggested that farmers lacked relevant, reliable, timely and consistent information and commerce support to improve their productivity, reduce their crop losses and realize fair prices for their produce. One major insight was that this deficiency must be addressed at an individual farmer basis. Their type of crop, soil, location, irrigation type, language and even the stage of the crop cycle must all be taken into consideration. Thomson Reuters incubated RML as an internal start-up as part of its global innovation program. Following nearly 18 months of market research, user-led prototyping, and market trials, RML AgTech was officially launched on October 1, 2007, in Maharashtra by Sharad Pawar, the union minister of agriculture of India followed by launch in Punjab in 2008 by Mr. Prakash Badal, state's Chief Minister. After reaching a million users pan-India on its multi-lingual highly personalized mobile product, the business was spun-out to accelerate its commercial growth with equity funding by Thomson Reuters and IvyCap Ventures Advisors Private Limited (IvyCap), a venture capital fund management company. IvyCap, which is backed by the IIT Alumni Network, was the lead investor in RML AgTech with Thomson Reuters remaining as a shareholder and partner in the newly formed RML AgTech Pvt Ltd (formerly RML Information Services Private Limited). The company evolved from a phone-led product to an android app for the farmers in addition to launching data and commerce-support products for enterprises connected with agri value chain such as banks and agri-input and sourcing companies. RML also worked with state and central governments and partnered with other businesses in the telcom business such as Nokia, Idea, Airtel and Vodafone. The company was renamed FarmBee in 2018..

It was named after Cape Cod, the location of many of the radars. History The Cape Cod System was designed to demonstrate a computerized air defense system, covering southern New England. Signals from three long range (AN/FPS-3) radars, eleven gap-filler radars, and three height-finding radars were converted from analog to digital format and transmitted over telephone lines to the Whirlwind I computer in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The first tests of the Cape Cod System, beginning in September 1953, used only simulated data, but later tests used U.S. Air Force B-47 Stratojet bombers as stand-ins for Soviet bombers, and real interceptors scrambled from four Air Force bases. The Cape Cod System verified that the new core-based machine was fast enough for use in SAGE, and an industrial effort was started in order to mass-produce the AN/FSQ-7 computers for this role. RCA was a front-runner, but IBM was eventually selected instead. They started production in 1957, along with a massive construction project to erect the buildings, power and communications network needed to feed the SAGE systems with data.

Andres Soriano Colleges of Bislig (ASCB), or more popularly known by their old acronym ASC, is a private, non-sectarian and non-stock educational institution established in 1952 located in Andres Soriano Ave., Mangagoy, Bislig City, Surigao del Sur, Philippines. It offers elementary and secondary education (junior & senior high), as well as various college courses. The institution is named in memory of Andr√©s Soriano, Sr., a prominent Filipino businessman. History In 1952, Civic Spirited Citizens formed a nucleus to establish a school named ‚ÄúSouth East Pacific Institute‚Äù. This was changed to Andres Soriano Institute in 1954, Andres Soriano Junior College in 1967, and renamed Andres Soriano Colleges, Incorporated in 1971; and finally registered with the SEC on June 17, 1971. Classes formally started under the old wooden and nipa building of thirteen (13) classrooms, with one hundred thirty-nine (139) high school students. The school made its name with the advent of the elementary department in 1968. Due to the demands of the high school graduates within and outside of the community, collegiate courses like 2-year Secretarial Course, Bachelor of Arts (AB), Bachelor of Science in Commerce (BSC), Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BSEEd) and the College of Forestry were opened. As an offshoot of its growing population, a two-storey L-shaped building was constructed. The typing laboratory and the speech laboratory were improved. In 1982, the Graduate School was opened to address the demand for a formal course in higher studies among professionals in both private and public schools. A progressive type two-storey concrete building was built, housing the College Library, Audio-Visual Room, Air conditioned Computer Rooms/Laboratories were stationed. Eventually, the College of Computer Science and Bachelor in Accountancy added attraction to the school. To date, there are thirty-six computer units for students taking Associate and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS). Just like any other organization/institution, Andres Soriano College has its own crisis and problems. However, due to the concerted effort, dedication and commitment of faithful leaders, members, teachers, parents and stakeholders, the school was able to hurdle these problems and challenges.

In an economic system with multiple equilibria, coordination failure occurs when a group of firms could achieve a more desirable equilibrium but fail to because they do not coordinate their decision making.Cooper and John, 4. Coordination failure can result in a self- fulfilling prophecy.Romer, 305. For example, if one firm decides a recession is imminent and fires its workers, other firms might lose demand from the lay- offs and respond by firing their own workers leading to a recession at a new equilibrium. Coordination failure can also be associated with sunspot equilibria (where equilibria are the result of variables that do not have any real impact on fundamentals) and animal spirits. Coordination failure can lead to an underemployment equilibrium. Coordination failure also implies that fiscal policy can mitigate the effects of recessions, or even avoid them entirely, by moving the economy to a higher-output equilibrium.Mankiw (2010) Example Example of a coordination failure Models of coordination failure can have multiple equilibria. In this example a representative firm ei makes its output decisions based on the average output of other firms (e*). When the representative firm produces as much as the average firm (ei=e*), the economy is at an equilibrium. The curve represents possible output decisions for the individual firm, and it intersects with the 45 degree line at three points, meaning there are three equilibria. If the firm and society are better off with more output, point B is most desirable. However, the firm's production is determined by what the other firms decide. Ideally, they could all coordinate to produce at the level corresponding with the equilibrium at point B, but, if they fail to coordinate, firms might produce at a less efficient equilibrium.Romer (1993), 15.Cooper and John (1988), 446.

Some scholars assume that in the Huarpe language, this word means \\"sandy ground,\\" but according to Arte y Vocabulario de la lengua general del Reino de Chile, written by Andr√©s Febr√©s in Lima in 1765, the word Cuyo comes from Araucanian cuyum puulli, meaning \\"sandy land\\" or \\"desert country\\".  History  Huarpe people settled in permanent villages beginning in the 5th century CE. About 50 to 100 people lived in a village, making them smaller than Diaguita settlements. They were agrarian people who grew corn (Zea mays), beans, squash, and quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa).Lewis 18 Towards the 15th century, Huarpe territory expanded into the current Argentinian provinces of San Luis, Mendoza and San Juan and even on the north of the Neuquen Province. They inhabited between the J√°chal River at north, to the Diamante River at south and between the Andes and Conlara Valley on San Luis. They were never fully part of the Incan Empire, but were influenced by Inca culture and adopted llama ranching and the Quechua language after 1480. Chilean encomenderos who had encomiendas in Cuyo introduced to Chile indigenous Huarpes, whom they hired to other Spaniards without encomiendas.

The most celebrated Sound steamer of her day, Commonwealth was especially noted for the elegance and comfort of her passenger accommodations, which included gas lighting, steam heating, and an \\"enchantingly beautiful\\" domed roof in her upper saloon. Her stability of motion led her captain to describe Commonwealth as the finest rough weather steamboat ever built in the United States. Commonwealth would spend her entire career on Long Island Sound routes, first from New York to Allyn's Point, Connecticut under the management of the Norwich and New London Steamboat Company, and later to Stonington and Groton with the New Jersey Steam Navigation and the Merchants' Steamship companies. During the American Civil War, she was part of the transport network that moved northern state Union regiments to the battlefront. Commonwealths end came prematurely when she was destroyed by a dockyard fire at Groton in December 1865. Construction and design Commonwealth was built by Lawrence & Foulks at Williamsburg, New York for the Norwich and New London Steamboat Company, which ran a steamboat line between New York City and Connecticut.Heyl, Vol. 3, pp. 97-98. About 18 months in construction, she was completed in March 1855.\\"New Steamer\\", The New York Times, 1855-03-21. Dimensions and hull design Commonwealth had an overall length of 330 feet (100 metres), with a length on deck of 316 feet and 300 feet along the load line, making her one of the largest steamboats on the sound. She had a beam of 42 feet--77 feet over the guards--a hold depth of 13 feet 6 inches and a gross register tonnage of 1,732 tons. For a vessel of her size and tonnage, she drew a surprisingly light draft of scarcely more than 8 feet in running trim.Frazer, p. 275. Commonwealths hull design was considered to be exceptional--\\"worthy of examination by all professional architects.\\"Monthly Nautical Magazine, p. 222. The hull was flat-bottomed with an external keel, and the bow sharply angled. The midship section was duplicated for 56 feet fore and aft--an original feature in steamboat design-- and the broad beam was considered an aid to stability. Like all large American wooden-hulled steamboats of the era, the hull was supported by heavy hog frames and iron tie-rods suspended from king posts to prevent excessive hogging,Baker and Tryckare, p. 48. but in Commonwealths case it was also strengthened with diagonal iron braces \\"after the manner of fastening the first-class sea-going steamships\\", and constructed throughout \\"with great reference to strength and safety.\\" Overall, the hull was deemed to provide \\"adequate stability, ease of motion, and every other good sea quality.\\" This assessment would be borne out in practice: Commonwealths longstanding captain, Jerome W. Williams, would later describe the vessel as \\"the finest boat for rough water ever built\\" in the United States.Johnson and Lightfoot, p. 23. Machinery Commonwealth was powered by a 1,200 horsepower, 19 rpm single cylinder vertical beam steam engine, with 76-inch bore, 12-foot stroke and Stevens cut-off set at 7 feet, built by the Morgan Iron Works of New York.Monthly Nautical Magazine, p. 224. The engine was fitted with a safety device, designed by Erastus W. Smith, which uncoupled the eccentric in the event of the piston moving further than its prescribed limit, to prevent further damage in the event of a component failure. Steam, at an average pressure of 30 psi (max. 40) was supplied by a pair of 38-foot by 13-foot-6-inch cylindrical iron return-flue boilers, placed on the guards forward of the paddlewheels. The boiler furnaces, six in total, were fitted with blower engines and used anthracite coal for fuel, about 30 tons of which could be stored in the ship's coal bunkers. The paddlewheels were 38 feet in diameter and each fitted with 28 10-foot 6-inch paddles, with a dip of 32 inches--40 inches when the vessel was fully loaded.Monthly Nautical Magazine, pp. 224-225. While Commonwealths speed is not recorded, it is said to have been unexceptional.Morrison, p. 330. Passenger accommodations Commonwealth was noted for the excellence of her passenger accommodations, designed by architect Alexander Hawkins. One feature in particular--the domed upper roof--drew praise, including that of a correspondent for The New York Times: Detail of Commonwealths upper saloon, showing the domed roof. This stereoscope, taken c. 1860 by George Stacy, is one of the earliest photos of the interior of an American steamboat. > One of the most noticeable and praiseworthy [features] ... is a semicircular > roof to the upper saloon, which gives an air of spaciousness, elegance and > comfort that is as novel as it is cheering. This arched roof extends nearly > the entire length of the boat, and the prospect through the long corridor is > enchantingly beautiful; the arched roof sits so gracefully on its supports, > and its ribs are so light, that it seems self-sustained, like the blue arch > above our heads. It is painted with exquisite taste a pure white, for any > attempt at ornamentation would mar its graceful and beautiful proportions; > and gilding and gingerbread work are used with a sparing and chastened hand > in all parts of this splendid vessel.\\"A Pleasure Trip to Boston: Trial Trip > of the New Steamer Commonwealth\\", The New York Times, 1855-04024. The saloon deck also featured an after cabin fitted with thirty large sofas, allowing passengers to \\"sit and enjoy the magnificent prospect of the evening passage on the Sound with comfort.\\"Monthly Nautical Magazine, p. 225. Below the saloon deck, in the upper hull, was the main passenger deck, with 120 staterooms, fitted with two beds each, and a number of bridal suites. The staterooms were large, well-ventilated, and designed with \\"Oriental elegance\\", incorporating materials such as satin damask, moquette, lace, velvet tapestry, and rosewood furniture.\\"The New Steamboat Commonwealth\\", The New York Times, 1855-04-20. Also on this deck, abaft of the engine room, was \\"a spacious and splendid ladies' cabin, unsurpassed in style and finish.\\" Below the main passenger deck was a third deck, containing more cabin space aft and a dining saloon forward. The three decks were linked by staircases forward and aft, with a main staircase amidships with double flights and double entrances which ran from the lower cabin to the upper saloon, described as a particularly fine piece of workmanship.Monthly Nautical Magazine, pp. 225-226. A number of firms were subcontracted for the specialty work: McGrath & Allendorph and M. H. C. Glensman for the cabinet work; Reed, Tice & Hamilton for the joinery; A. T. Stuart & Co. for the upholstery; Haughwout & Co. for the chandeliers; and Storrs Brothers for the plated ware. Furniture for the vessel, constructed of rosewood, was designed specifically for the ship. The tableware was of white China and heavy plated silverware. The servants designed their own livery: black pants, white vests and jackets, and blue velvet caps with silver trimming and the letters \\"C. W.\\" in beadwork at the front. Safety features and communications In addition to passenger comfort, the designers of Commonwealth also paid considerable attention to safety. Commonwealth was furnished with eight lifeboats, 600 life-preservers--enough for every passenger aboard--and 155 life-preserving seats. A large number of water pumps, operable either by machine or hand, were installed, each fitted with \\"a great length of hose\\" ready for use; also a number of \\"steam fire annihilators\\". Even the staterooms themselves were arranged in such a way as to permit rapid access to the main deck in case of emergency. To communicate with passengers and crew, a speaking trumpet was fitted to the rooms of the captain and pilot, just aft of the wheelhouse. The trumpet could also be utilized as a whistle to the forecastle. Additionally, the captain was able to communicate with crew members via a set of twelve bells located in different parts of the ship. Officers Having spent a considerable sum on the boat, the proprietors of Commonwealth were careful to ensure that their investment was placed in competent hands. Their choice of skipper for the vessel was Captain Jerome W. Williams, a seaman with almost 25 years of navigational experience on Long Island Sound, and known for his \\"cool, clear head and good judgement\\".Hunt, pp. 771-772. Williams would remain Commonwealths captain for the whole of her career, through all her changes of ownership, and is said to have developed a great fondness for the vessel. Commonwealths chief engineer was Samuel Carter, another man with at least 20 years' experience. Both officers were said to enjoy \\"the very highest reputation\\" in their respective fields.Monthly Nautical Magazine, p. 226. Service history=1855-1860 An 1859 advertisement for the Norwich & Worcester Railroad, showing Commonwealths route from New York to Allyn's Point, Connecticut Commonwealth embarked on her trial trip, testing her engine for the first time, on March 20, 1855. She was then placed by her proprietors, the Norwich & New London Steamboat Company, on the route from New York to Allyn's Point, Connecticut, the latter being the terminus of the Norwich & Worcester Railroad, which ran a connecting service to Boston via Norwich, Connecticut and Worcester, Massachusetts.Dayton, p. 163.Morrison, pp. 328-330.Parish, p. 839. For Commonwealths debut, the Railroad itself introduced a number of \\"splendid new sixteen wheel\\" railway carriages as a means of increasing the attraction of the service. The Railroad also assigned a train specifically to the steamer, ready to leave the moment Commonwealth arrived with her freight and passengers. Commonwealth made her maiden voyage to Allyn's Point on Thursday, April 5, 1855. She would thereafter maintain a regular scheduled service on this route, departing from the foot of Cortlandt Street, New York at 4pm every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, alternating with her stablemate Connecticut which departed at the same time on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This schedule, excepting accidents, maintenance and poor weather, appears to have persisted until the sale of Commonwealth in 1860.Jones, p. 282; Parish, p. 839; Nash & Parish, p. 256; Appletons, p. 246. On the night of September 3, 1855, Commonwealth broke her starboard crankshaft in stormy weather, and was taken in tow by the rival steamer Metropolis of the Fall River Line, the two vessels arriving in port about 8:00am, or about two hours behind schedule for Metropolis.\\"Steamboat Accident\\", Hartford Weekly Times, p. 3, 1855-09-08. A new crankshaft was manufactured and fitted to Commonwealth in the \\"remarkably short time\\" of ten days, and she resumed service on or about the 18th.\\"New York City\\", The New York Times, 1855-09-19. In October and November 1855, the essayist Henry David Thoreau made a couple of voyages aboard Commonwealth to New York City. Of the second, Thoreau remarked that while the weather was \\"so windy inland\\", the vessel had \\"a perfectly smooth passage\\" and himself \\"about as good a sleep as usually at home.\\"Sanborn, p. 335.Thoreau, Torrey and Allen, p. 133. In June 1857, a woman reportedly fell overboard from Commonwealth at the New London wharf, and could not be extricated from the water for half an hour, during which time the buoyancy of her hoop dress was said to have saved her from drowning.Emersons Magazine, p. 108. In August 1858, Commonwealth suffered a collision with the schooner Sea Lark, but only minor damage was done to either vessel.Starr, p. 199. In early 1859, the Norwich & New London Steamboat Company attempted to negotiate a larger share of the proceeds with their partner, the Norwich & Worcester Railroad. With the failure of these negotiations, the Steamboat Company announced its intention to replace Commonwealth with an inferior vessel on the expiration of their existing contract. Commonwealth consequently made her last run from Allyn's Point on Monday, January 2, 1860. A few days later, she was sold to the New Jersey Steamboat Company (Stonington Line), which placed the vessel on the New York to Stonington, Connecticut route.\\"City Intelligence\\", The New York Times, 1860-01005. Commonwealths most serious accident in terms of human cost occurred on the morning of December 19, 1860, about 5am. While waiting for daylight, to pass safely through Hell Gate, a defective plate in Commonwealths steam chimney burst, allowing steam into the starboard fireroom. When the firemen opened the door to make their escape, a gust of wind diverted the steam into a group of passengers on deck. A family of four from Dublin, the Blakes, were all scalded, the mother so badly she was not expected to recover. A young colored waiter who ran out on deck at the same moment was fatally scalded by inhalation. Two other passengers were also scalded. At an inquest held two days later, the cause of the explosion was determined to be corrosion of the steam chimney, and an accidental finding returned.\\"Accident on a Sound Steamer\\", The New York Times, 1860-12-20.\\"General City News\\", The New York Times, 1860-12-22. Civil war era, 1861-1865 With the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, the U.S. government requisitioned hundreds of steamboats and steamships to serve as transports, gunboats and blockade ships. Commonwealth would escape this fate, continuing through the war to operate on her usual Long Island Sound routes. In this role she would still however contribute to the war effort, as part of the transport network that brought newly recruited regiments and their supplies from the northeastern United States to the battlefront. in New York Harbor, 1860. Union troops aboard Commonwealth in late 1862 had excellent views of the mammoth steamship. As early as May 1861, Commonwealth was engaged in transporting troops from Connecticut to New Jersey, when elements of the 40th \\"Mozart\\" Regiment, New York Volunteers, embarked at Stonington on the 31st.Floyd, p. 22. Numerous full regiments followed, including the 1st Massachusetts Infantry (June 1861);Headley, p. 146. the 7th Massachusetts Infantry(July);Robbins, Jane and Fitzgibbons, pp. 17-18. the 16th Maine and 19th Maine Volunteers (August 1862);Small, p. 23. and the 27th Maine and 11th Rhode Island Volunteers.Pullen, pp. 38-39. Commonwealth was capable of accommodating an entire 1,000-man regiment plus additional passengers on a single voyage, but conditions in such circumstances were not always ideal--the 11th Rhode Island, for example, complained of a shortage of suitable sleeping arrangements.Rock, pp. 15-17. Regiments transported on Commonwealth in late 1862 were treated to \\"fine view[s]\\" of the mammoth British steamship , then laid up in New York Harbor for extended repairs. When transporting troops, Commonwealths usual route from Stonington to New York City was slightly altered, with the point of embarkation sometimes moved to Groton, Connecticut and the destination to Jersey City. After disembarking at Jersey, regiments then typically travelled on by train to Philadelphia. Here they were invariably given an enthusiastic reception by the local populace, which included a \\"splendid repast\\" at the Cooper Shop Refreshment Saloon, a venue maintained for the troops throughout the war by local volunteers. While the meal was greatly appreciated, some soldiers are said to have left the city with fonder memories still of the passionate embraces of the local females, who lined the streets to bid them farewell on their departure.Smith, pp. 6-7. After the war, some regiments would also return to their homes on Commonwealth.Annual Report of the Adjutant-General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, p. 544. In late 1863, Commonwealth suffered a series of collisions with other vessels, all of them relatively minor. On October 20, the British propeller Salidan, setting out for Jamaica, struck Commonwealth as the latter was exiting her Cortlandt Street berth. Commonwealths starboard paddle guard was torn off, and some damage done to the paddle frame--about $1,000 damage in all, which was expected to take four or five days to repair.\\"Collision on the North River\\", The New York Times, 1863-10-21. On November 28, in dense fog, Commonwealth collided with two Williamsburg ferries in succession--Warren and Nebraska. Again, the vessels involved appear to have escaped serious damage.\\"Marine Intelligence\\", The New York Times, 1863-11-29.\\"New York\\", The Press, 1863-11-30. In December 1863, Commonwealths proprietors, the Stonington Line, merged with the Neptune Line to form a new entity, the Merchants' Steamship Company. Commonwealth and the other Stonington Line boats were subsequently sold by private auction to the newly formed company. Since the Stonington Line's partner, the Boston and Providence Railroad, had by this time extended its service to Groton, Connecticut and built a large new terminus there, Commonwealths regular destination was around the same time relocated from Stonington to Groton. Loss Following her acquisition by the Merchants Steamship Company in December 1863, Commonwealth appears to have continued working the New York to Groton route almost without incident for the next two years, the one exception being another minor scrape with a New York ferry on November 22, 1864.\\"Williamsburgh\\", The New York Times, 1864-11-23. Stern view of Commonwealth; illustration by Stanton Commonwealth departed New York on her usual run on December 28, 1865. Shortly after arriving at Groton, at about 1:30am on the morning of the 29th, a fire broke out at the Groton depot which could not be contained. An attempt to tow Commonwealth to safety was made by a local ferry, but an unusually low tide, combined with the weight of Commonwealths freight which was still aboard, had grounded the vessel on a sandbar, and Commonwealth caught fire at the bows and was burned to the water's edge.\\"Great Fire at Groton\\", The New York Times, 1865-12-30.\\"Additional Facts About the Burning of the Steamer Commonwealth--A Life Lost\\", The New York Times, 1866-01-01.Morrison, p. 292. Fortunately, most of Commonwealths passengers had already disembarked and departed by train, but a young medical student named J. Dickson Ripley, a nephew of Connecticut Governor William A. Buckingham, could not be aroused despite repeated poundings on his cabin door and was presumed to have suffocated from smoke inhalation in his sleep.Caulkins, p. 638. In addition to the loss of Commonwealth, the entire depot at Groton was destroyed, so thoroughly that the Railroad was forced to move its terminus back to its former location of Stonington for a time. Total damage from the fire was estimated at $1,500,000. Because of Commonwealths well maintained firefighting facilities, her proprietors had only insured the vessel for $80,000, with replacement value estimated at $600,000. Salvage of Commonwealth continued well into 1866, with the steamer's safe, containing about $500 and \\"many valuable papers\\", recovered in July. According to Fred Dayton, author of the 1925 history Steamboat Days, Commonwealth was subsequently raised, \\"rebuilt from the burned wreck\\", and returned to service on her former route, before being \\"wrecked in a storm off Orient Point\\",Dayton, p. 198. but this account is uncorroborated. Models Model of the steamboat Commonwealth by John Dean Benton, ca 1864, The Mariners' Museum A number of notable models of Commonwealth were made in her time. William Foulks, partner in the shipbuilding firm that constructed Commonwealth, won the gold medal in the naval architecture division of the American Institute of New York's 27th Annual Fair in 1855 for a model of the vessel.Transactions of the American Institute, p. 178. The American jewelry firm Tiffany & Co. won the bronze medal for silverware at the Paris Exposition of 1867 for a display which included an \\"exquisite\\" silver model music box of Commonwealth.Morford, p. 233a.Every Saturday, p. 639. This model was made by John Dean Benton, a Tiffany silversmith, and it played ten airs of the day'Gold and Silver Steamboat Models With Musical Movements' in The Musical Box Society International Volume 32 (No.2), Autumn 1986, pp. 34-35 including ‚ÄòNellie Bligh‚Äô and ‚ÄòBy Banks and Braes of Bonnie Doon.‚Äô'The \\"Elegant\\" Steamboat Commonwealth' in American Neptune, Volume 8 (no. 3), July 1948, p. 253 An 1864 edition of Scientific American describes the model in detail: > In its construction seventy-three ounces of gold were used, and two hundred > and fifty-two ounces of silver, and skilled mechanics have been employed > upon the work for six months, at an aggregate cost of six thousand five > hundred dollars. The length of this model is thirty-one inches, and it is an > exact copy of the steamer Commonwealth, made by measurement upon a > diminished scale of three thirty-seconds of an inch to the foot.

This model was presented to the captain of Commonwealth, Jerome Wheeler Williams, by the Norwich and New London Steamboat Company for their appreciation of his service.The Mariners' Museum'Gold and Silversmith Steamboat Models With Musical Movements' The model is now in the collection at The Mariners‚Äô Museum where it is considered to be one of the gems of the collection.

Vibbard or just Vibbard, was a steamboat built in New York in 1864 for passenger service on the Hudson River. The first steamboat built specifically for what later became the Hudson River Day Line, Chauncey Vibbard quickly established herself as the fastest steamboat on the river, if not the world, with a record run from New York to Albany in 1864. Her popularity was such that after only two years of service she was lengthened to accommodate more passengers. Chauncey Vibbard was lengthened again in 1872, but in spite of these alterations, continued to set a variety of new speed records on the Hudson until at least 1876. In 1880, she was given another major rebuild. In 1890, after 26 years' service on the Hudson, Chauncey Vibbard was sold to the Lincoln Steamboat Company, which ran her as an excursion steamer between Philadelphia and Lincoln Park. Laid up in 1900, she was broken up in 1902, having accumulated some 36 years of service. Construction and design Chauncey Vibbard, namesake of the PS Chauncey Vibbard. After purchasing the steamboats Armenia and Daniel Drew in 1863 and running them on the Hudson for a number of months, Alfred Van Santvoord decided to build a new steamboat to operate in conjunction with Daniel Drew.\\"Formation of the Day Line - 1860s\\" , Hudson River Maritime Museum website.Morrison, pp. 130-132. Accordingly, a steamboat \\"with the same general arrangements and appearance\\" as Daniel Drew\\"Hudson River Day Line 1860 to 1880\\" , Hudson River Maritime Museum website. was ordered from the Williamsburg, New York shipyard of Lawrence & Foulks.Heyl, Vol. 3, pp. 65-67. Completed in early 1864, the new steamer was named Chauncey Vibbard after the prominent railroad executive, who at the time was one of Van Santvoord's partners. When completed, Chauncey Vibbard had a length of 265 feet, a beam of 35 feet, a hold depth of 9 feet 6 inches, and a tonnage of 794 tons. She was powered by a single cylinder vertical beam steam engine with 55-inch bore and 12-foot stroke. Steam was supplied at a relatively high pressure of about 55 psi by two boilers, one on each guard, just aft of the 30-foot diameter paddlewheels.Ryder, F. Van Loon: \\"Chauncey Vibbard: 1860-1900\\", Greene County News, 1965-02-11, as reproduced at www.rootsweb.ancestry.com. Both engine and boilers were supplied by Fletcher, Harrison & Co. of New Jersey.\\"A Model Steamboat\\", Scientific American, New Series, Vol. 11, Issue 22, p. 339, 1864-11-26. With concave lines forward and convex aft, and an unusually narrow beam for her length, Chauncey Vibbards hull was said \\"to cut the water as a knife blade, the water only breaking when it hit the paddles.\\" To enhance the smoothness of operation, hull and boilers were carefully balanced to eliminate vibration. With such fine \\"racer\\" lines and attention to detail, Chauncey Vibbard would prove capable of a cruising speed of 23 to 25 mph and a top speed of almost 30 mph--sufficient to challenge the fastest steamboats on the Hudson. According to some sources, Chauncey Vibbards hull was strengthened with high hog frames, typical hull strengthening components of their day. However, Stanton's illustration shows only king posts and iron tie-rods, suggesting that the hog frames were added at a later date, perhaps when the vessel was lengthened. In spite of her speed, Chauncey Vibbard is said to have been one of the most difficult boats to drive into a headwind. As a day boat, a substantial proportion of Chauncey Vibbards passengers were sightseers rather than travellers. To cater for this clientele, Chauncey Vibbards main saloon was located forward, offering the best possible views of the picturesque scenery of the Hudson. A promenade deck was also installed. Considered of no less importance, perhaps, was the boat's extensive larder-- from which it is said almost anything could be ordered. Chauncey Vibbards captain was Dave Hitchcock,Allison, p. 242. a partner of Van Santvoord. Hudson River service, 1864-90=Schedules 1864 advertisement for Chauncey Vibbard and Daniel Drew After completion, Chauncey Vibbard was placed on the New York to Albany route, working in tandem with the Daniel Drew, while Daniel Drews former partnering vessel, Armenia, was placed in reserve. Chauncey Vibbard was scheduled to leave New York for Albany on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, while her stablemate departed the same port on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The boats departed Debrosses Street, New York on their respective days at 7:00 am, touching at 30th Street, New York, then continuing on to West Point, Newburgh, Poughkeepsie, Rhinebeck, Catskill, Hudson and Albany. The return journey for each boat was made the following day, departing Hamilton Street, Albany at 9:00 am and arriving at New York about 6:00 pm.Disturnell, see advertisement p. 297. The schedule was arranged in such a way that when one boat was travelling downstream from Albany, the other was travelling upstream from New York. By this means, day travellers could alight at Poughkeepsie, the halfway point, and then return home the same day on the boat travelling in the opposite direction. This was known as the \\"nine-hour system\\" as each boat was scheduled to complete the trip between New York and Albany within nine hours. The service was only available from about May to October each year, with the boats being laid up for renovation during the winter months. Early service and new record, 1864-65 Chauncey Vibbard made her maiden voyage, from New York to Albany, on June 20, 1864. The same year, the vessel made the passage from New York to Albany in 6 hours 42 minutes,Dayton, p. 73. shaving eight minutes off the previous best time, set by her stablemate Daniel Drew in 1862.Buckman, pp. 65-66. With a top speed of almost 30 mph in favorable conditions, Chauncey Vibbard was soon being spoken of as not just the fastest steamer on the Hudson, but as probably the fastest in the world.Stone, p. 189. In September 1865, Chauncey Vibbard made headlines over an incident that occurred on a passage from Albany. Two Kentuckians, who had \\"not rid themselves of secessionist sentiment\\", offended other passengers by drunkenly avowing themselves rebels, singing Confederate songs and cheering for General Robert E. Lee. The incident culminated in one of the two stabbing the chief colored waiter in the chest with a sword cane. Both offenders were jailed for \\"drunkenness and disorderly conduct\\" over the incident, and one charged with assault.\\"Jefferson Market Before Justice Dodge\\", The New York Times, 1865-09-20. Reconstructions, 1865-66, 1871-72 During the winter of 1865-66, Chauncey Vibbard underwent a major rebuild. The hull was cut in half just aft of the paddlewheels in order to lengthen the vessel by 16 feet to 281 feet. A larger engine, a single-cylinder vertical beam with 62-inch bore and 12-foot stroke, designed to operate at a lower boiler pressure of 30 psi, was also installed. These changes, which increased the vessel's tonnage from 794 to 1,181 tons, were designed primarily to increase passenger capacity, but it was hoped that the new engine would allow Chauncey Vibbard to maintain if not improve her speed. Though some experts predicted that the rebuild would adversely affect her performance, Chauncey Vibbard quickly demonstrated otherwise when on June 4, 1866 she made a fast eight way-landing passage from New York to Albany of 7 hours 35 minutes. In the winter of 1871-72, Chauncey Vibbard was reconstructed a second time. The vessel was lengthened again, this time by about 20 feet, to 300 feet. New boilers, at a cost of $35,000, were also installed, and the interior, including the saloons, staterooms, dining room and ladies' boudoir were remodelled and fitted with new furniture. Total cost of the improvements was $75,000, lifting the vessel's total cost to $275,000. By this time, Vibbards New York departure point had moved to Vestry Street, the departure time being 8:30 am.\\"Trial Trip of the Chauncey Vibbard\\", The New York Times, 1872-05-28. Presidential trip and more records, 1870s President Ulysses S. Grant was a passenger aboard Chauncey Vibbard in July 1873 A highlight of Chauncey Vibbards career occurred in the 1873 season when President Ulysses S. Grant took passage on the vessel from New York to Rhinebeck. Apparently hoping to travel incognito, Grant boarded the steamer with only two companions, General Orville E. Babcock and an attach√© to General George H. Sharpe, to whose residence the three were travelling before setting out on a sightseeing visit to Overlook Mountain. News of Grant's presence on the steamer quickly spread, however, and Grant soon found himself the subject of \\"a somewhat inconvenient scrutiny\\". Arriving at Rhinebeck, a large crowd gathered as Grant waited for the ferry Sandy, pressing forward to shake his hand. The rest of the President's journey was accompanied by cheering crowds, gun salutes, a marching band, the unfurling of flags and banners, and showers of flowers strewn along the route.\\"The President at Kingston\\", The New York Times, 1873-07-30. In 1875, Chauncey Vibbard broke the nine-landing speed record between New York and Albany by ten minutes, a record set 40 years earlier by the steamer South America.\\"A Noted Boatbuilder Dead\\", The New York Times, 1887-09-06. Chauncey Vibbards captain, Dave Hitchcock, still hoped for an opportunity to establish a new outright record. It came in early 1876, when Chauncey Vibbard was scheduled to be sent to Albany for repainting prior to the opening of the regular season, allowing for a direct passage from New York uninterrupted by way-landings. Chauncey Vibbard accordingly departed New York at 5:20 am on April 18, bearing a party of excursionists who had been promised the fastest steamboat ride they had ever experienced. They were not to be disappointed; in spite of less than ideal conditions, Chauncey Vibbard arrived at her Albany pier at 11:40 am, setting a new record time of 6 hours 20 minutes, eclipsing her own previous record of 6 hours 42 minutes, set a dozen years earlier, by no less than 22 minutes. Accidents Chauncey Vibbards 26-year career on the Hudson was to remain remarkably free of accidents. The steamer was involved in a tragedy in 1876 however, when on August 30, while entering the slip at the foot of 24th Street, North River, about 6 pm, she collided with a small boat which crossed her bows. The two young men in the boat were thrown into the water, and one of them, an 18-year-old named William Koster, went missing and was presumed drowned.\\"City and Suburban News\\", The New York Times, 1876-08-31. Chauncey Vibbard suffered a rare mechanical breakdown on Monday, August 5, 1878, on a trip from Albany. Approaching the Poughkeepsie landing, her starboard paddleshaft broke. Her 400 passengers and their baggage were disembarked at Poughkeepsie, and a special train commissioned to enable them to complete their journey. Temporary repairs were meanwhile made to Chauncey Vibbard, allowing her to complete the passage to New York at a slow speed, where she arrived about 10 pm. Damage was estimated at between $2,000 and $2,500, and Chauncey Vibbard was laid up at the foot of 22nd Street New York for the installation of a new shaft, which was expected to take no more than a few days. To replace her during the repairs, the reserve steamer Armenia was quickly readied for service, a task which included the transfer of Chauncey Vibbards bar fixtures and furniture. This breakdown was the first time in 13 years of service that Chauncey Vibbard had missed a scheduled trip.\\"Accident to an Albany Steam-Boat\\", The New York Times, 1878-08-06. Rebuild, reserve status and sale, 1880-1890 Chauncey Vibbard after her 1880 reconstruction. Erik Heyl drawing based on a painting by James Bard. In the late 1870s, the Hudson River Day Line decided to replace the ageing Daniel Drew with a new steamboat. The new vessel, named Albany, debuted in 1880. Prior to the opening of the 1880 season, the company also decided to give Chauncey Vibbard another rebuild. The steamer's hog frames were removed, along with the boilers on the guards, which were replaced with three boilers in the hull, their three smokestacks running in a line athwartships in the same configuration as that of Albany. These changes not only radically altered Chauncey Vibbards appearance, they also lost the fine balance between hull and boilers achieved by the original designers. However, they had the advantage of allowing the builders to \\"almost double\\" her passenger accommodations.\\"Briskness in Boat- Building\\", The New York Times, 1880-02-07. As late as 1881, Chauncey Vibbard was still being touted by the U.S. press as one of the three fastest boats on the Hudson,\\"General Telegraph News\\", The New York Times, 1881-03-18. and as one of the four fastest in the world (the others named as the Hudson River steamers Albany, Mary Powell and Daniel Drew).\\"A Fast Boat\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, 1881-12-25. In late 1886, the Day Line's spare boat, Daniel Drew, was destroyed in a dockyard fire, prompting the company to order a new steamer.\\"The New Steamboats New York and Albany - 1880s\\" , Hudson River Maritime Museum website. The new vessel, named New York, entered service in 1887, at which time Chauncey Vibbard became the Line's reserve boat. On July 30, 1890, after 26 years on the Hudson, Chauncey Vibbard was sold to Alfred B. Stoney of Keyport, New Jersey, for operation on the Delaware River. Later career, 1890‚Äì1902 On August 5, 1890, Chauncey Vibbards new owner, Alfred B. Stoney, transferred ownership of the vessel to his Lincoln Steamboat Company. For the next ten years, the vessel operated as an excursion steamer, running from Philadelphia to Lincoln Park, an amusement resort on the Delaware located between Philadelphia and Chester. Toward the end of this period, in the service of the Everard Steamboat Company, apparently a reorganization of the previous company, she was also used for frequent excursions to Cape May, and occasionally to the fishing grounds outside the Capes. In 1899, a \\"Peace Jubilee\\" celebrating the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War took place, which included a naval parade on the Hudson, with Chauncey Vibbard as one of the participants. On the day of the parade, crowded with celebrity passengers, Chauncey Vibbard began leaking badly and was hastily beached on a sandbar. Not long thereafter, in 1900, Chauncey Vibbard was laid up by her proprietors. She was broken up at Cramer's Hill in 1902. ReferencesBibliography ;Books * Allison, Wm. L.

Distribution and discovery Branchinecta brushi lives near the summit of the stratovolcano Cerro Paniri. The type specimens of B. brushi were collected on December 13, 1988 by Charles F. Brush during an attempt to break the world record for the world's highest SCUBA dive. This attempt took place in a small pool, across, at an altitude of near the summit of the stratovolcano Cerro Paniri () in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. B. brushi was collected, along with some other species, from below of ice. The specimens were stored in 70% ethanol at the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the United States National Museum for nearly 20 years before being re- examined; the species was eventually described in 2010, and given the specific epithet brushi to commemorate Brush. Description Males are long, while females are only . In common with other fairy shrimp, the males bear complex structures on their second antennae, which are used in mating. B. brushi closely resembles Branchinecta valchetana, from which it differs in the form of the antennae and the gonopods. Ecology Branchinecta brushi shares the record for the crustacean living at the highest altitude with the copepod Boeckella palustris, also found in the same pool. The only higher record, which claimed that Branchinecta paludosa occurred at is \\"almost certainly a typographical error\\". Crustaceans are rarely associated with life at high altitudes, but fairy shrimp such as B. brushi produce dormant cysts which are capable of surviving prolonged desiccation, and aid in dispersal. The closed nature of the water body probably reduces the risk of predation, allowing B. brushi to complete its life cycle.

It courses through Dotta Canyon and Red Clover Valley to its confluence with Last Chance Creek in Genesee Valley, just above its confluence with Indian Creek , which flows into the East Branch North Fork Feather River. The Red Clover Valley sits at an elevation of about and is located on the east side of the Sierra Nevada crest, approximately north of Truckee and east of Quincy. Development and recreation Most of the Red Clover Creek Basin is uninhabited, although a few residences and vacation homes exist near the mouth in Genesee Valley. Most of the mountain and foothill lands are part of the Plumas National Forest and are managed by the U. S. Forest Service for timber production, wildlife management, grazing, recreation, and watershed management. There are no developed campgrounds along Red Clover Creek, however, there are several areas that offer suitable camping, and are frequented by campers, hunters, and fishermen. County Route 111, a dirt and gravel road, follows the creek from Red Clover Valley to Genesee Valley, and is referred to as the Genesee-Beckworth road. Historically railroad tracks ran through the valley, providing transportation for logging, mining, and dairy. Watershed The largest tributary watersheds are those of Crocker and Dixie Creeks. The upper and middle reaches are low gradient, alluvial valleys while the lower reach runs through a bouldered canyon. Prior to 1880, the upper portion of Red Clover Creek, was as a low gradient, narrow channel with a well-developed riparian zone comprising hardwoods, sedges, and willows that protected the streambanks. It had a reputation as a good trout fishery. Heavy logging in the watershed, extirpation of beaver, as well as heavy sheep and cattle grazing which eliminate riparian vegetation, led to severe erosion in the creek. By 1985, the actively eroding channel was 50 to 60 feet wide and had vertically incised to a depth of ten feet. The erosion contributed large amounts of sediment to the North Fork Feather River system via Indian Creek. Ecology After grazing removed riparian vegetation and extirpation of California Golden beaver (Castor canadensis subauratus) allowed erosion to incise the creek channel and lower the water table, the once-productive wet meadows converted to a dry sagebrush-dominated basin with minimal vegetation and little cover for fish. This area has been subject to multiple stream restoration efforts by the Plumas Corporation. Recently novel physical evidence has demonstrated that beaver were native to the Sierra until at least the mid-nineteenth century, via radiocarbon dating of buried beaver dam wood uncovered by deep channel incision in two locations in the Red Clover Creek watershed. Four species of fish are known to occur in Red Clover Creek, including Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Brown trout (Salmo trutta), Mountain sucker (Catostomus platyrhynchus) and Speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus).

A widely distributed species, it is found in north Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. The fungus fruits on the ground singly or in clusters in conifer forest, usually in poor (low nutrient) or sandy soil. Fruit bodies are somewhat top-shaped, measuring in diameter. Their velvety surfaces, initially white to pink, sometimes exude drops of red liquid. The lower surface of the fruit body features white to reddish-brown spines up to 6 mm long. Mature fruit bodies become dark reddish brown in color, and are then difficult to distinguish from other similar Hydnellum species. H. ferrugineum forms a mat of mycelia in the humus and upper soil where it grows. The presence of the fungus changes the characteristics of the soil, making it more podzolized. Taxonomy The species was originally described scientifically by Elias Magnus Fries, who named it Hydnum ferrugineum in 1815. Its taxonomic history includes transfers to the genera Calodon by Petter Karsten in 1881, and Phaeodon by Joseph Schr√∂ter in 1888. It was assigned its current binomial name by Karsten when he transferred it to its current genus, Hydnellum, in 1879. In 1964, Canadian mycologist Kenneth A. Harrison described a hydnoid fungus found with Pinus resinosa in Michigan and Pinus banksiana in Nova Scotia. The fungus, which Harrison named Hydnellum pineticola, is considered to be synonymous with Hydnellum ferrugineum by the nomenclatural database Index Fungorum. Harrison noted \\"The attempts to recognize European species in North American collections has only increased the confusion in this country, and until someone has worked critically in the field on both continents, it is better to make a recognizable grouping of our own population as that to guess that they may be the same as those that grow in Europe.\\" Other taxa considered synonymous with H. ferrugineum are Pierre Bulliard's 1791 Hydnum hybridum (including later synonyms Calodon hybridus (Bull.) Lindau, and Hydnellum hybridum (Bull.) Banker); Louis Secretan's Hydnum carbunculus (1833); and Howard James Banker's 1906 Hydnellum sanguinarium. Banker explained the difficulty in identifying old Hydnellum specimens: \\"A considerable number of collections have had to be set aside, as in the dried state, with no notes on the fresh characters, it was impossible to decide with any degree of satisfaction whether the plants represented H. sanguinarium, H. concrescens, H. scrobiculatum, or some undescribed form.\\" Common names given to the species include the \\"reddish-brown corky spine fungus\\", and the British Mycological Society-sanctioned name \\"mealy fungus\\". The specific epithet ferrugineum is Latin for \\"rust-colored\\". Description Closeup of hymenium showing the spines The fruit bodies of Hydnellum ferrugineum are more or less top-shaped with caps that are in diameter. They are at first convex, then pulvinate (cushion-shaped), later flattening or becoming slightly depressed in the center. The cap surface of young fruit bodies is uneven, with a velvety to felted texture, and a whitish to pink color. It sometimes exudes blood-red drops of fluid in the depressions. The surface later becomes flesh-colored to dark reddish brown, but with wavy margin remaining whitish. The lower surface of the fruit body bears the hymenium, the fertile spore-bearing tissue. It comprises a dense arrangement of white to reddish brown spines up to 6 mm long, hanging vertically downwards. The stout stipe measures long by thick, and is the same color as the cap. Fruit bodies have a \\"distinctly mealy\\" odor (similar to the smell of freshly ground flour), but are inedible. Fruit bodies can envelop obstacles as they grow. The flesh is reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue is made of generative hyphae that do not expand. This slows the growth of the fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months.Pegler, Roberts, Spooner (1997), p. 3. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.Pegler, Roberts, Spooner (1997), p. 5. The broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical spores are 5.5‚Äì7.5 by 4.5‚Äì5.5 Œºm. Their surfaces are covered with small rounded bumps. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25‚Äì30 by 6‚Äì7.5 Œºm. The hyphae of the flesh are brownish with thin walls, and measure 4‚Äì6 Œºm; hyphae in the spines are thin-walled, septate, and sometimes branched, measuring 3.5‚Äì4.5 Œºm. The hyphae do not have clamp connections. Similar species Hydnellum peckii is similar in appearance, but has an acrid taste, and clamp connections in its hyphae. Hydnellum spongiosipes is readily confused with H. ferrugineum, and several authors have historically considered the two species to be the same; molecular studies, however, indicate that the two fungi are closely related, but distinct. In contrast with H. ferrugineum, H. spongiosipes has a darker cap when young, darker flesh, and occurs in deciduous woods. Old fruit bodies of H. ferrugineum can be confused with those of Hydnellum concrescens. Habitat and distribution Young fruit bodies Hydnellum ferrugineum is found mainly in coniferous woodland, often near pines, but occasionally with spruce. Fruit bodies have a preference for sandy soil with low levels of organic matter and nutrients, and grow singly or in clusters. They are more likely to be found in older-growth forests. The fungus occurs in North America, including Mexico. It is widespread but generally uncommon throughout Europe, although there may be local areas where it is common. In Britain, H. ferrugineum is provisionally classified as endangered, and is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981; it was included as one of 14 species considered in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan for stipitate hydnoid fungi (i.e., hydnoid fungi with a cap and stipe) in 2004. The fungus is protected in Montenegro. It has been collected in India and North Africa. The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus and upper soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover an area of several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur in the center of large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil. Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H. ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at the leading edge of the mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing saprophytic tendencies. Bioactive compounds Hydnellum ferrugineum fruit bodies contain the pigments hydnuferrigin (dark violet) and hydnuferruginin (yellow), as well as small amounts of the polyphenol compound atromentin. Hydnuferrigin has a chemical structure that closely resembles that of thelephoric acid, a pigment found in other species of Hydnellum and Hydnum, and they may originate from a common precursor compound.

During this brief period, the continental tropical air mass, northeasterly winds and an associated dry and dusty harmattan haze affects the village. However, as a result of proximity to the ocean, the harmattan dust haze, is relatively mild; it may only last for a few weeks between December and January. The farmers benefit from the harmattan characteristics as they are good for harvesting and storage of the food crop. Ikot Udo Abia records warm to hot temperatures throughout the year. The mean annual temperatures varying between . The humidity varies between seventy-five percent in July and ninety-five percent in January.  Infrastructure  The community has two primary schools: St. Martins UNA primary school and Sixtowns school.

Has found two evolutionary sequences of stellar systems: nearly spherical and strongly flattened. Suggested essentially new method to investigate the structure and kinematics of the Milky Way Galaxy. Found a new estimate for the dissipation rate in stellar clusters. Gave an exhaustive analysis of the photogravitational interaction between stars and gas clouds. A planet (3862, \\"Agekian\\") was named in honor of Tateos Artemjevich. Biography T. A. Agekian was born to an Armenian family in Batum in 1913. After graduating from the Leningrad University, in 1938, he began to work as a school teacher. After some years he began his post-graduate studies, but was interrupted because of the Great Patriotic War. T. A. Agekian participated in the war as a Chief of Staff of an artillery regiment. After the demobilization, T. A. Agekian returned to the Leningrad University and worked at the Department of Stellar Astronomy. He received the degree of Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1947. In 1960, he became a Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences and later he received the title of Professor. At present, Professor T. A. Agekian is the Head of Laboratory of Stellar Dynamics and Celestial Mechanics of the Astronomical Institute of St. Petersburg University. He died on January 16, 2006 in Saint Petersburg Scientific activity=Cluster parameters The most of his work are connected with applying the methods of mathematical statistics and theory of random processes to stellar astronomy. In particular, studying the results of star and galaxy counts, he was able to separate the effects of real clustering and the effects due to a clumpy structure of the absorbing layer and to estimate the cluster parameters. Stellar encounters and stellar clusters Developing the theory of stellar encounters, T. A. Agekian has found the probability of encounters with a given velocity change and studied the effect of the encounter multiplicity. These results gave him a possibility to find a new estimate for the dissipation rate in stellar clusters. Evolution of rotating systems In the studies of the influence of the stellar evaporation on the evolution of rotating systems, T. A. Agekian has discovered the existence of two evolutionary subsystems: the spherical and the flattened ones. Photogravitational interaction Agekian gave an exhaustive analysis of the photogravitational interaction between stars and gas clouds. The results obtained provide a possible explanation for the phenomenon of the stellar velocity increase with age. Other scientific achievements T. A. Agekian has initiated a numerical study of triple systems and a statistical analysis of results. Among other results, T. A. Agekian and his collaborators found the probabilities of capture and exchange. A classification of the states of triple systems was proposed. T. A. Agekian also studied the problem of motion in the field of an axially symmetrical potential, and being an author of new methods, achieved some new results in this difficult topic. Professor T. A. Agekian is one of the pioneers of Stellar Dynamics. Since the 1970s, T. A. Agekian studied mainly the problem of motion in the field of an axially symmetrical potential.

The temple dates from the 12th century AD and was built by the Cholas. The Temple Vasishteswarar temple is situated in the village \\"Thittai\\" near Thanjavur. As the village is situated south of the Cauvery river, it is also called \\"Thenkudi Thittai\\". The presiding deity is Swayambootheswarar and the Goddess, Ulaganayaki. As the main deity is a Swayambu Lingam he got the name \\"Swayambootheswarar\\". The main deity is also called as Vasishteswarar as he was worshipped here by Saint Vasishtar.  Significance  It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams - Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanars Tirugnanasambandar and Thirunavukkarasar  Uniqueness  It is believed that a drop of water falls on the Shiva linga every 24 minutes from the ceiling because of the presence of a very special stone called Chandrakanth kept on the roof which absorbs moisture from the surrounding air and converts into a drop of water. This temple attracts huge crowds because of the above stone as well the presence of the temple for Raja Dakshinamoorthy. Legend \\"Thittai\\" - the name of the village means \\"Thittu\\" in Tamil, (i-e) a Mound. When the whole world was surrounded by water because of \\"Pralayam\\", Brahma & Vishnu worshipped the Lord Maheshwara for protection. After wandering much for a safe place, they found this only mount, which did not drown in the Pralaya waters, where there was a Shiva Lingam. They performed Pooja to the Lingam and worshipped Lord Shiva, who appeared before them and deligated their duties of Creation and Protection. It is believed that this is the only place, which was not destroyed even during Pralayam. Unlike many other temples, here the complete temple is built using the stone. Not only for the main deities, but also all other Sannidhi's are constructed using stones, right from floors, pillars, walls and roof. A unique feature of this temple is a drop of water falls on the Lingam (Main Deity) exactly every twenty four minutes (1 Naazhigai) from the roof. But for a small hole, there is no source of water or anything, on the Vimana of the main deity. Two stones \\"Suryagaanthakkal\\" and \\"Chandragaanthakkal\\" which are placed at strategic points above the Vimana are the reasons for the droplets of water which falls on the deity. These 2 stones absorb moisture from the atmosphere, convert into 1 water droplet, performing a natural Abhishegam to the deity, every 24 minutes (1 Naazhigai), be it the day or night. A small piece of yellow cloth (Dhothi) which covers the Lingam is always wet because of this. If one can wait patiently, they can view this amazing act. That shows the scientific and architectural brilliance of our ancestors who have made this temple. The temple tank situated opposite the temple is called \\"Chakra Tirtham\\" which is believed that it was created by the Chakra from the hands of Mahavishnu. The temple is glorified by Tevaram hymns Guru Another special here is that the \\"Guru Bhagavan\\" has a separate Sannidhi with a separate Vimana inside the temple complex, located between Vasishteswarar and Loganayaki Sannidhis. Even in the Gurusthalam Aalangudi, one can see that Dhakshinamurthy facing South in the Praakaaram is worshipped as Guru. This is the only place where you can see Guru Bhagavan who is the Raja Guru, in standing posture with 4 hands holding his weapons and a book. Chitra Pournami and Guru Peyarchi are most important festivals here. Location The temple is situated on Thanjavur - Melattur Road on the way to Thirukkarugavur, at the 10th Km from Thanjavur.

J. Patout Burns asserts that Jewish tradition clearly posits the principle of minimization of violence. This principle can be stated as \\"(wherever) Jewish law allows violence to keep an evil from occurring, it mandates that the minimal amount of violence be used to accomplish one's goal.\\"  Nonviolence  Judaism's religious texts endorse compassion and peace, and the Hebrew Bible contains the well-known commandment to \\"love thy neighbor as thyself\\". According to the 1947 Columbus Platform of Reform Judaism, \\"Judaism, from the days of the prophets, has proclaimed to mankind the ideal of universal peace, striving for spiritual and physical disarmament of all nations. Judaism rejects violence and relies upon moral education, love and sympathy.\\" The philosophy of nonviolence has roots in Judaism, going back to the Jerusalem Talmud of the middle 3rd century. While absolute nonviolence is not a requirement of Judaism, the religion so sharply restricts the use of violence, that nonviolence often becomes the only way to fulfilling a life of truth, justice and peace, which Judaism considers to be the three tools for the preservation of the world.Sandra L.

Mainstream Jewish traditions throughout history have treated these texts as purely historical or highly conditioned, and in any event not relevant to later times.Greenberg, Moshe, \\"On the Political User of the Bible in Modern Israel: An Engaged Critique\\", in Pomegranates and golden bells: studies in biblical, Jewish, and Near Eastern ritual, law, and literature, Eisenbrauns, 1995, pp. 467‚Äì469: > No \\"national\\" commandment such as that of \\"conquest and settling the land\\" > occurs in any of these [Judaic] summaries [of the Torah]‚Ä¶ [arguments for > applying herem to modern Israel] introduces a distinction that Scripture > does not recognize; nowhere are the obligations referred to in the summaries > contingent on the achievement of the land-taking or the destruction of > Israel's enemies.

Simon was more of a prototype for a modern Zionist fighter: unromantic and professional, a man who lived and died a guerrilla and nationalist.\\" (p. 142) In Modern times, warfare conducted by the State of Israel is governed by Israeli law and regulation, which includes a purity of arms code that is based in part on Jewish tradition; the 1992 IDF Code of Conduct combines international law, Israeli law, Jewish heritage and the IDF's own traditional ethical code. However, tension between actions of the Israeli government on the one hand, and Jewish traditions and halakha on the conduct of war on the other, have caused controversy within Israel and have provided a basis for criticisms of Israel. Some strains of radical Zionism promote aggressive war and justify them with biblical texts.Kravitz, Leonard, \\"What is Crime?\\", in Crime and punishment in Jewish law: essays and responses, Editors Walter Jacob, Moshe Zemer Berghahn Books, 1999, p. 31.

The Idumaens were forced to convert to Judaism, either by threats of exile, or threats of death, depending on the source.Flavius Josephus Antiquities 13.257‚Äì258Aristobulus In Euseb√≠us, Christianity, and Judaism Harold W. Attridge claims that ‚Äúthere is reason to think that Josephus‚Äô account of their conversion is substantially accurate.‚Äù He also writes, \\"That these were not isolated instances but that forced conversion was a national policy is clear from the fact that Alexander Jannaeus (c. 80 BCE) demolished the city of Pella in Moab, 'because the inhabitants would not agree to adopt the national custom of the Jews. Josephus, Antiquities. 13.15.4.Harold W. Attridge, G≈çhei Hata (eds.). Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism. Wayne State University Press, 1992: p. 387. Maurice Sartre has written of the \\"policy of forced Judaization adopted by Hyrcanos, Aristobulus I and Jannaeus\\", who offered \\"the conquered peoples a choice between expulsion or conversion\\".Maurice Sartre. The Middle East Under Rome. Harvard University Press, 2005: p. 15. William Horbury has written that \\"The evidence is best explained by postulating that an existing small Jewish population in Lower Galilee was massively expanded by the forced conversion in c. 104 BCE of their Gentile neighbours in the north.\\"William Horbury. The Cambridge History of Judaism 2 Part Set: Volume 3, The Early Roman Period Cambridge University Press, 1999: p. 599.  Kingdom of Himyar  After the conversion of the kingdom of Himyar in the late 4th century to Judaism, two episodes of \\"coercion and brutality\\" by Himyar Jewish kings took place during the fifth and early sixth centuries. Thirty-nine Christian were martyred in the third quarter of the fifth century, and a massacre of Christians took place in 523. The Yemeni Jewish Himyar tribe, led by King Dhu Nuwashad, offered Christian residents of a village in Saudi Arabia the choice between conversion to Judaism or death, and 20,000 Christians were massacred. Inscriptions show the great pride he expressed after massacring more than 22,000 Christians in Zafar and Najran.Jacques Ryckmans, La pers√©cution des chr√©tiens himyarites au sixi√®me si√®cle Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Inst. in het Nabije Oosten, 1956 pp. 1‚Äì24.  Retribution and punishment = Eye for an eye  While the principle of lex talionis (\\"an eye for an eye\\") is clearly echoed in the Bible, in Judaism it is not literally applied, and was interpreted to provide a basis for financial compensation for injuries. Pasachoff and Littman point to the reinterpretation of the lex talionis as an example of the ability of Pharisaic Judaism to \\"adapt to changing social and intellectual ideas.\\" Stephen Wylen asserts that the lex talionis is \\"proof of the unique value of each individual\\" and that it teaches \\"equality of all human beings for law.\\"  Capital and corporal punishment  While the Bible and the Talmud specify many violent punishments, including death by stoning, decapitation, burning, and strangulation for some crimes, *Sanhedrin 11:1 specifies strangulation *Neusner, Jacob, Comparing religions through law: Judaism and Islam, pp. 107‚Äì111 these punishments were substantially modified during the rabbinic era, primarily by adding additional requirements for conviction. The Mishnah states that a sanhedrin that executes one person in seven years ‚Äì or seventy years, according to Eleazar ben Azariah ‚Äì is considered bloodthirsty. During the Late Antiquity, the tendency of not applying the death penalty at all became predominant in Jewish courts. According to Talmudic law, the competence to apply capital punishment ceased with the destruction of the Second Temple. In practice, where medieval Jewish courts had the power to pass and execute death sentences, they continued to do so for particularly grave offenses, although not necessarily the ones defined by the law. Although it was recognized that the use of capital punishment in the post-Second Temple era went beyond the biblical warrant, the Rabbis who supported it believed that it could be justified by other considerations of Jewish law. Whether Jewish communities ever practiced capital punishment according to rabbinical law and whether the Rabbis of the Talmudic era ever supported its use even in theory has been a subject of historical and ideological debate. The 12th-century Jewish legal scholar Maimonides stated that \\"It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.\\" The position of Jewish Law on capital punishment often formed the basis of deliberations by Israel's Supreme Court. It has been carried out by Israel's judicial system only once, in the case of Adolf Eichmann.  Purim and the Book of Esther  The Book of Esther, one of the books of the Jewish Bible, is a story of palace intrigue centered on a plot to kill all Jews which was thwarted by Esther, a Jewish queen of Persia. Instead of being victims, the Jews killed \\"all the people who wanted to kill them.\\"Free Bible Version... The king gave the Jews the ability to defend themselves against their enemies who tried to kill them,Megilat Esther ‚Äì the Jewish Magazine numbering 75,000 (Esther 9:16) including Haman, an Amalekite that led the plot to kill the Jews. The annual Purim festival celebrates this event, and includes the recitation of the biblical instruction to \\"blot out the remembrance [or name] of Amalek\\". Scholars ‚Äì including Ian Lustick, Marc Gopin, and Steven Bayme ‚Äì state that the violence described in the Book of Esther has inspired and incited violent acts and violent attitudes in the post-biblical era, continuing into modern times, often centered on the festival of Purim.Lustick, Ian, For the land and the Lord: Jewish fundamentalism in Israel, Council on Foreign Relations, 1988. Quote: \\"Of decisive importance to Jewish fundamentalists is their belief that contemporary political developments are part of an unfolding cosmic drama that will determine, depending on the willingness of Jews to act decisively on its behalf, whether God's redemption of his people Israel, and of the whole world, will or will not soon reach its completion‚Ä¶. The massacre in the Hebron mosque on the Jewish holiday of Purim is a tragic, but telling, example. Preceded by a rash of killings of Jewish settlers by Muslim fundamentalists ‚Ä¶ it is not in the least a coincidence that the massacre took place on the Jewish holiday of Purim. For most Jews Purim means listening to .. the Book of Esther .. .It is an occasion for merry-making, games, charity and the exchange of gifts. But as Goldstein sat reading that same book on Purim even in 1994, it is almost certain he identified Yasir Arafat with Haman, the arch-enemy of the Jews of ancient Persia, and the killing of Jewish settlers over the previous months with Haman's murderous designs. Accordingly, he [Goldstein] focused on often- ignored verses at the end of the book [of Esther] which, for Jewish fundamentalists, capture the essence of the story under contemporary circumstances and contain a divine imperative to act. According to the Book of Esther the Jews are saved by the king who reverses Haman's evil decree and declares instead that Jews may do unto their enemies what their enemies had intended to do unto them 'to stand up for themselves, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might assault them, with their little ones and women' (Esther 8:11)‚Ä¶.By mowing down Arabs he believed wanted to kill Jews, Goldstein was re-enacting part of the Purim story.\\" (pp. ix‚Äìxi.)Quotes from Horowitz 2006, p. 16: \\"This book deals not only with the theme of Amalek and responses ‚Äì Christian as well as Jewish ‚Äì to the book of Esther over the centuries, but also with Jewish violence connected with the holiday of Purim, from the early fifth century to the late twentieth.\\" :p. 19: \\"The first [part of this book] is devoted .. to the book of Esther ‚Ä¶ Was it a book that promoted cruel vengeance‚Ä¶? Since according to Jewish law the Amalekites, including women and children, had to be utterly destroyed, thinking about Amalek involved ‚Ä¶ thinking about the possibilities of, and justifications for, Jewish violence. [The second part of this book includes discussion of] one specific form of Jewish violence over many centuries - the descration of the cross and other Christian images‚Ä¶. [chapter 8 is] devoted to violence against Christians, sometimes within the context of the Purim festiviy, in the 5th‚Äì7th centuries. Chapter 9 carries the subject of Purim violence into the medieval and early modern Europe, especially against the background of the often violent rites of Carnival.\\" Bayme, Steven, \\"Saddam, Haman, and Amalek\\", in Jewish arguments and counterarguments: essays and addresses, KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 2002: Quote: \\"For many centuries Purim has been a source of both joy and embarrassment for Jews. ‚Ä¶ Still others have challenged the doctrine of violence associated with the holiday‚Ä¶ Martin Luther, for one, accused the Jews of bloodthirsty and vengeful spirit in the Book of Esther‚Ä¶ [Luther] reflect[s] the close association of Purim with the biblical doctrine of war against the Amalek. The theme of Jewish violence against Haman and his supporters, the doctrine of Amalek, has caused Jews the greatest discomfort with the Book of Esther and the holiday with which it is associated‚Ä¶. Judaism teaches that violence is justified under certain circumstances ‚Äì particularly defense against aggression ‚Ä¶ Amalek, the rabbis argue, is the eternally irreconcilable enemy who represents a value system that promotes murder ‚Ä¶ Herein lies the enduring relevance of Purim. Aggression must be stopped and evil eliminated‚Ä¶. The meaning of Purim is relevant to the question of the war in the Persian Gulf today [2002]‚Ä¶. [Saddam Hussein's] unprovoked Scud missile attacks against entirely civilian targets in Israel are reminiscent of Amaleks's treacherous attacks upon the ‚Ä¶ Israelites....\\" (pp. 75‚Äì80) The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha, Augmented Third Edition Michael David Coogan (Ed). Quote:\\"Jews and Christians have also been troubled by the story's [Book of Esther] enthusiastic account of the violence of the Jewish community's response to their enemies, which involved not only self defense but also the slaughter of women and children, including the sons of Haman. The bloodthirsty language, however, derives from the story's symmetric pattern of reversals..\\" (p. 708) Gopin, Marc, Between Eden and Armageddon: the future of world religions, violence, and peacemaking, Oxford University Press US, 2000. Quote : \\"I have known many Orthodox rabbis, for example, who would be happy to ensure that a holiday such as Purim, with its obligatory reading of the Book of Esther, which cluminates with the slaughter of the people ‚Äì including their children ‚Äì who tried to exterminate the Jewish people, would never be used to justify the killing of anyone today. They certainly are deeply ashamed by Baruch Goldstein's mass murder at the Hebron mosque, which was inspired in part by Purim‚Ä¶. They can and do give moralistic sermons, and they can and do interpret the story in less violent terms‚Ä¶. The hermeneutic give and take of Purim is but one example of the way in which a deeply embedded tradition will not disappear even when many people reject its implicit message of violence‚Ä¶. It is not likely [that Purim would diminish in importance] in the current climate of religious revivalism, but it is possible that the violence of the story could be overshadowed with time by the numerous benevolent characteristics of the holiday, such as aiding the poor‚Ä¶. Jewish empowerment allows for a new hermeneutic that could centralize the violence of the story. If the political situation were to rapidly deteriorate, it is conceivable that Purim could become for radical Jews what Ramadan has become for radical Muslims in Algeria, a killing season‚Ä¶. Even the most radically pacifist Jews that I know do not eliminate this holiday, although they do not really know what to do with sacralized violence yet, and are now only evolving a spiritual and ritual reworking of traumatic and violent episodes.\\" (pp. 52‚Äì53) Nirenberg, David, Communities of violence: persecution of minorities in the Middle Ages, Princeton University Press, 1998. Quote:\\"There is evidence ‚Ä¶ that Jews could use ritual violence to criticize the Christians in whose lands they dwelled An obvious example is Purim, on which see E. Horowitz, The Rite to Be Reckless ..; and for a late medieval Iberian example, S. Levy, \\"Notas sobre el 'Purrim de Zaragoza\\", Anuario do Filologia 5 (1979): 203‚Äì217.

Quote :\\"In 1994, on Purim day, Jewish physician Baruch Goldstein burst into an Arab Mosque in Hebron ‚Ä¶ and sprayed Arab worshipers who were kneeling in prayer with bullets from an automatic weapon. Twenty-nine Palestinians were killed before the enraged crowd tore him to pieces. It was a shameful day in Jewish history, the memory of which should be injected into all future Purim celebrations as a sober reminder of the potential barbarism that is hidden within the old myths of vengeance wrought by the Sons of Israel upon their enemies‚Ä¶. [Baruch's] memorial plaque affirmed that 'he was murdered for the sanctification of the Name‚Ä¶'. In this manipulative phrasing the old Jewish ethos of martyrdom, the sanctification of the Name, was given new meaning - messianic, activist, and murderous‚Ä¶. Purim celebrations in Israel in 2001 were again blotted by ugly incidents. As Jewish hotheadedness increased ‚Ä¶ harassments of Palestinians took place. During Purim it was a mitzvah, or good deed, to sock it to the modern Amalekites‚Ä¶ In Jerusalem dozens of Jews gathered in the Sabath Square, pelted cars with stones, tried to set a minibus on fire, and threw various objects at residents of the Arab quarter. In Zion Gate Jews beat up Palestinians, calling them 'dirty Arabs' and 'terrorists'. One drunken Jew who wounded an Arab in the eye subsequently attacked the police as he was arrested. There was no loss of life in these incidents, but this cannot be said about the Baruch Goldstein precedence of violence that was deliberately injected into the Purim ritual. And if it has become a Purim commandment to drink and then attack Arabs, how should the Arabs react?\\" (pp. 63‚Äì64) Robins, Robert S. and Post, Jerrold M., Political paranoia: the psychopolitics of hatred, Yale University Press, 1997.

Purim [Baruch's] friend explained 'is a holiday to kill the people who are trying to kill the Jews'\\" ‚Ä¶ For most Jews Purim is a joyous celebration of deliverance. But for some it is a celebration of violence, commemorating an uprising of the Jews against their enemies, a day of righteous wrath when 'the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them' (Esther 9:1).\\" (pp. 162‚Äì163) Hunter, Alastair G. \\"Denominating Amalek: Racist stereotyping in the Bible and the Justification of Discrimination\\" in Sanctified aggression: legacies of biblical and post biblical vocabularies, Jonneke Bekkenkamp, Yvonne Sherwood (Eds), Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003.

Quote: \\"..Christians had grown apprehensive at what they perceived, not without reason, as the ill-will that Jews harbored against the Christian Church‚Ä¶ Such concerns are already reflected in the legislation passed in 408 CE against the alleged Jewish practice of burning Haman in effigy on 'a form made to resemble the sainted cross' during the festival of Purim, which the authorities suspected was a gesture of ridicule aimed at the Savior himself‚Ä¶.

Ian Lustick, Benny Morris, and Nur Masalha assert that radical Zionist leaders relied on religious doctrines for justification for the violent treatment of Arabs in Palestine, citing examples where pre-state Jewish militia used verses from the Bible to justify their violent acts, which included expulsions and massacres such as the one at Deir Yassin. * Saleh Abdel Jawad (2007) \\"Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War\\" in Israel and the Palestinian refugees, Eyal Benvenist√Æ, Chaim Gans, Sari Hanafi (Eds.), Springer, p. 78: :\\".. the Zionist movement, which claims to be secular, found it necessary to embrace the idea of 'the promised land' of Old Testament prophecy, to justify the confiscation of land and the expulsion of the Palestinians. For example, the speeches and letter of Chaim Weizman, the secular Zionist leader, are filled with references to the biblical origins of the Jewish claim to Palestine, which he often mixes liberally with more pragmatic and nationalistic claims. By the use of this premise, embraced in 1937, Zionists alleged that the Palestinians were usurpers in the Promised Land, and therefore their expulsion and death was justified. The Jewish-American writer Dan Kurzman, in his book Genesis 1948 ‚Ä¶ describes the view of one of the Deir Yassin's killers: 'The Sternists followed the instructions of the Bible more rigidly than others. They honored the passage (Exodus 22:2): 'If a thief be found ‚Ä¶' This meant, of course, that killing a thief was not really murder. And were not the enemies of Zionism thieves, who wanted to steal from the Jews what God had granted them?' '' * Carl. S.

After Baruch Goldstein carried out the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre in 1994, his actions were widely interpreted to be based on the radical Zionist ideology of the Kach movement, and were condemned as such by mainstream religious and secular Jews and praised as such by radical Zionists.

Secondly, the law of the pursuer is only intended to save a potential victim from imminent death.

On the contrary, Prime Minister Rabin, over half the members of the Knesset, and over half the population of Israel believe exactly the opposite - that it will save Jewish lives. Lastly, this law does not refer to elected representatives, for if Yitzhak Rabin was really a pursuer, then so are all his followers and that would mean that Amir should have killed over half the population of Israel! In other words, even according to the law of the pursuer, this act was totally futile and senseless since the peace process will continue.\\" and the mainstream Jewish view is that Rabin's assassin had no Halakhic basis to shoot Prime Minister Rabin.Halacha File: The Halacha of Rodef and the Rabin Shooting.

For example, Nelson-Pallmeyer writes that \\"Judaism, Christianity and Islam will continue to contribute to the destruction of the world until and unless each challenges violence in 'sacred texts' and until each affirms nonviolent, including the nonviolent power of God.\\" Bruce Feiler writes of ancient history that \\"Jews and Christians who smugly console themselves that Islam is the only violent religion are willfully ignoring their past. Nowhere is the struggle between faith and violence described more vividly, and with more stomach-turning details of ruthlessness, than in the Hebrew Bible\\". Similarly, Burggraeve and Vervenne describe the Old Testament as full of violence and evidence of both a violent society and a violent god. They write that, \\"[i]n numerous Old Testament texts the power and glory of Israel's God is described in the language of violence.\\" They assert that more than one thousand passages refer to YHWH as acting violently or supporting the violence of humans and that more than one hundred passages involve divine commands to kill humans. Supersessionist Christian churches and theologians argue that Judaism is a violent religion and the god of Israel is a violent god, while Christianity is a religion of peace and that the god of Christianity is one that expresses only love. While this view has been common throughout the history of Christianity and remains a common assumption among Christians, it has been rejected by mainstream Christian theologians and denominations since the Holocaust.R.

He was elected a Member of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament for the DA in 2009. Premier Helen Zille appointed him as the Provincial Minister for Housing. In 2014, he was named Provincial Minister of Human Settlements. A year later, in 2015, Madikizela unseated party stalwart Theuns Botha as deputy provincial leader of the DA. DA Provincial leader Patricia de Lille resigned in February 2017 and left Madikizela in charge as acting provincial leader. He won a full term in October 2017. In 2019, Madikizela became the Provincial Minister of Transport and Public Works. Early life Madikizela was born in the then Cape Province on 15 March 1975.

After Skwatsha won the leadership election, Madikizela and some of Rasool's supporters in Khayelitsha claimed that they were being marginalised, and later excluded as possible ANC candidates for the local government elections in 2006. In early 2006, Madikizela along with several other ANC members, including some party councillors, were expelled from the party after it became known of their intention to contest the local government elections as independent candidates. Although he was not elected as a councillor, Madikizela remained politically active, joining the United Democratic Movement (UDM) in 2007. He was appointed the party's Cape Town Metro Regional Secretary until a party investigation found that he had secretly convinced party members to join the Democratic Alliance. He was subsequently hired as a communication officer at the City of Cape Town, and later a spokesperson in the office of former Mayor of Cape Town, Helen Zille.

Controversy In September 2010, the ANC called for his resignation after his answer to a parliamentary question from the ANC's Pierre Uys over the provision of housing in the Western Cape. Madikizela had said \\"unfortunately\\" there was no influx control to regulate the movement of people into the Western Cape. The ANC called for Helen Zille to fire him, angered that he had linked the provision of services to the apartheid policy of influx control. Mandela Park Madikizela has been embroiled in a number of controversies surrounding housing developments in Mandela Park, Khayelitsha. He has been accused by the Mandela Park Backyarders as well as journalists of breaking a promise of giving residents of the community houses in new Mandela Park developments. The controversy has resulted in large demonstrations and blockades against construction in the community. The community of Mandela Park has also accused the MEC of refusing to meet with them.

It is a collection of six lectures given in May 1840 about prominent historical figures. It lays out Carlyle's belief in the importance of heroic leadership. Background The book was based on a course of lectures Carlyle had given. The French Revolution: A History had brought Carlyle recognition, but little money, so friends organized courses of public lectures, drumming up an audience and selling one guinea tickets. Though Carlyle disliked lecturing, he discovered a facility for it; more importantly, it brought in much-needed income. Between 1837 and 1840, Carlyle delivered four such courses of lectures, the final of which was on \\"Heroes\\". His lecture notes were transformed into the book, with the effects of the spoken discourse still discernible in the prose. \\"The Hero as Man of Letters\\" (1840): * \\"In books lies the soul of the whole Past Time; the articulate audible voice of the Past, when the body and material substance of it has altogether vanished like a dream.\\" * \\"A man lives by believing something; not by debating and arguing about many things.\\" * \\"All that mankind has done, thought, gained or been: it is lying as in magic preservation in the pages of books.\\" * \\"What we become depends on what we read after all of the professors have finished with us. The greatest university of all is a collection of books.\\" * \\"The suffering man ought really to consume his own smoke; there is no good in emitting smoke till you have made it into fire.\\" * \\"Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man; but for one man who can stand prosperity, there are a hundred that will stand adversity.\\" (Often shortened to \\"can't stand prosperity\\" as an unknown quote.) * \\"Not what I have, but what I do, is my kingdom.\\" Lectures : 1. (5 May) The Hero as Divinity. Odin. Paganism: Scandinavian Mythology : 2. (8 May) The Hero as Prophet. Muhammad: Islam : 3. (12 May) The Hero as Poet. Dante; Shakespeare : 4. (15 May) The Hero as Priest. Luther; Reformation: Knox; Puritanism : 5. (19 May) The Hero as Man of Letters. Johnson, Rousseau, Burns : 6. (22 May) The Hero as King. Cromwell. Napoleon: Modern Revolutionism Summary Carlyle was one of the few philosophers who lived through the British industrial revolution but maintained a non-materialistic view of historical development. The book included lectures discussing people ranging from the field of religion through to literature and politics. The figures chosen for each lecture were presented by Carlyle as archetypal examples of individuals who, in their respective fields of endeavour, had dramatically impacted history in some way, for good or ill.I. Ousby (ed.), The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (Cambridge, 1995), p. 434. Muhammad himself found a place in the book in the lecture titled \\"The Hero as Prophet\\". In his work, Carlyle outlined Muhammad as a Hegelian agent of reform, insisting on his sincerity and commenting \\"how one man single-handedly, could weld warring tribes and wandering Bedouins into a most powerful and civilized nation in less than two decades\\". His interpretation has been widely cited by Muslim scholars to show Muhammad without orientalist bias. Monument to Thomas Carlyle, Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow Carlyle held that \\"Great Men should rule and that others should revere them,\\" a view that for him was supported by a complex faith in history and evolutionary progress. Societies, like organisms, evolve throughout history, thrive for a time, but inevitably become weak and die out, giving place to a stronger, superior breed. Heroes are those who affirm this life process, accepting its cruelty as necessary and thus good. For them courage is a more valuable virtue than love; heroes are noblemen, not saints. The hero functions first as a pattern for others to imitate, and second as a creator, moving history forwards not backward (history being the biography of great men). Carlyle was among the first of his age to recognize that the death of God is in itself nothing to be happy about, unless man steps in and creates new values to replace the old. For Carlyle, the hero should become the object of worship, the centre of a new religion proclaiming humanity as \\"the miracle of miracles... the only divinity we can know\\".D. Daiches (ed.), Companion to Literature 1 (London, 1965), p. 89. For Carlyle's creed Bentley proposes the name \\"heroic vitalism,\\" a term embracing both a political theory, aristocratic radicalism, and a metaphysic, supernatural naturalism. The heroic vitalists feared that the recent trends toward democracy would hand over power to the ill-bred, uneducated, and immoral, whereas their belief in a transcendent force in nature directing itself onward and upward gave some hope that this overarching force would overrule in favor of the strong, intelligent, and noble.Bentley, Eric. The Cult of the Superman. Peter Smith, 1969. For Carlyle, the hero was somewhat similar to Aristotle's \\"magnanimous\\" man ‚Äì a person who flourished in the fullest sense. However, for Carlyle, unlike Aristotle, the world was filled with contradictions with which the hero had to deal. All heroes will be flawed. Their heroism lay in their creative energy in the face of these difficulties, not in their moral perfection. To sneer at such a person for their failings is the philosophy of those who seek comfort in the conventional. Carlyle called this \\"valetism\\", from the expression \\"no man is a hero to his valet.\\"Carlyle, Thomas (1869), On Heroes, Hero-Worship, & the Heroic in History, London: Chapman and Hall, 301. Legacy These lectures of Carlyle's are regarded as an early and powerful formulation of the Great Man theory of historical development. Friedrich Nietzsche agreed with much of Carlyle's hero worship, transferring many qualities of the hero to his concept of the . He believed that the hero should be revered, not for the good he has done for the people, but simply out of admiration for the marvellous. The hero justifies himself as a man chosen by destiny to be great. In the life struggle, he is a conqueror, growing stronger through conflict. The hero is not ashamed of his strength; instead of the Christian virtues of meekness, humility, and compassion, he abides by the beatitudes of Heroic Vitalism: courage, nobility, pride, and the right to rule. His slogan: \\"The good old rule, the simple plan, that he should keep who has the power, and he should take who can.\\" See also *Heroes in historical studies *Representative Men ‚Äì a similar series of lectures, given by Carlyle's American contemporary Ralph Waldo Emerson *Parallel Lives ‚Äì classic work by Ancient Greek biographer Plutarch, outlining the lives of elite individuals and the virtues they represented.

While sailing off Paknam on Siam's Chao Phraya River, three French ships violated Siamese territory and were fired warning shots by a Siamese fort and a force of gunboats. In the ensuing battle, France won and blockaded Bangkok, which ended the war.  Background  Conflict arose when the French Navy aviso Inconstant and the gunboat Comete arrived on July 13 at Paknam with the intention of crossing the bar into the Chao Phraya River and join the French gunboat Lutin already anchored off the French embassy in Bangkok. The Siamese forbade the French gunboats to cross the bar, a contravention of the Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1856 which permitted the French free passage up as far as Paknam Island. The French commander, Captain Borey, did not receive a telegram of updated instructions from Paris to hold his position at the mouth of the river, as it was not received by the French consul Auguste Pavie until the following day. But Pavie did advise him of the Siamese stance and suggested he anchor off Koh Sichang and await further instructions. Borey was under pressure since his ships could only cross the bar at high tide and chose to follow his orders from Rear Admiral Edgar Humann in Saigon rather than Pavie's counsel. The French in Bangkok believed that the Siamese were well-prepared for battle. Phra Chulachomklao Fort had just been modernized with seven 6-inch Armstrong Whitworth disappearing guns and was under the command of Andreas du Plessis de Richelieu, a Danish naval officer granted the royal title of Phraya Chonlayutyothin. Further upriver at Paknam Island, the smaller Phi Seua Samut fortress had also been fitted with three of the same guns. The Siamese had also sunk mines, barrels of gas, and dynamite in the river, from below the fort to the center of the river. Above this, two chain and stake barrages plus several sunken vessels off both banks left only a narrow passage available to the French. Reports are contradictory about the strength of Siamese naval forces that day. Contemporary French accounts suggest that five gunboats were anchored just beyond the sunken vessels, almost the entire Siamese fleet. Herbert Warington Smyth who visited Paknam that day disputes this, reporting that only the Siamese gunboats Makut Ratchakuman and Coronation were present, together with \\"two very old-fashioned gun flats with a big gun each, and the training barque, lying farther up river, armed with six brass carronades for saluting purposes\\". Incident Chulachomklao Fort firing on the French ships The French chose to cross the bar with the high tide just after sunset on July 13. The weather was overcast and raining. By this time the Siamese were on high alert and at battle stations. The French ships were led by the small mail steamer Jean Baptiste Say. At 18:15 the rain stopped and the Siamese gunners observed the French ships passing the nearby lighthouse. A few minutes later, the French were off Black Buoy when they entered the range of the fort's guns. Siamese gunners were ordered to fire three warning shots; if they were ignored, then a fourth shot would signal their gunboats to open fire. At 18:30, the Phra Chulachomklao Fort opened fire with two blank rounds but the French continued on, so a third, live, warning shot was fired and hit the water in front of the Jean Baptiste Say. When this warning was ignored, a fourth shot was fired so the gunboats Makhut Ratchakuman and Coronation opened up at 18:50. Inconstant returned fire on the fort while the Comete engaged the gunboats. At least two shots from fortress hit the Inconstant, but more effective action was prevented by a lack of training at the fort. Under Richelieu's direct command at the fort were three other Danes. Two of them were recent arrivals who spoke no Siamese. By Warington-Smyth's account \\"these officers were running breathlessly to their guns in turn up and down half-finished steps and gun- platforms, avoiding pitfalls as best they might, and communicating their orders in languages which none of the astonished gunners understood.\\" It was a similar situation aboard the Siamese gunboats where the Siamese crews lacked any training, so their Danish commanders ran back-and-forth to lay and fire the guns, then back to the bridge to steer the ship and instruct the engine room. After firing two shots the carriage of the 70-pound gun aboard the Coronation broke through the deck and could no longer be fired. In the ensuing confusion the Coronation was nearly rammed by the Inconstant which fired two shells into the Coronation. The Jean Baptiste Say was hit several times by cannon fire and the captain was forced to ground her on Laem Lamphu Rai. No shells hit the Phra Chulachomklao Fort. Within 25 minutes the Inconstant and the Comete had broken through the line of Siamese defences at a cost of fifteen Siamese and two French lives. A short time later the ships passed the Phi Seua fortress at Paknam. By this time night had fallen and after \\"five minutes' desultory firing of the wildest kind\\" the gunboats passed unhindered. Warington-Smyth reports that a civilian woman in Paknam was struck and killed by a stray bullet from this skirmish. Aftermath The following morning, Jean Baptiste Says crew was still aboard their grounded vessel so the Siamese sent a boat and captured the steamer. They then attempted to sink her, but failed. The prisoners were treated badly according to French reports but again this is refuted by Warington Smyth. A day later, the French gunboat Forfait arrived at Paknam and sent a boatload of sailors to recapture the mail steamer, but when they boarded the Siamese defenders repelled their attack. Captain Borey had anchored off the French Embassy in Bangkok around 22:00 on July 13. His ships' guns were targeted on the royal palace to put pressure on the Siamese to resolve multiple territorial disputes that had arisen with France. The Siamese were widely seen as having overplayed their hand in the dispute. By attempting to prevent the French from entering the Chao Phraya River, the Siamese had contravened the 1856 Franco-Siamese Treaty, giving the French a pretext for their subsequent actions. The French gunboats, together with Pavie, departed Bangkok on July 24 prior to the French imposing a blockade of the river from July 29 until August 3. In France, many were calling for a protectorate to be imposed upon Siam. But the events of July 13, followed by the blockade, which harmed British interests far more than French (British trade accounted for 93% of Siam exports), alarmed the British, who put pressure on both the Siamese and French governments to reach a negotiated settlement. The final agreement gave the French control of substantial territories east of the Mekong river, territory that today forms most of Laos. Furthermore, a 25 km-wide military-exclusion zone was established on the right bank of the Mekong and around Battambang and Siem Reap, weakening Siamese control of these territories, and the French were given temporary control of the port of Chanthaburi). Finally, the Siamese were forced to pay three million French francs indemnity to the French. The final agreement was signed on October 3, 1893.

Chandru asked him to take one more assignment, else he will reveal Sethu's real past to the villagers. Sethu had no choice but to take up the assignment and starts to Kodaikanal. In Kodaikanal he stays with Ramu (Vijayaraghavan), who was an old associate of his in Bombay. Sethu's assignment was to kill Radha (Ranjini), who teaches in a boarding school in Kodaikanal managed by Fr. Francis Arackal (Jose Prakash). One night Sethu goes to murder Radha, but is shocked to find her trying to commit suicide. Sethu instead saves her life and tries to found out who wants to kill her. Sethu understands that the person who wants to finish off Radha is actually Narayan Mehta (Lalu Alex), who is the boss of Chandru and Ramu. Narayan Mehta earlier married Radha as Narayanankutty for her money, but later left her and made her believe that he died in an accident in Dubai. Radha met Narayanankutty, who is now a big businessman called Narayan Mehta, in Kodaikanal. Narayan Mehta orders Chandru to have Radha killed, to prevent his secrets getting revealed. The cruel Mehta also destroyed the life of Kausalya (Parvathy) by killing her rich father, grabbing all her wealth and reducing her to his handicapped wife in a wheelchair. Sethu develops sympathy towards Radha, fals in love with her and decides to protect her from Chandru and Narayan Mehta with the help of Ramu and Albert (Saikumar). They ended up having an open fight and Chandru was killed by Ramu, who in turn was killed by Narayan Mehta. Sethu and Radha were chased by Narayan Mehta and finally Sethu kills Mehta with the help of Albert, who also dies in the attempt. The film ends with Sethu being taken by the police with Fr. Francis assuring him of getting acquitted considering the circumstances leading to the murder and Mehta's criminal past.

Description This fish can be up to in length. The body compressed laterally, endowed with a dorsal fin starting from the top of the head until joining practically the superior base of the caudal fin. When the dorsal fin is spread, it looks like a crest resembling the one on a cockatoo. The thorns of the dorsal fin are venomous. This fish mostly stays on the substratum and moves by means of its pectoral fins. Its color varies from cream to dark brown, with irregular spots. Distribution and habitat This species occurs in the tropical West Pacific Ocean, from Malaysia to Japan and from Indonesia to Australia. Ablabys taenianotus lives at depths from on sandy, silty or rubble bottoms, and also in fields of sea grass Zosteraceae. Behaviour This species is benthic and nocturnal. It is an opportunistic predator and ambushes passing prey while mimicking a crumpled, dead leaf or a drifting piece of seaweed. It allows itself to drift with the moving water in the way that an inert object would do. It may be found singly or in pairs. The fish feeds on small shrimp and other tiny crustaceans that pass near its mouth. Aquarium care These fish are venomous, so caution must be taken when they are handled. They can grow up to 5 or 6 inches in length and need at least a 30-gallon aquarium. The specific gravity (SG) should be between 1,020 and 1,025, and the temperature should be between 23 ¬∞C (73.4 ¬∞F) and 26 ¬∞C (78.8 ¬∞F). Cockatoo wasp fish are more active at night, which is when they come out and feed. They should only be kept with larger and non threatening tankmates. For the aquarium they need seagrass and sand which is found in their environment. They are sensitive fish so water quality must be excellent. Cockatoo waspfish eat fish, crabs, polychaetes worms, shrimp, jellyfish and medusae. They are also cannibalistic. They need to be fed 2-4 times a week by small amounts every day.

A cardinal since 20 November 2010, he was appointed the prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments by Pope Francis on 23 November 2014. He previously served as the secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples under Pope John Paul II, and the president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum under Pope Benedict XVI. A prominent voice of the College of Cardinals and in the Roman Curia, Sarah has been a forceful advocate for the defense of traditional Catholic teaching on questions of sexual morality and the right to life, and in denouncing Islamic radicalism. He has called gender ideology and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) the \\"two radicalizations\\" that threaten the family, the first through divorce, same-sex marriage and abortion, the latter with child marriage, polygamy and the subjection of women. Though he has been described as largely sympathetic to pre-Vatican II liturgical practices, he has also proposed that partisans of different liturgies learn from each other and seek a middle ground. He has been mentioned as papabile, a possible candidate for the papacy, by international media outlets such as Le Monde, as well as by Catholic publications including Crux, the National Catholic Reporter and the Catholic Herald. Early life and education Sarah was born in Ourous, a rural village in then French Guinea, on 15 June 1945, the son of converts to Christianity from animism. He is a member of the Coniaguis ethnic group in northern Guinea. In 1957, at age 12, he entered Saint Augustine Minor Seminary in Bingerville, Ivory Coast, where he studied for three years. Because in 1960 relations between newly independent Guinea and the Ivory Coast were strained, he continued his studies briefly in Conakry, Guinea, at Saint Mary of Dixinn Seminary run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, until the radical government of Guinea expropriated church property in August 1961. After independent study at home, the church negotiated a place for Sarah and some fellow seminarians at a government-run school in Kindia in March 1962 and then won the right to open a seminary, where Sarah earned his baccalaureate in 1964. In September of that year he was sent to study at the Grand Seminary in Nancy, France. Again deteriorating international relations, this time between Guinea and France, forced him to interrupt his studies, and he completed his theological studies in S√©bikotane, Senegal, between October 1967 and June 1969. From 1969 to 1974 he studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he obtained a licentiate in theology, except for the year 1971 which he spent at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum of Jerusalem, where he obtained a licentiate in Sacred Scriptures. Sarah speaks French, English and Italian fluently. Presbytariate and episcopate Cardinal Robert Sarah with President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines during courtesy call at Malaca√±an Palace Cardinal Sarah during the Procession of the Holy Blood in Bruges, Belgium, in 2009 Sarah was ordained to the priesthood on 20 July 1969, and incardinated in the Diocese of Conakry. On 13 August 1979, Pope John Paul II appointed him Metropolitan Archbishop of Conakry. He was consecrated bishop on 8 December 1979 by Cardinal Giovanni Benelli. He served as Conakry's bishop for more than twenty years and during that tenure filled terms as president of the Guinean bishops' conference and of the Episcopal Conference of West Africa.  Archbishop under dictatorship of S√©kou Tour√©  Sarah served as archbishop under the dictatorship of Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©, who put Sarah on a death-list before S√©kou Tour√© died in 1984. However, despite the persecutions of priests and laymen, Sarah worked to maintain the Church as the one institution that was independent of the dictatorship. In his book God or Nothing, Sarah rebuked the Marxist dictatorship as a utopian scheme that brought misery and death. The French magazine Le Figaro reports that Sarah \\"did not hesitate to oppose the all-powerful S√©kou Tour√©, then 'supreme leader of the revolution' but also a commander of violent repressions. He made the celebrated public statement: 'the power uses the man!'\\" The Historical Dictionary of Guinea commented on Sarah's role in resisting S√©kou Tour√©'s dictatorship, writing that the Church \\"managed to play a remarkable role under former Archbishop Robert Sarah in Guinea's public life... Monsignor Robert Sarah is one of the most respected leaders among Guineans, who expressed their strong desire to see him lead the country's political transition on various occasions between 2006 and 2010. He arguably earned much of this popular trust by speaking truth to power during the stormiest years of president Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©'s regime, while other spiritual leaders endeavored to cater to the regime.\\" Cardinalate On 20 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI made him Cardinal-Deacon of San Giovanni Bosco in via Tuscolana. He has the right to vote in papal conclaves until his 80th birthday. He was a cardinal elector in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis. He was mentioned in the press as a possible candidate for the papacy, papabile, both in 2013 and in future conclaves. Roman Curia On 1 October 2001, John Paul II named him secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, a post he held for ten years. He used the occasion of his departure from Guinea, when he was awarded the country's highest honor, to condemn the government of Lansana Cont√©. He said that Guinean society was \\"built on the oppression of the insignificant by the powerful, on contempt for the poor and the weak, on the cleverness of poor stewards of the public good, on the bribery and corruption of the administration and the institutions of the republic\\". In October 2010 he was appointed president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, which carries responsibility for organising Catholic relief efforts worldwide. He was the second African appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to lead a Vatican dicastery. The first was Peter Cardinal Turkson of Ghana who was appointed president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace in 2009. On 23 November 2014, Pope Francis appointed Sarah as Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. On 21 January 2016, Sarah announced that participation in the Holy Thursday foot-washing rite (the mandatum) was no longer limited to men, following instructions from Pope Francis who had included women since the beginning of his papacy. However, in March, Sarah said that there was no obligation to include women in the ceremony. Liturgy On 27 May 2015 (the memorial of Saint Augustine of Canterbury), while Cardinal Sarah was serving as Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Divine Worship: The Missal, \\"a legitimate adaptation of the Roman Rite, drawn up in the English Language,\\"Divine Worship: The Missal, p.5 a new form of the Catholic Mass using the traditional language of the Book of Common Prayer, was promulgated over his signature. Late in May 2016, Cardinal Sarah told an interviewer that the Second Vatican Council did not require priests to celebrate Mass versus populum, that is, facing the congregation. This way of celebrating Mass, he said, was \\"a possibility, but not an obligation\\". Readers and listeners should face each other during the Liturgy of the Word, he said. \\"But as soon as we reach the moment when one addresses God ‚Äì from the Offertory onwards ‚Äì it is essential that the priest and faithful look together towards the east. This corresponds exactly to what the Council Fathers wanted.\\" Cardinal Sarah rejected the argument that priests celebrating Mass facing the apse, or ad orientem, are turning their backs on the faithful or \\"against them\\". Speaking at a London conference on 5 July 2016, Cardinal Sarah asked all bishops and priests to begin celebrating the Mass ad orientem \\"wherever possible\\", \\"perhaps\\" by 27 November 2016, the start of Advent. He encouraged all Roman rite Catholics to receive Communion kneeling and said that Pope Francis had asked him to \\"continue the liturgical work Pope Benedict began\\". Sarah then met privately with Pope Francis and on 11 July the Holy See Press Office issued a statement that said that Sarah's London remarks had been \\"incorrectly interpreted, as if they were intended to announce new indications different to those given so far in the liturgical rules and in the words of the Pope regarding celebration facing the people and the ordinary rite of the Mass\\", that celebrating Mass facing the congregation (versus populum) was \\"desirable wherever possible\\" and not to be superseded by ad orientem. It reported that the Pope and the Cardinal were in complete agreement on these points. He once wrote: \\"I refuse to waste our time pitting one liturgy against another or the rite of Saint Pius V against that of Blessed Paul VI.\\" In July 2017, he wrote in the French magazine La Nef that he wanted the two forms of the Roman-Rite liturgy whose use is authorized by the 2007 papal document Summorum Pontificum to have the same calendar of feasts and the same Scripture readings, but that the work of a committee formed for that purpose had been unsuccessful. He still proposed that the newer form should restore certain practices that had been abandoned: that the faithful receive communion only on the tongue and while kneeling, that the prayers at the foot of the altar be included in the Mass, and that from the consecration of the host to the ablutions at the end of Mass the priest should keep thumb and index finger of each hand joined. In the older form, in which use of the vernacular language in the Scripture readings instead of Latin has only been made optional, he wished that the Scripture readings should be understood by the people. Earlier that year, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi criticised the expression \\"reform of the reform\\", which Sarah had used in the previous year; in his La Nef article Sarah said that the expression was best avoided and that he preferred to speak of \\"liturgical reconciliation\\". On a related note, on 24 August 2017, Pope Francis insisted that the liturgical reforms following the Second Vatican Council were \\"irreversible\\". Some perceived this as having part of a declaration invoked in his \\"magisterial authority\\". In September 2017, Pope Francis transferred primary responsibility \\"to faithfully prepare ‚Ä¶ approve and publish\\" translations of liturgical books into vernacular languages from the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments to conferences of bishops, ordering the congregation to \\"help the Episcopal Conferences to fulfil their task.\\" An explanatory note, attributed to Cardinal Sarah, soon appeared, specifying that the congregation's approval would not be a mere formality but would involve a detailed review that could lead to binding rejections of unsatisfactory translations. On 22 October 2017, the Holy See released a letter that Pope Francis had sent to Cardinal Sarah, clarifying that the Holy See and its departments would have only limited authority to confirm liturgical translations recognized by a local episcopal conference. Islam Sarah grew up and began studying for the priesthood in countries with Islamic majorities. He was impressed by the depth of Islamic religious observance in Guinea and has praised relations between Christians and Muslims there ‚Äì \\"the Islam in my country is a fraternal, peaceful religion\\". He has condemned military intervention by Western powers in Iraq and Syria, which has resulted in the near extermination of Christian communities: \\"I say emphatically that some Western powers will have perpetrated, directly or symbolically, a crime against humanity.\\" He believes that there is little possibility of theological dialogue between Christians and Muslims given their essential differences (the Trinity, the Resurrection, the Eucharist), but anticipates collaboration at the national or international level on resistance to abortion, euthanasia, and \\"the new gender ideology\\". Sarah has criticized the \\"pseudo-family of ideologized Islam which legitimizes polygamy, female subservience, sexual slavery, child marriage.\\" Views on homosexuality Sarah has opposed various attempts to provide legal recognition to gays and lesbians, often casting his remarks in terms of a defense of traditional Catholic and African values against contemporary secular Western culture. On 28 January 2012, the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, called on African nations to repeal laws that place sanctions on homosexual conduct. Sarah called the speech \\"stupid\\". When a journalist asked if Ban Ki-moon was \\"overstepping his responsibilities\\", Sarah replied: \\"Sure, you cannot impose something stupid like that. Poor countries like Africa just accept it because it's imposed upon them through money, through being tied to aid.\\" He said that, \\"It's not possible to impose on the poor this kind of European mentality,\\" and added that African bishops must react to this move against African culture. In an interview in September 2015, Sarah described same-sex unions as \\"retrogressive for culture and civilisation\\" and a problem for all of humanity. He said that despite the fact that such unions were increasingly recognized in Europe, they were not approved of in Africa. He blamed \\"Western ideological colonialism\\" for promoting the idea of gay marriage, which he warned would \\"destroy Catholic doctrine\\". According to the Daily Telegraph, Sarah's \\"outspoken remarks underlined deep rifts within the Church over the Pope's softer, more compassionate attitude towards homosexuality\\". Following the first session of the Synod on the Family in October 2014, Sarah objected to press coverage of the synod's discussion: \\"what has been published by the media about homosexual unions is an attempt to push the Church [to change] her doctrine\\". He said the synod's interim report or relatio appropriately objected to international agencies and governments that condition foreign aid on \\"the introduction of regulations based on gender ideology\\", but needed to underscore objections to same-sex marriage. He suggested that advocacy on behalf of same-sex unions formed \\"part of a new ideology of evil\\". In October 2015, he played a leading role in the Synod on the Family's rejection of attempts to ensure more welcoming language toward people who are gay or divorced and remarried. Addressing the Synod on perceived threats to marriage and the family, he said, \\"We need to be inclusive and welcoming to all that is human; but what comes from the Enemy cannot and must not be assimilated. You cannot join Christ and Belial! What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th century, Western homosexual and abortion Ideologies and Islamic Fanaticism are today.\\" He said that \\"Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism\\" could be seen as \\"almost like two apocalyptic beasts\\" with demonic origins, drew parallels between them and Nazism and Communism, and noted that terrorist attacks in France and Tunisia had taken place on the same day that the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that made same-sex civil marriage legal nationwide. Johan Bonny, Bishop of Antwerp, complained that Sarah tried to silence any discussion of the pastoral care of gay Catholics in the discussion group he led at the Synod: \\"There was no way of discussing it in a peaceful way.\\" Bonny said the Belgian participants found that the growing influence of the Africans prevented the pastoral solutions they favored from getting a hearing. When Krzysztof Charamsa, a theologian who lost his position at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith when he revealed that he was in a homosexual relationship on the eve of the Synod, assessed the Synod's work, he singled out Sarah's language to challenge all the participants: \\"No one publicly said a word against those defamatory sentences. What kind of respect does that show to us all?\\" Addressing the U.S. National Catholic Prayer Breakfast on 17 May 2016, Sarah said that \\"God is being eroded, eclipsed, [and] liquidated\\" in the United States because of legal changes being adopted \\"in the name of 'tolerance'\\". He cited \\"the legalization of same-sex marriage, the obligation to accept contraception within health care programs, and even 'bathroom bills' that allow men to use the women's restrooms and locker rooms.\\" He asked: \\"Should not a biological man use the men's restroom?\\"  Opinion on sexual abuse In response to Pope Benedict XVI's \\"Notes\\" on the sexual abuse crisis in the Church, Cardinal Sarah gave a talk published in L'Espresso stating that the notes \\"proved to be a true source of light in the night of faith that touches the whole Church... The frightening multiplication of abuses has one and only one ultimate cause: the absence of God.\\" Immigration Sarah is a critic of large-scale immigration. \\"It is better to help people flourish in their culture than to encourage them to come to a Europe in full decadence,\\" he said in a March 2019 interview. \\"It is a false exegesis to use the word of God to promote migration.\\" In the same interview, Sarah argued that immigrants in Europe often survived in poor conditions and lived \\"without work or dignity.\\" Other appointments On 6 January 2011, Sarah was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the Pontifical Council for the Laity, and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. On 10 March 2015, Pope Francis appointed Sarah to serve as a member of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses. Cardinal Sarah is a member of the Dignitatis Humanae Institute.

It is based on the idea of overloading MATLAB's commands for vectors and matrices to analogous commands for functions and operators. Thus, for example, whereas the SUM command in MATLAB adds up the elements of a vector, the SUM command in Chebfun evaluates a definite integral. Similarly the backslash command in MATLAB becomes a Chebfun command for solving differential equations. The mathematical basis of Chebfun is numerical algorithms involving piecewise polynomial interpolants and Chebyshev polynomials, and this is where the name \\"Cheb\\" comes from. The package aims to combine the feel of symbolic computing systems like Maple and Mathematica with the speed of floating-point numerics. The Chebfun project is based in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford and was initiated in 2002 by Lloyd N. Trefethen and his student Zachary Battles. The most recent version, Version 5.7.0, was released on June 2, 2017. Chebfun2, a software system that extends Chebfun to two dimensions, was made publicly available on the 4th of March 2013. Following Chebfun2, Spherefun (extension to the unit sphere) and Chebfun3 (extension to three dimensions) were made publicly available in May and July 2016.

He was capable of playing as both an inside and outside forward. Born in Ferryhill, County Durham, Sheppard started his career as an amateur in County Durham, before joining Liverpool in 1926. He signed as a professional for Watford in 1927, who at the time were playing in the Football League Third Division South. In the 1927‚Äì28 season‚Äîhis first at Watford‚ÄîSheppard scored 25 goals in all competitions, finishing as the club's top scorer. After 39 goals in 95 Watford games, he joined QPR on a free transfer in 1930, and moved to Coventry City the following year. Sheppard joined Walsall in January 1933, and one of his first games for the club was an FA Cup Third Round tie against Arsenal at Fellows Park, in front of 11,150 spectators. At the time Arsenal were competing for the First Division title, which they eventually won. Walsall were in the Third Division North. Sheppard played the game at inside right. After a goalless first half, Walsall centre-forward Gilbert Alsop scored the opening goal with a header in the second half. Five minutes later Alsop won a penalty kick, which Sheppard converted to double the team's lead. Arsenal were unable to overturn the deficit; Walsall won the match 2‚Äì0. He remained at Walsall until the end of the 1933‚Äì34 season. He briefly joined Chester, but returned to Walsall in October of that year, before leaving permanently in June 1935. Season 1935‚Äì36 saw him at Tunbridge Wells Rangers in the Southern League. Sheppard died in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, during a Christmas celebration.

Both cars ultimately retired, one with mechanical issues and the other after losing control and spinning off the circuit, injuring the driver Mark Wainwright and damaging the car too seriously to continue. Gulf AMR Middle East Vantage GT2 - Petit Le Mans 2011 Upgrades and GTE Version For the 2012 season, Aston Martin Racing returned to a GT based program, after an ill-fated attempt the previous season with their LMP1 class petrol-powered contender, the AMR-One. With the Vantage GT2's specification varying slightly from the updated Le Mans GT2 (now GTE) regulations, development took place with the car relaunched as the Vantage GTE. Major upgrades Primarily, this focussed on serviceability, a major drawback on the outgoing Vantage GT2. This included creating a new modular construction implementing a series of detachable bars in the front structure, allowing the engine to be pulled straight out of the car. This now allows the engine change process to be completed in less than an hour without any effect on suspension settings, unlike the old configuration, which could take upwards of four hours. The rear suspension and subframe have also been modified to aid serviceability. To increase safety, the fuel cell has been repositioned within the roll cage to reduce the risk of damage to its structure in an accident. Secondary upgrades Other upgrades include reductions in weight throughout, including weight reductions for many individual components such as the battery.Chris Pickering, [\\"Aston Bids for GT Advantage\\"], Race Tech, April 2012 Improvements also included a new CFD- derived front-bumper, side skirt and rear wing - the latter an evolution of the Le Mans aero package which the Automobile Club de l'Ouest allowed the Aston Martin Racing team to run on the car for the entire season - \\"Aston Martin Vantage: The rear wing used at Le Mans in 2011 will be used during all the 2012 season with a 15 mm gurney and at Le Mans 2012 without gurney\\".[\\"LM GTE Pro\\"], Endurance Committee Modifications also improved cooling for the driver, a significant concern on the old model, which plagued Drayson- Barwell's 2008 ALMS season.[\\"Licence to Le Mans\\"], Greenlight TV World Endurance Championship ReferencesExternal links * Aston Martin Racing V8 Vantage GT2 Category:Coup√©s Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:2010s cars Category:Cars introduced in 2008 Category:Grand tourer racing cars ","title":"Aston Martin Vantage GT2"},{"id":"29095362","text":"The British Osteopathic Association (BOA) was an independent organisation representing osteopaths.

Dating from 1695, it is the oldest church still standing in Jakarta. History Lithograph of the Zion Church (1883-1889) Lithograph of the interior of Zion Church Interior and Pipe organ of Zion church in the year 1950 The church was formerly known as De Nieuwe Portugeesche Buitenkerk (\\"The New Portuguese Outer Church\\"), referring to its position on the outside of the city wall, as opposed to Portugeesche Binnenkerk, \\"the Portuguese Inner Church\\"). The church was also known as Belkita during the period. The church was built outside the old city walls for the so-called \\"black Portuguese\\" - the Eurasians and natives captured from Portuguese trading posts in India and Malaya and brought to Jakarta (then Batavia) as slaves. Most of these people were Catholics, but were given their freedom on the condition that they joined the Dutch Reformed Church, and the converts were known as Mardijker or the liberated ones. The construction of the church was started in 1693. It was officially opened on Sunday, October 23, 1695, and was jointly financed by the Portuguese and the VOC Government. The first sermon was delivered by Reverend Theodorus Zas and was attended by Governor-General Willem van Outhoorn. Later, the church name changed into \\"Portuguese Church\\". During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in 1942, the name \\"Portuguese Church\\" was forbidden and the church was closed for two years. The Japanese army wished to transform the place into a columbarium for the fallen soldiers. During the governmental transition, the Dutch government transferred the ownership of the church to the Protestant Church in Western Indonesia (Gereja Protestan di Indonesia bagian Barat) or GPIB. During the 1957 GPIB Sinode Conference, the Portuguese Church changed its name into GPIB Congregation of Zion (GPIB Jemaat Sion), and since then, the church is known as Zion Church. The church was restored in 1920 and 1978. The building is protected through the Law SK Gubernur DKI Jakarta CB/11/1/12/1972 In 1984, the churchyard was reduced for road construction. Building Tomb of Governor General Hendric Zwaardecroon in the old graveyard. Sion Church measures 24 by 32 meters and is situated on 6,725 square meters of land. An extension was built on the back facade, measuring 6 by 18 meters. It was built above a foundation of 10,000 logs. The construction is designed by E. Ewout Verhagen from Rotterdam. The wall is constructed from bricks glued by a mix of sand and heatproof sugar. Church interior. Sion Church is characteristically Dutch with its plain facade, ward-like appearance and domed windows. The church contains copper chandeliers, a baroque-style ebony pulpit, and the original organ. The furnishings were made by craftsmen from Formosa (Taiwan). The pipe organ was donated by the daughter of Reverend John Maurits Moor. 2,381 people were buried in the graveyard during 1790 alone, however, few tombs remain. The ornate bronze tombstone of Governor- General Hendrick Zwaardecroon who died in 1728 was buried, as was his wish, among \\"ordinary\\" people.

Agresta's only known surviving works are unaccompanied madrigals, including a complete book of six-voice pieces.  Biography  Incredibly little is known about the life and career of Agresta, including neither the circumstances of his birth or death. Apart from his works (discussed below), there are only two contemporary or near-contemporary references to him. He and his elder brother Giovanni Antonio are listed together in the third book of Scipione Cerreto's 1601 Della prattica musicale as excellent composers operating in Naples ('Compositori eccellenti della Citt√† di Napoli, che oggi vivono'); however, no works by Giovanni Antonio survive. And a 1664 work by the Neapolitan scholar Camillo Tutini lists him as a madrigalist in a section devoted to promoting the cultural claims of Naples against Rome.Larson 1985: 916‚Äì919  Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo (1617)  Agresta's only surviving book of madrigals, Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo, was published in Naples in 1617 by Costantino Vitale, and dedicated to Don Roderico di Salazar. Salazar had been commissioner of contraband in the provinces of Terra di Bari and Capitanata (today the province of Foggia) but was prosecuted in 1607 for extortion and corruption (Larson 1985: 758); his status in 1617 is unknown. Agresta's relationship to him is similarly unclear, although Larson has speculatedLarson 1985: 758 that the composer may have been employed by Salazar as a tutor for his children, in a similar capacity to that of his brother in the household of the Count of Roccella (the records of the Banco Mari, which are contained in the Archivio di Stato in Naples, list a payment made to Giovanni Antonio Agresta on 18 March 1598). While composers in the northern Italian peninsula were beginning to move away from what was regarded as the old-fashioned polyphonic madrigal without continuo, Naples remained the most important centre for its composition and publication. In this context, Agresta's Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo occupies an important position, as during the first 30 years of the 17th century only two books of six-part unaccompanied madrigals were published in Naples: Agresta's and Gesualdo's posthumous collection of 1626 (of which only the Quinto part-book survives). While it is impossible to speculate with any accuracy on the basis of such scant evidence, Larson suggests that Agresta's madrigals may reveal something of the style of Gesualdo's incomplete book.Larson 2001 Watkins labels Agresta a minor figure among those Neapolitan composers who were influenced by Gesualdo, but suggests that posterity's opinion of him (and others) might well be different if more of his works had survived.Watkins 1991: 227‚Äì228 Larson goes further and declares that Agresta 'occasionally surpassed (Gesualdo) in the degree of slow chromatic durezze e ligature and diatonic, scalar points of imitation in quavers and semiquavers', claiming that 'the latter are usually longer and more lively and intricate than Gesualdo's'.Larson 2001  Agresta's other madrigals  Apart from the Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo, three other madrigals identified as being by Agresta survive, all for five voices: * 'Io mi sento morir', in Giovanni Vincenzo Macedonio di Mutio's Il secondo libro de madrigali a cinque voci, published in Naples in 1606 by Giovanni Giacomo Carlino. An incomplete and damaged set of part-books exists in the library of the Conservatorio di Musica San Pietro a Majella in Naples (missing Quinto, incomplete Soprano). * 'Caro dolce ben mio', in Giardino novo bellissimo di varii fiori musicali scieltissimi il secondo libro de madrigali a cinque voci raccolti per Melchior Borchgrevinck organista del serenissimo re di Danemarcka, published in Copenhagen in 1606 by Heinrich Waltkirch (RISM 16065), which survives complete in the British Library, London, and incomplete (Soprano and Alto part-books only) in the Landesbibliothek Kassel. (This madrigal has previously been edited and published in Glahn et al. 1983Glahn et al. 1983.) * 'Io ard'e moro, Donna', in Teatro de madrigali a cinque voci. De diversi eccellentiss. musici napolitani (RISM 160916), published in Naples in 1609 by Giovanni Battista Gargano and Lucretio Nucci. The only surviving copy of this is in the Landesbibliothek Kassel, with an incomplete Quinto part. The inclusion of a piece by Agresta in the Borchgrevinck collection of 1606 raises many questions. Melchior Borchgrevinck was court organist to King Christian IV of Denmark, and in 1599 led a party of Danish musicians to Venice to study with Giovanni Gabrieli, returning there in the winter of 1601‚Äì2. He was greatly respected by his contemporaries, being praised by Orazio Vecchi in the dedication to Christian IV of Le veglie di Siena (1604), who also added that Gabrieli considered Borchgrevinck 'one of the most outstanding musicians of our time'.Lewis 2005: 372 The two volumes of Giardino novo (the first appeared in 1605, dedicated to Christian IV) included madrigals by some of the most popular Italian composers of the day, including Claudio Monteverdi, Benedetto Pallavicino and Giaches de Wert, as well as Borchgrevinck and other Danish composers. However, there are a number of works by composers who may not unfairly be deemed minor figures, including Giovanni Paolo Nodari, Curtio Valcampi and Grisostomo Rubiconi, and which Lewis suggests may not previously have been printed.Lewis 2005: 373 Apart from 'Caro dolce ben mio', all Agresta's works were published in Naples, and there is no record of him ever having worked or travelled away from Naples, thus seemingly making him very much a southern Italian composer. How then did his works find their way north to Venice, and why was he considered a composer of sufficient stature to be included in a volume of works dedicated, in a politically charged, to King James I of England?Lewis 2000: 10 While it was not unusual for Neapolitan composers to have their works printed in Venice (see Larson 1985: 873‚Äì882Larson 1985: 873‚Äì882 for a list of such works), the absence of any other evidence that links Agresta to Venice makes it hard to gauge his status and reputation during his lifetime. There are two other references to Agresta which appear not to have been noted by other authors. In Schofield and Dart's article describing the contents of the British Library manuscript now known as Egerton MS 3665, believed to have been compiled by Francis Tregian (son of the more famous Catholic exile of the same name), Agresta is listed among the composer represented in the selection of over 700 Italian madrigals included in the manuscript; it is implied in the article, although not clearly, that Agresta's contribution comes from his Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo.Schofield and Dart 1951: 213‚Äì214 In the mid-1990s Alfred Noe completed a comprehensive study of the contents of the library of Albert Fugger (of the famous Augsburg banking family), which was purchased by Mathias Mauchter in 1655 for Emperor Ferdinand III and now forms part of the √ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna. In the catalogue made by Mauchter at the time of purchase, there is an entry on the last page of the music section which reads 'Il Primo lib.¬∞ de Madrigali a 5. di Agostino Agresta'.Noe 1994: 650 No collection of five-part madrigals by Agresta survives, nor any reference to one elsewhere. However, Noe identifies this volume as Agresta's 1617 Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primoNoe 1997: 617 from its contents, regarding the 'a 5' as a copyist's mistake.  Sources  Two complete copies of Agresta's Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo survive, one in the Collection 'G. Thibault' of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris, the other in the library of the Conservatorio di Musica San Pietro a Majella in Naples; both are in good condition, and each is identical to the other. The print is on the large part free from errors.  The contents of Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo  Keith Larson has dealt extensively with the contents of Agresta's Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo;Larson 1985: 757‚Äì764 here are some extra details to his analysis. Numbers 1 to 8 are written in an 'ordinary' clef combination (Canto and Sesto in C1 clef, Alto in C3 clef, Tenore and Quinto in C4, and Basso in F4), while numbers 9 to 15 are written in 'high' clefs (Canto and Sesto in G2, Alto in C2, Tenore and Quinto in C3, and Basso in F3 ‚Äì commonly known as chiavette), suggesting downwards transposition. If one follows Adriano Banchieri's suggestion in his 1614 Cartella musicale of transposing pieces written in chiavette down by a perfect 4th when the printed key signature contains one flat and by a perfect 5th when it contains no flats, the transposed ranges of the individual voice parts of numbers 9 to 15 all become rather lower than the ranges of numbers 1 to 8. Depending on the singers involved in a performance, a downwards transposition of either a tone or a minor 3rd for numbers 9 to 15 is suggested. The last piece in the collection, 'Io penso e nel pensar' is unusual in many ways. The anonymous poem is a dense play on the words 'penso' ('I think'), 'pensar' ('to think') and 'pensier' ('thought'); most striking is its use of frequently changing time signatures, which are different in each part, including such proportions as 1:10, 14:6, 6:5 and 3:7. Larson describes it as 'an intellectual challenge to virtuoso singers',Larson 2001 while Watkins suggests that its 'novel and highly mannered proportional complexities ... while appearing theoretical as well as anachronistic, may well be an attempt by the composer to suggest expressive tempo variability'.Watkins 1991: 228  The texts  The choice of poetry comprises both old and new authors, and the majority of the texts are also set by many other composers. These include four by Giambattista Marino, four by Petrarch and two by Giovanni Battista Guarini (plus one other, number 7, which is attributed to Guarini); there are four anonymous poems. Numbers 6, 8 and 13 are the only settings of their poems recorded in Il nuovo Vogel, while the text of number 15 (discussed above) is set elsewhere only by Francesco Mazza, in his own first book of six-part madrigals published in Venice in 1590. (A slightly different version of the poem was set by J√©han Gero in the collection published by Costanzo Festa in 1541 and subsequently in Gero's own collection of 1543.)

Life Joachim L√ºtkemann was the son of Samuel L√ºtkemann, an apothecary from Demmin who had become mayor, and his wife Katharina, n√©e Zander. After attending school in Demmin, he went to university in Greifswald in 1624, then in 1626 to the Marienstiftsgymnasium in Stettin. From 1629‚Äì1634he then studied philosophy and theology at the University of Strasbourg, where he was especially influenced by the teachings of Johann Conrad Dannhauer and Johann Schmidt, and later by those of Philipp Jakob Spener. After a study-trip to France and Italy, he joined the University of Rostock in November 1637,See entry of Joachim L√ºtkemann in Rostock Matrikelportal graduating from it in 1638 as a magister legens. In 1639 he became a deacon in the Jakobikirche in Rostock and later that year was elected to replace the lately-deceased Zacharias Deutsch as archdeacon, also marrying Deutsch's widow Dorothea. In 1643 he became the Professor of Metaphysics and Physics in the University of Rostock. In 1646 he disputed on De viribus naturae et gratiae at the University of Greifswald pro licentia. From November 1646 he taught theology classes in Rostock and was chosen as the university's rector. In 1648 in Greifswald he was promoted De baptismo to Doctor of Theology. In 1649 L√ºtkemann presented his thesis that during his three days in the tomb (tempore mortis) Jesus Christ was not truly human, since there was the soul had left the body and so there was not the human connection between the soul and body that there had been in life. L√ºtkemann's true intention was to say that the death of the son of God was real, but this led to a controversy with the Rostock theologian Johann Cothmann. L√ºtkemann was then denounced as a heretic and dismissed by Adolf Frederick I, Duke of Mecklenburg. L√ºtkemann asked for the suspension to be lifted but this was conditional on signing a recantation, which L√ºtkemann was unwilling to do, so he left the country. L√ºtkemann then followed the court of Augustus the Younger, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, where he became court-preacher and Generalsuperintendent. There, in 1651, he set up a new education policy introducing compulsory schooling. From 1650 to 1653 he led a general visitation. In 1653 he was made abbot of Riddagshausen Abbey. Family In 1639 Joachim L√ºtkemann married Dorothea von Levetzow (1612‚Äì1666), the widow of Zacharias Deutsch. They had twelve children, of which five died in infancy. In 1734 his great-nephew Timotheus L√ºtkemann became Generalsuperintendent in Greifswald.  Works  His literary work was very prolific and, though his writings on philosophical and dogmatic themes were of little importance, they influenced the devotional writers Heinrich M√ºller, Christian Scriver and Theophil Gro√ügebauer. *Der Vorschmack g√∂ttlicher G√ºte. 1653, 1673. - His first work, whose title translates as Foretaste of divine goodness. It became one of the most popular devotional works in Lutheranism. L√ºtkemann's approach in that work was mystical spiritualism, though he also tried to distance himself from that approach at the same time, describing the necessary connection between inner faith and outer words. It was influenced by Johann Arndt's work Vier B√ºcher vom wahren Christentum and was highly esteemed by Philipp Jacob Spener, who made it compulsory reading in his first collegia pietatis. *Regenten Predigt (von der h√∂chsten Tugend hoher Obrigkeit, √ºber Psalm 37 V. 34). 1655. - A sermon first pronounced in September 1655, in which he criticised contemporary rulers' notions of absolutism and contrasted them with the notions of piety. *Harpffe von zehen Seyten, Das ist: Gr√ºndliche Erkl√§rung Zehen Psalmen Davids. 1658. - A work on the Psalms of David.

It published three issues in 1972. The publication was historically significant in that it brought together the work of many noteworthy underground artists and writers.  Publication history J. David Moriaty conceived of The Rip Off Review of Western Culture in 1971, desiring to publish a real magazine with writing, photographs, and comics. Moriaty asked Robert Follett to serve as the magazine's editorial director, a job which entailed contributing interviews and editing the magazine. Dave Sheridan, already a well-known cartoonist and underground comic artist, was given the title of art editor. Follett and a couple of others managed to publish first issue of The Rip Off Review of Western Culture in June 1972. A magazine and comic book mix, the artists, writers, and photographers contributed many different styles and stories to the magazine. The magazine was distributed through various underground outlets, with a limited amount of money. Ramsey Wiggins stepped in as the managing editor on the second issue and was asked to write a column and a few of the editorials.  Issues = #1 (June/July 1972)  *Editor and Publisher: J.

It was the most difficult cover to print, which required large areas of solid black ink. J. David Moriaty had worked hard with the staff to save this difficult run. After many long days, he managed to print the covers without too many defects to the magazine. This saved the first issue, due to the lack of money Rip Off Press had in their budget. The artist Monjett Graham originally from Nebraska, wrote a regular column on culture for The Sun Reporter, an African-American newspaper, located in San Francisco.Sun Reporter Newspaper Retrieved 14 Jan 2011 This was about the time he was approached by the Rip Off Review of Western Culture staff and asked if he would contribute to the magazine. Graham contributed two pieces of artwork to the first issue. The first one, called Urban Mood, appears on page 15. This piece was created with woodcuts and pencil.

The first performance was in Paris at the th√©√¢tre de la Huchette in October 1955, directed by Robert Postec and with Pierre Leproux, Pierre Chevallier, Tsilla Chelton, Maria Murano.  Characters  * Le Gros Monsieur, the fat gentleman * Alice, his sister * Le Peintre, the painter * La Voisine, the neighbor  Plot  Le Gros Monsieur, aka the fat gentleman, is an irresistible, shrewd businessman. Le Peintre, aka The Painter, wants to sell him his painting. Initially, he wants 500,000 francs for it but in the end, the fat gentleman so savagely criticizes the painting, when he finally looks at it, that the Le Peintre agrees to pay the fat gentleman to store his painting. Alice, an old, ugly, and ill woman, is asked by her brother to lend him a hand. After the painter leaves, the brother-sister relationship is reversed and the meek creature becomes authoritarian and demanding, threatening her brother with her walking-stick. The fat gentleman obeys her but, when she is not looking, he grabs a gun and shoots. A miracle happens: Alice transforms into a beautiful maid. The old and ugly neighbor comes in, and she becomes beautiful too. The painter then comes back and turns into Prince Charming. The fat gentleman is the only one who remains fat and ugly, so he asks the audience to shoot him.  Analysis  The play is subheaded Guignolade, that is a Guignol play, and Eug√®ne Ionesco insists that it be played by Clowns in the most excessive, idiotic way. The characters shall not have any psychological depth, and the social content is merely accidental. According to the playwright, only extreme childish simplification can reveal the meaning of this farce, and it can become plausible when it is most improbable and idiotic. Idiocy can be such a revealing simplification for Ionesco. The author's emphasis on the word \\"idiocy\\" is rather puzzling, but the contrast between ths aesthetic and the utilitarian in the play is noteworthy, and as a classical theme, it seems to guarantee this humble play's lasting relevance.

It was formed as a Telangana separatist organisation, demanding statehood for the Telangana region that was then a part of Andhra Pradesh. TPF was launched on 9 October 2010 with Gaddar as president. He was specific in saying that it was not a political party but rather intended to be an umbrella body for uniting various action committees that had become somewhat moribund in the preceding months. He did not, however, rule out the possibility of contesting elections at some future time, although some TPF supporters, who were mostly students, said that they would withdraw if it did in fact become a party. The aim at foundation was to get a bill for a separate Telangana state introduced into parliament. Gaddar said that the creation of the new state could only happen through \\"people's movements and agitations\\". Gaddar resigned as president in May 2012, still insisting that a separate state could not be achieved through electoral means. He was replaced by Akula Bhoomaiah, who subsequently died in what has been alleged to be a political murder.

Ragnall occurs in Old Irish, and Middle Irish/Middle Gaelic. It is a Gaelicised form of the Old Norse R√∏gnvaldr, R«´gnvaldr, R√∂gnvaldr. This Old Norse name is composed of two elements: regin, meaning \\"advice\\", \\"decision\\"; and valr, meaning \\"ruler\\". It has also been suggested that Ragnall could also represent the Old Norse Ragnarr as well. Ragnall can be Anglicised as Ranald, and Latinised as Reginald, Reginaldus. The modern spelling is Raghnall in Scottish Gaelic and either Raghnall or Raonull in Irish. Anglicised forms of Raghnall include: Ranald, Randal, Rannal, and Ronald. Note that while Randal is commonly used as an Anglicised form of the Gaelic name, it is etymologically unrelated. The final -ll sound of the Gaelic names are de-vocalized, and to non-Gaelic-speakers this suggests -d sound. In this way the name is similar to the various forms of the Gaelic Domhnall, which can be Anglicised as Donald.

He led the Department of Ecology and Marine Biology at the Saline Water Conversion Corporation Research and Development Centre, Saudi Arabia as chairman during 1993‚Äì2002. He was a Professor at Kerala University and Kerala Agricultural University before becoming Vice- Chancellor of the Cochin University of Science and Technology. He was the Vice-Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University from 11 June 2007, to 17 January 2012. During his term he initiated a \\"crackdown\\" against squatters and put into place ID cards for all students. The university also signed MoUs with Wisconsin University, Cleveland University, Atlanta University, Johns Hopkins University and New York University and began clearing a backlog of PhD submissions. India Today cited his efforts as leading to a \\"remarkable turnaround\\" for the university.  Vice-Chancellorship  Prof Azis first served as the Vice Chancellor of Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) from 2004 - 2007. During his tenure, he initiated an ambitious plan to upgrade CUSAT to the status of IIEST (Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology), but the project could not materialise due to a lack of understanding with the successive state governments and eventually, had to be shelved. Prof. Azis then served as the Vice Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) from 2007 - 2012.

During his tenure as VC of AMU, Prof Azis courted controversy, and was under the CBI scanner for alleged financial impropriety related to 'travel concession for family, income tax payment from University funds and purchase of luxury cars\\". He was later cleared of all charges by the CBI with submission of its closure report at the Patiala House Court. Abdul Aziz's departure was cited by India Today as evidence of the \\"waning influence\\" of the \\"Malayali lobby\\" in Delhi.

This support comes in the form of a qualified maternity nurse or health care professional, kraamverzorgster, who comes to the home in order to provide care and instruction for the newborn. Kraamzorg care is included in standard health insurance packages in the Netherlands; though, depending on specific policy, a small contribution for each hour of care is expected. Responsibilities The primary responsibility of the kraamverzorgster is to ensure that the mother's recovery is quick and efficient, and that the baby develops appropriately. Tasks usually adopted by the kraamverzorgster include, but are not limited to: flagging any issues that may arise between the new mother and midwife or doctor, ensuring the area in which the mother and the baby are in is clean and hygienic, ensuring that the mother is healing well after the birth, supporting the mother with feeding issues (whether this be breast or bottle feeding).Expat Arrivals, Having a Baby in the Netherlands, Sept 2010 It typically lasts eight days after coming home from hospital, or twice that for special cases such as multiple births. Historically, professional monthly nurses served a similar function in the UK. Interaction with the kraamzorg organisation of choice begins in the thirty- fourth week of pregnancy. At this point, a chosen representative will visit the home and discuss what type of support is available depending on whether the mother is planning a home or hospital birth. The hours of care each mother is entitled to vary, and can even change after birth. There are three levels of care: basic, minimal, and flexible, that translate into a specific number of daily hours of service depending the mother and the family's personal situation. Factors that can affect which level of care a mother is entitled to include: number of children already in the family, an unstable home situation, problems with breastfeeding, and illness in the family. The kraamzorg organisation provides a list of items that should be in the home in order to prepare for the arrival of the child, and the company issues a file where mothers can track the day-to-day progress of their babies, as well as their own recovery. Families and mothers are encouraged to ask as many questions as possible in preparation for their first meeting with a representative from the kraamzorg organisation. A similar service, Kraamzorg UK, was launched in Manchester in 2013.

Early life Edgecombe was born on 22 October 1932 in St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda, the youngest of eight children. He often accompanied his father on his schooner running gasoline from Trinidad to Antigua. In 1942, his father took United States citizenship and disappeared. The young Edgecombe worked his passage aboard a British ship carrying sugar to Liverpool. From there he moved to Cardiff, where he stayed for some years, lodging at a mission for seamen. Searching for his missing father, he hid on a ship bound for Texas, but on arrival was arrested and put back on board for the return trip. When he docked in Britain, magistrates jailed him for 28 days as a stowaway. After leaving prison, he made his way to London, where he became involved in petty crime, serving three months for an attempted jewel theft. He ran a drinking and drugs den in premises rented from Peter Rachman, and reportedly acted as a pimp to his girlfriend. Profumo scandal It was in this \\"shebeen\\" that he first encountered Lucky Gordon, who threatened to tip off the police about the drinking den. Edgecombe closed it down, and moved into the jazz scene, driving musicians to gigs, and dealing small quantities of cannabis. In September 1962, he met a nightclub hostess, Christine Keeler, and moved into her flat in Sheffield Terrace. Keeler was involved with several men, and it was this web of relationships and jealousy that triggered the events that led to what became known as the Profumo affair. Keeler told Edgecombe that \\"Lucky\\" Gordon had assaulted her and held her captive after she ended their relationship. Edgecombe confronted Gordon with a knife in the Flamingo Club on 27 October 1962, and Gordon required 17 stitches in the face. Edgecombe asked Keeler to help him find a solicitor before surrendering to the police, but she refused and said that she would give evidence against him. On 14 December, Edgecombe took a taxi to the Marylebone flat of osteopath Stephen Ward, where Keeler was in hiding. When she refused to come out, he fired several shots at the door. His subsequent arrest set in motion the unravelling of Keeler's relationship with Secretary of State for War John Profumo and Russian naval attach√© Yevgeny Ivanov, with Keeler's non- appearance at his trial at the Old Bailey in March 1963 finally giving the British press the excuse it needed to publish the story.Martin, Douglas. \\"Johnny Edgecombe, British Scandal Figure, Dies at 77\\", The New York Times, 9 October 2010.

Obituary: Johnny Edgecombe, The Guardian, 30 September 2010 He served five years. On his release Edgecombe became a jazz promoter, running a club called Edges, and worked as a film and television extra. In 1987 he made an extended appearance on an edition of the live television discussion programme After Dark alongside Tony Blackburn, Peter Tatchell, Victoria Gillick and others.

He was born in Trondhjem as a son of telegrapher Edward Diesen (1852‚Äì1909) and Johanne Christophine Stenersen (1855‚Äì1936). He was a first cousin of Emil Diesen and Andreas Melchior Seip Diesen, and a first cousin once removed of Andreas‚Äôs son Ernst Diesen. He was a naval officer from 1903, graduated from the Norwegian Naval Academy in 1905 and was promoted to Premier Lieutenant in 1906. He worked in the merchant fleet from 1906 to 1908 and 1909 to 1911. From 1912 to 1913, he studied at the Berlin Institute of Technology. He served in the neutral Royal Norwegian Navy during World War I, and was promoted to Captain in 1917. His last service on a ship was as second-in- command of HNoMS Tordenskjold in 1929. He lived in Borre near Karljohansvern. Here he edited the newspaper Hortens Avis from 1919 to 1920 and was a member of the executive committee of Borre municipal council from 1920 to 1923.

It was established in 2008 by the Bilim ve Sanat Vakfƒ± (BiSaV or BSV, ). The university started its education in the academic year of 2010‚Äì11 at its campus in Altunizade, √úsk√ºdar, following a ceremony held on October 5, 2010 that was attended by then State President Abdullah G√ºl, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmet Davutoƒülu. The university was closed down on June 30, 2020, after it faced financial difficulties stemming from a legal land dispute, which in turn was fueled by a bitter political feud. Organization The university had, as of (2016), six faculties, three graduate institutes, a vocational high school, four research centers, and a language school, organized as follows: *College of Humanities and Social Sciences **Political Science and International Relations (in English) **Political Science and International Relations (in Turkish) **Sociology (in English) **Psychology (in English) **Psychology (in Turkish) **History (in English) **Turkish Language and Literature (mainly in Turkish, but few courses are in English) **Philosophy (in English) *College of Engineering and Natural Sciences **Computer Science & Engineering (in English) ***CS Faculty Members **Electrical Engineering (in English) **Industrial Engineering (in English) **Industrial Engineering (in Turkish) *School of Management and Administrative Sciences **Management (in English) **International Trade and Management (in English) **Entrepreneurship (in Turkish) **Management Information Systems (in Turkish) **Economics (in English) *College of Communications **Cinema and Television (in English) **Cinema and Television (in Turkish) **Public Relations (in Turkish) *School of Law (mainly in Turkish, but few courses are in English) *School of Islamic Studies (in Turkish, English, and Arabic) *Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences **Cultural Studies (in English) **Political Science and International Relations (in English) **Modern Turkish Studies (in English) **History (in English) **Sociology (in English) **Public Law (in Turkish) **Private Law (in Turkish) **Clinical Psychology (in Turkish) **Urban Studies (in Turkish) **Cinema and Television (in Turkish) *Graduate School of Business **Business Non-Thesis Graduate Program (in Turkish) **Executive MBA (in Turkish) **Executive MBA (in English) *Graduate School of Natural and Applied Sciences **Electronics and Computer Engineering (in English) **Industrial and Systems Engineering (in English) **Cybersecurity Engineering (in Turkish) **Data Science (in English) *Vocational High School (all in Turkish) **School of Justice **Computer Programming **Child Development **Photography and Videography **Graphic Design *Research Centers ** Center for Urban Studies ** Center for Higher Education Studies ** Center for Modern Turkish Studies ** Technology Transfer Office *School of Languages **Sehir English Preparatory Program (SEPP) **Turkish for International Students **the School offers also language courses in: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Greek, Latin, Persian, Russian, Spanish, (Ottoman) Turkish, ... Campus Istanbul ≈ûehir University had three campuses, West Campus, East Campus, and South Campus, all of which were located in Altunizade, √úsk√ºdar. Later, during the academic year 2017‚Äì18, Istanbul ≈ûehir University moved to its main campus in Dragos, Kartal, where construction was long delayed due to environmental concerns. Financial crisis and closure In November 2019, the university faced financial trouble and was unable to pay the salaries of faculty members and the scholarships of students despite its revenue of millions of dollars. The reason was a freeze on its assets imposed by a court order, after a year-long trial, on request for an arrestment of funds by the state-owned Halkbank, which had concerns regarding the pay back of a US$70 million credit. A real estate, which belonged to the state-owned monopoly company Tekel, was transferred free of charge to the university as campus ground, and became subject of security for a credit from the Halkbank. The real estate lost its security status when the Council of State ruled at the last instance in favor of the Chamber of Architects branch of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects (TMMOB) overturning the court's decision in the case. It was claimed by university representatives that the measure was of a political rather than technical nature due to the political fallout between Erdoƒüan and Ahmet Davutoƒülu, the latter being a co-founder of the university. By mid December 2019, the Council of Higher Education (Y√ñK) ruled for a temporary handover of Istanbul ≈ûehir University to Marmara University, which was the \\"guarantor university\\" of the former. It was stated that the university was unable to continue its educational activities due to its financial situation. The operation license for education of the university was then suspended. With the Presidential decree no. 2708 issued on June 30, 2020, the official authorization of Istanbul ≈ûehir University was revoked. The Council of Higher Education (Y√ñK), after a general meeting on June 30, 2020, later announced that the students of Istanbul ≈ûehir University were to be transferred to Marmara University.

Early life Heward-Mills was born on 14 May 1963 to a Swiss mother (Elizabeth Heward-Mills) and Ghanaian father (Nathaniel Heward-Mills) in London, United Kingdom. He moved with his family soon after his birth to Accra Ghana and has spent his entire life in Ghana. He was converted to Christianity while having his secondary education at Achimota School. He joined Christian youth campaigns such as the Scripture Union as well as the Calvary Road Singers (which later became Harvest Chapel International) immediately after his conversion. He proceeded to the University of Ghana Medical School, where he was trained as a medical doctor. He started the Lighthouse Chapel International while still a student in Medical school, having felt a strong call of God to start a church. In his fifth year of medical school, Heward- Mills started the church in a little classroom in the School of Hygiene, Korle-Bu, with no more than 15 members. Amidst persecutions in various forms and with his academic work demanding time and effort, he saw this little church grow until it now filled the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital Canteen.  Lighthouse Chapel International  Dag Heward-Mills founded the Lighthouse Chapel International church in 1987. Paul Gifford, \\"Ghana's New Christianity: Pentecostalism in a Globalizing African Economy \\", Indiana University Press, USA, 2004, p. 25 He often states that God placed upon him the anointing to teach, and that led him to begin holding meetings in a classroom on his University campus at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. As attendance steadily increased, larger and larger halls had to be used. In 1992, the fledgling church acquired an old cinema hall within the Korle-Gonno area and mobilized its members to renovate the structure. The Korle Gonno Cathedral would become the first of several Cathedrals with the city of Accra that Dag Heward-Mills would build. The congregation grew steadily until finally, in 2006, he commissioned the construction of one the largest church complexes in Africa; The Qodesh. Harri Englund, \\"Christianity and Public Culture in Africa\\", Ohio University Press, USA, 2011, p. 208 Over the years Heward-Mills has inspired many of his members to become missionaries, pastors and workers to help build the denomination into an internationally reputable ministry. From the humble beginnings of meetings in a small classroom, there has been growth that continues to spread. Heward-Mills has since planted over 3000 churches in more than 90 different countries worldwide. The Lighthouse Chapel International denomination has both acquired and built multiple buildings, including the Qodesh ‚Äì its international headquarters. The Qodesh is one of the largest, ultramodern complexes in Africa. Mission work The Bishop's vision to encourage as many people as possible to work for God is reflected today in the many camps he holds across the world, it is also explained in the book titled Many Are Called. These camps have seen the birth of many \\"missionaries\\", who made several sacrifices including giving up their jobs and livelihood and relocating themselves to different countries to start branches of LCI. Heward- Mills records the messages preached at these \\"camps\\" and freely makes them available in a compilation he calls \\"the Machaneh\\" ‚Äî a compilation of all the camp messages.\\"The Machaneh Iron\\" , Dag Heward-Mills Books. Heward-Mills and the Lighthouse Church are heavily involved in the raising, training, sending and supporting missionaries al all corners of the globe. Heward-Mills is marked by his strong emphasis on church planting and the spread of the Christian gospel through the sacrifice of Christians.Samuel Nii Narku Dowuona, \\"Prosperity preaching is 'nonsense' - Bishop Dag\\", Modern Ghana. and obedience to God by ordinary men.Mark Ellis, \\"African church leader assails church in America\\", Godreports, 12 March 2013. Author As well as being the head of a large denomination, Heward-Mills is also one of the best-selling authors in the Christian world today. His style of writing is notably simple and understandable, with a wealth of scriptures. The books include titles such as The Art of Leadership, The art of hearing, the renowned Loyalty and Disloyalty series of ten titles, the best-selling marriage counselling book Model Marriage and The Megachurch. His writings are now available in 52 languages including French, Russian, Portuguese and Spanish, and have been made accessible to millions of people worldwide. His works have been patronised by several church leaders of other denominations who claim to have tangibly benefited from key biblical insights in the books. The most popular of the books so far has been Loyalty and Disloyalty, which was accredited the Grand Award from the Ghana Christian Book Awards body in 2007. It is now one in the Loyalty series of ten books.Kevin P. Emmert, \\"Why It's Hard to Learn from African Christians\\", Christianity Today, 14 October 2014. He has also compiled 73 of his best selling books in a library and named it the Makarios Library Conference speaker Heward-Mills is acknowledged in the Christian World as an evangelist, teacher and a highly respected minister of the Gospel. He has invitations to preach in several churches, ministries and organisations (both religious and secular), nationally and internationally. Heward-Mills has said that he views conferences and conventions as part of the work the Lord has called him to do; freely sharing in a down to earth manner, the messages the Lord has laid on his heart. Many pastors, ministers of the Gospel, leaders, church workers and diverse congregations are thus encouraged and strengthened to continue in what he refers to as \\"the work of the ministry\\". He holds annual international conferences dubbed \\"Give Thyself Wholly - Work of the Ministry\\" conferences, in the United Kingdom, France, South Africa and Ghana. These were formerly known as the \\"Iron Sharpneth Iron Conferences\\".\\"‚ÄòIron Sharpneth Iron Conference\\", the Qodesh. These conferences bring together thousands of pastors, ministers, church leaders and workers from various denominations, all around the globe, whose participation often births fresh hope, new visions, revivals and higher levels of ministry. Heward-Mills has also spoken at conferences including the Church Growth International and the Pentecostal World Fellowship conferences.\\"23rd Pentecostal World Conference, August 27-30, 2013, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\\", EBSCO. He was this year re- elected to the 7-member executive board and advisory committee of the Pentecostal World Fellowship. Anagkazo Bible School Additionally he founded a bible school ‚Äî The Anagkazo Bible Seminary, to train men and women in the practical work of the ministry. The Anagkazo Bible School is a full- time Bible seminary with several thousand students worldwide, aimed at raising other ministers in the doctrines and practices of Bishop Dag and LCI. Healing Jesus campaigns In 2004, Heward-Mills began a campaign to win the lost across Africa called The Healing Jesus Campaign. Heward-Mills' evangelistic campaigns have taken him across the whole of West, East and Southern Africa, with massive outdoor campaigns in many cities, towns, and villages where the gospel had not yet been preached. With its convoy of tracks, 4x4s and buses, the campaigns have traveled thousands of miles, crossing various borders with the sole purpose of spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ to other nations and cultures.http://www.daghewardmills.org/healingjesuscrusade/ His campaigns have been likened to those by Evangelist Rienhard Bonnke, whom the Medical Doctor turned Evangelist, has publicly referred to as a father in ministry. Healing Jesus Campaign - Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire. 2013 In 2018, Heward-Mills announced a vision of winning 100 Million souls through the campaigns. The campaigns have attempted to reach the farthest parts of the world. Heward-Mills‚Äô personal passion for soul-winning has led to these massive evangelistic efforts across the African continent, sometimes gathering over half a million souls in a single night. These evangelistic campaigns have recorded over 11 million decisions for Christ. The campaigns held by Heward-Mills have been marked with several signs and wonders, with healing of many blind, deaf and lame. He has witnessed the resurrection of the death twice in his ministry. Once in a crusade in Columbia, a young boy, declared dead by a hospital, was carried to the crusade by his mum, only for the boy to come back to life after the Evangelist prayed for the sick, during the service. Heward-Mills also holds conferences for pastors at these campaigns. Healing Jesus Campaign - Maputo, Mozambique. 2017 The Healing Jesus Campaign also caters to the physical well-being of the towns and cities it visits through the provision of medical care and basic needs for day-to-day living, such as clothing, buckets, etc.Thembeka Dlamini and Noxolo Nkabinde, \\"Thousands cascade to Mavuso for Healing Jesus Campaign\\", Swazi Observer, 30 April 2015. Freetown Campaign- Healing Jesus Campaign In June 2014, the Healing Jesus Campaign held a campaign in the city of Abomey-Calavi in Benin, thus recording the 100th city to be visited since the commencement of the campaigns in 2004. The purpose of the crusade, he states, is to take the gospel to all peoples of the world.  Television and radio  His programs are seen and heard domestically and internationally on the radio and television in several countries. The ministry continues to produce CDs, DVDs, pamphlets, books and other Christian resource material.Dag Heward-Mills on iTunes. Although Heward-Mills is primarily known for his Healing Jesus Campaigns in Africa and other third-world countries, the ministry is also active on the internet, videos, worldwide television and radio. Humanitarian efforts Heward-Mills' ministries also cater to the poor, the sick, orphans, widows and prisoners. Together with his team of professionally trained and qualified doctors, nurses and pharmacists, he diagnoses and treats patients free of charge. His ministry has also established many schools in underprivileged communities and run a successful \\"Help the Helpless Charity\\" that reaches thousands of poor people in various complex situations. Rev. Adelaide Heward-Mills, the Evangelist's wife, runs and manages the ministry's thriving orphanage built and structured in a way to replicate a home environment. Experiences from working on the mission fields by way of the evangelistic crusades in deprived cities, towns and villages across Africa, have led Heward-Mills to pick up his stethoscope again to provide medical care to the needy.http://www.helpthehelplesscharity.org/humanitarian/.../healing-jesus- medical- outreaches He is often accompanied by professionally trained medical teams of doctors, nurses and pharmacists who hold medical clinics as part of the medical outreach to the remote and poor communities. In 2008, the Lighthouse Medical Mission Hospital and Fertility Centre was founded. Several patients have been treated by Dr. Dag Heward Mills himself. The First Love Church In 2011, Dag Heward-Mills began to pastor the First Love Church, the University wing of the Lighthouse Chapel International. He has handed over active preaching in his other churches (including the Qodesh) to his associate pastors and is the direct pastor of the church previously on the Campus of the University of Ghana but has moved into their own building at East Legon, Accra- Ghana. Apart from his frequent travels to preach, Bishop Dag currently preaches to a growing congregation of over 6,000 young people at the First Love Church in Ghana.  Family life  Heward-Mills met his wife Adelaide who was, at the time of his education in the University of Ghana, a law student. After a few years of courtship, they married in 1989 and have been married for more than 30 years with four children. Adelaide Heward-Mills supports Dag in his vision to win souls, plant churches and raise leaders. She speaks in women's and young peoples‚Äô conferences all over the world. Adelaide Heward- Mills\\"About us: Adelaide Heward-Mills\\", Dag Heward-Mills website has been involved in Christian ministry all of her adult life and has served alongside her husband throughout their entire marriage.

He was created as a supporting character of Patoruzu, but got his own comic book afterwards, which is periodically reprinted. The character is often referenced as a \\"playboy\\", but only with the meaning of a man seeking leisure and a high-society lifestyle, without references to sex. The character has been used in a 2007 animated movie. Publication history Before the creation of Isidoro, Quinterno created other characters of a similar style. The first one was Manolo Quaranta, for the \\"La Novela Semanal\\" magazine. It was followed by Don Gil Contento and Juli√°n de Monte P√≠o. This last character was usually involved in games, horse races and nocturnal life, and had Patoruzu as a supporting character. However, popular reception modified this, and Patoruzu became the main character, with Julian as the supporting one.Accorsi, p. 11 Quinterno also created Pepe Torpedo for a comic strip in La Raz√≥n, oriented towards automovilism. Quinterno left La Raz√≥n and its related publications, and he managed to keep the copyright over Patoruzu. The newspaper kept the other characters, and published Juli√°n de Monte P√≠o as a stand alone character. Pepe Torpedo was simply discontinued. Quinterno created a new character for another newspaper, Isidoro Batacazo, a businessman interested in horse races. Quinterno resumed the publication of Patoruzu in 1935, outside of La Raz√≥n. To fill the role of Juli√°n de Monte P√≠o, whose rights were still held by the newspaper, he created Isidoro Ca√±ones, a new character with combined characteristics of Quaranta, Contento, Juli√°n and Batacazo. Isidoro sas, since his first appearance, Patoruzu's representative. The comic book was based in the dichotomy between both characters, with Patoruzu being full or virtues and Isidoro full of flaws. Isidoro's attempts to steal money from Patoruzu or have a high lifestyle without working were the usual action that started most plots. Isidoro started to be featured in solo stories without Patoruzu in 1940, and the title of the main comic book was changed to include both Patoruzu and Isidoro in it. In his own stories, the role of Patoruzu was be filled by Isidoro's uncle, the colonel Urbano Ca√±ones. The success of Patoruzu also led to the creation of Patoruzito, a child version of Patoruzu, which included as well a child adaption of Isidoro, Isidorito. Unlike the main character, Isidorito always stayed as a supporting character for Patoruzito. Characters There are few recurring characters in the comic strips about Isidoro, and most other characters are used for individual stories. However, as Isidoro is portrayed as a dandy, many characters interact with him as if they had known each other from before. The first steady character related to Isidoro to be created was his uncle Urbano Ca√±ones. This character is an aged colonel that tries to force Isidoro to give up his lifestyle and find a job or develop more serious habits. It was introduced in \\"The Irascible Colonel\\" story of the Patoruzu comic book. The first full solo story of Isidoro was a remake of this story, with Patoruzu and Upa removed from the plot. The remake introduced as well another recurring character, the captain \\"Metralla\\". Both last names, \\"Ca√±ones\\" and \\"Metralla\\", represent military-related Spanish terms (\\"cannons\\" and \\"shrapnel\\" each), and other similar minor characters used for specific stories are named following the same recurring joke. Isidoro has a partner, named Cachorra Bazooka. In line with the aforementioned joke, she's the niece of another colonel, friend of Ca√±ones, but which remains an unseen character during the series, used for another recurring joke where Isidoro always fail to meet or see him. Cachorra holds a \\"secret identity\\": although she shares most of his traits, as a female version of Isidoro, she deceives Ca√±ones, Metralla and the other military characters by posing as a reputable and innocent young woman. Other media There were attempts to make a TV series about Isidoro in the 1970s, with Santiago Bal in the main role, but were never aired. Patoruzito was featured in a pair of animated films, including Isidorito in them. The first adaption of Isidoro Ca√±ones was done in the 2007 animated movie Isidoro: La Pel√≠cula, voiced by Dady Brieva and Luciana Salazar.

He was Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum from 1904 to 1909, and Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1909 to 1924. Early years Born on 11 September 1859 in Staines, Middlesex, he was the second son of William Smith, solicitor, and his wife, Harriet, daughter of Frederic Harcourt, of Ipswich. He attended Winchester College (1873-78) as a scholar. In 1879 he joined the department of Roman and Greek antiquities in the British Museum. He soon became known as a rising archaeologist, and in 1887 was a founder editor and contributor to the Classical Review. In 1887 he was attached to the diplomatic mission in Persia. In 1892 he married Alice Edith, daughter of H. W. Watson of Burnopfield, Co. Durham. They had two sons, Simon and Gilbert. From 1895 to 1897 he was granted special leave to take up the directorship of the British School in Athens. The school had just received an annual grant from the Treasury and was able to extend its activities. Harcourt-Smith enhanced the prestige of the school and instituted its \\"Annual\\". He also began the school's excavations in the island of Melos, which contributed much to the knowledge of Aegean civilisations. While in Athens, Harcourt-Smith was promoted to assistant keeper of his department at the British Museum. From 1904 to 1908, he was Keeper of Greece and Rome Antiquities. Director and Secretary of the Victoria and Albert Museum In 1908 Harcourt-Smith became chairman of a commission of the Victoria and Albert Museum, set up to look into the collections of applied art at South Kensington that had been purchased by the government after the Great Exhibition of 1851. His report was so highly approved of that he was offered the post of director and secretary under the new organization, and in 1909 he accepted the appointment. The newly completed building gave scope for a more orderly display of the collections; the administration of the museum and its staff was set upon more modern lines, and the objects were grouped according to their material rather than, as in many great museums, by nationality or period. This method of grouping objects lasted until the evacuation of 1939 when they were grouped chronologically by Sir Leigh Ashton. Harcourt-Smith remained at the Victoria and Albert Museum until his retirement in 1924. During this time he introduced many improvements. He raised the status of the technical staff and negotiated for them the same rank and pay as the officials of the British Museum. He added students' rooms to all departments, and a steady stream of catalogues and guides was begun. Official guide lecturers were instituted and sponsored special exhibitions such as the Franco-British Exhibition of 1921 were introduced. It was under his directorship that the museum acquired the Salting collection, the Rodin sculptures (now transferred to the Tate Gallery), the Talbot Hughes collection of costumes, the Alma Tadema library, the Le Blon Korean pottery and the Pierpont Morgan stained glass. Other offices A year after his retirement Harcourt-Smith was appointed advisor for the Royal Art Collections and from 1928 until 1936 he was also Surveyor of the Royal Works of Art. He played a leading part in the foundation of the Central Committee for the Care of Churches, he was chairman of the committee of the Incorporated Church Building Society, and vice-chairman of the British Institute of Industrial Art and the British Society of Master Glass Painters. He was also vice-president of the Hellenic Society, president of the Society of Civil Servants and British representative on the International Office of Museums. He was an honorary member of the British Drama League and an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. As well as contributing to many of the British Museum departmental catalogues, he wrote for the art journals and also published a number of monographs: The Collection of J. Pierpont Morgan (1913), The Art Treasures of the Nation (1929), and The Society of the Dilettanti: its Regalia and Pictures (1932). Smith was knighted in 1909, appointed CVO in 1917, and advanced to KCVO in 1934. He died on 27 March 1944.

Llangadwaladr (), formerly spelt Llancadwaladr in some sources, is an isolated mountain parish in Powys, Wales. It was formerly in the historic county of Denbighshire, and from 1974-1996 was in Clwyd. Some 7 miles west of the nearest town, Oswestry, it covers an area of sparsely settled hill farming country around the valley of the Afon Ysgwennant beneath Gyrn Moelfre. History The parish was originally a chapelry of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, but was later formed into a separate parish, consisting of the township of Tre'r Llan, where the parish church was located, and those of Tregeiriog (the only village, in the neighbouring valley) and Nantyr, both of which were entirely detached from Tre'r Llan and surrounded by other parishes.Llangadwaladr, GENUKI Samuel Lewis's 1849 Topographical Dictionary of Wales described the parish as having 234 inhabitants and covering 2900 acres in total. In the late 1980s, Tregeiriog and its surrounding areas were transferred to the parish of Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog.St Cadwaladr's church , Llanfyllin Deanery There was a corresponding civil parish of Llangadwaladr, but following 1974 boundary and administrative changes, some of the area is now part of the civil community of Llansilin; the remaining parts of the civil parish are now in Ceiriog Ucha in Wrexham county borough. Before the rural depopulation of the late 19th century, the area was almost exclusively Welsh- speaking. The 1891 census recorded that 99.5% of the inhabitants of Llangadwaladr parish spoke Welsh, and that 88% knew no English whatsoever.Davies, J. 'Welsh', in Price, G. (ed.)

After the World War I he was instrumental in establishing the Baltic States and Finland as autonomous countries.  Life  James Young Simpson was born at 52 Queen Street in Edinburgh on 3 August 1873 to Margaret Stewart Barbour, sister of Alexander Hugh Freeland Barbour, and Sir Alexander Russell Simpson (1835-1916), professor of midwifery at the University of Edinburgh. His father was a nephew of his namesake, James Young Simpson, the first person to use chloroform as an anesthetic on humans. The family lived at 52 Queen Street, a property inherited from his great-uncle. Simpson was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh, which he attended from 1891 to 1894, graduating with an MA.Memoir by G.F. Barbour in the book: The Garment of the Living God (1934) pp.18‚Äì19. After two summers as a research student at Christ's College, Cambridge (1899/1900), he completed his DSc in 1901 at the University of Edinburgh. From 1899 he lectured in natural science at the University of Edinburgh. He was given his professorship in 1904. In 1900 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Cossar Ewart, Sir William Turner, Sir John Murray, and Alexander Buchan. In 1910 he was living at 25 Chester Street in Edinburgh's West End.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1910 He died on 20 May 1934 in Edinburgh. He is buried with his parents in the south-west section of Grange Cemetery close to the rear embankment behind the central vaults.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/158520815/james-young-simpson Family He married Helen Huntington Day of Indianapolis, USA. His younger brother was George Freeland Barbour Simpson.  Work  As a boy, he visited Paris with his father and was introduced to Louis Pasteur. Pasteur laid his hand on Simpson's head and exclaimed: \\"Travaillez, mon ami, travaillez!\\" [Work, my friend, work!] Turning to the father, he said \\"A-t-il dit, Oui?\\" [Has he said, yes?] Simpson seems to have implemented Pasteur's injunction throughout his life.'Memoir', p.18. In his writings, his dominant interest lay in showing the connection between science and religion. In his view, there is no contradiction between these, and he views Christianity as the natural outcome of man's evolutionary progress. Jesus Christ is \\"the fulfillment of all that went before. . . He is the Alpha and Omega of strictly human history.\\" and so on.Man and the Attainment of Immortality. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1922, p. 260. In a later book, Nature: Cosmic, Human and Divine (1929), Simpson argues that religion results from the confrontation of Mind with the Infinite Energy of the universe as suggested by Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle.Nature: Cosmic, Human and Divine. Oxford: OUP, 1929, p.115f.  Association with Russia and the Baltic States  Simpson's association with Russia began when Prince Nicholas Galitsyn visited Edinburgh in the early 1890s. Simpson befriended him and accompanied him on a visit to Siberia in the summer and autumn of 1896.'Memoir', p.24f. This Prince Nicholas Galitzin was not the famous Prince Nicholas Galitzine who was the last Tsarist Prime Minister of Russia. He was only distantly related to the latter. The object of the journey was to visit Siberian prisons and distribute bibles and other religious works to prisoners. Simpson made elaborate notes on the topography, agriculture, and customs of Siberia. These notes led to the publication of the book, Side-lights on Siberia in 1898. Subsequent books on Russia resulted from his regular visits to that country. In September 1910, Simpson accompanied his father to a medical congress in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) in Russia. On this one week's visit, he met Baron Nicolai and other Christians who were impressed by his reconciliation of Christianity with science.'Memoir', p.37. His last visits to Russia were in 1916 and April/May 1917 before the Revolution took place.'Memoir', p.43. In 1919, Simpson worked with the British Delegation to the Peace Conference at Versailles to ensure that the Baltic States and Finland were established as independent states.'Memoir', pp.46‚Äì47. He was subsequently given awards by these countries in recognition of his services. His last visit to the Baltic States was in June/July 1932, when he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Law (D.Jur.) at the University of Tartu.'Memoir', p.61.

He is best known for his numerous tango compositions including the famous Finnish tango song, \\"Satumaa\\". His first name was originally Uuno.  Biography  Mononen is often said to come from Somero, but was actually from Muolaa and did not come to Somero until the Second World War was over and Muolaa was conquered by the Soviet Union. Mononen studied church music in the University of Turku. He quit these studies since he felt he did not learn anything important. As a composer he was self- taught. Mononen began his musical career by singing with local dance groups while he was under 20. After a failed operation to his adenoids damaged his voice, Mononen started to compose. In 1950, Mononen first successfully sold his songs to a record company. The first song recorded was \\"Pieni laulu\\" (\\"A small song\\"), a waltz sung by Pentti Halme. In 1955 Henry Theel recorded the famous \\"Satumaa\\" to some success, but the song's status wasn't cemented until seven years later, in 1962, when Reijo Taipale recorded it. Playing guitar with his own band in 1959. Other famous tangos by Mononen include \\"T√§hdet meren yll√§\\" (\\"Stars above the Sea\\"), \\"Lapin Tango (\\"The Tango of Lappland\\"), \\"Erottamattomat\\" (\\"Inseparables\\"), \\"Kangastus\\" (\\"The Mirage\\"), \\"Kaipuuni Tango\\" (\\"The Tango of my Longing\\"), \\"Kohtalon Tango\\" (\\"The Tango of Destiny\\") and \\"Y√∂n Hiljaisuudessa\\" (\\"In the Silence of Night\\"). The last two of these became better known when another famous musician from Somero, singer Rauli \\"Badding\\" Somerjoki, recorded them. Singer Esko Rahkonen also worked with the composer in the 1960s. One of the most well known figures in Finnish popular culture, provocative entertainer M. A. Numminen had played drums in Mononen's band. Later Numminen asked Mononen to compose a humorous tango to his lyrics. Mononen answered that for Numminen, he would write a tango even to the words of a phone book. From this collaboration, the song \\"Naiseni kanssa eduskuntatalon puistossa\\" (\\"With my Woman at the Park of the Parliament House\\") was born. During his later years, Mononen suffered from alcoholism and eventually shot himself with a pistol on June 28, 1968. He was 37 years old.

He was also a teacher at Ontario College of Art, 1936-42; Principal of New School of Design and Vice-Principal of the Ontario College of Art, 1946. Biography Born in England in 1909 but sent to Canada in his teens, he apprenticed with printers in Toronto in the 1920s and learned the graphic design trade along the way. He struck out on his own in 1930, and built a successful design practice on corporate work and illustration, including several covers for Maclean's and illustrating for Mayfair magazine. During this period he was active in Toronto's Arts and Letters Club, a 'home away from home' for him throughout his life. He was also a regular part-time instructor at the Ontario College of Art. In World War II he registered as a conscientious objector, and created several well-known war posters, then became a camouflage designer in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In late 1942 he heard that Ottawa was looking for volunteers for its new War Artist program. He applied and was accepted, receiving a commission in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He attained the rank of Flight Lieutenant while covering RCAF operations in Coastal Command and the 2nd Tactical Air Force. During the years 1943-6 he produced over one hundred drawings and paintings in watercolours and oils that remain the property of The Crown and reside permanently with the Canadian War Museum. Career He returned to his Toronto design practice in late 1945. When Frank Carmichael died suddenly he found himself in charge of the Ontario College of Art\`s New School of Design. Educational administration was not for him and he resigned in 1946. In 1948, he created several covers and inside drawings for the Varsity Graduate magazine. He then worked as Graphic Arts Designer for the University of Toronto from 1948 to 1953. His celebrity as a returned war artist helped him land high-profile mural commissions with the Sunnybrook Hospital and Ontario Hydro. In 1954, along with Frederick Varley and others, he visited the Soviet Union on the first Canadian cultural exchange of the Cold War, and their travels were documented in a Maclean's article. Although he was never a communist and undertook this visit out of curiosity, it is likely that this visit made him ideologically 'suspect' and may have adversely affected his career from this point forward. As a mature designer, he continued to work steadily during the 1950s, counting as his clients Imperial Oil, the University of Toronto, Ryerson, York University and the Stratford Festival. He was not a prolific fine artist, however, which guaranteed him a low profile in comparison to other war artists, such as Alex Colville, Lawren P. Harris or Jack Shadbolt. Aldwinckle was an out-of-the-box thinker decades before the term became popular. He was a student of Theosophy (his book Two Fables was published by the Theosophical Press in 1950), an accomplished chef, raconteur, astrologer, composer of music, playwright, writer, and social critic. He enjoyed mentoring young artists, and influenced the careers of the late composer Harry Somers (his correspondence with Somers is in the McMaster University Archives, RC0385), Academy Award-winning filmmaker Christopher Chapman, muralist York Wilson and designer Theo Dimson. While his work as a war artist and as a graphic art designer were his most visible contribution, perhaps his most enduring legacy will be his role in the establishment of Killarney Provincial Park, the area where members of the Group of Seven painted some of their works.

The original Glyndon Hotel was built in 1889 to replace Green's opera house. At that time horse-drawn streetcars carried guests from the L&N; Railroad depot located further east on Main Street to the hotel. After a fire destroyed the original hotel in 1891, the current four-story brick structure was erected on the foundation of the earlier one. The new hotel opened in the fall of 1892 under the management of George G. Corzelius (1864‚Äì1948). Des Jardins and Hayward, a noted Cincinnati architectural firm, designed the existing edifice. The principal partner, Samuel E. Des Jardins, also designed four of Richmond's largest residences a few years earlier: the Pattie Field Clay House in 1883, Amberley in 1885, the Bennett House in 1885-90 and Elmwood in 1887. The front four-story facade has four bays. Round arches cap the grouped windows on the fourth story. Below, a three-story projection with balconies on each level emphasizes the asymmetrically placed main entrances. In the early days of the Glyndon, ladies did not use this entrance; they entered by way of a separate side entrance. White trim consists of latticed balcony railing, Tuscan columns, and window details. Large arches continue the rounded detailing of the exterior into the interior and connect the entrance to the lobby. Initially, three large cisterns at the rear supplied the hotel with water. A lengthy side porch provided for the popular pastime of promenading, and a mezzanine afforded relaxing pleasure to many guests. The dining room operated from the hotel's opening until 1965. A painting of Daniel Boone by Bert Mullins was executed especially for the Glyndon and has hung in the lobby since 1932. The name Glyndon is Danish for \\"haven of rest\\". The Glyndon has served a noteworthy group of people, including U.S. Vice President Alben Barkley, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, and several governors, as well as businessmen and educators from all parts of the world.

It filled a niche market segment, by being one of the few small, IP67 rated smartphones available at the time of its late 2010 release. It is water resistant, dust resistant, and has an impact-resistant screen. The phone was launched unlocked in Germany, France, Italy, Hungary, India, Thailand, Spain, the UK, Turkey, Romania and Greece under various networks and was distributed exclusively by a number of carriers, including T-Mobile in the United States, Telus in Canada, and Telstra and Optus in Australia. An updated version of the original MB525, Defy+ (MB526) is also available. Description The phone is a bar format with a touch screen and four Android touch buttons on the front. It has Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b-1999, IEEE 802.11g-2003, IEEE 802.11n-2009), 5-megapixel camera with LED flash, speakerphone, 800 MHz TI OMAP3630 processor, a FWVGA LCD. Lacking a physical keyboard, the phone instead provides the Swype virtual keyboard and an alternative multi-touch QWERTY keyboard. The Defy shares its platform with Motorola Bravo though there are minor differences in exterior design, 3G band, lower resolution camera without LED flash and non-weather resistance. The Defy is \\"water-resistant\\" with all covers closed (battery, USB, and audio jack).  Hardware  The Defy CPU/GPU is TI OMAP3 architecture OMAP3630 and the PowerVR SGX530. The OMAP 3 is the industry's first 45-nm CMOS processor set at 800 MHz in ARM Cortex-A8 superscalar microprocessor core. Under-clocked CPU frequencies (below ARM manufacturer specs of 1 GHz) & high CPU voltage levels on the stock phone led to much lower performance and battery life on stock settings than the hardware is capable of. This can be modified on rooted phones, using 3rd party tools (e.g. SetVSel app) or custom ROMs, with stable performance over 1 GHz being common. A minor hardware change and possible hardware refresh on MB526 models was observed, mainly noticeable by the camera lens being red ('Bayer' camera), instead of green.

It is considered highly dangerous, as it is capable of delivering extremely painful and medically significant stings when touched. It inhabits coral reefs, seagrass beds, and rocky or sandy environments at depths of up to . It feeds on algae, bryozoans, and organic detritus. Its common name is derived from its numerous and distinctively flower-like pedicellariae, which are usually pinkish-white to yellowish-white in color with a central purple dot. It possesses short and blunt spines, though these are commonly hidden beneath the pedicellariae. The rigid \\"shell\\" (test) is a variegated deep red and gray in color, though in rare cases it may be greenish to light purple. Taxonomy Toxopneustes pileolus is one of four species belonging to the genus Toxopneustes. It belongs to the family Toxopneustidae in the order Camarodonta. It was originally described as Echinus pileolus by the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1816, in the second book of his Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vert√®bres series. It was later used as the type species for the newly created genus Toxopneustes by the Swiss American biologist Louis Agassiz. The generic name Toxopneustes literally means \\"poison breath\\", derived from Greek œÑŒøŒæŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ [œÜŒ¨œÅŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩ] (toksik√≥n [ph√°rmakon], \\"arrow [poison]\\") and œÄŒΩŒµœÖœÉœÑŒøœÇ (pneustos, \\"breath\\"). The specific name pileolus means \\"little cap\\" or \\"skullcap\\", from Latin pileus, a kind of brimless conical felt cap. In English, Toxopneustes pileolus is most widely known as the \\"flower urchin\\". It is also sometimes known under various other common names, including \\"trumpet sea urchin\\", \\"flower tip urchin\\", \\"felt cap sea urchin\\", and \\"poison claw sea urchin\\". In the seashell collecting trade, Toxopneustes pileolus is known as the \\"mushroom urchin\\", due to their spineless empty shells (tests) resembling the caps of mushrooms. It is also known as tapumiti in Samoan; tehe-tehe batu in Sinama and Tausug; rappa-uni („É©„ÉÉ„Éë„Ç¶„Éã) or dokugaze (ÊØí„Ç¨„Çº) in Japanese; and l«ébƒÅ d√∫ j√≠ h«éi d«én (ÂñáÂè≠ÊØíÊ£òÊµ∑ËÜΩ) in Chinese. Description Flower urchins are relatively large sea urchins. They can reach a maximum diameter of around . Like most echinoderms, the body of adult flower urchins is equally divided into identical segments around a central axis in multiples of five (pentaradial symmetry). The rigid \\"shell\\" (test) has five interambulacral segments separated from each other by five ambulacral segments, each of them are composed of smaller regularly interlocking plates. It is overlaid by a thin layer of skin in living individuals. The test is variegated in coloration, usually deep red and grey, though there are rare instances of green and pale purple. Each ambulacral segment is ornamented by a large purple zigzag pattern running along its length. Two rows of tube feet emerge from the grooves on either side of each of the ambulacral segments (for a total of ten rows). The tube feet are individually composed of a thin muscular stalk (podia) tipped with a small suction cup (ampulla). The mouth is centrally located in the bottom (oral) surface of the test. It is surrounded by a ring of small plates overlaid by softer tissue known as the peristome. Embedded in the peristome are five calcareous \\"teeth\\" collectively known as Aristotle's lantern. These are used for grinding the flower urchin's food. The anus is situated on the upper (aboral) surface of the test, directly opposite the mouth. Like the mouth, it is surrounded by a ring of small plates known as the periproct. Surrounding the anal opening are five smaller holes (the genital pores) which are directly connected to the gonads inside the body cavity. The most conspicuous feature of flower urchins are their pedicellariae (stalked grasping appendages). Flower urchins possess four types of pedicellariae, distinguished by form and function, but only two are abundant. The first type are the ophicephalous pedicellariae. They resemble tube feet, except they end in three small claws (called valves) rather than suction cups. These are used to keep the body surface clear of algae, encrusting organisms, and unwanted debris. The second type are the globiferous pedicellariae which superficially resemble flowers (hence its common name). These are more specialized and are used for defense against predators and larger ectoparasites. Globiferous pedicellariae also end in a three-valved claw-like grasping appendage, like they do in ophicephalous pedicellariae, but they are much larger. The valves are connected to each other by a distinctive circular membrane around in diameter. They are pinkish-white to yellowish-white in color with a central purple dot and a bright white rim. Each valve ends in a sharp fang-like tip which is capable of penetrating human skin. The base of the valves also house venom glands. Some authors further subdivide globiferous pedicellariae into two subtypes based on size - the trumpet pedicellariae and the giant pedicellariae. The other two types of pedicellariae - tridentate and triphyllous - are rare or restricted only to certain areas of the test. The relatively blunt spines are quite short and are usually hidden below the flower-like pedicellariae. They can vary from white, pink, yellow, light green, to purple in coloration with lighter-colored tips. Other members of the genus Toxopneustes are similar in appearance and can be mistaken for flower urchins. Toxopneustes roseus can be distinguished by the uniform coloration of their tests of pink, brown, or purple. It is also restricted to the East Pacific and thus aren't found together with flower urchins. Toxopneustes elegans, which is only found around Japan, can be distinguished by the presence of a distinctive dark stripe just below the tips of their spines. Toxopneustes maculatus is a very rare species known only from specimens from R√©union, Christmas Island, and the Palmyra Atoll. It can be distinguished by the bright violet coloration on the bottom and in a band around the middle of their tests. Distribution and habitat Flower urchins are widespread and common in the tropical Indo-West Pacific. They can be found north from Okinawa, Japan, to Tasmania, Australia in the south; and west from the Red Sea and the East African coast, to Raratonga in the Cook Islands in the east. They are found among coral reefs, coral rubble, rocks, sand, and seagrass beds at depths of from the water's surface. They may sometimes partially bury themselves on the substrate. Ecology and behavior=Diet Flower urchins feed on algae, bryozoans, and organic detritus. Predators Flower urchins have few predators. They are known to be toxic to fish. One of the few organisms capable of consuming flower urchins with no apparent adverse effects is the predatory corallimorph Paracorynactis hoplites. However it is unknown if flower urchins are among its natural prey. Associated species The zebra crab, Zebrida adamsii, is a parasite of flower urchins The commensal alpheid shrimp Athanas areteformis, can sometimes be found living among the spines of flower urchins (as well as burrowing urchins and collector urchins). The intestines of flower urchins can also serve as habitats for the commensal flatworm Syndesmis longicanalis. Flower urchins are also common hosts of the zebra crab, Zebrida adamsii. These tiny crabs are obligate symbionts of sea urchins. They cling to the spines on the outer surface of the sea urchin test using their highly specialized walking legs. Because their ability to walk on substrates like sand is impaired, zebra crabs spend their entire benthic life stage attached to sea urchins, switching between hosts only during the mating season. Usually only one zebra crab is attached to an individual sea urchin outside of the mating season, but larger sea urchins can be hosts to two (very rarely more). The area of the test they inhabit is characteristically smooth; completely devoid of spines, pedicellariae, tube feet, and even epidermis. It is unknown if they physically destroy and/or consume these appendages or if they use other stimuli to induce the host sea urchins to autotomize. Although previously considered harmless commensals, authors have since reclassified them as parasites. In addition to the visible external damage, a 1974 study also observed abnormal behavior and coloration among infected sea urchins. They also appear to be immune to the flower urchin's venom. Reproduction Flower urchins are dioecious (having separate male and female individuals), but it is almost impossible to determine the sex of an individual by external characteristics alone. A possible method is by examining the external characteristics of the genital pores (gonopores). In males, they are generally short, cone-shaped, and extrude above the body surface; while in females they are usually sunken. However this is not reliable, as 15% of the cases can exhibit the opposite characteristics. All other external features, like shape and size of the tests or color of the spines are indistinguishable between the two sexes. Flower urchins have a chromosome number of 2n = 42. Relatively little is known of the spawning behavior of flower urchins. Like other sea urchins, fertilization happens externally. Males and females release free- swimming gametes (eggs and sperm) directly into the water currents in mass spawning events. In Okinawa, Japan, a 1994 study identified the spawning season of flower urchins as occurring in winter, at the same time as the closely related and sympatric Toxopneustes elegans. It also recorded possible natural hybrids resulting from instances where the eggs of Toxopneustes pileolus are fertilized by the sperm of Toxopneustes elegans. In Taiwan, a 2010 study observed flower urchins spawning in May on the years 2007 and 2009. They occurred on highly similar conditions: in the afternoon low tide of the spring tide immediately after a new moon. During the event, spawning individuals discard the debris that usually cover their bodies before releasing their gametes into the water. Another study published in 2013 did not find any obvious correlation between lunar and tidal cycles to the mass spawning behavior of the flower urchin populations in southern Taiwan. It did note that the spawning patterns appeared to be non-random, with higher spawning rates on daytime on certain dates. However, the study was conducted within a span of only five months (from April to August 2010). \\"Covering\\" behavior Flower urchin off the coast of R√©union exhibiting \\"covering\\" behavior Flower urchins are among the numerous species of sea urchins known as \\"collector urchins\\", so named because they frequently cover the upper surfaces of their bodies with debris from their surroundings. This behavior is usually referred to as \\"covering\\" or \\"heaping\\". Flower urchins are usually found almost completely covered in objects like dead coral fragments, shells, seaweed, and rocks. These are held fast to their bodies using their tube feet and pedicellariae. The function of this behavior is not well understood. Some authors believe that the debris serve as ballast, preventing them from being swept away by wave surges when feeding; while others believe that they may function as some sort of defense against predation. A 2007 study has hypothesized that the behavior may serve as protection from UV radiation during daytime. Venom=Bioactive components At least two active toxins have been purified from the pedicellarial venom of flower urchins in two studies. The first was discovered in 1991 and named Contractin A. It was found to interfere with the transmission of signals at nerve endings as well as cause hemagglutination (clumping of the red blood cells). When administered to guinea pigs, it resulted in contractions in the smooth muscles. The second, discovered in 1994, is a protein toxin named peditoxin. It is composed of the protein pedin and the active prosthetic group pedoxin. At low doses to mice, pedoxin was found to result in markedly lower body temperatures, muscle relaxation, sedation, and anesthetic coma. At higher doses it resulted in convulsions and death. Pedin itself is non-toxic, but it magnifies the effects of pedoxin. When combined together into the holoprotein peditoxin, even low doses resulted in anaphylaxis-like shock and death. UT841, a possible third toxin isolated in 2001, has been shown to affect brain metabolism in chicks. However, the authors are unclear on whether UT841 may actually be the same compound as Contractin A, since both have the same molecular weight of 18,000 Da and an almost identical N-terminal sequence. In addition to these toxins, lectins have also been isolated from flower urchin venom. Among them is SUL-I, SUL-II, SUL-IA, and SUL-III (SUL stands for \\"sea urchin lectin\\"). These lectins may be valuable as research tools for investigating the functions of cell processes. Close up of a flower urchin. Note the tightly shut globiferous pedicellariae behind the extended tube feet. Envenomation mechanism Unlike most other venomous sea urchins, flower urchins and related toxopneustids do not deliver their venom through spines. Instead, the venom is administered through the flower-like globiferous pedicellariae. If undisturbed, the tips of the globiferous pedicellariae are usually expanded into round cup-like shapes. They possess tiny sensors on their inside surfaces which can detect threats by touch and chemical stimuli. When agitated or brushed against by a potential threat, the pedicellariae will immediately snap shut and inject venom. The claws of the pedicellariae may also break off from their stalks and adhere to the point of contact, retaining the ability to continually inject venom for several hours. The potency of the pedicellarial venom is believed to be directly related to the size of the pedicellariae. Thus individuals with larger globiferous pedicellariae are considered to be more dangerous than individuals with more numerous but smaller globiferous pedicellariae. Effects on humans In 1930, the Japanese marine biologist Tsutomu Fujiwara accidentally envenomated himself with seven or eight flower urchin pedicellariae while working in a fishing boat. He described his experience in a paper published in 1935: There have been reports of fatalities resulting from flower urchin envenomation. One such report was the purported drowning of a pearl diver after being rendered unconscious from accidental contact with a flower urchin. But it remains difficult to confirm if these incidents actually occurred since no documentation or details of the deaths have been uncovered so far. Nevertheless, flower urchins are still considered highly dangerous. The severe debilitating pain of the flower urchin sting compounded by muscular paralysis, breathing problems, numbness, and disorientation can result in accidental drowning among divers and swimmers. The flower urchin was named the \\"most dangerous sea urchin\\" in the 2014 Guinness World Records. Edibility Flower urchin from Longdong Bay, Taiwan, with some of the tube feet extending past the pedicellariae Despite being venomous, flower urchins are sometimes harvested in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands for their edible gonads. In the Sulu Archipelago of the Philippines and eastern Sabah, Malaysia, flower urchins are among the species of edible sea urchins used by the Sama-Bajau and Tausug people to make a traditional delicacy known as oku-oku or ketupat tehe tehe. This is prepared by degutting the test and then filling it with glutinous rice and coconut milk before boiling. Other uses In Okinawa, fishermen observed numerous individuals of the predatory crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) gathering around the remains of the internal organs of flower urchins. A follow-up study by Japanese researchers in 2001 confirmed that the viscera of flower urchins could indeed attract crown-of-thorns starfish in both aquarium and open sea experiments. The attractant compounds were isolated and identified as arachidonic acid and Œ±-linolenic acid. The authors believe that this discovery may be used to augment population control measures of the crown-of-thorns starfish, which are highly destructive to coral reefs.

He escaped enslavement to join the Union Army during the Civil War. After the war, he married and raised a family in Ohio. Collaborating with his daughter, he published his autobiography. Early life Bruner was born in 1845, in Winchester, Clark County, Kentucky. His mother had three children, including Peter, and would fight with her master John Bell Bruner over her children. Peter's father was his master. When Bruner was about 10 years old John Bell Bruner was offered $800 for Peter, but told the man that \\"he was growing into money\\" and before long would be worth $200 more than that. He was removed from his mother at a young age and worked as a tanner; He was also hired out to work for others. Bruner was beaten and tried to escape many times, having endured \\"extreme physical violence and psychological deprivation\\". The sister of his owner threatened that: \\"she wanted to buy me for the sole purpose of whipping me; she said if she could whip me and break me in she could stop me from running off\\". Civil War On July 25, 1864, after numerous attempts, he escaped slavery and joined the Union Army as a free man at Camp Nelson in Kentucky, serving in Company C of the 12th Regiment Heavy Artillery U.S. Colored Troops, as part of the United States Colored Troops. During his initial attempt to join the army in August 1863, he had been told it was a \\"white man's war\\". Kentucky was the last state to accept African-American men into their army. In February 1864, there were 400 men who wanted to enlist and Col. Andrew H. Clark began enlisting them. By June of that year there were 1,500 enlisted colored soldiers. On June 13, 1864, restrictions were lifted requiring men to be free or have their owner's written permission to engage in the war. From that point forward, anyone that enlisted was emancipated. Bruner described the events of his second, successful attempt to enlist in his book A Slave's Adventures Toward Freedom: \\"The next morning about five o'clock I had gone twenty-one miles and had arrived at Richmond. After I had left Richmond I came upon sixteen colored fellows who were on their way to Camp Nelson and of course I did not get lonesome. Just a half hour before sundown we arrived at Camp Nelson and had come forty-one miles in that day. The officers asked me what I wanted there and I told them that I came there to fight the rebels and that I wanted a gun\\". Camp Nelson became the third largest recruiting and training center for African-American men: more than 10,000 men were recruited there. > Unlike the all-white unit that guarded central Kentucky for the Union in > 1863, the new army welcomed, initiated, trained, and commanded thousands of > African American soldiers willing to fight the Confederates and, more > immediately, to attain their freedom. Bruner served in western and central Kentucky, performing garrison duty. He was mustered out of the army in 1866 and went to Winchester, Kentucky, to visit his mother, whom he had not seen for 18 years, before moving to Ohio. Peter Bruner is listed on plaque B-26 at the African American Civil War Memorial in Washington, D.C. Marriage and children In 1866, he moved to Oxford, Ohio, where his aunt and uncle named the Brassfields lived. On March 10, 1868, he married Frances Proctor, the daughter of a free black farmer; they raised five children, including four daughters, together. He and his family were long-term members of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church (A.M.E. Church) in Oxford.

Miami University Bruner worked as a custodian and messenger at Western Female Seminary, Oxford College, which merged into Miami University. He was the first African-American man to work at Miami University. He learned to read and write. In his autobiography he said that he went to school in Oxford and \\"studied reading, writing, geography and spelling, and have not got it yet\\".

His top hat is exhibited at the William H. McGuffey House Museum at Miami University. Several of his grandchildren and great grandchildren were able to graduate from Miami University, including Thomas Monroe Cheeks, Carrie Cheeks Morgan, Isabel Cheeks Lewis, Thomas Kelly, Margaret Greene McClain and James Cheeks. Many of his other descendants have graduated from other colleges. Autobiography With his daughter, Carrie Burns, he wrote an autobiography, A Slave's Adventures Toward Freedom; Not Fiction, but the True Story of a Struggle. Bruner states in the introduction: > In this book I have given the actual experiences of my own life. I thought > in putting it in this form it might be of some inspiration to struggling men > and women. In this great, free land of ours, every person, no matter how > humble or how great seems the handicap, by industry and saving, can reach a > position of independence and be of service to mankind. Slave Narrative Collection In 1936, Bruner was interviewed for the Works Progress Administration Slave Narrative Collection. The interview did not reveal the same level of detail as his book. He left out personal information and did not delve into the more complex natures of individuals and the communities in which he lived. Blassingame theorizes that some of this may be due to memory loss, transcription errors, or concealment of some of the facts. The WPA interview resulted in a couple of typed pages; Bruner's book was 54 pages in length. Death Peter Bruner died on April 6, 1938, and is one of the African-American Civil War Veterans buried in Woodside Cemetery, Oxford, Ohio.

It is found in the Western Pacific Ocean. Description The longfin grouper has a body with a standard length which is 2.8 to 3.2 times its depth. The dorsal profile of the head is smoothly curved. The preopercle is rounded or subangular while the gill cover has a nearly straight upper edge. The dorsal fin contains 11 spines and 16-18 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 8 soft rays. The caudal fin is rounded while the pectoral fin is around twice the length of the head. The overall colour is whitish on the head, body and fins and it is marked with many sizeable closely set hexagonal to roundish dark brown to blackish spots. On the upper head and body the spots are closer together and form a reticulated pattern while on the lower head and body the spots are more widely spaced and they are less well defined. There is a pattern of similar dark spots on dorsal, anal and caudal fins. There are tow dark bands on the breast which join underneath the pectoral fin and almost join at the gill slitcreating an isolated pale patch on the ventral part of the breast and there is another pale area between the upper dark and a dark blotch that normally covers most of the base of the pectoral fin. There are irregular dark brown bands and blotches on the throat and the ventral surface of the breast., The dark spots on the head are smaller towards the snout but these are always notably larger than the nostrils, and there is a squarish white or pale area on the cheek at rear end of the upper jaw. The rear margin of pectoral, anal and caudal fins is mostly dusky with faint dark spots while the front margin leading edge of pelvic fins with white line and broad blackish submarginal band. This species attains a maximum total length of . Distribution The longfin grouper is found in the Indo-West Pacific, especially in the Indomalayan region. In the Indian Ocean it has only been recorded from the Andaman Islands and off Australia. In the Western Pacific Ocean its range extends from Japan and South Korea in the north south to Australia and east as far as the Solomon Islands. In Australia, it is distributed from Shark Bay in Western Australia along the northern coast and as far south as northern New South Wales, including the islands of the Great Barrier Reef. Habitat and biology The longfin grouper is found on silty reefs in coastal waters at depths of less than . It is a sedentary species which feeds on worms, smaller fishes and crustaceans. This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite and the females become sexually mature at around and when they are 1.8 years old. The change in sex to males takes place when they have attained a total length of around . The long and fleshy pectoral fins appear to be used to support the fish's body as it rests on the substrate. Taxonomy The longfin grouper was first formally described as Serranus quoyanus in 1830 by by the French zoologist Achille Valenciennes (1794-1865) with the type locality given as New Guinea. The specific name honours the French naval surgeon, zoologist and anatomist Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy (1790-1869) who, with Joseph Paul Gaimard, reported this species. Utlisation The longfin grouper is of some value to fisheries in Hong Kong and Taiwan, occurring in the live reef fish food markets of Hong Kong and probably on other regions of southeast Asia. The small juveniles are caught in the summer and the larger fish are caught using gill nets, hand- lines and traps. Once caught the wild hatched juveniles are grown-out in cages in southeast Asia, albeit on a small scale.

KIST, founded in 1966, was the first multi-disciplinary scientific research institute in Korea and has contributed significantly to the economic development of the country.Moo-Young Han, \\"Annotated Chronology of Korea's Science and Technology: From Rice Paddies to Flat Panel Displays\\" In 2003, two major agreements between Institut Pasteur Paris and KIST paved the way for the launch of Institut Pasteur Korea. One established financial arrangements for the operation of the institute; the other was a general agreement on its foundation and management. Institut Pasteur Korea was mandated to expand the reach of Institut Pasteur by moving basic research toward therapy development and to introduce the ‚ÄúPasteurian‚Äù research mission, management and culture to Korea. Over its 130-year history, the Institut Pasteur in Paris has combined scientific achievements with their application in public health. Institut Pasteur Korea was inaugurated in April 2004. Operations began at the start of 2005 under the motto ‚ÄúFrom Drug to Genes‚Äù, with the mission of turning basic research into pharmaceuticals using ‚Äútarget- free‚Äù drug discovery. Using this approach, drugs are sought in a cellular context, with no preconceived notions of what targets within the cell are relevant. Institut Pasteur Korea joined the Institut Pasteur International Network in November 2004 as a private foundation recognized as working toward the public good through biomedical research. Until April 2009 Institut Pasteur Korea was located in a small facility on the campus of KIST. It then moved into a new 15,199 square meter facility in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province. The institute is one of the few in the world that contains robotic, high throughput optical imaging capacity within biosafety level 2 and 3 facilities. Vision and Strategy With the excellence of its multinational scientists and staff, the cutting-edge translational-driven research innovations, the strong affiliation with Institut Pasteur Paris and its global network of 33 institutes, and the commitment to making a difference in people's lives according to the teachings of Dr. Louis Pasteur, Institut Pasteur Korea aims to be one of the premier research institutions in Korea. Institut Pasteur Korea focuses on five key objectives to accelerate the discovery phase for a multitude of infectious diseases: 1) Build a fundamental understanding of the biology of the disease. 2) Deploy discovery platforms to search for novel host molecular target(s) for intervention and diagnosis; and identify novel compounds to treat the disease. 3) Facilitate the transition from discovery to translation through chemistry optimization and asset valorization efforts. 4) Identify the right industrial partner for further development and commercialization of diagnostic kits for earlier detection and prevention; and novel small molecule therapies for immediate treatment and disease spread control. 5) Develop and mentor the research leaders of tomorrow through targeted recruitment and retention of rising stars, combined with academic outreach programs, such as Pasteur Jr. and Institut Pasteur Korea Life Science programs. Organization Institut Pasteur Korea is organized into four divisions, Research Technology Management, Discovery Biology, Discovery Chemistry and Administration. These functional units collaborate across disciplines and classical research boundaries, providing an effective operational organization to meet the strategic goals of the institute. Research and Technology Institut Pasteur Korea‚Äôs research groups study infectious diseases including tuberculosis, antibacterial resistance, HCV, HBV, influenza, leishmaniasis, and dengue fever, as well as cancer. For over a decade, Institut Pasteur Korea has focused on technology development to build the best drug discovery platform for high-content screening performed in BSL level 2 and 3 environments. Its innovative screening platform utilizes target- free, visual high-content screening using large compound libraries or siRNA libraries to identify chemical compounds that prevent or slow disease progression in live, physiologically relevant disease models. Its core technology features automated cellular imaging-based, high-content screening facilities with a capacity to screen up to 2 million points (independent compounds or RNAi) per year. Institut Pasteur Korea‚Äôs target identification technology uses high-content, genome-wide visual arrays to identify targets of interest in live cellular disease models. By screening with siRNA libraries, researchers can identify genes that alter drug sensitivity in the cellular disease model, thereby providing a way to quickly close in on the molecular targets. Institut Pasteur Korea‚Äôs Discovery Chemistry group applies new concepts of drug design to optimize hit-to-lead identification. Its drug discovery technology platforms have led to the first-ever TB chemical screen performed using primary macrophages and resulting in a new best-in-class molecule to fight TB, referred to as Q203. Business Development Institut Pasteur Korea actively promotes knowledge sharing and collaboration with international and domestic scientific communities and it is committed to sharing the fruits of our research, technologies and expertise with partners and young scientists. The positive reputation of Institut Pasteur Korea and its technology in the international pharmaceutical community has led to collaborations with multiple global partners. Also of significance, Institut Pasteur Korea entered the Korean market by establishing a privileged partnership with major pharmaceuticals. The formation of these collaborations is an important milestone for the development of further business relationships in the pharmaceutical arena. Additionally, Qurient, Co. Ltd. is a spinoff company that serves as a virtual drug development center, using contract research organizations to bring small molecules generated by Institut Pasteur Korea into clinical trials. The goal of Qurient is to license out lead compounds discovered at Institut Pasteur Korea for clinical development and commercialization by larger partners in the biotech and pharmaceuticals sector. Financial Support Institut Pasteur Korea is funded through Korean government subsidies from the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and Gyeonggi Province, domestic and international grants, revenues from industry sponsored research and license agreements, and donations.

Early life and education  He was born into a Hazara family in Shahristan District, Daikondi Province in central Afghanistan, the son of Gholam Ali, a farmer. Khodaidad completed his primary education at Shahristan Primary School in 1967. During that time the Hazara people hardly advanced to higher education in Kabul due to tribal discrimination in the country. There were no schools for the Hazaras, and it was very difficult to go to Kabul and study. The Hazara areas were under immense pressure from the Central government, who were not supportive and intentionally did not provide educational facilities in the Hazara-based areas. This meant the Hazara people had limited opportunity to develop and go on to further education. In particular, it was very difficult to get places in the army, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice and any key roles in the government. However, due to his hard work General Khodaidad managed to obtain a place at Kabul to study. He received his military high school diploma from Kabul Military High School, (Harbi Showanzai) in 1972. He completed his diploma with high marks and was one of the few selected, bright students to go to India to study at the National Defence Academy (NDA), located in Khadakwasla, near Pune, Maharashtra, India, which one of the most prestigious Academy in the world, in 1972. He studied at the NDA for three and a half years. Khodaidad graduated from the National Defence Academy (NDA) -India successfully and afterwards joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA), located in Dehradun, where he studied until 1977.  Career  After his return from India, Khodaidad had achieved the rank of second lieutenant infantry commando officer in the Afghan Army in 1977. He was the first army officer from the Sharistan district of Daikondi province in the Afghan armed forces. Khodaidad was a member of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) (Khalq). After the 1978 Saur Revolution and the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War (1979‚Äì1989), he continued serving the government of Afghanistan and in 1983 Khodaidad was a Major and commander of 444 commando brigade. In 1985 he was sent to the Frunze Military Academy, located in Moscow and one of the most-prestigious Soviet military academies, for a period of one year. Khodaidad's military career includes: * 1977 ‚Äì platoon commander and instructor of reserve school of the Ministry of Defence * 1978 ‚Äì company commander of military police of the 29th regiment of the Ministry of Defence * 1978 ‚Äì commander of reconnaissance company of the 29th regiment of the Ministry of Defence * 1979 ‚Äì second battalion commander of 37th paratrooper brigade, in Bala Hissar, Kabul. Due to the differences between Khalq and Parcham groups, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Khodaidad was posted to Number 17 division and 33 regiment as Head of non- confidential documents. * 1980 ‚Äì commander of 2nd training battalion of 444 paratrooper brigade * 1981 ‚Äì operational director of 444 commando brigade * 1982 ‚Äì chief of staff of 444 paratrooper brigade * 1983 ‚Äì commander of 444 paratroopers brigade * 1984 ‚Äì second in command of 2nd infantry division * 1985 ‚Äì commander of 2nd infantry division * 1987 ‚Äì commander of 14th infantry division of Ghazni Province and head of Defense Council of Ghazni and Wardak Province; also commander of operational groups of Ghazni and Wardak provinces in Central Afghanistan. Created and established 3 territorial army division (95, 96, and 97) of Hazara for peace and reconciliation to support the central government of Afghanistan * 1990 ‚Äì commander of 54th division and chief of staff of 6th Corps of Kunduz in North East Zone * 1990 ‚Äì commander of operational groups of Takhar Province in the North East Zone. * 1990‚Äì1991 Due to the dispute between the Northern Alliance and the Najibulla regime in North of Afghanistan, Khodaidad kept his neutrality and as a result was posted to become an instructor to the Afghan High Officers Course of the Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan). * 1992 ‚Äì Minister of National Security during the Sibghatullah Mojaddedi government. In 1984, during the government of Afghan President Babrak Karmal, Khodaidad became the first officer from the Hazara people ever to achieve the rank of a general in the Afghan National Army. While Khodaidad was commanding the 14th Infantry Division of Ghazni Province he played a major role in the Afghan governments National Reconciliation programme instigated by Najibullah. Khodaidad managed to convince several mujahideen factions, groups and individuals in the central and northeastern zones of the country to enter the reconciliation and reintegretion process. He recalls his time of meeting and discussing with mujahideen leaders hence the reason why the central zones of Afghanistan witnessed peace and harmony in the late 1980s. Khodaidad had positive connections with local mujahideen leaders and commanders in areas under his sphere of influence including Wardak, Ghazni, Bamyan, Urazgan, Logar and parts of Paktia and Paktika provinces. He encouraged the various different mujahideen from various tribes to join the peace process and work towards the unity of Afghanistan. This included encouraging all the factions of the Hazara mujahideen to put their differences aside and work for the future of Afghanistan. As part of the reconciliation and reintegration process, Khodaidad created an operational group for all the tribes living in his area of responsibility namely Ghazni, Wardak and other areas in Central Afghanistan. The operational groups consisted of three infantry divisions, 95th Division for Ghazni, 96th Division for Wardak and Bamyan provinces and no 97th division for Mazar-i-Shariff province. In the meantime, he was commanding the operational group in these areas. His relations with mujahideen commanders in Takhar, Kunduz and Baghlan provinces was highly appreciated by the government as it added to improving the security and stability in areas under his responsibility. After the collapse of Najibullah's government in 1992 and the beginning of civil unrest in Afghanistan, Khodaidad, on behalf of the Hazara people of Afghanistan, was appointed as the Minister of National Security during the prime government of Sibghatullah Mojaddedi. As Afghanistan drifted to civil war, Khodaidad used his non alignment by cooperating and supporting the United Nations peace process in achieving national unity and stability in Afghanistan. Khodaidad continued to keep his non-alliance remaining neutral and did not support any particular factions, groups or individuals. His main goal was to bring peace and security for Afghanistan. He tried to keep his good relationship with the people of Afghanistan both living in Afghanistan and outside. However, after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, he sought refuge in London until the fall of the Taliban regime. In 2001, after the U.S.-led invasion at the start of the War in Afghanistan, he was invited to his homeland by the international community to support the Afghan people to bring peace, security and national unity to the country. He became a member of the Emergency Loya Jirga of Afghanistan after the collapse of the Taliban regime. In 2004, Khodaidad was appointed by Hamid Karzai as Deputy Minister of Counter Narcotics and Member of National Security Council of Afghanistan and shortly after receiving parliamentary approval in 2007, he became the Minister of Counter Narcotics until March 2010. In 2006 he attended the Top Leadership Programme (TLP1) in Berin Germany organised by the commission for reform of public affairs and UNDP to strengthen good governance and leadership in Afghanistan. As minister, known to his colleagues, Khodaidad showed commitment and dedication to his job. During his term, twenty, out of thirty-four, provinces of Afghanistan were announced as poppy-free by the U.N. Of the 203,000 hectares used for poppy cultivation, Khodaidad managed to reduce this to 123,000 hectares. As a part of his campaign to rid Afghanistan of drugs, Khodaidad travelled to all thirty-four Afghan provinces with his United Kingdom, United States and other international partners to volatile and dangerous provinces. In President Karzai's cabinet, Khodaidad was amongst one of the few ministers who had maintained their non alignment with any faction or party in Afghanistan. According to his colleagues and the international community, Khodaidad was renowned for being against corruption and has been described as a clean and transparent minister in the Karzai cabinet. As Phil Zabriskie, states in his article \\"Afghanistan's drug czar ‚Äì world's toughest job\\", published in Fortune, Khodaidad \\"has earned one of the cleanest reputations in the Afghan civil service.\\" Further, Tom Schweich, a former senior State Department counternarcotics official also speaks highly of Khodaidad as an individual without \\"any influence\\" from any tribes backing him, gunmen or mujahadeen lending him credibility. In addition, Khodaidad has no sway with any ethnic groups because he values his independence and non-alignment. The former US Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and Francis J. Ricciardone, Jr., in a discussion on the \\"New Cabinet\\" in 2009 stated that Khodaidad \\"holds graduate degrees from the Indian National Defense Academy. ‚Ä¶ and he has been a very good partner for U.S. counternarcotics efforts.\\" In 2013 General Khodaidad was selected as the first vice president candidate to his excellency Hedayat Amin Arsala for the upcoming presidential elections of Afghanistan in 2014. General Khodaidad was also a member of the consultative Loya Jirga (Grand Meeting) of Afghanistan to agree the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) between Afghanistan and the United States in November 2013. Between 2017 and 2019 Khodaidad was appointed as the Inspector General and member of High Oversight Board (HOB) of the Afghan armed forces in the Office of the National Security Council, Afghanistan in the presidential palace.  Accolades  Khodaidad is honoured and perceived by the Afghan people, former colleagues including army officers and generals and many former mujahideen foes as a courageous and distinguished soldier who showed commitment and gallantry in the battlefield. He has received over fifty-two gallantry medals from the Afghan government. During his time as the Minister of National Security (Afghanistan) and later as the Minister of Counter Narcotics (Afghanistan), Khodaidad was recognised by his colleagues as an Afghan patriot who consistently put aside ethnic differences as well encouraging national unity amongst ordinary Afghans.  Personal life  Although pursuing a military and political life, Khodaidad has always maintained his greatest hobbies of playing polo and horse riding. While training at the NDA, he received a Blue and a blazer ‚Äî being the highest prizes at riding horses and playing polo ‚Äî from the academy in 1976. He also received a Blue prize from the IMA in 1977. In his first term at the NDA he also became the academy champion in shot put. Khodaidad can speak over six languages which includes Dari Persian, Pushto, Russian, Hindi, Urdu and English. Khodaidad is married to a teacher, and has two sons and four daughters. His children were educated in London and are in highly established, professional jobs.

The first four vessels of the class were ordered in late 1972 and commissioned between 1975 and 1977, with the final ship being commissioned in 1983 after a conversion by Fairmile Marine. They were built by Richard Dunston for ¬£1.1m each, and were designed for service in the Inshore Division of the Fishery Protection Squadron. The class was closely related to the Royal Air Force Marine Branch Seal class long-range recovery boats. The vessels had poor seakeeping qualities and the design was therefore considered unsuccessful. As a result, Peterel and Sandpiper were employed as training tenders for the Royal Naval Reserve and never undertook an operational patrol. After a decision was made on their future, they were fitted with an enclosed bridge and assigned to Britannia Royal Naval College for training duties. Kingfisher, Redpole and Cygnet were assigned to Northern Ireland Squadron to replace the older Ton class minesweepers.Ripley, Tim and Chappel, Mike (1993). Security forces in Northern Ireland (1969‚Äì92). Osprey, p. 30. The vessels are now privately owned, Cygnet in the UK, Redpole in the USA and Sandpiper in the Netherlands.

It is no longer clear which way cultural developments were flowing in the 6500 to 4500 BCE period.Yoffee, Norman and Clark, Jeffery J. (eds) (1993), \\"Early Stages in the Evolution of Mesopotamian Civilization: Soviet Excavations in Northern Iraq\\", (The University of Arizona Press, Tucson)Potts, Daniel (1997), \\"Mesopotamian Civilization: The Material Foundation\\", (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York) The site, about 70 miles northeast of Baghdad, has been dated to the late 6th millennium BCE. It was occupied in several phases from the Samarran culture through the Ubaid. Buildings were rectangular and built of mud brick, including a guard tower at the settlement's entrance. Irrigation supported livestock (cattle, sheep and goats) and arable (wheat, barley and flax) agriculture. One important aspect of the site therefore is the evidence that it yields for chronological relationships between North and South Mesopotamian cultures, at least in the area of Mandali, and for connections with Iran. The introduction of irrigation, new types of grain, foreign ceramic styles and domestic cattle are all located in the Choga Mami phase, a late manifestation of the Samarran Period in lowland Mesopotamia. This chronological identification thus also suggests the source of these innovations: migration from the lowlands. Artifacts found at Choga Mami include Samarran painted pottery and elaborate clay female figurines.  History  Choga Mami is the largest Tell in the Mandali region. Excavators David and Joan Oates describe the site as a \\"low mound some 200 meters long and 2-5 meters high,\\" and \\"heavily eroded, the latest preserved levels dating to 4800 B.C.\\" Based on excavation findings, it appears that Choga Mami had a few small village clusters with small irrigated areas where people grew wheat and barley; herded sheep, goats and some cows; and hunted gazelles and other wild fauna. Lentils and \\"large-seeded peas\\" were also grown, while pistachios were gathered from the nearby landscape. The domestication of plants and animals at Choga Mami was possible because of man-made irrigation channels which \\"ran along the northern side of the mound,\\" which date from the \\"6th millennium B.C.,\\" and a large canal dating to the end of the Samarran period which was located at the \\"southwestern side of the mound.\\" Some channels reached more than five kilometers in length, which would require the cooperative labor of larger groups. The latest of these canals can be dated to around 1,500 years ago.  Archaeology  Choga Mami was originally excavated by a team of archaeologists, led by Joan and David Oates. The first season of this excavation project began on December 2, 1967 and would extend until February 26, 1968. The archaeological site of Choga Mami was chosen for excavation in part due to its location in Iraq, along an area which would have ostensibly seen heavy foot traffic during the time, in which it would have been considered part of the Mesopotamian region. During the excavation the team of archaeologists found mud brick rooms all similar in size and thoughtfully aligned, pottery, tools, and many small clay figures. David Oates also found a jar containing the fragmented remains of what is presumably an infant burial, which led them to believe that this location would have been the site of a small town.  Architecture  Excavations at Choga Mami have revealed many levels of occupation on the tell, dating from the start of the 6th millennium B.C. A mud-brick tower guarded the entrance to the settlement. There is no clear evidence that it formed part of a town wall, and encouraged by a part of an ascending ramp found beside it, archaeologists identify the structure as a watch tower. Built out of locally sourced mud brick, the settlement had Samarran-style, rectangular shaped homes. The homes found at Choga Mami were built directly on top of, or occasionally within, the walls of earlier levels. The majority of houses \\"contained either two or three rows of small rooms,\\" on either side of a central hall, referred to as a tripartite plan. This plan is common throughout Mesopotamia in both public and domestic architecture. Many of the houses found at Choga Mami were strengthened by external buttresses, corresponding with \\"the corners and junctions of walls.\\" The largest buttress found by excavators measured 10 x 7 meters and contained twelve rooms in three rows. Despite being rendered obsolete by architectural innovations later in the period, these buttresses are found at all levels of occupation, resulting in purely decorative use of the buttress by the end of the Samarran period.  Ceramics/Pottery  The surviving pieces of pottery found at Choga Mami were regularly constructed with the same materials and the same overall look as those of the wider Samarran Culture. Many remaining examples display an extensive use of animal imagery, a defining characteristic of the period. Among the clay artifacts that have been excavated at Choga Mami, both painted and unpainted pots, clay beads, and small figurines have been recovered. While standing male and female Terracotta figurines are the most common, other figurines largely resemble the figures of the later Ubaid period, found in southern Iraq. These small baked terracotta figurines are often depicted as standing male or female statutes with their hands at their waist and intricately decorated, yet depicted with exaggerated body proportions. Many have the appliqu√© eyes, scalloped hairstyles and beauty marks, typical of the pottery of the larger Mandali region. Few Terracotta figurines have been found fully intact due to their composition. Most remain fragmentary, as these figurines were often assembled with added on smaller pieces, which have broken off over time at the joining point.

A surveyor and a director of numerous companies, he was best known for his role as Chairman of the Prudential Assurance Company from 1928 to 1941.  Family  Horne was the son of Edgar Horne (1820‚Äì1905) of Witley in Surrey and his wife Maria, the widow of Thomas Everfield; his father had been head of the Prudential Assurance Company for many years, and his estate was valued on his death at ¬£565,407. He was married in 1886 to Margery May (died 1939), the daughter of Mr. G. A. May of Elford in Staffordshire. They had two sons (twins, Alan Edgar and W. Guy, born in 1889) and a daughter.  Career  Edgar Horne was educated at Westminster School, before entering his father's firm of auctioneers and surveyors, Messrs Horne and Company, which was based in the City of London. He was consulting surveyor on the widening of Whitehall, ran the firm even before his father's death, and subsequently became a director of Prudential from about 1904 and Deputy chairman in 1917, then chairman from 1928 until his death in 1941. He was a member of the council of the British Overseas Bank, President of the Surveyor's Institution, and vice-president of the National Service League. He was also chairman of the Guildford and West Surrey Agricultural Association, a governor of Westminster Hospital and of his alma mater, Westminster School He was a generous benefactor to the school, donating to it the building of No. 17 Dean's yard, and was involved in the establishment of the Old Westminsters association for former pupils of the school. He entered local government, becoming chairman of the united vestries of St Margarets and St Johns, Westminster, and then served as a member of Westminster Borough Council, where he was Mayor in 1924. At the 1906 general election Horne stood unsuccessfully as a Unionist candidate in the Barnstaple division of Devon, a safe seat for the Liberal Party. At the January 1910 general election he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Guildford division of Surrey. He was re-elected in December 1910,Craig, British parliamentary election results 1885‚Äì1918, page 398 and was returned at the 1918 general election as a Coalition Unionist. He stood from the House of Commons at the 1922 general election. In the 1929 New Year Honours list, which had been delayed until March owing to the illness of King George V, it was announced that Horne was to be made a Baronet \\"for public and political services\\". The title was conferred on 30 March, with a territorial designation of \\"Shackleford, in the County of Surrey\\". Horne owned a sporting estate at Lairg in Sutherland, but lived in Hall Place, Shackleford, in Surrey. The estate included a lake and nearly all of the village. It covered and was put up for sale after the death in 1939 of Lady Horne. The agents described it as \\"a gentleman's pleasure farm\\". The Times reported that Lady Hall had \\"made the garden of Hall Place one of the prettiest in Surrey\\". However, a buyer had not been found by the following year, and Horne decided instead to let the house unfurnished, and sell the remaining land. The house was leased to a preparatory school called Aldro, which bought the freehold after his death, and the rest of the land was sold separately. He died on 26 September 1941, aged 85.

The road used to be called Park Street, and prior to that Burial Ground Road. History The Park Street Cemetery was one of the earliest non-church cemeteries in the world, and probably the largest Christian cemetery outside Europe and America in the 19th century. Opened in 1767 on what was previously a marshy area, the cemetery was in use until about 1830 and is now a heritage site, protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The cemetery was opened to relieve the pressure on the old burial ground in the heart of the city. The road leading to the cemetery came to be known as the Burial Ground Road but was subsequently renamed Park Street after the park around Vansittart's garden house. By the year 1785 the burial ground had been extended on the northern side of Park Street and by 1840 a vast new cemetery was opened to the east of the Lower Circular Road. The Europeans started to disuse it in the year 1790. It has been confirmed by a marble plaque at the gate which reads \\"South Park Street, Opened:1767, Closed:1790\\". Tollywood's Bengali film, Gorosthaney Sabdhan (literal translation: Beware in the cemetery) was shot here. The film was based on the novel of the same name by Satyajit Ray.

Among the interesting professions mentioned in the epitaphs are: breeder of cattle, jail-keeper, silversmith, schoolteacher, architect, translator, livery, printer, head tide-waiter, park superintendent, cooper, postmaster and surgeon. Grave 363 and the oldest This grave contains only the following epitaph, possibly indicating that the person wished to remain anonymous: \\"A virtuous mother (died 1825)\\". The oldest grave in this graveyard is of Mrs.S.Pearson.(1768) Features The tombs are a mix of Gothic and the rich flavour of the Indo-Saracenic style. Among the Indo-Saracenic tombs is a unique and composite brick structure built in the ‚Äòpanchyatana‚Äô manner, with a central dome flanked by miniature replicas of Orissan ‚Äòrekha deul‚Äô on four sides. Coupled with this peculiarity, the black basalt carvings on the frontal fa√ßade indicate a distinct respect for the Hindu faith. Controversies A well known business family wanted to turn the cemetery into an arts centre. The demolition work had begun in 1984 and the Calcutta High Court intervened and issued an order stopping further construction work. Nevertheless, substantial damage had already been done by then and many graves were lost. The grave of Charles Stuart was destroyed (and was later restored) and the demolition of Derozio's grave had been initiated, when, Justice Bagbati Banerjee of Calcutta High Court issued orders to stop further construction work. North Park Street Cemetery The former North Park Street Cemetery is now the site of the Assembly of God Church School and the Mercy Hospital with only a sole grave standing that recalls its past. The Lower Circular Road cemetery still exists today and is used for burial, although it has fewer monuments.

It was originally named the Transport Ensign, but soon became known as the Admiralty Ensign. In 1905, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) was formed, and, in 1922, was directed to fly this flag. (Up to that time, some captains had flown the Red Ensign.) In 1968, the RFA was awarded its own ensign, similar to the Admiralty Ensign, but with a vertical anchor. In 1974, various units that provided harbour services were amalgamated into the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service (RMAS), the Admiralty Ensign was renamed the Government Service Ensign and was flown by all Ministry of Defence-owned vessels that were not part of the Royal Navy, RFAS or RMAS. In 1996, most RMAS vessels were transferred to Serco Denholm, which operated them under a commercial contract, flying the Government Service Ensign.

The second-oldest surviving residence in Galveston, it is now on the National Register of Historic Places. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1964. The home was built in 1839 for Samuel May Williams, one of the founders of Galveston. The prefabricated house was shipped from Maine and constructed on off the ground, raised on ten piers. The 1.5-story house was topped with a cupola, where Williams installed a telescope so that he could be one of the first to learn when interesting cargo arrived by ship. After Williams' death in 1858, the house was sold to his friend, Phillip C. Tucker, and became known as the Tucker House. The Tucker family retained possession of the house until 1953. The house was purchased by, and became the first project of, the newly organized Galveston Historic Foundation. Restoration was partially funded by a grant from the Moody Foundation. In 2007, the executive director of the GHF, stated \\"I can hardly overemphasize the importance of this house, not only to Galveston and Texas history, but to the history and affections of our organization.\\" The house was opened to the public in 1959, restored to its original look in the late 1970s, and opened to regular tours in 1984. Attendance dropped from 25,000 to 1,000 visitors per year, and the museum was closed in 2007. The interiors were redesigned as part of an interior design showcase, and the house was offered for rent in 2008. It survived 2008's Hurricane Ike unscathed. Background Samuel May Williams moved to Mexican Texas in 1822 and soon began working as the secretary to Stephen F. Austin, the first empresario in Texas.Henson (1976), pp. 3-5. During the Texas Revolution (1835-1836), Williams and his business partner Thomas F. McKinney used $99,000 of their own funds to purchase supplies for the Texian Army; Williams also purchased the first ship in the Texas Navy, the schooner Invincible.Henson (1976), pp. 79-81. The war concluded with a Texian victory over Mexico, and the province known as Texas became an independent nation, the Republic of Texas. Between 1836 and 1838, McKinney and Williams worked with Michel B. Menard to get federal permission for the Galveston City Company to create a community on the eastern end of Galveston Island. In April 1838, Williams was named one of five directors of the company, which had permission to sell shares that could be redeemed for land or resold.Henson (1976), pp. 94-96. The new city of Galveston grew rapidly, with over 4,000 residents in 1840. The city was geographically isolated, with no fresh water. There was not a bridge to connect the island to the mainland, and water was delivered by steamer every day.Cartwright (1998), p. 77. Construction In late 1838, Williams won election to the Fourth Congress. He asked McKinney to supervise the building of a home for the Williams family.Henson (1976), p. 105. Like most of the wealthier residents in the city, Williams wished to live along the banks of McKinney's Bayou. His lot was located near the bayou at 35th Street and Avenue A, about west of the town. Williams had ordered a prefabricated house, which was shipped from Maine. It was built in the Greek Revival style, with some elements of classic Louisiana plantation architecture. To allow the house to better weather storms, it was elevated on ten brick piers.Cartwright (1998), p. 78. The bricks used for the piers were transported to Galveston as ballast on ships. The 1.5 story house was topped with a cupola and widow's walk. The first floor had long porches, and dormer windows adorned the attic. The cupola windows could be opened, allowing cool ocean breezes to enter the house. The house faces east, and had a large gallery on both the south and east sides. The downstairs consisted of a parlor, dining room, central hallway, and two bedrooms. Both the parlor and the front bedroom had French doors that opened onto the porch. The upstairs had four small bedrooms, each with a dormer. Classical wood columns supported the porch roof, and a white picket fence surrounded the house. A detached brick kitchen was in the rear, and on either side of the house were garden plots. Williams estimated that the house cost $7,472. Williams family residence For the next 20 years, Williams, his wife, and children lived in the house. Williams often lounged on the widow's walk. At this time, Galveston Island had few trees or tall buildings, and from the widow's walk Williams could see the Gulf. He could also watch the horse races at a nearby race track which he co-owned with McKinney. He installed a telescope on the widow's walk, pointed towards the harbor. It was customary for ships to flash signals as they approached land to inform the harbormaster of the types of cargo they carried. Williams used his telescope to examine approaching ships; if one flashed the signal of an interesting cargo, Williams would rush downtown to start trading. This gave him a competitive advantage over other merchants, who did not learn of the cargo until the ship was closer to shore. Partially as a result of this tactic, the McKinney & Williams commission house \\"was considered one of the wealthiest and most influential establishments in Texas\\". As Williams' wealth grew, he made his home more comfortable. He ordered portraits painted of both himself and his wife; these were hung in the parlor of the house. In a stable behind the house he kept two horses, a carriage, and a barouche. The family had four slaves, who lived in outbuildings near the kitchen.Henson (1976), p. 148. Williams died in the house on September 13, 1858, of what his doctor called \\"general debility\\".quoted in Henson (1976), p. 161. The funeral was held several days later at the house.Henson (1976), p. 161. Tucker family residence In 1859, Williams' children sold the house to a family friend, Philip C. Tucker, and it became known as the Tucker House.Henson (1976, p. 163. The same year, Galveston received train service to the mainland; three times a week people could travel via train to Houston. A fire in the 1890s destroyed the cupola and damaged some of the second story floors. The house survived the 1900 Galveston Hurricane, which devastated the island. After the storm, it was the second-oldest surviving house on the island. During the reconstruction of the city, the grade of the populated portion of the island was raised. Four feet (1.2 m) of sand was pumped under the house, giving it the appearance of having only piers. Preservation In the 1950s, the \\"Free State of Galveston\\" collapsed as law enforcement worked to eradicate corruption and illegal activity. As the city's gambling, prostitution, and illegal drinking establishments were closed, city leaders began to look for other means to attract tourists. This prompted an increased interest in historic structures.McComb (1986), p. 197. The Galveston Historic Foundation (GHF) was established in this decade, primarily to save the Williams house.Hardwick (2002), p. 147. To assist in preserving the house, the GHF received a grant from the Moody Foundation. The foundation had been established by Galveston resident William Lewis Moody, Jr. to support educational, scientific, religious, and health institutions in Texas.Wiencek et al (2010), p. 61. Its chairman, Mary Moody Northen, who was a member of the Texas Historical Commission advisory board, emphasized historic preservation.Wiencek et al. (2010), pp. 62, 64. The GHF restored the house, and in 1959 it opened to the public.McComb (1986), p. 198. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. After finishing the restoration, the GHF worked to restore other historical buildings in Galveston. The GHF absorbed the Galveston Historical Society shortly after, becoming one of the largest locally based groups focused on historic preservation in the United States. Author Susan Wiley Hardwick wrote that \\"The initial work of the GHF, preservation of the Williams home, set the stage for the preservation and redevelopment of the Strand commercial district, located one block from the harbor.\\" Museum Initially, the house was furnished with donated items. The GHF conducted extensive research in 1978 to determine the house's appearance during Williams' lifetime. The house was subsequently restored to its 1854 appearance, with a reconstructed cupola. It was reopened to the public for regular tours in 1984. In the 1980s, it received up to 25,000 visitors each year. For a time, the museum used innovative interpretive technology. As technology changed, however, the museum fell behind. New audiovisual systems and technology are expensive and, as with most historic house museums, a limited budget made it difficult to adapt. Jessica Foy Donnelly wrote in Interpreting historic house museums that \\"changing technology for audiovisual systems contributed to the failure [of the Williams house museum] to continue an exciting interpretive technique.\\"Donnelly (2002), p. 35. In 2004, the house received new landscaping, donated from the Hotel Galvez. In preparation for adding a new outdoor pavilion, the Galvez uprooted hundreds of shrubs and perennials. Many of these, including oleanders, daylilies, hibiscus, plumbago, agapanthus, and bougainvillea, were relocated to the grounds around the Williams house. Attendance slowly dwindled, and in the first nine months of 2007 the museum received only 1,000 visitors, each of whom paid about $3 per ticket. These funds were not enough to cover maintenance on the house. The museum closed permanently at the end of September 2007. Post-museum After closing its doors to the public, the house was used by the Texas Gulf Coast Chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers as a showcase. The home was redesigned at no cost to the GHF. Designers donated their time, and businesses and craftsmen donated an estimated $100,000 worth of materials and time. The redesigned house features wood floors, stenciling in the entryway, and faux crown molding in the dining room. The color palette is now blues, roses, soft yellow, and gold colors, and the furniture is a mix of period pieces-some originally owned by the Williams family-and contemporary furniture. The theater was converted to a kitchen, and the bathroom was upgraded with antique fixtures. After the showcase concluded, the GHF offered the house for lease. Tenants would also serve as curators and would be required to interview for the opportunity to live there. Tenants are requested to open the house or grounds occasionally. This is the first time that a group has leased a historic building with a newly redesigned interior. The home suffered minimal damage during Hurricane Ike, which hit Galveston in September 2008.Schmidt (2009), p.4. In early 2016 the GHF sold the house to Leah and Mariano Garcia-Blanco, who moved to Galveston from North Carolina in 2014 and who are restoring the interior of this home so important to Galveston and Texas. Legacy In 2007, Dwayne Jones, then executive director of the GHF, stated \\"I can hardly overemphasize the importance of this house, not only to Galveston and Texas history, but to the history and affections of our organization. The house inspired a generation of active, public-spirited Galvestonians to found what has grown into the largest local historic preservation group in the nation ‚Äî an organization that has had a profound effect on our community.\\" The house is reputed to be haunted by Williams. Tourists have reported feeling a cold draft and a presence outside the bedrooms of the children.Williams(2007), p. 32. A replica of the house was built in the Woodlands, a northern suburb of Houston, in the early 2000s. Homebuilder Insignia Homes chose six historic Texas houses, and built luxury replicas in a single neighborhood. Although the exterior is almost identical to the original Williams house, the interiors were redesigned to be more modern.

He was the son of Thomas Barbour Bryan. Through his father, he was both a member of the esteemed Barbour family and a great-great nephew of Daniel Boone. Bryan received his preparatory education there, subsequently becoming a student at the University of Virginia and later taking his degree in law at Columbian University (now George Washington University), Washington, D.C. From 1879 to 1883 he practiced his profession in Colorado and also took an active part in politics, being elected as a Republican to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1880. In 1883 he returned to his former home, Chicago, where he soon became a leader in State politics. He served as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1888 to 1897 and also served on the staffs of three successive governors of the State, in each instance with the rank of colonel. In 1891 and 1892 he made tours of Europe in the interest of the World's Columbian Exposition, making the acquaintance of many of the foremost rulers and statesmen of the countries visited. His diplomatic career really began in 1897, when he was appointed minister to China by President William McKinley. The following year he received the appointment as envoy to Brazil. In this role, he laid the firm foundation for the cordial relations between the United States and Brazil. In 1902 he was transferred to Switzerland, but in a few months thereafter (January 1903) he was given the more important post of minister to Portugal, where he remained for six years. In 1909 he was transferred as minister to Belgium, and after serving two years became ambassador to Japan.U.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian He retired from the diplomatic service in 1912, and later made his home in Washington and Chicago, dividing his time between the two cities.

Music=Album artwork Battersea Power Station with an inflatable pig in the 2011 campaign to reissue Animals. Author of a book on Battersea Power Station Peter Watts thinks one of the main reasons for the building's worldwide recognition is due to it having appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd's 1977 album, Animals. Developed by long-time Floyd collaborators design studio Hipgnosis, the album sleeve featured photography, taken in early December 1976, of the power station with the group's inflatable pink pig, named Algie, floating above it.Battersea Power Station: Electrifying design, BBC, Design Icons, 7 November 2013 The inflatable was made in Germany by Ballon Fabrik (aka the Zeppelin Airship company), to the design of Australian artist Jeffrey Shaw. The 30-foot (9-metre)-long pig was tethered between two of the power station's southern chimneys. During the shoot, it broke loose from its moorings and, to the astonishment of the pilots of approaching planes, rose into the flight path of Heathrow Airport. Police helicopters tracked its course, until it landed in Kent. Video footage of the photoshoot was used in the promotional video for the song \\"Pigs on the Wing\\". The album was officially launched at an event at the power station. The Pink Floyd image has been much referenced, parodied and paid homage to, for instance on: * The US cover of The Orb's 1991 album, Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld. * The back cover of Les Claypool's Frog Brigade's 2001 album, Live Frogs Set 2, which is a full cover of Pink Floyd's Animals.

He is, however, remembered primarily as an avid amateur photographer who helped found the Hawaiian Camera Club (1889‚Äì1893). His photographs of native peoples, landscape, family, and industry offer a unique pictorial record of Hawaii at the end of the 19th century. Early life Christian Hedemann was born in 1852 at Flensburg in Schleswig-Holstein, which at the time was part of the Kingdom of Denmark. He was the son of Christian August Ferdinand Hedemann (1810-1879), an eminent surgeon in the Danish army, and Caroline Amalie Cloos (1824-1867). After attending primary school in N√¶stved, he continued his education at Herlufsholm School and graduated with first class honours in mechanical engineering at the Polytechnic College in Copenhagen. After an apprenticeship in a machine shop, he was employed as a designer by Burmeister & Wain in Copenhagen (1874‚Äì78). In October 1877, he married Meta Marie Magdalena Nissen (1850-1952).\\"Biographies from Men of Hawaii transcribed for Genealogy Trails by Janice Rice: H - L\\". Retrieved 7 October 2010. Professional life in Hawaii The Hana home Christian Hedemann (1880) He arrived in Honolulu with his family in 1878 where, at the age of 25, he became chief engineer on a three-year contract at the Hana Sugar Plantation on the island of Maui. But instead of returning to Denmark at the end of his contract, in 1884 he joined the Honolulu Iron Works, the largest manufacturer of sugar mill machinery in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Initially a draftsman, he ultimately became the company's technical director.\\"From the King's Peaceful Copenhagen The Work of Danish Amateur Photographer Christian Hedemann in the Hawaiian Islands\\", Fund og Forskning, (1981-1990), Bind 29. Retrieved 7 October 2010. In 1903, he obtained American citizenship and, in 1909, was appointed Danish consul. In March 1917, he was decorated as a knight of the Order of Dannebrog. Amateur photographer Hedemann had taken a great interest in photography ever since he visited the World Exposition in Vienna in 1873 where many exhibits featured photography. Before leaving for Hawaii he acquired a camera of his own and learned the art of making images on glass plate negatives, using the wet plate collodion process. The first dated photograph is a view of his house with a Danish flag taken in Hana on 1 February 1880. It was followed by informal portraits of his growing family and home, as well as of the sugar mill, co-workers and friends. In 1883, he converted his carriage shed into a studio with removable roof sections to improve the light. This allowed him to take portraits not only of the native inhabitants, which proved invaluable to ethnic studies, but also of Chinese and Portuguese workers and a small colony of Scandinavians. Hawaiian pineapple field (tinted): Christian Hedemann (1880s) The photographs of his wife and seven children show how Danish traditions were maintained, for example in the children's clothing, while his photographs of the mills document the industrial evolution of the islands. Some of these were presented at the Hawaiian Government Exhibit at the Paris Exposition of 1889, demonstrating not only the progress of the plant, but also the industrial transformation of Hawaii. In January 1889, Hedemann was one of the founding members and the first president of the Hawaiian Camera Club, which brought amateur photographers from Honolulu together with those he had met during his travels around the islands. The club gave Hedemann the opportunity to follow and experiment with the latest techniques such as magnesium powder flash photography and photographic enlargements as well as the use of the so-called magic lantern. In 1892, when he first returned to Denmark, Hedemann took his lantern slide projector with him in order to show his new home to his family and friends. Hedemann died in Honolulu in 1932 leaving a collection of photographs which provide a record not only of his close-knit family and his faith in the industrial age but also of the islands themselves at the end of the 19th century.

As a duo, they released an acclaimed 1965 folk song album on Elektra Records, before pursuing separate careers. They have reunited to perform together on several occasions in recent years. Early career and recordings Kathy Larisch and Carol McComb began singing together when in high school at Vista, California, in the early 1960s. They both played guitar and autoharp, and claimed influences from Joan Baez, Gene Autry, and Tex Ritter, among others. They worked as a duo in Southern California folk clubs, sometimes opening for the likes of Bill Monroe, Taj Mahal and Phil Ochs, and performed regularly at the Ash Grove in Los Angeles. Folk musician Michael Cooney then introduced them to singer Mark Spoelstra, who in turn recommended them to Elektra producer Paul Rothchild. In mid-1964, after they had performed at the Berkeley Folk Festival, Joan Baez also recommended them to Rothchild, and he agreed to record a demo session with them. Elektra label boss Jac Holzman heard the recordings and agreed that they should make an album, which was recorded, with Rothchild producing, in the winter of 1964-65. Their debut album, Kathy & Carol, was released in April 1965. It contained mostly traditional British and American ballads, apart from one song written by Spoelstra. Paul Rothchild said of their album that it was \\"the most beautiful Renaissance ballad record I ever heard. It's just perfect. If you like Joan Baez, here's Joan Baez times two, with gorgeous harmony, singing purist songs like angels.\\" Elektra discography] Critic Richie Unterberger stated that \\"what made it stand out most from similar releases of the time were the pair's extraordinary close, high, and haunting harmonies.\\" McComb said later: \\"We would hear somebody like Bonnie Dobson or Joan Baez or Judy Collins do a song, and we would decide that we would want to do that song. But we never wanted to do anybody else's versions of the song. So we'd... find ourselves the best set of words we could, and we'd copy out various different melodies out of the songbooks... We would put together the best melody we could find with the best lyrics we could find, and that would be the Kathy & Carol version. We just didn't want to do it like anybody else did it.\\" The album was released shortly before the Newport Folk Festival, where the duo performed a song by Richard Fari√±a which was later released as part of the CD of the festival. They also began work to record a second LP, writing some of their own material and preparing to perform with a rock band - it is not known which one. However, in early 1966 Paul Rothchild was imprisoned on drug charges, and the album was never recorded. The pair did record for the small Folk-Legacy label, but that work was also unreleased because the duo's songs, by that time, were going beyond the traditional folk material in which the label specialised. Further material produced by Larry Murray of the band Hearts & Flowers was not released, and the duo also recorded unreleased material with both Linda Ronstadt and Rusty Young, later of Poco. In the late 1960s, the duo split up when Larisch decided to pursue a fine arts degree. Later careers Kathleen Larisch gave up her career in music, and later became a teacher of fine arts at California College of the Arts. She has exhibited work in the media of painting, printed textiles, prints on paper, and photography. Carol McComb continued to be an active performer. She played and toured with Mimi Fari√±a between 1969 and 1971, and released a solo album, Love Can Take You Home Again, in 1975. Between 1975 and 1980 she fronted a band called Moonstone, who released one album. Her solo albums included Tears into Laughter (1990) and Little Bit of Heaven (2000). She wrote and published the instructional book Country and Blues Guitar for the Musically Hopeless (1991), and has run folk guitar workshops in Palo Alto, California, as well as teaching guitar, harmony singing, voice and songwriting in the San Francisco Bay Area and at summer music camps nationwide. She also formed the Gryphon Quintet, and later the Gryphon Carollers with Ed Johnson and student members of a harmony singing class at Gryphon Stringed Instruments. Both the Quintet and the Carollers released albums, including They All Laughed (1983), Undecided (1985), Gryphon Quintet - Live! (1987), Winter's Gift (1997), and One December Night (2004). Carol has occasionally performed with Joan Baez and Linda Ronstadt. Ronstadt and McComb planned to release an album of their own, but it was never recorded due to health issues. Reissues and reunions Kathy & Carol was reissued by Collector's Choice Music in 2004. Following that, the pair reunited to perform at the California Autoharp Gathering in 2005 and 2006, and have also performed together at other events in California. They released another album, Keepsake, on Hazelwood Records in 2010. The album consists of traditional folk songs, some originally recorded by the Carter Family, and others written by McComb.

Lebanon, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1938 by John P. Harris of the Harris Amusement Company, and was in business until 2008. It is currently seeking funding to be renovated and reopened in the near future. History Pennsylvania State Senator John P. Harris formed the Harris Amusement Company in the 1920s, opening 15 theaters throughout the mid-Atlantic states. After his death in 1926, Harris‚Äô brother Denis Harris took over the Harris Amusement Company and formed the Denis Theatre in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. The $250,000 Functional-Moderne-style building was designed by architect Victor Rigaumont and erected in 114 days. Opening night was June 1, 1938. The Pittsburgh Press, reviewing the theater after attending the opening, was impressed by the theater‚Äôs air conditioning system and its distinguished Carrara structural glass front. In 1960, the theater was sold to Ernest A. Stern, owner and president of Associated Theaters, along with several other theaters previously owned by Harris. In 1965, a second auditorium was built within the theater, opening as an art house, which was called the Encore Theatre Associated Theaters was sold to Cinemette in 1974, but the latter company declared bankruptcy just four years later. Stern was able to regain possession of the theater, as well as several others he had sold, that same year. The Main Denis auditorium was ‚Äútwinned‚Äù in 1981, with the main projection booth being relocated to the front of the balcony, and the remaining balcony became a small auditorium. At this time Denis had four screens. Associated Theaters was sold to Jeff Lewine of Cinema World in 1988, though Stern was able to retain ownership of the Denis building. Stern‚Äôs son Richard gained ownership of the building after his father died, and in 1993 Stern grouped it with the local Manor and Bellevue theaters and formed CineMagic. Between 1994 and 2004, Stern's son formed a business partnership with Milo Ritton, who took possession of the Denis after their partnership dissolved. In 2007, the Denis was put on the market and purchased by D. Raja, a Mt. Lebanon entrepreneur. Subsequently, the Denis Theatre Foundation was formed as a non-profit organization. The Foundation signed a 15-year lease in 2008, with plans to renovate and reopen the theater. The Foundation purchased the theater outright in 2010. Vision and Mission Statement Mission Statement: The Denis Theatre enriches and educates the community through distinctive and engaging film and arts programming. Vision for the New Denis Theatre: The Denis Theatre Foundation and its associates plan for the Denis Theatre to function primarily as an art house with two main theaters with capacities of two- and one-hundred seats and a smaller screening and lecture room which will seat up to forty people. As well as showing a variety of independent, foreign, and documentary-type films, the theater will act as a venue for film students, film festivals, a place to showcase regional and local art year-round and will house a lounge for patrons, several small meeting rooms, and a stage available to local bands and other small performance groups. The Denis Theatre Foundation plans to bring more jobs to the business district of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Planning and Construction After buying the building for $668,750, the Denis Theatre Foundation outlined a plan to reopen the Denis Theatre on Monday, April 28, 2008. They estimated a total of $3 million to fund the project, which is currently up to $4.5 million. In 2010, the Denis Theatre Foundation broke down the project into two phases. This first phase includes opening one screen, updating or replacing basic systems, and installing an elevator. The second phase of renovation includes opening two more screens, restoring the stage, and adding meeting rooms. For the first phase to be complete, an estimated $2.5 million will be needed. After reviewing the plans, the foundation‚Äôs board decided to make some modifications. The first phase will include renovating the first floor theaters and then adding a learning center/screening room so that more movies can be screened and events held. These changes cut the costs of renovation, as no elevator would be needed until a later phase of construction. In the meantime, the first floor will be accessible by ramp. The costs of the newly modified first phase add up to around $1.8 million. Balog Steines Hendricks & Manchester Architects Inc. of Youngstown, Ohio is the chosen architect for the renovation and NEXT Architecture of Pittsburg has provided designs for the project. Construction began in October 2014. Fundraising and Donations In order to fund the renovations and construction, the Denis Theatre Foundation launched a series of capital campaigns ranging in goals, the most recent being $1 million, with an expected 2017 reopening. The first donors to contribute to the foundation were the D. Raja and his wife, Neeta, the owners who purchased the theatre in 2007 to prevent the building from being converted into an office complex. They gave a generous $5,000 back to the foundation after the Denis Theatre was bought. Other donations include a $100,000 grant from the Pittsburgh Foundation and an anonymous $155,000 challenge grant. In December 2015, the Foundation received an anonymous donation of $145,000 after reaching its year-end goal of raising $290,000. This triggered an additional $25,000 donation from the Lawrence and Rebecca Stern Family Foundation. A list of donors ranging in price from $100 to $100,000 and above is listed on the Denis Theatre Foundation website. Present Use While the Denis theatre currently serves under a 1-year, one million dollar revitalization plan, the foundation hosts programming in temporary locations in order to build community interest, including a film discussion series in spaces around the municipality and, as of fall 2014, a movie-focused art therapy program for senior citizens at the Mt. Lebanon Public Library. The Denis foundation‚Äôs offices and apartment buildings' community rooms around Mt. Lebanon host ‚ÄúReel to Real‚Äù discussions about eight times a year, where film buffs watch a movie and discuss it. Those screenings will eventually move to the main theater with discussions and refreshments in the learning center.

Pace's work as Abstract Expressionist during the 1950s, first displayed in New York at the Artists Gallery, was described by The New York Times as consisting of \\"dark, energetically worked abstractions achieved through a distinctive blend of brushwork, drawing and staining\\". Time he spent in Pennsylvania and Maine led Pace to create representational pieces depicting outdoor scenes, such as lobstermen and of his wife while she was gardening, as well as interiors and nudes done in his studio. Though his work often appeared to have been painted very quickly, Pace was often able to make subtle corrections, saying of himself that \\"You might call me a fake Zen painter\\".

History In February 1973, a small group of Chicago women founded Women Employed (WE), through an initiative of the Loop YWCA. Organizers intended to mobilize networks of female workers around the common issues that affect their lives.Evans, Sara Margaret. Born for Liberty: A History of Women in America. p. 299. Women Employed's first major public event, attended by over 200 women, was a meeting of 26 of Chicago's leading corporations to discuss fair employment policies for women.Women Employed, Women and Work: Shaping the Future, June 1993. In its first year, WE published Working Women in the Loop ‚Äì Underpaid, Undervalued, an investigation that used 1970 U.S. Census data on wages and employment patterns to expose substantial inequalities between women and men. The study found that women made up 45% of downtown Chicago's labor force, yet earned only 25% of wages.Women Employed, Working Women in the Loop ‚Äì Underpaid, Undervalued, 1973.

In full, the formation numbers 16 harpists, of whom 12 are women. An important role in characterizing the sound of Celtic Harp Orchestra goes to the voice of soprano Donatella Bortone, who joined the group in 2003, after having worked with Fabius Constable in an earlier project, \\"Fir Soar\\", CHO is considered the largest Celtic harp orchestra in Europe. History On July 4, 2002, during the International Festival of art, culture and music, \\"Celtica\\", on a stage set up in the woods of Peuterey, at the foot of Mont Blanc, a group called Harpe Diem performed for the first time. It was an extemporized formation of 44 harpists of all levels, from beginners to internationally acclaimed musicians, such as Briton Myrdhin, who had accepted the invitation of Fabius Constable to play harp together. The concert was held in front of 4000 people. This first success was the beginning of the history of Celtic Harp Orchestra. The group was then organized. A repertoire, initially composed of ancient melodies and traditional Irish music, was selected and the orchestra began to rehearse and perform together. Since then, Celtic Harp Orchestra has given many concerts in Italy (at Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome, in various conservatories and universities, including Bocconi, the Compagnia Humanitaria in Milan, Villa Erba, Villa Olmo, Villa Balbianello on Lake Como, Vittoriale degli Italiani, the festival Mi.To.) and abroad with concerts in Spain, Switzerland, France, Ireland (at Trinity College in Dublin), Germany, Britain, China, Japan and Korea. Alongside touring there has been an intensive recording activity, that led to the release of four albums. Discography=Got the Magic The first album, Got the Magic was released in 2003 and is a \\"live concert without an audience\\", organized by Svana Sound Recordings at Rocca Brivio Sforza, a villa of the 17th century, surrounded by an impressive park, not far from Milan. The sounds on the CD were left unchanged: there are no cuts and no equalizations in the post-production. In the background, are distinctly audible the sounds of nature, that come to be part of the music, in which harping and traditional tunes are predominant. The Myst In spring 2005, The Myst was produced: an expression of musical and personal evolution of the group. It was the first real session in a recording studio for the orchestra. Amplifying and recording parts for such a large number of harps, as well as other instruments (\\"The Myst\\" saw the cooperation of nearly 40 musicians, including guest stars) required over 200 hours of hard work at Suonovivo Studios, near Bergamo. This second release gives room to a more diverse repertoire, comprising some rearranged traditional tunes and original compositions by Fabius Constable, echoing the most various influences, from tango to classical music, from folk to more introspective songs, like \\"A bigger dream \\" and the title track \\"The Myst\\". Tale of the Fourth In 2008, Celtic Harp Orchestra released the third CD, Tale of the Fourth: a concept album related to the Fibonacci sequence of numbers. It represents a further change in musical style, as some of the new tracks were composed while Fabius Constable was on tour in the Far East, and later rearranged with the addition of a typical rock trio: electric guitar, bass guitar and drums. This recording session was held at Auditoria Records, near Como, paving the way for the lasting collaboration with producer Aki Chindamo. The third album, although containing some Irish classics, including Constable‚Äôs variations of \\"Greensleeves\\" and \\"O'Carolan's Concerto\\", is far from the canons of traditional music. Harp sound, which is strongly distinctive of CHO, is in fact interpreted and mixed in an innovative way, with sounds such as Moog and Hammond. An experiment that was worth the nomination of Tale of the Fourth for best album and best recording at Prog Academy Awards in 2008. Three Letters to the Moon The intense touring of the next two years, gave birth, in 2010, to Three Letters to the Moon. The first part of the CD, Letter From The Sleeper, contains solo compositions by Fabius Constable. It emphasizes a more intimate and reflective style, resembling influences of Japanese, North African and Celtic music. The second part, Letter From The Dreamers, has a massive sound impact, with the orchestra to the full, the presence of the choir and the rock trio, already successfully tested in Tale of the Fourth. In the Letter from Inferno, finally, some new compositions are presented, never recorded before, but often performed during live shows, with enthusiastic response from the audience. They are compositions of part of the Dante's Dream Project, by Fabius Constable and Donatella Bortone, in which some of the most famous poems of Dante's Inferno (such as the V canto, with the moving love story of Paolo and Francesca) were set to music.

The three-story Second Empire style building was erected in 1875, and is one of the small community's largest 19th-century buildings and one of its architecturally most significant. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Brooklin IOOF Hall is a three-story wood frame structure located a short way west of the center of Brookin on Maine State Route 175. It has a mansard hip roof with gabled dormers, and is basically rectangular, except for a projecting stairwell at the northwest corner. The main facade faces east, and is divided into two bays, separated by a brick chimney sheathed in weatherboard up to the roof, and then with a slightly projecting roof section built around it. The first floor of the building is divided into two storefronts, with entrances near the outer corners and windows toward the center, their interior finished in tongue-and-groove woodwork on the walls and ceilings. The second floor was designed as a community auditorium space, with plaster walls and a tongue-and- groove ceiling. The lodge space on the third floor is more elaborate, with a medallion in the ceiling, and retaining its original regalia, including benches, seats, and podium. The hall was built in 1896, and remains one of the small town's largest and architecturally most distinguished buildings. The principal alterations since its construction include the addition of the chimney to the front of the building, and the conversion of what was originally a four-story tower to what is now the stairwell. At the time of its listing on the National Register in 1990, it was still in active use by the local chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows.

Dick Wilson became Tribal Chairman in 1972 and began a \\"reign of terror\\" on the reservation. Wilson favored mixed‚Äìblood residents and close family and friends for positions in his office and created a special enforcing unit, known as the \\"Goon Squad\\", to police the region. This Goon Squad soon began to terrorize the residents of the reservation who openly spoke out against Wilson or disagreed with him, especially those who were pure‚Äìblooded Indians. Many attempts were made at impeaching Wilson, but Wilson always interfered and subsequently kept his position by sending out his Goon Squad to stamp out the residents who dared try to impeach him. \\"The past administrations all along have been pretty sly and crooked with Indian funds,\\" said Gladys, \\"but they weren't quite as hard on us as this drunken fool we got now.\\"Peter Matthiessen, In the Spirit of Crazy Horse (Viking Penguin, 1983,'92). Calico Hall On February 27, 1973, the traditionalists and others from Pine Ridge that were persecuted by Wilson's administration gathered at Calico Hall to discuss what was to be done about their situation. Attending the meeting were two leaders of AIM, Russell Means and Dennis Banks, who were invited there to hear the people and see if they could help them with the injustice happening on the reservation. Many people talked at Calico but two of the most influential speakers were Ellen Moves Camp and Gladys Bissonette. Gladys eloquently spoke for twenty minutes, asking AIM to come to Pine Ridge and help them fight the injustice; she stated \\"for many years we have not fought any kind of war, we have not fought any kind of battle, and we have forgotten how to fight.\\" After Gladys and Ellen Moves Camp spoke, Chief Frank Fools Crow declared that the group at Calico Hall should go to Wounded Knee to protest. Wounded Knee Occupation That night on February 27, 1973, a caravan of cars made its way to Wounded Knee. The subsequent occupation of the village lasted 71 days. During the occupation, Gladys Bissonette worked at the health clinic established there and was one of the negotiators with Kent Frizzell, the Assistant Attorney General selected to negotiate with the occupiers. Bissonette adamantly argued with Frizzell over the terms of the cease fire and what would happen after Wounded Knee. She stressed that the reason all the protesters were at Wounded Knee was because the government gave them no other way to get their attention. She stated in one round of negotiations that \\"we have wrote letters, we have sent phone calls ‚ÄîI know, I did myself. We have made statements to our Congressmen. We asked, we begged, that Pine Ridge be investigated. It never was done.\\" The Wounded Knee occupation finally ended on May 8, 1973. Life After Wounded Knee After Wounded Knee, Gladys went back to Pine Ridge but was put on trial by the U.S. courts. Pedro Bissonette, another activist in the Wounded Knee Occupation and Gladys Bissonette's adopted son, was killed on October 1, 1973. Tragedy struck again on March 30, 1975 when Richard Eagle, Gladys Bissonette's grandson, was killed while playing with a loaded gun kept for protection from the Goon Squad. Gladys died not many years later.

The fault zone intersects the East Rift near the Pauahi Crater and extends nearly in an east-northeast direction towards the westernmost boundary near Mauna Iki and the Southwest Rift Zone. Boundaries of the Koa‚Äôe Fault Zone also cover in a north-south orientation along the length. It is believed that the fault zone has been active for tens of thousands of years. The area is infrequently visited by park patrons due to the lack of eruptive activity and closure of certain areas to the general public. Features The Koa‚Äôe Fault Zone contains numerous thrust fault scarps and ground cracks that are slowly moving towards the Pacific Ocean. The area is covered with pahoehoe lava flows dated between 700 and 500 years old. The exact number of lava flows in this region is debatable. Numerous exposed scarps have very poor distinctions between various lava flows due to weathering of the basalt. Because Kilauea has erupted explosively in the past, the Koa‚Äôe Fault Zone is also covered with tephra deposits. The stratigraphy of the sediments contains many clues to the eruptive history of Kilauea Volcano. *A layer of scoria overlies the basaltic lava flows. The age of these deposits has been determined to be roughly 400 years old. Groundwater penetration into Kilauea most likely created a steam explosion followed by an eruption of these tephra deposits. *Above the scoria is a layer of orange ash roughly thick. The fined grained texture of the ash also suggests an explosive style of eruption sometime after the tephra was deposited. Biologists believe that this layer of ash served as a soil horizon for native and invasive plants to colonize the area. *The top layer is a sandy material which is also the product of an explosive eruption. Large ground cracks in the Koa'e Fault Zone on Kilauea Volcano In order to get a stratigraphy like this, a large eruption with tephra reaching the jet stream is required, suggesting that energetic pyroclastic eruptions have occurred in the past, making Kilauea significantly more hazardous than once thought. Fault scarps in the Koa‚Äôe Fault Zone create a Horst and Graben type of terrain. Some of the scarps (called ‚Äúpali‚Äù in native Hawaiian) face northwards, towards the summit of Kilauea Volcano and Halema ªuma ªu Crater. This is unusual because the scarps usually face in the direction of flow. Monitoring data of the fault zone has revealed that at the Pacific Ocean, the land mass is moving at a rate of per year. In the upper regions of the fault zone, the crust is moving at a rate of annually. This vast difference in movement rates has over time created numerous antiforms in the region. Kulanaokuaiki Pali is the southernmost fault in the Koa‚Äôe Fault Zone. During a period of intense earthquakes in December 1965, Kulanaokuaiki Pali was vertically displaced by more than meters. The region has been intensively studied since then. Displacements in other parts of the Koa‚Äôe Fault Zone based on historical data suggest that movements as great as have occurred. Mechanics An antiform created by ground movement in the Koa'e Fault Zone. The Koa‚Äôe Fault Zone is one of the most active fault zones in the entire world. The massive weight of Kilauea is largely responsible for the movement along the Koa‚Äôe Fault Zone as well as the East and Southwest Rift Zones. Some scientists have interpreted the Koa‚Äôe Fault System as a break away structure as a direct result from the southward displacement of the southern flank of Kilauea. The mobility is caused by gravitational forces acting on the massive weight of the volcano as well as the forceful injection of magmatic dikes into the East and Southwest Rift Zones. Bathymetric contouring of the seafloor off the south coast of the Big Island, have revealed that massive landslides have occurred in Kilauea's past, most likely as the result of rifting and catastrophic collapse.

The school buildings sandwich a river which flows from Angola to the Kunene River. On its shores there is the well-known fig tree omukwiyugwemanya, this name is derived from he nature of the tree, the fact that it grew on a rock. Oshigambo High School is one of the oldest schools in the northern part of Namibia. It first came into existence in 1960 and was in good management of its first principal Toivo Tirronen, a Finnish national. Oshigambo High School is a missionary and church school of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia. In 2006, Oshigambo River broke its banks for the first time in 50 years. The flood water separated the school from its hostel; learners and teachers who stayed at the other side of the river had to either pass through the river at own risk, or had to walk a distance of about 3 km to get to school. A bridge had been promised to be built by President Hifikepunye Pohamba. The school receives voluntary teachers from the United States every 2 years. They mostly cater for the Math and Science subjects. It has about 20 teachers, of which most are foreigners and about 300 learners.

The fierce skirmish known as the Battle of the Trough occurred about a mile and a half away the same year. The existing Federal style house, built just after the American Revolution, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. According to the Geographic Names Information System, Fort Pleasant was also known throughout its existence as \\"Fort Hopewell\\" and \\"Waggener's Lower Fort.\\" (The latter name distinguished it from Fort Buttermilk, also known as \\"Fort Waggener\\", about 5 miles upstream and also built by Capt. Waggener in 1756.) It was also sometimes called \\"Fort Van Meter\\", a name now commonly given to another Van Meter family fort some nine miles downstream at the northern end of The Trough which was built around the same time. History The house in 2013 18th century Settlement (1740s) The area around Fort Pleasant was first settled by Isaac Van Meter (ca. 1692-1757), his wife Annetje Wynkoop, and their four children in 1744, at which time the family constructed a fortified log cabin there.Isaac B. Van Meter's grandfather was Joost Jansen Van Metern (or John Van Meter; 1656-1706) who had been born in Gelderland Polder, the Netherlands and died in Salem County, New Jersey. George Washington first visited the \\"Indian Old Fields\\" (as the area was called) as a teenager and conversed with Isaac Van Meter there in 1747-48 while he was surveying Lord Fairfax's land grant.Koontz, Louis K. (1925), The Virginia Frontier, 1754-1763; The Johns Hopkins Press. Washington recorded in his journal that he met with \\"Mr Vanmetrise\\" on behalf of Fairfax, who asserted that the Van Meter tract was part of his own South Branch Manor (a part of the Northern Neck Proprietary). Van Meter insisted that he had the land on the authority of the Virginia Council grants of 1730 and that they had nothing to do with Fairfax's grant. (Subsequent litigation played out until well after the Revolution, at which time the Van Meter heirs finally prevailed.)US Dept of the Interior, Op. cit. Hostilities (1750s) In 1756, at the outset of the French and Indian War, a large new fort and its supporting structures were erected on Isaac Van Meter's property by Captain Thomas Waggener under orders from now Colonel George Washington. The fort was first known by the name of the Van Meter family, which had also assisted in its initial construction and maintenance. It was a substantial palisaded defense enclosing a blockhouse and log houses. (Washington's written instructions indicated a quadrangular shape with 90-foot-long walls, bastions in the corners, barracks, and a magazine.) Fort Pleasant was one in a chain of forts that ran along the frontier of the Allegheny Mountains and for a time it served as the local headquarters for the Virginia Regiment on the South Branch. It was never attacked directly by Indians but several raids occurred nearby. Soon after its construction, the Battle of the Trough (1756) took place a short distance to the north in and around the large river gorge known as The Trough. In 1757, working unprotected in his fields, Isaac Van Meter was attacked, scalped, and killed by Indians of the Delaware and Shawnee tribes. Renovations (1770s & '80s) There exists a map/drawing of Fort Pleasant signed by James Witt and dated May 1770.It is on file at the Hardy County Library. The drawing shows blockhouses at the corners of the fort, suggesting that the structure was either remodeled or totally rebuilt sometime after the end of the War. After the 1777 founding of Moorefield to its south, the fort was known as \\"Town Fort\\" due to its proximity to the new town. When Washington was in the region for the last time ‚Äî he visited Abraham Hite at Old Fields on 28‚Äì29 September 1784 ‚Äî he observed that the Fort Pleasant blockhouse was still standing.Koontz, Op. cit. Eventually, Isaac's son Garrett Van Meter (1732-1788) had most of the old fort and original family cabin removed and built a strong brick structure ‚Äî half above ground and half below ‚Äî in place of them for defensive purposes. (Parts of this unwieldy structure, connected by enclosed steps, still exist.)US Dept of the Interior, Op. cit. The \\"Great House\\" (1790s) The large brick house at Fort Pleasant was completed by Garrett's son, Isaac B. Van Meter (1757-1837), and his wife Elizabeth Inskeep Van Meter, before the end of the 18th century. (It was built on the very site of the old fort, thus both Fort and house bore the name \\"Fort Pleasant\\".) The impressive residence is a massive double-chimney Federal-style building constructed of clay bricks fabricated on the Fort Pleasant farm. Its \\"giant order\\" columns ‚Äî colossal columns spanning two stories ‚Äî were among the first such features in the region and Fort Pleasant mansion acquired a reputation as one of the \\"great houses\\" of the South Branch Valley. 19th century A portion of the old fort apparently survived Garrett Van Meter's renovations and the construction of the great house by his son. When Samuel Kercheval (1767-1845), the local historian, visited the site in 1830, he remarked that \\"one of the block- houses, with portholes was still standing, and the logs particularly sound\\".Kercheval, Samuel (1833), A History of the Valley of Virginia, Winchester, Virginia: Samuel H. Davis Thus, the last vestiges of the old fort did not vanish until later in the 19th century. Other Van Meter settlements Fort Pleasant is one of five significant VanMeter family dwellings in the Old Fields area; the others are Traveler's Rest, Fort Van Meter, the Garrett VanMeter House, and Buena Vista Farms.

The Modular Handgun System was solicited by a Request for Proposals in September 2015 and is anticipated to be the next U.S. military standard side arm replacing the Beretta M9 pistol and the SIG Sauer M11. The U.S. Marine Corps also participated in the program to have input on source selection, but likely will not order the resulting weapon until their current pistols' life-cycles end in the mid-2020s. The competition was first announced in 2011, but multiple delays pushed the solicitation deadline to February 2016. SIG Sauer's entry was declared the winner on January 19, 2017, with plans to begin fielding before the end of that year. The XM17 and XM18 versions of the SIG Sauer P320 were chosen for the full size and compact pistol versions. After acceptance into service the handguns received the designations M17 and M18, respectively. They are configurable to receive suppressors and even though the 9mm was chosen, they can be adapted to fire other calibers such as .357 SIG and .40 S&W.; All weapons are planned to be delivered in a period of 10 years. Rationale Glock 19X proposed by Glock Ges.m.b.H. The main reason for the program is the same as the Colt M1911A1 replacement by the Beretta M9 previously: the pistols were at the end of their service life and wearing out. All firearms have a finite life cycle. While parts such as the barrel, grips, springs, pins, and others can be replaced, the frame cannot and eventually becomes unserviceable. The M9, in service since the late 1980s, is approaching this limit. Examples in service are showing signs of terminal wear, and rather than replacing them with newly built M9s, the Army decided to opt for a new weapon to address design weaknesses. Special Forces use pistols more often and reach the end of the M9's service life relatively quickly, and regular troops are also reaching their handguns' lifecycle end through sheer age. Special operators have opted for other side arms like the SIG Sauer P226 and P228 (Navy SEALs), the Glock 19 (Army Rangers), or modernized variants of the M1911 (Delta Force, Force Recon). Conventional soldiers have problems with M9 features, or perceived lack thereof, including no accessory rail or suppressor attachment, an ergonomically poor grip, a heavy trigger pull, poor safety selector placement, and an open slide that lets in debris and can cause a malfunction. Requirements The U.S. Army initially required the MHS to be more effective, accurate, and reliable than the M9 pistol. The MHS requirement called for a non-caliber specific weapon with modular features to allow for the adaption of different fire control devices, pistol grips, and alternate magazine options. The weapon will fit various hand sizes and will mount targeting enablers using Picatinny rails. The new weapon will incorporate detection avoidance by having a non-reflective neutral color and will be operable with a suppressor in place. In January 2013, the Army released a Request for Information (RFI) to assess available handgun technologies and U.S. small arms industrial production capacity for the Modular Handgun System. The announcement seeks information ‚Äúon potential improvements in handgun performance in the areas of accuracy and dispersion out to 50 meters, terminal performance, modularity, reliability, and durability in all environments.‚Äù The handgun should have a 90 percent or more chance of hitting in a 4-inch circle out to 50 meters consistently throughout the weapon's lifetime. Ergonomic design should minimize recoil energies and control shot dispersion. Features include, but are not limited to, compatibility with accessory items to include tactical lights, lasers, and sound suppressors. Full ambidextrous controls are required and there was interest in ergonomic designs that could be controlled by female shooters. There was no specific caliber, but terminal ballistics at 50 meters through 35.56 cm (14 inches) of ballistics gel will assess lethality compared to M882 9mm FMJ rounds. Specific interest was given to pistols that can accommodate higher chamber pressures over 20 percent greater than Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI) specification for the cartridge without degradation of reliability. The RFI calls for 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages, 10,000 mean rounds between failures, and a 35,000 round service life. Manufacturers are asked to provide production capacity estimates on minimum and maximum monthly rates, as well as the lead times to achieve those rates. Estimated pricing was requested for quantities of 250,000 to 550,000 handguns. Development The requirement for the new pistol originated with the MHS program initiated by the Air Force in 2008. It has received Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validation. The MHS program was to select a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) handgun in fiscal year (FY) 2011‚Äì2012. Testing was to be completed by FY2013 and type classification was expected in FY2014. Testing and evaluation of replacement pistols were expected to begin in early 2014. The new pistol will also be carried by more soldiers, namely squad and team leaders. A three-year test and evaluation will determine if a COTS contender can replace all 239,000 M9s, as well as the concealable M11. The program was in conjunction with the Air Force. The House Armed Services Committee was pushing to upgrade the M9 rather than pursue a new program. Project officers believed buying a new pistol would be cheaper than improving and maintaining the M9 and offers designs that outperform it. The three-year Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase will test a variety of capabilities including accuracy, dispersion, compatibility, and corrosion resistance. Pistols will be tested in extreme weather and extreme combat conditions. A Request for Proposals (RFP) was expected to be issued in January 2014. The Army plans to buy 265,000 new pistols. The Army held an industry day for the MHS on 29 July 2014. The program looked to replace the entire handgun system, which includes the gun, ammo, holster, and some other parts. Owing to the poor reception of the 9mm NATO cartridge in combat zones like Iraq and Afghanistan, the program was an open-caliber competition to evaluate larger rounds like the .40 S&W; and .45 ACP or more powerful rounds like the .357 SIG or FN 5.7√ó28mm. Although the objective was for a round with better terminal ballistics, the argument for adopting a larger bullet has disadvantages. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and certain police forces have reversed earlier decisions to replace their 9mm pistols with ones chambered for .40 S&W; because the heavier bullet and greater recoil caused excessive wear and frame damage. Law enforcement personnel have found that even marginally larger pistol rounds are still too underpowered to kill a person with one shot, and that smaller rounds allow for better shot placement when firing rapidly. Beretta has submitted changes and product improvements to the M9 system, like the M9A1 accepted by the U.S. Marine Corps in 2006, but the Army has maintained that the M9 system does not meet their MHS requirements. The MHS competition was planned to be launched in January 2015 with the release of a final solicitation. Some 280,000 standard pistols will be ordered, as well as 7,000 compact versions, with deliveries to begin in 2017. Other military services participating in the program may order an additional 212,000 systems. Previously-held industry days allowed interested companies to suggest ways and ideas that the Army can improve the plan and process, some of which were adopted into the program. Test firings in simulated combat scenarios will be performed by over 550 military personnel from all services to provide feedback on the performance of each candidate system. In December 2014, Beretta announced the M9A3, which was submitted via an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) in accordance with the terms of the current M9 contract. A modified version of the existing M9A1, the new model features a thinner grip, MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, removable tritium sights, threaded barrel, and a sand-resistant 17-round magazine, produced in a dark earth tone color. Beretta claims likely cost savings over the standard M9 model and meeting almost all of the enhanced handgun requirements. Later that month, the Army decided not to evaluate the M9A3 in favor of pursuing the MHS program, without asking any questions about the upgraded pistol or requesting a sample. Army weapons officials maintain that the M9 design does not meet requirements and a cost-benefit analysis determined the old fleet would cost more to replace and repair than buying a new service pistol. Beretta claims M9A3 upgrade features fix most of the complaints and could be sold for less than the cost of previous M9 versions; the company has suggested a dual-path strategy to evaluate commercially available options while simultaneously evaluating improvements.  Request for proposal  The Army delayed the MHS RFP until after January 2015 \\"to allow for improvements to the RFP as a result of feedback received from Industry;\\" the second draft solicitation for the XM17 was released on 8 June 2015 following the Defense Department's decision to allow use of special purpose ammunition. Testing of three versions was planned to be conducted through 2017. Full-Rate Production would begin in 2018, with 280,000 standard pistols M17 for the Army (replacing the Beretta M9), 212,000 for other services, and 7,000 compact M18 versions for soldiers (replace SIG Sauer M11). In a departure from an over one century old battlefield practice, a legal review from the Pentagon has allowed the Army to consider expanding and fragmenting ammunition, such as hollow-point bullets, for the XM17. Though not a signatory to the 1899 Hague Convention that barred bullets with exposed lead tips, or expanding rounds on the battlefield, the U.S. has generally observed the agreement, although it has reserved the right to use the bullet type \\"where it saw a need,\\" such as United States Army Criminal Investigation Command, Military Police, and Special Forces. The Army claims expanding use to regular troops supports the international law principles of preventing excessive collateral effects, since expanding bullets transfer most of their energy into a target and usually do not pass through a body, and that legal standards have changed since the convention in an era of asymmetric warfare. Some complaints about the M9 involve its 9mm Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) round having insufficient stopping power, so a move to expanding bullets could allow more lethality without switching to a different caliber. Army Contracting Command released the official MHS RFP on 28 August 2015. The maximum program value of the XM17 contract could be worth up to $580 million. The competition was open caliber to allow submissions chambered in larger rounds; the solicitation does not specifically mention expanding bullet use, but it also does not prohibit it. Each manufacturer can submit two gun/ammunition combinations if they are differing calibers. Interested vendors had until late January 2016 to submit bids, one year after the RFP was originally planned to be released. Competitors Twelve pistols were entered into the competition: *: Beretta did not enter the improved M9A3, instead competing with their new APX striker-fired pistol. *: CZ P-07 MHS and P-09 MHS chambered in 9 mm NATO and .40 S&W.; *: FN Herstal entered a polymer- framed, striker-fired pistol, apparently based on the FN FNS, and from which the FN 509 Tactical was developed. *: Glock 17 MHS and 19 MHS chambered in 9 mm NATO, Glock 22 MHS and 23 MHS chambered in .40 S&W;, respectively. *: KRISS USA announced its entry into the program using a variant of their Sphinx SDP chambered in 9mm NATO. *: SIG Sauer P320 MHS, a modified version of the P320. *: Smith & Wesson M&P; M2.0; in co-operation with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems. *: STI and Detonics Defense STX. Sturm, Ruger & Co. designed a pistol series, the Ruger American Pistol, based on the specifications of the MHS, but ultimately declined to formally submit any variant of it for consideration. A down-selection to three weapon systems was expected to be made in August 2016, leading the way into a nine-month Production Verification Test (PVT) program. Following the successful conclusion of the PVT, a preferred bidder was intended to be selected ahead of low-rate initial production and first deliveries to U.S. armed forces.  MHS contract awarded to SIG Sauer  The Army Times reported on January 19, 2017, that the contract for the new US handgun had been awarded to SIG Sauer Inc. on January 18, 2017. Several news sources at the 2017 Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show, as well as SIG Sauer, stated that the SIG Sauer P320 had been selected as the winner of the $580.217 million contract, for both full- sized M17 and compact M18 models. The 9 mm version of the pistol was chosen, with the contract allowing the government to purchase XM1152 FMJ and XM1153 Special Purpose (SP) ammunition and training rounds. An Army press release stated, \\"The Army determined that this MHS (full size handgun, compact handgun, ammunition, and ancillary components) was the best value in terms of its performance capability, the terms and conditions of the vendor's proposal, and price.\\"  Introduction into service  November 27, 2017 the 101st Airborne Division received the first of the M17 handguns and gear that go along with it. US ARMY 101st AIRBORNE fire the M17 MHS (SIG SAUER P320) Post-introduction testing In January 2018, the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation published its report on the testing of the XM17, which highlighted some deficiencies. Notably, the weapon initially performed poorly in drop tests, causing a discharge when dropped, this issue was fixed by replacing the trigger group with components lighter in weight. Additionally, the weapon performed poorly with ball ammunition, causing several double ejections and stoppages. The analysis of this problem is still ongoing. The weapon performed well in other fields, with the exception of the mean rounds between stoppage failure, which is related to the previously noted issue.  Legal challenges  Shortly after, on February 24, 2017, Glock filed a protest of the contract award with the Government Accountability Office (GAO); the GAO denied the bid protest on June 5, 2017. Additionally, in May 2017, Steyr Arms, Inc. of Austria sued SIG Sauer via the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, claiming patent infringement of their Steyr M pistol. In March 2020, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire found that SIG Sauer did not infringe Steyr‚Äôs patents, and dismissed all motions.

Clark Spencer M. Clark (June 3, 1811 ‚Äì December 10, 1890) was the first Superintendent of the National Currency Bureau, today known as the Bureau of Printing and Engraving, from 1862 to 1868.  Public service  Spencer Morton Clark was born in Vermont and was involved in a variety of business activities until 1856 when he became a clerk in the Bureau of Construction of the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. According to a history of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Clark became interested in the work of finishing new currency notes at the Treasury and gradually assumed increasingly greater responsibilities in the engraving, printing, and processing of U.S. Government currency and securities. He was a strong advocate for a distinct bureau within the Treasury Department for the production of currency and securities, and took over as the first Superintendent of the National Currency Bureau in 1862.  Bureau of Engraving and Printing  On August 29, 1862, Clark commenced work with one male assistant and four female operatives, according to a 1977 Washington Post article. Clark is said to have developed the original \\"Treasury Seal,\\" a variation of which still appears on U.S. notes, according to a 1979 Washington Post article. Clark is also credited with proposing that facsimile signatures for the Treasurer of the United States and the Register of the Treasury be imprinted on U.S. notes using a \\"peculiar process and with peculiar ink.\\" Prior to that, the signatures were penned by an army of clerks \\"For the\\" appropriate official, the Post article added.  Fractional Faux Pas  Fractional Currency. In 1864, Congress authorized the issuance of a series of fractional currency notes in denominations of 3, 5, 10, 15, 25 and 50 cents, with Clark‚Äôs office being given responsibility for production of the notes. A controversy ensued when it was discovered that Clark's image had been put on the 5-cent note. There are different historical accounts of how this occurred. In one, the 5-cent note was supposed to bear a portrait of \\"Clark,\\" as in explorer William Clark of Lewis and Clark fame. But because no one had distinctly specified exactly which Clark, the currency superintendent took it upon himself to put his own portrait on the bills. In another version, Clark ordered that the portrait of Francis E. Spinner, treasurer of the United States, be placed on the 50-cent note without consulting him. Spinner was pleased with it, and as he had authority to select portraits on new notes, approved it. Other designs were selected at random and when it came to issuing the 5-cent note, Spinner was asked whose portrait was to be selected. Clark is said to have replied, \\"How would the likeness of Clark do?\\" \\"Excellent,\\" said Spinner, thinking that reference was made to Freeman Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency. The matter escaped further notice until the notes had been printed in enormous quantities. Whatever the story, Congress was outraged when the notes, which had already been mass-produced, came out. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, Congress‚Äôs \\"immediate infuriated response was to pass a law retiring the 5¬¢ denomination, and another to forbid portrayal of any living person on federal coins or currency.\\" Clark only kept his job because of the personal intervention of Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase.  Departure  Clark resigned from the National Currency Bureau in 1868 amidst a congressional investigation into record-keeping and security within the agency.Bureau of Printing and Engraving History, Historical Resource Center, 2004 He went on to work at the Department of Agriculture in the Statistical Division. He later headed the Bureau of Vital Statistics in the Agriculture Department until his death in 1890. He is buried in Hartford, Connecticut.

He graduated with a degree in architecture and a master's in design. He then worked at the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp. Parker joined the Mergenthaler Linotype Company as Jackson Burke's assistant and heir; within two years becoming Director. Under Parker's leadership over 1,000 typefaces, including Helvetica, were added to the library making them available wherever Linotype equipment was in use, including complete series of Hebrew and Greek scripts. This was made possible through Parker‚Äôs organization of shared typeface development between the five separate companies in the Linotype Group worldwide. Parker was responsible for bringing in internationally known designers such as Matthew Carter, Adrian Frutiger and Hermann Zapf. The result was a library that became the standard of the industry. In 1981, Parker and Matthew Carter co-founded Bitstream Inc, a type design company, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While revenues from the sale of typesetting equipment were dwindling, they recognized a business opportunity in the design and sale of type itself, due to the changing technologies that allowed type to be independent of equipment. Bitstream, largely financed through prepayment for the type library by several newly formed imagesetting companies, developed a library of digital type that could be licensed for use by anyone. Bitstream was highly successful during the 1980s when digital design and production, desktop publishing and personal computer use became virtually universal in the Western World. Parker was featured in the film Helvetica, a feature-length independent film about typography, graphic design and global visual culture. He wrote the introduction for the re-issue of Stanley Morison's A Tally of Types, published by David Godine. Pages was developed on the NextStep platform and was in the Beta stage of development when the Next Computer and the NextStep platform were discontinued in 1995. Upon the closing of Pages Software in 1995, Parker licensed the Pages patent to Design Intelligence in Seattle and joined the company as an in-house consultant. In 2000, Design Intelligence was bought by Microsoft. With that, Parker had come full circle, he had completed a process that began with Gutenberg's transformation of flexible but laborious calligraphy into modular fonts of movable type, and ended with similar digital modules of expert design that guide all aspects of a whole document's appearance. In 1994, Parker published evidence that the design of Times New Roman, credited to Stanley Morison in 1931 was based on Starling Burgess' 1904 drawings for Lanston Monotype Foundry. This publication attracted the attention of Roger Black, noted design director and former avid Linotype customer, and David Berlow former colleague at both Linotype and Bitstream. Parker joined their co- founded company, the Font Bureau, as a Consultant, Type Historian and Type Designer. In 2009, Parker released \\"Starling\\", a Roman font with a matching italic series based on the 1904 design of William Starling Burgess. Parker died on February 23, 2014.

Soumah started out in the 1950s playing in dance bands, but moved to modern Guinean music following the cultural revolution. He was a part of the greatly influential Syli Orchestra (originally Syli Orchestre National) who were formed under the instruction of the first elected president Sekou Toure. The group of Guinea's elite musicians were selected to travel throughout Guinea and inspire and instruct musicians across the country and help set up the regional orchestras that were key to Sekou Toure's 'Authenticit√©' programme to promote and proliferate 'authentic' Guinean traditional music after colonial rule. From the mid 1980s Soumah developed an idiosyncratic blend of jazz and African traditional music. He died suddenly on June 15, 2003. At the time of his death Soumah was musical director of Circus Baobab.
