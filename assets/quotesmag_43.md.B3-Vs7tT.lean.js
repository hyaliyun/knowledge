It is set in the Shanghai International Settlement during the Sino-Japanese War. In the film, a gun runner falls in love with a beautiful French singer. Plot The \\"International Settlement\\" is in the heart of Shanghai, where Western foreign powers had long controlled a protected enclave divided among 13 nations. Japanese forces have successfully overrun Peiping and are now heading for Shanghai. Newsreel footage (actual) shows Japanese bombers attacking Peiping and Chinese refugees fleeing south. Del Forbes, a vagabond adventurer with a dapper mustache, sailing for China, is broke enough to agree to impersonate a fellow passenger, ailing munitions dealer Zabellu. Too ill to leave the ship, Zabellu pays Forbes to impersonate him in an illegal arms deal for which he's owed some 200,000 pounds, which Forbes understands is \\"nearly a million dollars!!\\" Forbes gets the last hotel room in the British sector of the International Settlement, crowded with frightened people escaping from the Japanese invasion of Peiping in the north. Playing a suave, slightly condescending British cad, Forbes ignores the annoying advances of Joyce, a naïve American girl. Instead, he falls hard for Lenore, a stunning nightclub singer he first meets when she breaks into his room and tries to kill him She misses, but Forbes decides she is far too beautiful to turn over to the police, promptly inviting her to dinner later. Forbes rickshaws to the \\"native city\\"the Chinese quarter outside the Settlementto carry through the deal with shady Joseph Lang and his partner Murdock. Forbes fights off an attack as he leaves with the money but when he delivers it to the ship, he learns Zabellu has died of natural causes. Forbes is now walking around Shanghai with the equivalent of a million dollars around his waist. He meets Lenore for a romantic dinner, with a night of passion promised. He even tells her that his current situation has him \\"beginning to care whether I'm alive.\\" Unaware that she's the wife of shady American munitions dealer Monte Silver, who also wants the money, Forbes goes with her to the Green Dragon, a bar in the Chinese quarter, where Monte is waiting for him. Just when Forbes realizes he's been set up by the woman he loves, Japanese bombers start attacking Shanghai; the two men struggle and Monte shoots Forbes in the arm. Lenore rushes into the room, where wounded Forbes has just enough time to congratulate her on her deception when the bar is hit by a bomb. Silver staggers off, leaving Lenore and Forbes unconscious in its wreckage. With explosions all around them (including actual newsreel footage of the bombing of Shanghai), Lenore wakens and braves the bombing in the streets to search for a doctor for the dying Forbes, and finds one bandaging wounded Chinese peasants. Doctor Wong frees the unconscious Forbes from the beam that's crushed him and explains that only a transfusion will save his life. Though risky to attempt outside a hospital, the continued bombing has them trapped, so when Lenore begs to donate her compatible blood, Dr. Wong improvises a workable transfusion which saves Forbes' life. When Forbes wakesunaware of what she's just donehe bitterly rejects Lenore again before collapsing. Lenore rushes off to get help and finds Joyce and her buddy, a ditzy newsreel cameraman, in the Chinese quarter but they arrive too late: the building where Forbes lay has been destroyed. With Monte killing everyone in his way, he and Lenore board a ship heading for America with the money. They are surprised to find Forbes, alive if not entirely happy until Joyce explains all Lenore has done to save him. He visits her cabin just in time to watch Lenore point her gun at Monte as she takes the money and leave with Forbes. As they depart, Monte is killed by some other victim of his previous misdeeds.

Personal life  After finishing secondary school, van Bruggen became an accountant, first in his uncle's company, later with Koninklijke Hoogovens, where he became the head of the Administration. In 1950 he married Anna Blom, with whom he had a son; she died in 1996. In April 2000 he remarried with Liesbeth Bakker. Van Bruggen was interested in nature already at a very young age, in particular in animals and plants in and around water. He sowed his first plants when he was 5-years old: Tagetes. This led to his lifelong interest in botany, particularly water and marsh plants and orchids. Van Bruggen was an active member of the \\"Dutch Waterplant Society\\", for which he did the administration during many years.  Contributions to botany  In the late fifties, van Bruggen obtained from an aquarium-plant importer an Aponogeton species which he failed to be able to name using the existing literature. He concluded that it was a new species, unknown to science, and with the help of Hendrik de Wit he described the new species as Aponogeton rigidifolius H. Bruggen. In subsequent years he published a revision of the genus Aponogeton in several parts (organised geographically), culminating in his magnum opus, a complete monograph of this genus, which was well received in professional circles. In total, van Bruggen described 13 new Aponogeton species. For health reasons, van Bruggen never travelled to the tropics himself, but based his studies on observations from others and both living and dried (herbarium) materials sent to him. Two Aponogeton species were named after van Bruggen: A. vanbruggenii C. B. Hellquist & S. W. L. Jacobs (Australia) and A. bruggenii S. R. Yadav & R. S. Govekar (India). In addition, one orchid subspecies, Ophrys holosericea (N.L. Burman) Greuter subsp. vanbruggeniana J. & L. Essink & Kreutz, was named after him, commemorating van Bruggen's lifelong interest in this family.

Viswanath. It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Bhanuchander, Ramya Krishna in the lead roles and music is composed by K. V. Mahadevan. This film is based on a story against violence shown in a rural background. This message is shown in a short graphic format as an introduction to the film. Plot The film begins in a village where Neelakantam (Satyanarayana) a tyrant who tramples the public under his feet. In the same village, Hanumanth Dasu (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) and his brother-in-law Rangadasu (Murali Mohan) belong to a Haridasa family. Once Neelakantam molests an orthodox Brahmin woman Yashodamma (K.R.Vijaya) wife of a Bhagavathar Acharyulu (Ashok Kumar). So, Yashodamma forfeits herself to be his wife and discards from his life along with Tirumala Dasu (Bhanuchander), son of Hanumathu Dasu with the intention of giving him a good education. After 20 years, Tirumala Dasu (Bhanu Chander) returns to the village as a district collector. In the beginning, Tirumala Dasu pretends as if he is supporting Neelakantam, according to the guidance of his father to get a revolution in public and they succeed in it. Parallelly, Seeta (Ramya Krishna) daughter of Rangadasu who loves Tirumala Dasu a lot also dislikes him but afterward realizes his virtue. Right now, Neelakantam ploys to conquer the Govt lands for which he initiates Tirumala Dasu to get them to auction. Here, Tirumala Dasu clearly takes bribe from different landlords and uses it to acquire the land by the villagers. At present, enraged Neelakhantam intrigues to destroy the village with the help of other landlords when Tirumala Dasu ceases them. Being cognizant of it, the villagers unite to kill Neelakantam when Hanumath Dasu stops and pacifies them that violence is not the solution to resolve a problem. Finally, Neelakantam also realizes his mistake, sheds all his weapons and reforms as a good person. Even Yashodamma reunites with her husband. At last, Hanumanth Dasu affirms that it's wiser to give best punishment for egregious persons is to destroy their evil nature than eliminating them.

Originally built as a Sephardi synagogue for Dutch Jews trading in Exeter, it is now a synagogue of the Ashkenazi rite. Exeter Hebrew Congregation itself existed shortly prior to its construction. History The Jews in Exeter have a long history, though there is currently little evidence to support the existence of a Jewish community in Roman Exeter. The first Jew in Exeter was mentioned in 1181, and the community is believed to have owned its own burial ground and synagogue before antisemitic rulings of Exeter's Synod in 1287, which aided the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290. The first Jew known to have settled in Exeter in modern times was a Mr. Jacob Monis from Padua, who advertised his services in 1724 as a Hebrew and Italian teacher. He was joined by his nephew Joseph Ottolenghi, who was employed as the community's shochet. A scandal between these two, when Joseph subsequently converted to Christianity, is the subject of many useful documents which have shed light on Exeter's Jewish history. With the accession of the Hanoverians to the throne of England, Jews of German origin settled in Exeter; and by 1757 the community had taken lease of a burial ground at Bull Meadow, just outside the city walls. On 5 November 1763, Abraham Ezekiel and Kitty Jacobs leased land in Mary Arches—via a local non-Jew, to avoid the restrictions on Jewish ownership of land—on which the present Exeter Synagogue was consecrated on 10 August 1764. A letter found in the Devon Record Office describes the consecration, in which the Torah was carried seven times around the bimah and the national anthem was sung. The Ezekiel family continued to lead and support the local community for 75 years, and special services were held in the synagogue for events such as the coronation of George IV and the death of Prince Albert. The community dwindled throughout the nineteenth century: in 1842 there were only about thirty families, and in 1878 there were fewer than ten. For much of the late 19th to the early 20th centuries, the Synagogue was located near the entrance to overcrowded slum dwellings one of the poorest areas of central Exeter. Regular services were abandoned in 1889. Six years later the synagogue was revived by Charles Samuels, who was the community's leader until his death in 1944. The synagogue was damaged in the Baedecker Blitz during the Second World War. Although small in numbers, the community today is spread widely over Devon, Cornwall, Somerset and Dorset and holds regular services using a variety of traditions. Exeter Hebrew Congregation still owns and maintains the Bull Meadow Jewish cemetery, In July 2019, extreme right-wing anti-semite Tristan Morgan set fire to the synagogue in an attempt to burn it down. Morgan was found guilty of terrorism charges and sentenced to an indeterminate hospital order before his potential release can be considered by court.https://www.devonlive.com/news/watch-moment-terrorist- firebomber- blasted-3058919https://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/2019-07-05/devon-man- sentenced-after-setting-fire-to-synagogue-and-himself/ Architecture Exeter Synagogue, like most eighteenth-century synagogues, is tucked away from the main thoroughfares of the old city and is windowless, presumably as a security feature during its time of construction. The synagogue was constructed in a traditional Orthodox style, with a women's balcony, and was heavily restored throughout the 1980s. The building also currently contains room for a small cheder. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Exeter Synagogue (in which it resembles the synagogue in Plymouth) is its Aron Kodesh (Torah ark), a wooden structure carved to resemble marble. The ark contains a quotation from Psalms 5:8, \\"I will worship towards thy holy temple in fear of thee\\", and is believed to have been made by north German craftsmen. A building next to the synagogue which originally contained the cheder and minister's residences was demolished during the 1960s. Major refurbishments made in 1830 uncovered vivid colours and decorations on the columns and ark of the synagogue, and in the 1980s window lighting was added in the ceiling. The wealth of colourful design in the synagogue is due to the fact that the exterior of the synagogue was subject to regulations at the time of construction, so that the most noticeable architectural features are to be found within. Replacements of wall panelling, seating, the upper galleries, and central heating all took place in 1997. List of rabbis Exeter's Jewish community did not maintain a full complement of religious staff for the majority of its history and after 1867 with the departure of Rabbi Myer Mendlessohn for Bristol it was served by Rabbis with very short terms, and to this day Exeter's community has no rabbi (in part due to its being affiliated with neither the Movement for Reform Judaism nor the United Synagogue), with services being led by members of the congregation and visiting rabbis. The previous rabbis were: *1795–1839: Rabbi Moses Horowitz Levy *1839–1840: Rabbi Michael Levy Green *1841–1852: Rabbi Samuel Hoffnung *1852–1853: Rabbi Berthold Aldu *1854–1867: Rabbi Myer Mendlessohn See also * Oldest synagogues in the United Kingdom * Plymouth Synagogue  References Further reading * Kadish, Sharman, Building Jerusalem: Jewish Architecture in Britain, 1995 * Hidden Legacy Foundation, The Jews of Devon and Cornwall, 2000 External links * * Exeter Synagogue Archive * Susser's Archive on the Jewry of Devon and Cornwall * Exeter Hebrew Congregation on Jewish Communities and Records – UK (hosted by jewishgen.org). * Susser, Bernard, The Jews of South-West England Category:18th-century synagogues Category:1763 establishments in England Category:Ashkenazi Jewish culture in England Category:Dutch diaspora in Europe Category:Dutch-Jewish diaspora Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1763 Category:Orthodox synagogues in England Category:Buildings and structures in Exeter Category:Synagogues in Devon Category:Sephardi Jewish culture in the United Kingdom ","title":"Exeter Synagogue"},{"id":"26539744","text":"Nemesis (right background) destroying Chinese junks in the Second Battle of Chuenpi Hall (standing right) on the verandah of British merchant Lancelot Dent in China Admiral Sir William Hutcheon Hall, (c. 1797 – 25 June 1878), was a British Royal Navy officer.

In 1816–17, he served as a midshipman under Captain Basil Hall, with whom he attended William Amherst's embassy visit to China. After returning to England in November 1817, he was appointed to the frigate, HMS Iphigenia, under Captain Robert Mends in the West Africa Squadron. He was later promoted as master of the sloop, HMS Morgiana. In this rank, he served in the British West Indies, Mediterranean, and Home stations until 1836. After studying steam engines in Glasgow, Scotland, and on board steamers trading to Ireland, he travelled to the United States, where he was employed in steamboats on the Delaware and Hudson.Stephen, Leslie; Lee, Sidney (1890).

China In November 1839, Hall obtained command of Nemesis of the British East India Company in China, where he served in the First Anglo-Chinese War (1839–42). For his services, the Admiralty procured an Order in Council to enable it to make him a lieutenant on 8 January 1841. The Admiralty later obtained power to enable him to count his time in the Nemesis as if he had served in one of Her Majesty's Ships.Clowes, William Laird (1901).

Retrieved on 16 March 2010. Russia After the outbreak of the Crimean War (1853–56) against Russia, Hall was not able to obtain command of a vessel corresponding to his seniority, so on 15 March 1854 he accepted the 6-gun paddle steamer, HMS Hecla, which was engaged in the Baltic and was again Mentioned in Despatches, and slightly wounded. He transferred to the 72-gun HMS Blenheim in November 1854, and in 1855 was engaged in the capture of Bomarsund, among other battles. Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich, second son of Tsar Nicholas I, remarked, \\"of all bold and seamanlike operations, this of Captain Hall's—taking his steamer seven miles up a creek of intricate navigation in an enemy's country—is the most daring I could have imagined; I cannot but admire such gallantry, even in an enemy.\\"Royer, Alfred (1854).

Works and later life Hingley's became sole manufacturers of these anchors in 1891 Hall was one of the first British officers to make a thorough study of steam engines. He invented iron bilge tanks for ships, adopted by the navy, and \\"Hall's patent anchor\\". On 30 April 1845, he married Hilare Caroline Byng, third daughter of his first captain, George Byng. They had one daughter, Frances Russell Hall, who married Captain Charles Davis Lucas in 1879. Lucas had won the Victoria Cross while serving under Hall in 1854 aboard HMS Hecla. Hall was appointed to HMS William and Mary on 3 March 1847 to assist in relief efforts during the Great Famine of Ireland. He was transferred to HMS Dragon on 6 May. During his time in command of Dragon, he was reprimanded for the poor state of her gunnery, and the ship was paid off on 8 June 1850. In 1847, Hall was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, where he served several years in its Council. His writings involved developing national defences, and employing boatmen, fishermen, and armed merchant steamers as part of the naval reserve. He was an active supporter of the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society for 26 years. In 1863, he was promoted to rear admiral. He retired from active service on 2 April 1866, was promoted a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 13 March 1867, and was promoted (on the retired list) to vice admiral on 26 July 1869, and admiral on 11 December 1875. He died of apoplexy at Phillimore Gardens, Kensington, London, on 25 June 1878, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Lawrence's Church, Mereworth, Kent, on 29 June. Selected works *Bernard, W.

The academy offers a two-year Master of Fine Arts degree with a focus on technical training and critical discourse, as well as a Post-baccalaureate Certificate of Fine Art. The school annually hosts two public events: the TriBeCa Ball and the fund-raising auction Take Home a Nude, both known to attract high profile guests. History= Early years  In the late 1970s, a group of realist New York artists including Jack Beal, Alfred Leslie, Rafael Soyer, and Milet Andrejevic, recognized a need for arts instruction grounded in the teaching of traditional skills. The early school, then known as the New York Drawing Association, began instruction in 1980 in a rented basement space at the Middle Collegiate Church on the Lower East Side, with New York businessman and art collector Stuart Pivar providing key financial support. According to sculptor Barney Hodes, the early school was created through a merger in 1982 of two schools started in 1979: the New Brooklyn School of Life Drawing, Painting and Sculpture (formed by Hodes and Francis Cunningham) and the New York Drawing Association (created by Stuart Pivar). In a recently published account of early days of the school, Pivar describes his role as its primary founder, inspired by a suggestion to start such a school by his close friend Andy Warhol. Pivar assembled the early faculty and advisory committees which included Beal, Leslie, Soyer, Andrejevic, as well as Frank Mason and Nelson Shanks, and secured the lease at the Middle Collegiate Church in 1980. Pivar disputes Hodes's account that the school was a result of a merger between the New York Drawing Association and the New Brooklyn School. Pivar acknowledges that in 1983 Hodes and Cunningham were brought in as senior faculty, and that several trustees of the New Brooklyn School were added to the academy's board, but that the union was acrimonious and that Hodes, Cunningham, and former New Brooklyn School board members Barbara Stanton and James Cox had left the school by 1985. In 1984, the New York Academy of Art (NYAA) relocated to Lafayette Street in the East Village and expanded its administration, faculty, and curriculum, with additional support from Pivar. By 1986, the New York Times reported that the NYAA had grown to serve 40 full- time students, all on scholarship, along with 150 part-time students enrolled in fee-based night classes. The arts curricula centered on building the classical skills of realism including training in perspective drawing and working from life models to sculpt the human form. Later accounts of the formation of the academy list pop artist Andy Warhol as one of its key founders and funders, along with Pivar. After Warhol died in 1987, he left a bequest to the academy, allowing it to purchase its Franklin Street headquarters in Tribeca. Warhol was reportedly a supporter of artists \\"learning all of the tools of their trade\\", and the Warhol Foundation had given the academy more than $1 million (as of 2004).  Franklin Street building  In 1990, the NYAA began operating out of the Franklin Street building, a five-story 42,000 square foot landmark building originally designed by Benjamin Warner in 1861. Following a 2001 fire that damaged 50 percent of the interior space, the building was renovated by TRA Studio. The same firm continued to renovate and improve the school starting in 2010 (through at least 2020) and included the restoration of the facade in collaboration with the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.  Management  David Kratz was appointed president of the school in 2009. Prior to his leadership appointment at NYAA, Kratz had worked in public relations for two decades before he earned a graduate degree in painting from the academy in 2008. The school's provost is Peter Drake who has also served as the academic dean of students since 2010. Drake came to the NYAA in 2010, after working for the Parsons School of Design.  Disputes  The school is also known for several major disputes among administrators and the ouster of more than one financial controller accused of embezzling funds. New York Magazine reported that Stuart Pivar was maneuvered off the school's board in 1994 by board chairman Russell Colgate Wilkinson and board member Dennis Smith. A 1994 report by education consultant Robert Montgomery accused the school of failing to uphold the basic requirements of an educational institution. Montgomery noted that the financial and educational committees were in violation of the school's bylaws, as was Smith for serving well beyond the four year term limit for chairman. Pivar sued the academy for losing several of his artworks. The dispute with Pivar escalated and he sued the college in 1997 asking $50 million for \\"emotional and mental distress\\". The claims were later dismissed. In the early 2000s, Pivar helped to expose an embezzeling con-artist working within the academy.  Epstein ties  Human- trafficker Jeffrey Epstein served as a board member from 1987 to 1994. Academy alumni Maria Farmer criticized Eileen Guggenheim for pressuring her in 1995 to undersell her artwork, for the sake of the academy, to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell during her graduate exhibition. Several NYAA alumni traveled with Farmer to Epstein's New Mexico ranch on an awkward trip organized by Guggenheim, who served as the Dean of Students in 1995. The students described attending a bizarre, competitive dinner party where they were led to believe that Epstein was planning to grant one of them a major commission, which ultimately never materialized. After Farmer, and her younger sister Annie, were abused by Epstein and Maxwell in 1996, she reported it to Guggenheim, who did not take further action. In May 2020 a petition began circulating that called for Guggenheim's resignation from her position at NYAA as chair of the Board of Trustees due to her earlier involvement with Epstein in the 1990s.  Public events  alt= The academy hosts two major public events annually, the Tribeca Ball and the Take Home a Nude auction. The first Tribeca Ball was held in 1994. The event, held each year at the Franklin Street building, is an important fundraiser for the school and is known to attract high profile attendees. Attendees are able to visit over 100 artists' studios and view artwork during a cokctail hour before the main event of dinner in the first floor \\"cast hall\\". In 2020, the annual Tribeca Ball, held in Spring, was moved to a virtual experience online due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Academics and accreditation The New York Academy of Art offers a two-year Masters of Fine Arts program, with a total enrollment of approximately 100 students. The academy also offers continuing education classes and a post-baccalaureate Certificate in Fine Art. The academy was granted an Absolute Charter on June 24, 1994 by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York. It is institutionally accredited by the Board of Regents and the Commissioner of Education acting under their standing as a nationally recognized accrediting agency. In 2013, the academy was accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). The school was accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) in 2016. Facilities New York Academy of Art, Tribeca Gallery in 2014 In total, the Academy houses eight MFA classrooms, multiple exhibition spaces, approximately 100 studio spaces, a library and archives, three student lounges, a woodshop, a kiln, sculpture floor, and printmaking facilities.

Development started at Fredric Flader Inc. in 1947, with the first examples being delivered in 1949. However, these delivered far lower power than predicted. Improved models followed in early 1952 that met the performance requirements, but demonstrated very poor reliability. When small engines from other companies became available, the J55 project was cancelled in 1952. History=Supersonic compressors An axial compressor consists of a series of propeller-like disks known as \\"stages\\", each of which compresses the incoming air in turn. As the air is compressed its volume decreases, so each stage has less diameter than the one before it. In a normal turbojet, the compressors rotational speeds are limited so that the outer tips of the blades remain subsonic. If all of the stages are powered off of a common shaft, this means that the limiting rotational speed will be defined by the first stage, which is the largest. Stages further in will be operating with tip speeds that are much lower, which works against the general principle that faster rotational speeds are more efficient. Larger engines, like those on modern airliners, normally include two or three \\"spools\\", sections of the engine operating at different rotational speeds, allowing each section of the compressor to reach the highest RPM possible while remaining subsonic. Additionally, in order for an aircraft to operate at supersonic airspeeds, aircraft normally use a series of ramps or cones to create shock waves that progressively slow the air to subsonic speeds before it reaches the compressor. These intakes create drag that must be overcome by the engines. A compressor that works at supersonic speeds would thus have improved performance, at least in theory. This would allow it to operate at higher rotational speeds, as well as reducing or eliminating the need for the complex inlets. During the early days of engine development, supersonic aerodynamics were not well understood, and it was not clear whether such an engine would be more or less efficient than a conventional design. In order to find out, between 1946 and 1948 engineers at the NACA Lewis Research Center carried out an early research program on supersonic compressor stages. These demonstrated very encouraging results; not only did such a design work, but the compression ratio across a single stage was much higher than in a subsonic design, as much as two times.Leyes and Fleming 1999, pg. 48 This would allow an engine with a given overall pressure ratio to be built with fewer stages, making it smaller, lighter and less complex. Flader proposal Fredric Flader Inc. was formed in 1944 to develop small turbine engines, initially based on a contract with the US Army Air Force for a turboprop, the T33-FF-1. Flader opened a new plant in Tonawanda, New York to develop the engine, but the Army cancelled the project shortly after.Leyes and Fleming 1999, pg. 46 The company was saved by a US Navy contract for an turbine for emergency power on small ships, but this contract was later won by Solar Turbines and work at Flader ended. In 1946 the Army started developing the requirements for a series of three unmanned aircraft, one of which was a high-speed radio controlled target drone, the XQ-2. Ryan Aeronautical won the contract with their Firebee design, and on 7 February 1947 the Power Plant Laboratory at the Wright Air Development Center issued a tender for a small engine to power the Ryan airframe. Flader's proposal, from 26 April 1947, proposed using a supersonic compressor in order to build a small engine suitable for the design. They predicted that the compressor would have a pressure ratio about 2.75, roughly twice that of conventional designs. This was enough that only a single centrifugal-flow compressor was needed to complete the compression cycle of the engine.Leyes and Fleming 1999, pg. 47 In spite of the risks involved, Flader's proposal won the tender and development started two months later. Early testing Flader worked in close concert with the engineers at Lewis. They sent an early version of the compressor to them for testing in June 1948, which demonstrated performance far below the predicted value. Worse, contrary to expectations, the performance decreased with increasing rotational speed, the opposite of what Lewis's earlier research had suggested, which was one of the biggest reasons for using the design. This was later attributed to a thick boundary layer on the blades. Additionally, after about 35 hours of running time the leading edges of the compressor blades were found to be curled over, apparently due to extremely high aerodynamic loads.Leyes and Fleming 1999, pg. 49 In mid-1949 Flader delivered two derated engines, XJ55-FF-1's, to the Air Force for testing. These delivered only of thrust, far below what was needed to power the Firebee. However, Flader continued working on the design, and it had greatly improved by late 1951. In January 1952 they delivered one of these improved models and on 24 January it ran at , meeting the requirements. However, during a second test on 31 January the engine failed shortly after running for one minute at .Leyes and Fleming 1999, pg. 50 Although it appeared that the basic design was able to deliver its promised performance, at that point it was far from a complete design. Weight and fuel consumption were both above the design estimates, the various support systems like fuel and oil pumps were not self-contained, and it remained susceptible to compressor surging. Flader estimated that these problems would require another three years of development to fix. Cancellation At that point, two new small engines with roughly the required power had come to market, the Fairchild J44 and the Continental J69, a licensed version of the French Turbomeca Marboré. The Air Force decided to use the J69 in the Firebee, and cancelled development of the J55 shortly after. Flader made several other one-off designs, but found no lasting work in the field and eventually sublet their plants to Eaton Manufacturing in 1955. Eaton moved on, and Flader was wound down on 2 September 1957.Leyes and Fleming 1999, pg. 51 Description The J55 looked like a conventional axial-flow engine overall, but the equipment section was located in front of the engine in an oversized spinner area. Behind the spinner was the intake area and the supersonic compressor stage. Behind this was the single centrifugal stage, in a separate cylindrical section. This was followed by a canular combustion area and then a single turbine stage.Progress 1951, pg. 570 Specifications (J55-FF-1 Lieutenant 124)References=Bibliography  Category:1940s turbojet engines Category:Abandoned military aircraft engine projects of the United States Category:Axial- compressor gas turbine engines ","title":"Flader J55"},{"id":"26539988","title":"Slovakia at the 2010 Winter Paralympics"},{"id":"26540038","text":"L. chinensis may refer to: * Leptocanna chinensis, a bamboo species endemic to Yunnan, China * Litchi chinensis, the lychee, a tropical and subtropical fruit tree species primarily found in Asia, Southern Africa and Mexico * Lobelia chinensis, a flowering plant species found in China See also * Chinensis (disambiguation) ","title":"L. chinensis"},{"id":"26540039","title":"Alors on danse"},{"id":"26540047","text":"Goose Hill Road Historic District is a national historic district located at Cold Spring Harbor in Suffolk County, New York.

It is the eighteenth in the Cadfael Chronicles and was first published in 1991. Brother Cadfael is pleased to join his young friend Mark, now a deacon, on a mission of church diplomacy in Wales. Travelling in the safety of the Prince of Gwynedd's train, they are brought to unexpected dangers, as they seek to keep a young Welsh woman free from harm. Introduction to plot The Anarchy is paused, except for the continued ravages of Geoffrey de Mandeville and his band of marauders in the Fens. Wales has a squabble between two brother princes, rooted in a murder the previous year. The Roman church under Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is extending its influence into Wales, which prefers its Celtic ways and the see of Saint David, by reviving an old bishopric straddling the border of England and Wales. Theobald requested that Bishop Roger de Clinton send a welcoming embassy to the new bishop, whose see includes parishes that once were under de Clinton. Plot summary Three plots interlock in this novel. First is the embassy of Deacon Mark and Brother Cadfael to two bishops in Wales, reinforcing the Roman rite in Wales. Second is the young woman Heledd rejected by her canon father in reaction to imposition of the Roman rite, sending her to find love among historic Welsh enemies. Third is the trouble raised up by Cadwaladr, and resolved by Owain, who wanted no trouble with the Danes in their dragon boats. Mark, a young deacon in the house of Roger de Clinton, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, is chosen to carry messages of good will to two bishops in Wales. He takes Brother Cadfael as translator into his homeland of north Wales in April 1144. They travel on horseback from Shrewsbury Abbey. Mark succeeds with the new bishop of Saint Asaph and the bishop of Bangor, sharing gifts and speaking as a diplomat. From Llanelwy to Bangor, they travel in the train of Owain Gwynedd, stopping at his royal seat at Aber overnight, where Cadfael finds a murdered man. Heledd rides away from Aber, not wanting to marry a man she has not chosen, awaiting her in Bangor. Mark and Cadfael seek the lost Heledd as they head home. Cadfael finds her; as quickly as he does, the two are seized by a group of strong Danes led by Turcaill. They are prisoners in the camp of Otir, leader of the Danes of Dublin. Mark sees them and reports it to Owain. Heledd tells Cadfael she left Aber on a whim, finding the horse saddled and ready. In a scheme to regain his lands and his good standing with his brother, Cadwaladr makes a deal with the Danes in Dublin to threaten Gwynedd. For Otir it is a cash transaction. The deal is for 2,000 marks in silver, cattle or goods. Otir's men are armed, but they have no plan to take on Owain's army. The ships land at Abermenai, opposite the island of Anglesey, at the end of the Menai Strait. Owain moves quickly to set up camp less than a mile away overnight. His brother approaches him with his scheme. Owain rejects it outright, telling his brother he must make good his debt to the Danes and keep the three captives safe. Cadwaladr instead tells the Danes that they should leave Gwynedd. Owain visits Otir to state his perspective on this awkward and potentially explosive situation. Cadwaladr will pay the amount he agreed, and the Danes will leave quietly. Mark is the go-between to announce Owain's coming; he is left in place of Cadwaladr while the brothers talk in Owain's camp. Heledd relaxes in this break from her troubles by talking and teasing with Turcaill. Her unknown betrothed arrives at Owain's camp. Ieuan ap Ifor cannot wait; he plans a rescue in the night. Cadwaladr's supporters itch to release him so they join up with Ieuan. Upon hearing Owain's terms, Turcaill kidnaps Cadwaladr from Owain's camp in the night, so Otir can pressure Cadwaladr to gather his money and cattle to settle this affair. Again Mark is the envoy, carrying Cadwaladr's words and seal to Owain, whom Cadwaladr trusts to gather his resources from his steward and bring them hence. Owain's son Hywel leads the party amassing the payment, Gwion riding out with them. The silver is loaded in barrels onto the Danish boats. That night, Ieuan succeeds in seizing Heledd. Gwion, returned on his own with supporters of Cadwaladr, does not succeed in freeing him, but sparks a battle, which kills three of the Danes, and some of his own men. Owain arrives after dawn, with the drove of cattle finishing Cadwaladr's debt, seeing the Danes in full battle array. Gwion takes the moment to charge his own men again. Owain orders his men to stop. There are more casualties. Gwion takes a fatal wound from Otir. In the presence of Cadfael and Owain, Gwion confesses to the murder at Aber. His compatriot Bledri would not ride to Cadwaladr that night. The horse was gone. Cadwaladr received no intelligence, so the murder gained him nothing. His death is rough justice for the murder Gwion committed at Aber. Heledd accepts her capture by Ieuan equably. She approaches what had been Otir's camp. At sunset, Turcaill arrives in a boat. She leaves with the man of her choice, leaving behind her troubles with her father. Mark and Cadfael proceed to Shrewsbury Abbey. They stay at Hugh's manor in Maesbury overnight for a pleasant family visit, with Aline and young Giles to cheer them. They overstayed the ten days promised to Abbot Radulfus, and Cadfael is happy to go home. Characters *Brother Cadfael: Herbalist monk and sometime sleuth at Shrewsbury Abbey, born in Wales. He is aged about 64 in this story. In dialogue with Mark or Cuhelyn he tells his own Welsh heritage and his decisions in youth to leave Wales when he was offered the chance to travel to Shrewsbury at the age of age 14. His life has now travelled a full circle; he is pleased to be tied to a small piece of land and a small fraternity of brother monks. *Abbot Radulfus: Head of the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, based on the real abbot of the era. He released Cadfael to aid Mark. *Hugh Beringar: Sheriff of Shropshire, appointed by King Stephen. He owns manors at Maesbury, near the border with north Wales. From both his home location and his agreements as Sheriff with Owain and other neighbouring rulers, he advises Mark on his best route, and some delicate points in present politics. Introduced in One Corpse Too Many. *Deacon Mark: Deacon with Bishop Roger de Clinton sent on embassy to two parishes in Wales. As a young monk, spent two years with Cadfael, where they became great friends. He has a talent for reading people's true natures and true needs. His priestly studies are financed by Leoric Aspley (see The Devil's Novice). About 23 years old. Officially introduced in Monk's Hood, but he may have been unofficially mentioned at the very end of A Morbid Taste for Bones. *Bishop Gilbert: He is newly appointed by Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury to head the revived diocese of Saint Asaph at Llanelwy, its parishes straddling the boundary of Wales and England, and formerly in the see of Bishop Roger de Clinton. A man of Norman birth, he speaks no Welsh. Real historical bishop. *Bishop Meurig: Welsh bishop of Bangor. He swore allegiance to King Stephen, accepted Canterbury as the only Archbishop four years earlier. He is a pleasant and practical man. Real historical bishop. *Owain Gwynedd: Prince of Gwyedd. He is a real historical person, who is in his early forties in this story. He is attempting to unite the independent parts of Wales through dynastic marriages and strategic alliances. He was mightily displeased with his brother Cadwaladr for directing the murder of the Prince of Deheubarth, who was betrothed to Owain's daughter, and dispossessed Cadwaladr of his lands. This prince makes his second appearance as a character in this series of novels. *Hywel ab Owain: Second son of Owain, who drove Cadwaladr out of his lands on his father's order. Also a poet. He is about 20 years old. Real historical person. *Rhun ab Owain: Eldest son of Owain. He has his father's appearance, is the pattern of a prince since age 16, and his father's favourite. Real historical person. *Cadwaladr: A younger brother of Owain. He was dispossessed of his lands in north Ceredigion in Wales by Owain for his role in killing Prince Anarawd of Deheubarth. He escaped to Ireland in disgrace. He is a strong man, with an impetuous temper. He is a real historical person who made such troubles in history. *Anarawd ap Gruffydd: Prince of Deheubarth in southern Wales. He was an ally to Owain Gwynedd and betrothed to his daughter; then slain by Cadwaladr's men in the year before the story started. His death is the reason for Owain stripping Cadwaladr's lands from him. Real historical person. *Canon Meirion: Canon of the new see at Saint Asaph, under Bishop Gilbert. He was a married priest who is now widowed, father of Heledd. He is balancing his career against his daughter, under the new rules. The depth of his feelings for her shows itself when she runs away. *Heledd: Bold, observant, beautiful dark-haired daughter of Meirion. She is betrothed to a man she has never met, feeling unloved by her father. Her mother died the prior Christmas, an event awaited by the Bishop Gilbert. She is 17 or 18 years old. Wales kept married priests, but the Roman rite so recently imposed disallows them. The new bishop finds her a bad sign of old sinful ways. *Canon Morgant: Another canon under Bishop Gilbert. He is sent with the party bringing Heledd to meet her betrothed in Bangor. *Cuhelyn ap Einion: Warrior seriously injured in serving Prince Anarawd the prior year. He is now in the household of Owain Gwynedd. He lost his left hand in that encounter. Mark notices the resemblance between Cuhelyn and Gwion, in looks and passion, though mirror images in Cadfael's view. Cuhelyn recognises Bledri ap Rhys as one of the eight in the party who attacked him and Prince Anarawd, at the meal with Bishop Gilbert. *Bledri ap Rhys: Man in Cadawaladr's service. He is an unexpected envoy at meal at Saint Asaph at Llanelwy to all but the new Bishop, who wants Owain to reconcile with his brother. He travels with the party leaving Llanelwy next day. He was found murdered the next morning at Aber. *Gwion: Young man at Aber on his parole for the last six months. He is of the group who murdered Prince Anarawd, loyal to Cadwaladr, and unwilling to \\"promise peace\\" to Hywel. He and Bledri ap Rhys are of the same allegiance. He is seen speaking with Bledri in the chapel after the feast. *Ieuan ap Ifor: Betrothed chosen for Heledd by Owain. He is present with Owain's army at Carnarvon; of Anglesey. He is in his mid thirties, grey already salting his dark hair, of muscular build. *Turcaill son of Turcaill: One of the Danes from Dublin aligned with Cadwaladr. He seized Heledd and Cadfael. He is a tall, strong, flaxen haired young man. *Leif: Son of a Welsh mother and Danish father, who speaks Welsh like a native. At 15 years old, he spies among the Welsh for Turcaill. *Otir: Leader of the Danes of Dublin. He is allied with Cadwaladr in his fight to regain his lands in Wales from his brother Owain. This is a transaction for money gain, rather than a political alliance for Otir. Real historical person. Continuity Deacon Mark was first introduced by name in Monk's Hood as the assistant to Cadfael at the end of 1138. Cadfael has much respect for Mark, and is delighted he received a gift for his education to become a priest in The Devil's Novice two years later, a gift from the lord of a local manor whose son was helped by Brother Mark. In several later novels, Cadfael speaks of how he will wait to confess what he thinks his worst sins to Mark, when he is a priest, as Mark understands him so well. Serving Mark as a translator suits Cadfael well now, his favourite helper progressing so well on his way to priesthood. The connection between Wales and England in this time comes to the fore in this novel, but is always in the background in the other novels. Having Owain Gwyneth as a character again (earlier in A Morbid Taste for Bones and a major character in Dead Man's Ransom) lets the reader see how close the people are on either side of changing border, and as well the differences. Setting in history=Political Events in the Church and within Wales Wales in the 12th Century – Isle of Anglesey at top Unlike most of the Brother Cadfael chronicles, the Summer of the Danes is set in north Wales, specifically Gwynedd. Wales was then divided into many principalities. Owain Gwynedd tried to unite many of them through negotiation, dynastic marriage and conquest. Historically, he and his brother Cadwaladr were several times estranged and reconciled. Cadwaladr did indeed enlist the help of a Danish fleet from Dublin to regain his lands. This conflict with Owain Gwynedd is a major thread of the plot of the novel. Their encounter was at Abermenai Point, opposite the southwest corner of the Isle of Anglesey; Cadwaladr came with a group of Danes from Dublin in his hope of again being in his brother's good graces and perhaps regaining his lost lands in the north of Ceredigion just south of the border with Gwynedd. After the instance in this novel, Danes from Dublin acted in Welsh affairs, specifically after Owain's death in 1170, on behalf of his dispossessed son Hywel. Prior to that, in the Great Revolt of 1166, Danes from Dublin were hired by Henry II of England to harass the coast while his armies fought the Welsh on land. They were ineffective, and Henry II lost on land as well. Another driving force of the story is the tension within the Church, represented at the time by Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and churchmen in Wales who wished to preserve independent Celtic organisation and forms of their Christian religion. Among others, the Celtic Christian tradition allowed priests to be married and have children, while the Roman practice was newly enforcing celibacy among all priests. The See of Saint Asaph was reestablished the year before the story; Theobald appointed a Norman to impose the doctrines of Rome. Deacon Mark alludes to the Claim of Metropolitan Status of the See of Saint David's, which would make it equal to Canterbury. This was opposed by Theobald. He moved to impose the Roman rite on all of Wales by 1148. This change at Saint Asaph attracts Deacon Mark and Brother Cadfael into Gwynedd and pushes Heledd out of it. Places in the Novel The places named in the novel are real places, from Shrewsbury Abbey and Oswestry to St Asaph, Aber, Bangor, Abermenai and the many stops between Cadfael's home at the Abbey and his homeland of North Wales. Hugh Beringar's manor at Maesbury is said to be between the two great dykes built by Mercian kings to mark the border of their territory with Powys in the 8th century; the westernmost being the larger, known as Offa's dyke. The Menai Strait makes Anglesey an island. Much of the action of the novel takes place along it. Bangor is adjacent to it on the mainland of Wales at its eastern end. Mark and Cadfael walk west along it in search of Heledd; Turcaill brings his boat down it seeking food for the men; and Owain brings his troops so quickly overnight from Carnarvon to the west end of the Menai Strait where the confrontation with his brother and the Danes from Dublin occurs, at Abermanai. Customs and Language in Wales Welsh names for people and places are used in this novel, in keeping with it being a historical novel. Some naming customs are common, as the use of \\"son of\\" or \\"daughter of\\" in a name. Hywel ab Owain is Hywel son of Owain; similar to Bledri ap Rhys. Ab is used when the name following starts with a vowel, while ap is used when the name following begins with a consonant. Daughter of was not used in this novel; \\"merch\\" (rather than verch or ferch) has appeared in other of the novels in the series (see Peters, Ellis Dead Man's Ransom 1984). A full guide to Welsh orthography is not needed for the names in this novel. A few hints make it easier. C is sounded as \\"hard\\" c, like k, as in the name Cuhelyn (kee hell in). Double \\"dd\\" is similar to a heavily stressed English \\"th\\" as in \\"this\\", as in Gwynedd (gwin eth) or Heledd (hell eth). Y is a vowel, either unstressed as in Hywel ab Owain (hah well ab oh wine) or Ynys (inn is), or sounding like ee as in Bledri ap Rhys (bled ree ap reese) or Llanelwy (lan ell wee). G is the hard sound, as the place name Ceredigion (kare uh dig ee on). TH is sounded similarly to English 'think' or 'three', as in Deheubarth (de hay barth) the southern principality in the 12th century. Words of more than one syllable generally have even stress on all the syllables (unlike spoken English). A quick review of sounds with audio samples gives clear examples, including some of the names used in this book. A site about Welsh mountain names offers a quick guide to pronunciation. The sound represented by ll or Ll is a voiceless lateral fricative, which does not exist in English. Hospitality was a major obligation to the Welsh in the 12th century. A contemporary author Gerald of Wales wrote of their ways in Latin, later translated to English. One feature of this novel is the supper feast at Aber hosted by Owain Gwynedd, explicating the customs there by courses, by conversations and by placement at table. The pattern of meals and the food served differed from that in the monastery. The courtesy due a guest in his house guided some of Owain's rapid decisions when the murdered man is found after the feast.

Billy J Hobbs claimed this was his favourite in the series, as it brings up well Cadfael's past as a soldier, and there is suspense in whether the Danes will invade.

The Rosales Novels, The Star-entangled Banner: One Hundred Years of America in the Philippines, books.google.com or \\"The Traveller\\", is a 1993 English-language novel written by Filipino author F. Sionil José.\\"Viajero\\", Commencement Speaker - Francisco Sionil José, Foundation Time Community Page, Community Issue, Foundation Time, Foundation Time Official Bulletin of Foundation University, negroschronicle.com The literary theme is about the constant search of the Filipino people for “social justice and moral order”.Viajero (A Filipino Novel) by F. Sionil José, amazon.com Viajero is one of the literary representatives embodying the fulfillment of the Filipinos' \\"emergent- nationalism\\". Main characters The lead character of Viajero was an orphan named Salvador dela Raza (a Spanish name meaning “Savior of the [Filipino] Race”). In 1945, Raza was adopted and brought to America by James Wack, an African-American captain of the United States military. Dela Raza was a firsthand witness of the Filipino diaspora. Dela Raza was described to be a Philippine-born \\"nationalist hero\\" independent of American colonial influence who was able to recover the past of the Philippines long thought lost due to \\"colonial oppression\\". Dela Raza was the missing link or filler of the fundamental gaps or disjunctions between the Filipino Ilustrados and the common people known as the masa (referring to the \\"mass[ive number] of people\\" or the Philippine public), and between Filipino expatriates and the Filipinos who stayed in the Philippines. However, Dela Raza's knowledge of American issues and history made Viajero an allegorical reinforcement of \\"ideological interdependence\\" and reaffirmation of \\"American colonial tutelage\\", which was contrary to the goal of contemporary Filipino nationalists. Such goal was to define and diffentiate the Filipino view of nationalism from the American form of nationalism. Other characters include the wife of Leo Mercado, Father Jess, and Simplicio Verdad (a name meaning \\"Simple Truth\\" or \\"Simply True\\" in translation). Some characters from José's The Rosales Saga also resurfaced in Viajero, such as Pepe Samson of José's Mass in the person of a full-pledged insurgent. Description Viajero tackled Philippine History and the character of the Filipino people prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. The other “epic voyages” experienced by the Filipinos included the country’s contact with China, the tragedy of Ferdinand Magellan in Mactan Island, the voyages of galleon through the Pacific Ocean, the movement of Filipino men and women workers to the Middle East, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo Japan. Although a novel about the Philippines, Viajero was also described as a novel about America because Dela Raza was educated by his American stepfather. Through Wack (a representation of the United States in the novel), Dela Raza learned of the issues that existed in America: racial discrimination, colonialism, failures of political ideals, betrayals of nationwide democracy, and ironies of American History. By discovering the American shortcomings, Dela Raza saw the failures in Philippine History. Thus Dela Raza was able to instruct and rejuvenate the Filipino youth to search in the past for answers in order to solve the Philippines' problems. Through Viajero José was able to point out the \\"failed opportunity of the revolution\\" to create the changes that could have been made by Corazon Aquino for the Filipino people when she was president.

Although O'Neill did not play in Celtic's victory in the 1967 European Cup Final, he was an important member of the first team squad, making 32 appearances in the 1966–67 season.

At the time of O'Neill's death, Craig remarked that O'Neill was a defensive-minded full-back, who rarely made forays into the opposition's half of the field. This style of play was in keeping with the traditional function of the position, but full-backs were being expected to attack more by the mid-1960s. Indeed, fellow full-back Tommy Gemmell scored the equalising goal in the European Cup Final victory. O'Neill made a total of 86 appearances for Celtic, 55 of those in Scottish Football League matches. He represented the Scottish League once, in 1968.

The episode, by Israeli director Dan Setton, investigated the rise of the religious right in Israel and the role it could play as a \\"spoiler\\" in peace negotiations with the Palestinians.Frontline: Israel's Next War: An Interview with Dan Setton It was Setton's second documentary film for PBS: his previous film for them, \\"Shattered Dreams of Peace,\\"Frontline: Shattered Dreams of Peace, the Road from Oslo won him a Peabody Award.Peabody Awards . The film Setton explains that the inspiration for his project came from his previous film, In the Name of God (HBO), an investigation of fundamentalist Islam and suicide bombers, for which he received an Emmy Award.Time Warner. Having investigated radical religion in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and South Lebanon, Setton decided to take his investigation closer to home and investigate how right-wing religious fundamentalism was impacting Orthodox Jews in Israel. The phenomenon of the radical right had already made an enormous impact on Israeli society following the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre in 1994 by Baruch Goldstein,G.J. Church et al., \\"When Fury Rules\\", Time, March 7, 1994 and the assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin by Yigal Amir the following year.BBC On This Day. Two groups associated with these events, Kach and Kahane Chai, were declared terrorist organizations by the Israeli and U.S. governments, respectively.. While Setton found that the activist core of these groups was small, some 30 percent of Israelis identified with their ideology of establishing an exclusively Jewish state. To better understand the phenomenon, he decided to investigate a lesser-known incident that had failed - a plot to bomb a Palestinian girls' school in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of At-Tur. During the film, Setton interviews the two perpetrators, Shlomo Dvir and Yarden Morag, in prison, and visits the settlement of Bat Ayin, where they lived.Frontline: Israel's Next War. Dvir admits to the camera that it was his idea, saying, \\"Whoever gets hurt gets hurt.\\" These interviews serve as a hook, leading Setton to various other settlers, who supported Dvir and Morag. Some are very explicit about the motivations for the attack: \\"Revenge\\", says Noam Federman, \\"is an important value. The Talmud says that it is one of the greatest things. Revenge is great.\\"Frontline: Israel's Next War: Transcript He believes that revenge is the motive for people like Yitzhak Paz,This is the spelling of the name as given in the transcript of the film here. Note that in the interview with Setton here, the name is given as Yitshak Pass. formerly of the Jewish settlement in Hebron, whose 10-month-old daughter Shalhevet was killed by a sniper, while he and his wife were walking with her in the street. Paz's arrest for the possession of explosives helped the police to unravel the case against Dvir and Morag. As the film unfolds, however, Setton discovers that the extremists' motives extend far beyond acts of personal revenge against the Palestinians. Shmuel Ben Yishai, a follower of Meir Kahane now living in the settlement of Kiryat Arba, is no less antagonistic toward the State of Israel in its current configuration: \\"The Israeli secular entity has to be destroyed,\\" he says. \\"God can't reveal himself until it's all wiped out. As long as the state of Israel stays as it is, there will be no redemption.\\" An Israeli editorial on the series noted that \\"Words like 'redemption,' 'sanctify', and 'revenge' marble the vocabulary of these people.\\"Sam Allis. \\"Frontline takes an unsettling look at extremist Israeli settlers', in the Jerusalem Post, April 5, 2005. On the other hand, the extremists believe that this will one day change. Mike Guzovsky says: \\"I think the day will come when the Secret Service and the government will look for Jews who are willing to go into the Arab villages and kick them out, kill them …\\"This appears in the English-language transcript cited above, and is quoted in the aforementioned article in the Jerusalem Post, however, based on a careful audit of the original Hebrew spoken by Guzovsky, it seems that he did not actually say \\"kick them out, kill them\\", but rather תדאג שהם לא יצאו משם, i. e., \\"make sure that they don't leave\\". During the film, Setton also speaks with the Israeli authorities under whose tenure the events occurred. Avi Dichter, head of the Shin Bet at the time, tells him that, \\" Jewish terror is liable to create a serious strategic threat that will turn the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into a conflict between 13 million Jews and a billion Muslims all over the world.\\" Yitzhak Dar, the head of the Jewish section of the Shin Bet, draws a distinction between believers and activists: \\"As long as they're only thinking it, as long as they're only talking about it, we can live with it. When they try to put it into action, through the murder of the prime minister, through the murder of Arabs, through the massacre at the Hebron mosque, it's the beginning of the end of a nation that can defend itself.\\" Israeli response to the film On October 20, 2005, five months after the documentary screened on PBS, an extended version of it was shown on Israel's Channel 2. Although Israelis had long been aware of the extremist activities of its fundamentalists, the overwhelming response was one of horror to hear their underlying ideology articulated. The national newspaper Haaretz titled its review of the film \\"A Horror Film\\",Ruta Kupfer, \\"סרט אימה\\", in Haaretz 20 October 2005. but quickly attempted to insinuate that the phenomenon was not indigenous to Israel, and had been imported there largely by American Jewish immigrants. The lede paragraph of the article notes of the extremists that, \\"They are 'serious to death', as they say in English, the mother tongue of no small part of them ...\\". Setton, however, disagreed with this analysis, and attempted to argue that the ideology, if not the actions, are prevalent among large segment of Israeli society. He admits that there are no confirmed numbers of people who adhere to that ideology, though in an interview with PBS, he estimates that it is about 30 percent of the country's Jewish population. After quoting Shmuel Ben Yishai saying that there is no religious justification for leaving any Palestinian in a Jewish state, Setton comments, \\"To some people, this is extreme, but others who are more centrist and more religious do not see anything wrong with what he is saying. They see a brave man who is expressing what he feels. It all depends on where your political compass lies.\\" Nevertheless, Setton does see a difference between these extremists and the Islamic fundamentalists, who were the subject of his previous film \\"In the Name of God\\". He explains, \\"They have something unique to them - the adoration of death as a value. With us, it is something internal that does not come from the same motives, but from other causes. There is no room for comparison, except in their religious beliefs.\\" External links *Frontline: Israel's Next War *  See also References Category:Israeli television shows Category:Israeli documentary films Category:Israeli films Category:Neo-Zionism Category:Documentary films about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict ","title":"Israel's Next War"},{"id":"26540287","text":"Volmer Sportsman at Airventure 2009 The Volmer VJ-22 Sportsman is an American homebuilt amphibious aircraft.

The genre involves different styles including hardcore punk, metalcore, gothic metal, heavy metal, alternative rock, punk, ska, blues, and grunge. Recognition and acceptance of the genre Rock music is widely listened to and enjoyed in Ecuador, however, some forms of the genres are not broadly accepted in certain more conservative sectors of Ecuadorian society where there can be a great deal of prejudice toward the genre. Until the midst of the 1990s rockeros of all kinds have been discriminated against. Consequently a powerful alliance of segments of the Catholic Church, the police and other government institutions has been formed against rock music. Even in the new millennium the official media discourse is highly discriminative against the rockeros. This is evidently shown by the reactions towards the tragedy of a fire blaze which broke out in the nightclub Factory in Quito on April 19th in 2008 during a gothic rock festival \\"Ecuador gótico\\" and an awards ceremony. In this fire at least 19 people died and 24 were injured. In the flames all members of the band \\"Zelestial\\" were literally wiped out. Particularly significant was the reaction in the daily press. Although there was great sympathy with the victims, their families and friends, on the other hand some journalists – such as Jorge Ortiz in \\"Hora\\" or Fernando Ehlers in \\"La TV\\" argued that the tragedy had been the result of the \\"satanic practices\\", vandalism and the morbid gothic cultures of the rockeros and metaleros. Nevertheless, rock continues to be a popular genre in the country. Unlike Argentina or Mexico, which have dedicated rock record labels, Ecuador lacks a music industry that supports Ecuadorian rock bands. This is an issue of the Ecuadorian music industry that as a whole has had relatively limited support and investment. Although, in recent years, a small rock music industry has developed in Ecuador, many Ecuadorian bands believe the lack of a strong local music industry is the primary reason that Ecuadorian rock music has not found international commercial success. Influences on the development of Ecuadorian rock Rock music was introduced to Ecuadorian audiences in the late 1950s through radio and television music programs. The primary influences on the evolution of Ecuadorian rock were Mexican and Argentine rock; however, the political environment during the Ecuadorian revolution of the 1960s also influenced the genre. The Hippies are recognized as one of the first Ecuadorian rock groups. Since the midst of the 1990s several mestizo-bands in Ecuador made use of indigenous musical elements in rock music. Rocola Bacalao integrated Andean rhythms and made in their song-texts references to emblematic indigenous towns, such as Pujilí in Cotopaxi. Sal y Mileto and Casería de Lagartos coined the genre of new Ecuadorian Rock. Nevertheless, in the 1980s and the early 1990s the rhythm of the social as expressed in Ecuadorian rock was characterized by hopelessness and resistance or even resignation against repression. With the emergence of a powerful indigenous movement organized in the Conaie the rhythm changed. The most emblematic references towards the political impact of the indigenous movement are made by the metalband Aztra and the hardcore band CURARE at the beginning of the 2000s, during the heyday of indigenous social protest against neoliberalism and for (ethnic) democratization.Olaf Kaltmeier 2019. \\"Rockin\`for Pachamama: political struggle and the narration of history in Ecuadorian rock music.” In: Sonic Politics. Ed. Olaf Kaltmeier and Wilfried Raussert. New York: Routledge 2019, p.179-204. Health promotion messages in Ecuadorian rock In recent years, Ecuadorian rock groups have collaborated with non-governmental organisations (NGOSs) to promote health messages targeted at young people. In 2005, Cacería de Lagartos (Lizard Hunt), partnered with the Ecuadorian Red Cross to create an education campaign promoting HIV awareness.

Quintus Catius was an officer (legatus) of the Roman Republic during the Second Punic War. Catius was plebeian aedile with Lucius Porcius Licinius in 210 BC. Using money collected through fines, they dedicated bronze statues at the Temple of Ceres and presented games (ludi) that the Augustan historian Livy says were quite magnificent for their time.Livy 27.6.19: ex multaticio argento signa aenea ad Cereris dedere et ludos pro temporis eius copia magnifici apparatus fecerunt. Unless otherwise noted, dates, offices, and citations of ancient sources from T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1951, 1986), vol. 1, pp. 279, 297 and 304. In 207 BC, Catius was left in charge of the Roman camp at Canusium when his commanding officer Gaius Claudius Tiberius Nero joined consular colleague Marcus Livius Salinator to fight against Hasdrubal.Livy 27.43.12. Nero's move was virtually unprecedented; a consul was to fight only within his own provincia with the troops assigned to him by the senate, but Nero thought the circumstances justified extreme measures which also gave him an element of surprise.English translation by Aubrey de Sélincourt, Livy: The War With Hannibal (Penguin Books, 1965, 1972), p. 486 online. Catius was left to face off against Hannibal, who decided to stay put. This delegation of authority anticipated a highly controversial case two years later concerning an egregious exercise of imperium under Scipio AfricanusScipio had not earned his cognomen Africanus yet, but this is the name by which he is best known to history. by his legate Quintus Pleminius; Catius, by contrast, had benefitted from the nearby support of the experienced and respected Fulvius Flaccus, a four-time consul.Serge Lancel, Hannibal (Blackwell, 1999, from the French edition of 1995), p. 147. Ruin of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi In 205, Catius and Marcus Pomponius Matho, who would later become the praetor in charge of the investigation against Pleminius, were sent as Rome's ambassadors to Delphi with gifts to dedicate at the temple. These included a 200-pound gold crown and images (simulacra) of the spoils seized from Hasdrubal, amounting to 1,000 pounds of silver.Livy 28.45.12: Tulerunt coronam aureaum ducentum pondo et simulacra spoliorum ex mille pondo argenti facta. This embassy occurred in the context of what Livy characterizes as a sudden attack of religiosity at Rome,Livy 29.10: ciuitatem eo tempore repens religio inuaserat (\\"A sudden religiosity invaded the citizenry at that time\\"). which in addition to a consultation with the Sibylline books resulted most famously in the importation of the cult of Cybele to Rome. Catius and Matho received favorable omens when they sacrificed to Pythian Apollo at Delphi. The question posed by the Roman ambassadors goes unrecorded, but the oracle responded with what was probably already a safe prediction: \\"The Roman people will soon have a victory much greater than that from whose spoils you have brought gifts.\\" This was taken as confirmation of Scipio's desire to operate in Africa.Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, The Delphic Oracle, Its Responses and Operations, with a Catalogue of Responses (University of California Press, 1978), p. 345, noting that Livy's source may be the historian Fabius Pictor. The Catii were an obscure family; the only other member to attain prominence during the Republic was Gaius Catius Vestinus, a military tribune in 43 BC under Marcus Antonius.

Traces of these beliefs survive in the later Abrahamic religions that came to dominate the region. The concept of ghosts or spirits in Mesopotamia is comparable to the shades of the deceased in the Underworld in the mythology of classical antiquity. The shades or spirits of the deceased were known as ' ( ) in Sumerian, which was borrowed as ' in Akkadian. The Sumerian word is analyzed as a compound of either gig \\"to be sick\\" and dim3 \\"a demon\\", or gi6 \\"black\\" + dim4 \\"to approach\\".John A. Halloran, Sumerian Lexicon Version 3.0, sumerian.org Gidim were thought to be created at time of death, taking on the memory and personality of the dead person. They traveled to the netherworld, Irkalla, where they were assigned a position, and led an existence similar in some ways to that of the living. Relatives of the dead were expected to make offerings of food and drink to the dead to ease their conditions. If they did not, the ghosts could inflict misfortune and illness on the living. Traditional healing practices ascribed a variety of illnesses to the action of ghosts, while others were caused by gods or demons. s.v. \\"gidim\\". Some sources say the spirit was \\"inherited from the slain god whose body was used in creating man\\". Netherworld The Burney Relief (c. 1792 - 1750 BC), representing an ancient Babylonian goddess, possibly Inanna or Ereshkigal In Mesopotamian religion, Irkalla, the Underworld, is ruled by the goddess Ereshkigal and her consort Nergal or Ninazu. Ghosts spent some time traveling to the netherworld, often having to overcome obstacles along the way. The Anunnaki, the court of the netherworld, welcomed each ghost and received their offerings. The court explained the rules and assigned the ghost his fate or place. Another court was presided over by the sun god Utu, who visited the netherworlds on his daily round, Shamash might punish ghosts who harassed the living, and might award a share of funerary offerings to forgotten ghosts. The Babylonian netherworld was populated by an array of monsters and demons. However, within the netherworld the ghosts existed in a manner similar to the living. They had houses and could meet with deceased family members and associates. The Epic of Gilgamesh revolves around a relationship between the hero-king Gilgamesh and his close companion, Enkidu. It may loosely refer to a real king of the 27th century BCE. Part of the story relates Enkidu's death, the adventures of his ghost in the underworld, and the eventual return to the world when Gilgamesh breaks a hole in the earth. Interaction with the living The Babylonians believed that life in the underworld could be made more tolerable if the surviving relatives regularly made offerings of food and drink. The ghosts of people without children to make these offerings would suffer more, while people who died in fire or whose body lies in the desert would have no ghost at all. If the relatives failed to make offerings, the ghost could become restless and visit sickness and misfortune on them. Physical ailments resulting from hearing or seeing a ghost included headaches, eye and ear problems, various intestinal pains, shortness of breath and dizziness, fever and neurological and mental disorders. Cures involved ritual performances with use of offerings, libations, figurines, ritual burial and dispatch, encirclement, amulets, fumigants, bandages, salves, potions, washes, and suppositories. Other Mesopotamian diseases were blamed on gods or ghosts, each causing a particular sickness. Jo Ann Scurlock, Burton R.

Samuel Murray (circa 1890). Photographer: Thomas Eakins? Samuel Aloysius Murray (1869 - November 3, 1941) was an American sculptor, educator, and protégé of the painter Thomas Eakins. Murray and Eakins Murray, the 11th of 12 children of an Irish stone cutter and his wife, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and educated in the city's parochial schools. In September 1886, at age 17, he entered the seven-month-old Art Students' League of Philadelphia, where he studied under Eakins.McHenry, pp. 71-72. He soon became a favored student, then Eakins's assistant, and was listed as an instructor in 1892.The school closed its doors in early 1893. The two artists shared a studio at 1330 Chestnut Street from 1892 to about 1900, sometimes painting and sculpting from the same model. The pair spent a great deal of time together: working side by side, bicycling around Philadelphia, attending boxing matches, fishing in Gloucester, New Jersey, and taking trips and vacations together. Murray accompanied Eakins on visits to Walt Whitman in Camden, New Jersey (across the Delaware River from Philadelphia), and following the poet's death on March 26, 1892, the pair cast a plaster death mask of his face.McHenry, p. 85. Murray introduced Eakins to Catholic priests at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, and Eakins painted portraits of a number of them. Eakins painted an 1889 portrait of Murray, and featured him in a number of paintings and photographs. Murray modeled at least three figures of Eakins. The exact nature of their relationship is the subject of speculation, but Murray remained a lifelong friend to Eakins, and helped care for the disabled painter in his old age.

At age 21 (reportedly, on Eakins's recommendation), Murray was hired by the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (now Moore College of Art) as an instructor in modeling from life and a lecturer in anatomy--a position he held for over 50 years. Among his students were Edythe Ferris, Bessie Pease Gutmann, Alice Neel, Anne Parrish, Ella Peacock, and most of the Philadelphia Ten. Murray's career as a sculptor had a propitious beginning: in March 1896, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts mounted a solo exhibition of his work. (He was age 27.)This was to be the only solo exhibition during his lifetime. His first major commission came in September 1896, for ten colossal terracotta statues of Biblical prophets to adorn the facade of Philadelphia's Witherspoon Building.Sculptor Alexander Stirling Calder modeled statues of Presbyterian theologians for the same building. Eakins is rumored to have assisted on the project, and at least six of the figures were modeled on members of their \\"circle\\": > Moses: Walt Whitman (posthumous) > Isaiah: George W. Holmes (posthumous, posed for Eakins's The Chess Players) > Deborah: Susan Macdowell Eakins (Eakins's wife) > Samuel: Franklin L.

Macdowell (Eakins's father-in-law) > Huldah: Jennie Dean Kershaw (Murray's fiancé, and later wife) The models for Elijah, Ezekiel, Daniel and John the Baptist have not been identified. The terracotta statues were removed from the building in 1961; only three of them survive: Moses, Elijah, and Samuel.Chamberlin-Hellman, pp. 134-39. Over the course of half a century, he modeled about a dozen large sculptures in bronze, the ten Witherspoon prophets, and nearly 200 portrait busts, miniatures and statuettes. Some of the commissions - Commodore Joseph Barry (1906–08), Father William Corby (1909–10), Bishop John W. Shanahan Memorial (1916–18) - may have come through his ties to Philadelphia's Irish- Catholic community. (One of his sisters was a nun.) His work was shown frequently at PAFA's annual exhibitions from 1892 to 1933, occasionally at the National Academy of Design and the National Sculpture Society (both in New York City), and at exhibitions in the United States and the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. His most ambitious commission was for work on the Pennsylvania State Memorial (1909–10), on the Gettysburg Battlefield. An immense granite pavilion, Murray modeled the bas-reliefs of battle scenes over its four arches, and the 21-foot-tall (originally gold-patinaed) goddess that crowns its dome. The latter seems to echo Augustus Saint-Gaudens's Sherman Memorial in Central Park, New York City, of a decade earlier.Saint-Gaudens's Angel Personal Following an engagement of nearly 20 years, Murray married illustrator Jennie Dean Kershaw (1866-1952) in March 1916.Henry Adams, \\" 'The One I Most Love'--Thomas Eakins's Portrait of Samuel Murray,\\" in Cynthia Fowler, ed., Locating American Art: Finding Art's Meaning in Museums (New York: Routledge, 2017), p. 130.

They had no children. Samuel Murray died in Philadelphia, at the age of 72. His widow donated a couple of his pieces to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, which also holds a collection of his papers. A competent sculptor and a sensitive modeler of faces, Murray is remembered more for his personal ties to Eakins than his body of work.

He lives and works in Paris.  Biography  From 1992 to 1997, he studied science at the École normale supérieure (ENS) on rue d’Ulm, in Paris. In 1995 he joined the visual arts department, directed by Chris Killip, at Harvard University (United States). Under his supervision, he produced the series of photographs, ‘American TV,’ found today in the Photographic Collections department at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMa) in New York. In 1997, he returned to France and took classes with Christian Boltanski at the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts in Paris. From 2000 to 2009, his photographs were exhibited at the Photographic Resource Center in Boston (United States), at the State Russian Museum in Saint-Petersburg, and at the Affordable Art Fair in London.  Work  All the photographic series that Vincent Goutal has produced, up to Transitions (2009), have a social documentary photographic style. For Cuban Impressions (2003–2005), he knocked at one door after another, to photograph the interiors of homes. He does not speak Spanish and his equipment- camera, lights, stand – is not discreet, but he always managed to go in and take photographs, at times without a single word being uttered.In absentia, photographies d'intérieurs cubains For the Transitions series, Vincent Goutal wrote very elaborate scenarios which describe precise social situations with his partner Olivia Leriche. The shots involve complicated staging where the lighting plays a particular role, like in 1950s film noir genre. The goal is to obtain pictures, of an almost allegorical nature, of stereotypes with a certain social success (businessman, pilot, executive woman) where, however, solitude or incommunicability with others is apparent.

The school has approximately 449 students of which approximately 103 are boarders. It offers the traditional Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate courses along with Transition Year, which is compulsory. It is under Church of Ireland management. The school has a large amount of international pupils, primarily from Spain, Germany and South Korea, though there are also pupils from Russia and Ukraine as well as a number of other nations. History and future planning The school has existed in various forms for over 400 years, its constitutions reflecting the changing outlook and needs for society. The present school incorporates part of the Charter School which was set up in 1752 under the Royal Charter. This school closed in 1843. The Diocesan School In Elphin, which numbered Oliver Goldsmith among its pupils, was moved to Charter School buildings in Sligo in 1862. In 1907, the school buildings were conveyed to the Incorporated Society who closed their boarding school at Primrose Grange under Knocknarea and built spacious dormitories and classrooms (the present boy’s dormitories and \\"Prep Room\\") on the present site, of Sligo Grammar School. In 1947 Sligo Grammar School was merged with Sligo High School which was founded by Dean Ardill in 1911. The premises of the High School were closed and the residence known as the \\"Hermitage\\", adjoining the Grammar School, was purchased from the Campbell family to house the girl boarders. The New Teaching Block was added in 1971, and expanded in 1985 and 2002. In August 1976, the school was leased by the Incorporated Society to Sligo Grammar School Limited, which runs the school through a local Protestant board. \\"The Hermitage\\" was destroyed by fire in November 1976 and was replaced by a new residence in September 1978. An extension to the school including more classrooms and a new library was completed in September 2012. A new rugby pitch (to replace the old 'Donkey pitch') and slip for kayaking are to be finished by September 2013. A new wall and gate has recently been completed on the entrance to the school.

The Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development recognises the increasing scarcity of water as a result of the different conflicting uses and overuses of water.  The Dublin Principles  The declaration sets out recommendations for action at local, national and international levels to reduce the scarcity, through the following four guiding principles: #Fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life, development and the environment #Water development and management should be based on a participatory approach, involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels #Women play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water #Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good  Water as a human right or economic good?  The emphasis of the Dublin Statement on the economic value of water rather than water as a universal right is highly contested by NGOs and human rights activists (although the full text of principle 4 does state it is vital to recognize first the basic right of all human beings to have access to clean water and sanitation at an affordable price) In November 2002, however, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted General Comment No. 15, which was formulated by experts as a comment on articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In this comment, water is recognised not only as a limited natural resource and a public good but also as a human right. This step - adopting General Comment No. 15 - was seen as a decisive step towards the recognition of water as universal right. On 30 September 2010, the 15th Session of the UN Human Rights Council passed Resolution A/HRC/15/L.14, reaffirming an earlier General Assembly resolution (64/292 of 28 July 2010) which recognized the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights. Resolution A/HRC/15/L.14 clarifies that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and human dignity.

John McNulty is a major figure in the development of the genre of literary journalism. Contribution to development of genre of literary journalism It is the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Prof. Sims who credits Joseph Mitchell, John McNulty and other short piece writers at Harold Ross’ designedly succoring The New Yorker magazine with evolving an early 20th- century reformer news writer's practice into a separate literary genre.Norman Sims, Literary Journalism in the 20th Century, Northwest University Press, © 1990 Oxford University Press, Chapter 4 “Joseph Mitchell and the New York Nonfiction Writers”, pp 82-108, particularly, pp 83 and 84. In fact, as here noted, editor Norman Sim’s dedicates his own written entire chapter of the text to this theme or to quote him there the “new writers (at the New Yorker), who made enduring contributions to literary journalism: John Hersey, John McNulty, Geoffrey Hellman …”, p. 83. Sim’s also notes there that in this nascent stage, literary journalism was simply referred to popularly as the “New Yorker style”. In his seminal work Literary Journalism in the 20th Century, Norman Sims traces the roots of literary journalism to journalist reformers efforts to make their news reports so poignant as to compel others to undertake corrective social actions.See Norman Sims, Literary Journalism in the 20th Century, Northwest University Press, © 1990 Oxford University Press. At its Chapters 2 and 3, this work provides as example for this thesis the early journalistic work of Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck. In Steibeck’s example, which is particularly compelling of Prof. Sim’s argument, contributor William Howarth there examples the evolution of Steinbeck’s news reports, which he skewered in text and photograph to advocate for improved treatment of California’s Dust Bowl immigrants, directly to his literary masterpiece, The Grapes of Wrath. In Literary Journalism’s Chapter 3, titled “Journalism and the Grapes of Wrath”, Howarth quotes the writer John Steinbeck as stating “I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for [neglecting the migrants] but I can do it best through newspapers.” The later genre of literary journalism, as stated by Sim's to have been evolved by McNulty and other short piece writers at the New Yorker magazine, is no longer conflicted between unbiased fact reporting and the enhanced portrayal of social conditions for some form of advocacyEven, if the exclusive goal of the advocating, as in McNulty's case, is simply to gain the reader’s recognition of the dignity of the character(s) or socioeconomic class(es) portrayed by the author. but, concentrates upon such latter portrayal, while using actual events as a creative substrate. Literary journalism does, however, still demand accurate fact reporting of its practitioners. McNulty's words are near unrivaled, at evoking in their readers’ minds, such poignant imagery, and in their readers’ hearts, such concern and affection for his very common characters. Early life, education and career John McNulty was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1895. John's father died during John's early childhood. He was raised by his mother, who operated a small store to support her family.Edd Applegate, Literary Journalism: a biographical dictionary of writers and editors, ©1996 Greenwood Publishing Group, Westport, Connecticut, p 173 John McNulty served to the rank of noncommissioned officer in the U.S. infantry in France during World War I. McNulty fought in several of the war's major battles. It was sadly at the 1918 Battle of Tardenois, also known as the Second Battle of the Marne, the decisive Allied victory that lead to the Central Powers’ capitulation and the end of World War I or the war to end all wars within 100 days thereof, that the thereto unscathed John McNulty finally suffered a massive wound to his leg that left him with a severe limp for the rest of his life. No other noncommissioned officer in John’s company survived the war.again, Edd Applegate, Literary Journalism: a biographical dictionary of writers and editors, ©1996 Greenwood Publishing Group, Westport, Connecticut, p 173 After recouping from his injury for more than a year, John attended the Columbia School of Journalism while working for the Associated Press. After graduating from Columbia University, John went to work as a reporter for the New York Post newspaper. He subsequently worked as a reporter in chronological order for the Columbus, Ohio Ohio State Journal newspaper, the New York Daily Mirror newspaper, the New York Daily News newspaper, and, then, as a staff writer at Time (magazine), before in 1937 joining his close friend James Thurber at The New Yorker magazine, where McNulty remained until his death from a heart attack in 1956.Edd Applegate, Literary Journalism: a biographical dictionary of writers and editors, ©1996 Greenwood Publishing Group, Westport, Connecticut, p 174 Notoriety and Legacy The success of J. A. McNulty’s 1941 short story “Atheist Hit By A Truck” catapulted him into the national spotlight and cemented his reputation and further career path as an author rather than a journalist.’’The Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography’’, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, © 1995, John S. Bowman ed., p. 491, John's wife, Faith McNulty, was an author and children's book writer known for penning The Burning Bed, which was eventually turned into a 1984 film featuring Farrah Fawcett.Faith McNulty McNulty's great-grand nephew Matt McNulty also worked as a reporter for the New York Post, much like John did in the early 1930s before writing for The New Yorker. Literary works and close friendship with Thurber Many of John McNulty's stories deal with New York saloon life and its characters. McNulty was a lifelong friend, associate, and drinking companion of writer and humorist James Thurber, who McNulty had early mentored while in Ohio.http://shortnorth.com/ThurberConnection.html McNulty wrote at The New Yorker with Thurber, Joseph Mitchell, S. J. Perelman, E. B. White and others. They met at Costello's saloon on Third Avenue in New York City as members of the \\"square table\\" (in contrast with the literary wits who met at the Algonquin Round Table). Thurber eulogized McNulty in the New Yorker and wrote a long and extraordinarily affectionate foreword to (The World of John McNulty) the earliest posthumous collection of his friend's stories.\\"This Place on Third Avenue\\", John McNulty, Counterpoint, Washington, D.C., c.2001, foreword \\"John As He Was\\" by wife Faith McNulty, pp ix- xxxix.http://shortnorth.com/ThurberConnection.html According to Thurber, The New Yorker published more than sixty pieces by McNulty.

In portion, Thurber's tribute to his early mentor and close friend McNulty “Nothing, however, commonplace, that he touched remained commonplace but, was magnified and enlivened by his intense and endless fascination with the stranger in the street, the drinker in the bar, and the bartender behind it, the horseplayer, the cab driver, the guy at the ballgame, the fellow across the room, the patient in the next hospital bed.” - James Thurber of his fellow writer and dearest friend John McNulty.The World of John McNulty, © 1957 NY Doubleday, pp 9-10.

He signed with Fresh's label German Dream and was featured in three songs in his 2005 mixtape Fick immer noch deine Story (\\"Fuck your story still\\"), which was Eko's diss against his former mentor and friend, German- based rapper Kool Savas.

The Alcazaba is accessed from the Puente Romano through a small enclosure, traditionally known Alcarazejo. This was used to check the traffic of pedestrians and goods to the city. Annexed is the military area, whose gate is flanked by two towers; over the horseshoe-shaped arc is an inscription celebrating Abd ar-Rahman patronage of the work.

Background  When the band performed at the South by Southwest festival in 2000, they impressed Simon Raymonde and Robin Guthrie so much that the duo decided to sign the band to their record label, Bella Union, that same day. The band's characteristic sound comes from a solo guitar with heavy use of effects pedals and a modified Leslie speaker. The band's major work, the double-disc concept album The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads, was released in 2001. The album's lyrics are replete with Biblical Christian imagery relating to the Second Coming of Christ and a professed love of Texas and the United States. The music features a multilayered Wall of Sound and feedback-driven aesthetic. The band performed three times on the John Peel BBC Radio 1 show. The band was not active as such for long. Pearson has pursued a solo career, while Young formed a project, Western Arms, with Elbow frontman Guy Garvey. Young now has a band, The Flowers of God, which released a four-song EP in September 2010. As of late 2011, Browning plays bass in Fort Worth, Texas- based shoegaze-styled band Year of the Bear.

Arliss plays Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington in the events leading up to the Battle of Waterloo and beyond. Plot With Napoleon defeated and exiled, the reluctant Duke of Wellington (George Arliss) is persuaded by Lord Castelreagh (Gerald Lawrence) to represent Great Britain's interests at the Congress of Vienna, where the victorious allies will decide the future of Europe. While there, his friend the Duchess of Richmond (Norma Varden) introduces the married man to the pretty Lady Frances Webster (Lesley Wareing), an ardent admirer, at her ball. During the course of the evening, however, Wellington receives an urgent message: Napoleon has escaped and has landed in France. French King Louis XVIII and his niece and most trusted adviser, Madame, the Duchess d'Angoulême (Gladys Cooper), are not alarmed in the least. Ney (Edmund Willard), formerly one of Napoleon's marshals, volunteers to take 4000 picked men and capture his former leader. However, he switches sides. With France once again under Napoleon's control, both sides race to reassemble their armies. Napoleon routs the Prussians under Marshal Blücher (Franklin Dyall) before coming to grips with his old nemesis Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. At the crucial point of the battle, Blücher's timely arrival turns the tide, and Napoleon is defeated for the final time. The allies occupy France and gather in Paris to divide the spoils. Once again, Castelreagh sends Wellington to try to restrain the others from punishing France too severely, in order to ensure a lasting peace. Wellington's task is made more difficult by the opposition of Madame, who is certain he wants to rule France himself. Wellington warns Louis that Madame's desire to have the still popular Ney executed for treason would risk another revolution. Madame arranges for Wellington's recall to London, to answer a newspaper story that he is carrying on an affair with Lady Frances. Wellington soon disproves the claim, but while he is gone, Ney is convicted and shot by firing squad. The French people are outraged. Upon his return, Wellington forces the King to dismiss his advisers, including Madame. Back in London, Wellington has to defend his decision to accept no reparations for his country.

The album was remastered and reissued for its 15-year anniversary by Mute Records on February 3, 2017. The album was reissued across three separate formats, all featuring revised artwork: a 2-CD set; a double vinyl LP set pressed on blue and red colored vinyl; and a deluxe 4-LP box set including the band's first demo EP and live recordings.

The throne is said by various holy books to reside beyond the Seventh Heaven and is called Araboth ( ‘ărāḇōṯ) in Judaism,In Seventh Heaven and al-'Arsh in Islam. Many in the Christian religion consider the ceremonial chair as symbolizing or representing an allegory of the holy Throne of God. Judaism Micaiah (1 Kings 22:19), Isaiah (Isaiah 6), Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1) and Daniel (Daniel 7:9) all speak of God's throne although some philosophers, such as Saʿadiah Gaon and Maimonides, interpreted such mention of a \\"throne\\" as allegory. The heavenly throne room or throne room of God is a more detailed presentation of the throne, into the representation of throne room or divine court. Micaiah's throneroom vision Micaiah's extended prophecy (1 Kings 22:19) is the first detailed depiction of a heavenly throne room in Judaism. Zechariah's throneroom vision Zechariah 3 depicts a vision of the heavenly throne room where Satan and the Angel of the Lord contend over Joshua the High Priest in the time of his grandson Eliashib the High Priest. Many Christians consider this a literal event, others such as Goulder (1998) view the vision as symbolic of crisis on earth, such as opposition from Sanballat the Horonite.M. D. Goulder The Psalms of the return (book V, Psalms 107-150) 1998 p. 197 \\"The vision of Joshua and the Accuser in Zechariah 3 seems to be a reflection of such a crisis.\\" Dead Sea Scrolls The concept of a heavenly throne occurs in three Dead Sea Scroll texts. Later speculation on the throne of God became a theme of Merkabah mysticism.Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls: N-Z Lawrence H. Schiffman, James C.

In the New Testament, the Throne of God is talked about in several forms. Including Heaven as the Throne of God, The Throne of David, The Throne of Glory, The Throne of Grace and many more. The New Testament continues Jewish identification of heaven itself as the \\"throne of God\\",William Barclay The Gospel of Matthew: Chapters 11-28 p340 Matthew 23:22 \\"And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.\\" but also locates the throne of God as \\"in heaven\\" and having a secondary seat at the Right Hand of God for the Session of Christ.Philip Edgecumbe Hughes A Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews p401 1988 \\"The theme of Christ's heavenly session, announced here by the statement he sat down at the right hand of God, .. Hebrews 8:1 \\"we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven\\")\\" Revelation The Book of Revelation describes the Seven Spirits of God which surround the throne, and John wishes his readers in the Seven Asian churches to be blessed with grace from God, from the seven who are before God's throne, and from Jesus Christ in Heaven. John states that in front of the throne there appears to be \\"a sea of glass, clear as crystal\\", and that the throne is surrounded by a lion, an ox, a man, and a flying eagle; each with six wings and covered with eyes, who constantly cry \\"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come\\" repeatedly. It is also said that \\"out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices\\". Isaiah In Isaiah 6, Isaiah sees the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train (robe) filled the temple. Above the throne stood the Seraphims (angelic beings), and each one had 6 wings. With two wings they covered their face, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And the Seraphims were calling out to one another, \\"Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts\\" (Some translations title Him, 'Lord of heavens armies', or 'Lord Almighty'). Their voices shook the temple to its foundations, and the entire building was filled with smoke. Islam Sufi mystic and philosopher Ibn Arabi, ca. 1238.

In Islamic theology, the Throne ( Al-ʿArsh) is one of the greatest things ever created by God. Some Muslims including Salafis believe God created the throne both as a sign of his power and place of dwelling, some Muslims including most of the Sufis believe it as a sign of his power and not as place of dwelling, and some Including Ashari and Maturidi believe it as a metaphor of the greatness of God. The Quran mentions the throne some 25 times (33 times as Al-'Arsh), such as in verse 10:3 and 23:116: The Quran depicts the angels as carrying the throne of God and praising his glory, similar to Old Testament images. The Ayat al-Kursi (often glossed as \\"Verse of the footstool\\"), is a verse from Al- Baqara, the second sura of the Quran, and is regarded as the book's greatest verse. It references the Throne, and also God's greatest name, Al-Hayy Al- Qayyoom (\\"The Living, the Eternal\\"). Scholars of hadith have stated that Muhammad said the reward for reciting this verse after every prayer is Paradise, and that reciting it is a protection from the devil. Prophetic hadith also establish that The Throne is above the roof of Al-Firdaus Al-'Ala, the highest level of Paradise where God's closest and most beloved servants in the hereafter shall dwell.

Clerical career Archie Wickham was educated at Marlborough College and New College, Oxford, where he read Classics. He then prepared for the priesthood at Leeds Clergy School and was ordained. After three curacies he was vicar of Martock, Somerset, from 1888 to 1911 and a prebendary of Wells Cathedral from 1904 to 1911. He was then vicar of East Brent, Somerset, from 1911 until his death in 1935.WICKHAM, Rev. Prebendary Archdale Palmer, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2016 (online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014) Cricket career Wickham played 82 matches for Somerset County Cricket Club between 1891 and 1907. He also played for a number of representative teams and for Oxford University, and played second-class cricket for Norfolk County Cricket Club from 1881 to 1890. A wicket-keeper and right-handed batsman, he scored 760 career first-class runs, and claimed 90 catches and 60 stumpings. He had a distinctive wicket-keeping stance, bending low with his feet more than a metre apart. Playing for Somerset against Hampshire in the County Championship in 1899, he kept throughout Hampshire's innings of 672 for 7 without conceding a bye. This remained a record in the Championship until 2002. In 1901, playing for Somerset against Oxford University, he kept wicket for both sides: when the Oxford wicketkeeper was injured during the match, Wickham volunteered to stand in briefly for him. It is the only known instance in first-class cricket of a player keeping wickets for both sides in the same match. He was not noted for his batting, and usually batted at number 11. However, when he made his highest first-class score of 28, he top-scored in Somerset's second innings as they struggled in vain to avoid an innings defeat against Gloucestershire in 1900. Personal life Wickham was also a renowned amateur entomologist, specializing in the Lepidoptera.Patrick Armstrong, The English Parson- naturalist: A Companionship between Science and Religion, Gracewing Publishing, Leominster, 2000, p. 99. In 1917 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society.Pelham Warner, \\"Rev. A. P. Wickham\\", The Cricketer Annual 1935, p. 87. His collection of butterflies numbered many thousands. After his death his collection of specimens and manuscripts was lodged at the British Museum. He and his first wife, Emily Helena McPherson Baldwin, had a daughter and two sons. She died in 1890. He and his second wife, Harriet Elizabeth Strong, who came from a family of vicars and brewers, had a son and two daughters.

In that capacity, he was responsible for ensuring that U.S. Department of Defense initiatives and programs were integrated into the FAA's National Airspace System modernization effort. Among his many assignments in the Air Force, he served as the Commander of the 2004th Communications Squadron at Sondrestrom Air Base, Greenland in 1985–1986. After retiring from the Air Force in 1987, in 1988 Stafford founded Universal Systems & Technology, Inc. (UNITECH), a training and simulation technology company supplying training for the military, defense, health care, and financial sectors. He was the company's chairman and CEO, and sold it to Lockheed Martin in 2009. In 2008 Stafford founded The Wentworth Group, LLC, a private equity and financial services and consulting firm based in Reston, Virginia, which supports small businesses, and he is its CEO. Stafford currently serves on the boards of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, the National Symphony Orchestra, the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Apollo Theater Foundation, and Trustee Emeritus of the Wesley Theological Seminary. Philanthropy Stafford has made major philanthropic contributions in the form of investing in the underprivileged. The Stafford Foundation In 2002 he founded the faith-based nonprofit organization, The Stafford Foundation (TSF), Inc., based in Reston, VA. Since the foundation began its grantmaking program it has donated more than $4 million to organizations and individuals. The People’s Inaugural Project In March 2008, Stafford conceived the idea of an event to bring disadvantaged people from all walks of life to Washington, D.C., to be part of the 2009 presidential inaugural celebration. The idea manifested into the People's Inaugural Project, which, in January 2009, brought more than 400 disadvantaged people to the inauguration of President Obama. More than 2,000 individuals attended in total, including representatives from more than 40 nonprofit groups that help people in need, such as wounded veterans, homeless individuals, and severely disabled adults become self-sufficient. The 300 disadvantaged guests were lodged in rooms at the JW Marriott and participated in several events over the course of three days, including a 1,000-person Prayer Breakfast, a 1,000-person Martin Luther King Luncheon with a keynote speech by Martin Luther King III, a viewing of the inaugural parade from the JW Marriott 12th floor terrace, and a main inaugural ball. TSF is continuing to partner with these organizations as part of building a community of doing good for those in need. =The People's Project and the Doing Good campaign= Since the People's Inaugural Project, The Stafford Foundation has continued its investment in underserved people through continued outreach. The People's Project encompasses initiatives through grants that support programs with viable nonprofits groups aligned with TSF's mission. Since the fall of 2009, TSF has supported the work of 30 organizations with grants totaling more than $1 million. The People's Project 2010 national initiative focused on \\"Doing Good\\". In January 2010, The Stafford Foundation (TSF) launched a national movement to motivate people to help others in need by Doing Good. The campaign is based on the principle of helping those in need become self-reliant so that they will in turn be inspired to help others. The effort focuses on ways to help people with job-training, health and wellness, and mission-based support. The campaign will result in bringing support and services to people in need to help them become self-sufficient and live in dignity. The impact ranges from supporting women's homeless shelters that also provide job training to helping low-income families have healthy diets. TSF recognizes that many people want to do good, but simply don't know how. The People's Project emphasizes initiatives that serve to combat this impediment to doing good. It is TSF's goal to help others learn how to help themselves, so that one day they may be capable of helping someone else in need.

Nurse on Wheels shares its cast and production team with the Carry On films, but the film is not an official member of the Carry On series. Story Joanna Jones, a nurse, passes her driving test (after one hundred and six lessons) and successfully applies for a job as District Nurse. She settles into a cottage with her mother, and goes about her work with quiet confidence. But she finds that the patients are used to, and prefer, an older nurse, like Nurse Merrick, who has recently retired. Joanna despairs of winning the confidence of her patients, but is then visited by Nurse Merrick who tells her that it was the same when she arrived many years before. Boosted by this, Joanna soon wins the support of the populace. She also meets Henry Edwards, a rich but very short-tempered farmer. Her mother hopes that Joanna will fall in love with Dr Golfrey, who Joanna works with, but in fact it is Edwards who shows more interest in her. When a young couple, Ann and Tim Taylor, park their caravan in one of the fields owned by Edwards, the population rally around a heavily pregnant Mrs Taylor. Edwards tries to evict them, but Joanna has taken charge of the delivery, and won't allow it. All works out in the end. Dr Golfrey offers the vacant receptionist's job to Deborah, daughter of the local vicar (who is smitten with him anyway). Joanna becomes engaged to Edwards, who promises to curb his temper. And Mr Taylor is offered a job as gardener at the vicarage.

The state and the Continental Congress were concerned about the defense of Pamlico Sound, and the key Ocracoke Inlet, through which a large number of inbound merchant ships traveled, bringing war-related supplies from Europe and the West Indies. History On December 21, 1775, the North Carolina Council of Safety passed a resolution authorizing the acquisition of three ships. Committees were established in Cape Fear, Edenton, and Newbern for their acquisition and outfitting. The provincial congress established pay scales in May 1776, and by October of that year, the brigantine Washington entered service at Cape Fear, the Pennsylvania Farmer entered service at Newbern, and the King Tammany began service at Edenton.Paullin, p. 452 Staffing and supply issues, however, meant that these ships actually saw little service in 1776. Some of the crew of the Pennsylvania Farmer, which lay idle due to a lack of ammunition, attempted to desert to the British fleet of Lord Dunmore. By the end of 1777 the expense of maintaining these ships led the state to begin selling them off. Washington was sold in December 1777 and Pennsylvania Farmer was auctioned off in May 1778. The state embarked on a joint venture with Virginia in May 1776, since the trade of both states depended on the security of Pamlico Sound. The entrance to Chesapeake Bay was regularly patrolled by the Royal Navy, so supply ships bringing goods from France, St. Eustatius, and other ports in the West Indies, instead entered the sound through the Ocracoke Inlet, and offloaded their cargos in the ports of both states that were accessible from the sound. Virginia constructed two ships, Caswell and Washington, for the purpose of monitoring Ocracoke, and North Carolina agreed to contribute to their outfitting and operating expenses. In 1778, after Virginia complained that North Carolina was not contributing sufficiently to their upkeep, North Carolina purchased the Caswell and continued her use as a sentry at the Ocracoke Inlet.Paullin, p. 458 The Caswell sank in June 1779, ending North Carolina's operation of ships during the war. Privateering and prize administration The state established admiralty courts to adjudicate maritime matters, including the distribution of captured prizes. It also authorized privateering.Paullin, p. 459 ReferencesFurther reading * This work contains summary information on each of the various state navies. * Category:Military units and formations of the United States in the American Revolutionary War Navy Category:Disbanded navies Navy Category:Military units and formations established in 1775 Category:1775 establishments in North Carolina Category:1779 disestablishments in North Carolina ","title":"North Carolina State Navy"},{"id":"26541146","text":"Drechsel may refer to: Persons with the surname * Bernd Drechsel (born 1953), German athlete (wrestling) * Gottfried Drechsel (1928–2009), East German functionary and politician * Herwig Drechsel (born 1973), Austrian athlete (football) * Jeremias Drechsel or Hieremias Drechsel or Jeremias Drexel (1581–1638), Jesuit writer * Sammy Drechsel (1925–1986), German political comedian * Thomas Drechsel (born 1987), German actor * Viktor Drechsel (born 1960), Italian athlete (pole vault) See also * Drexel (disambiguation) ","title":"Drechsel"},{"id":"26541193","text":"The Bad Lieutenants are a United Kingdom skydiving team started in 2006.

Existing entirely within Medina County, SR 421's endpoints are at opposite ends of the concurrency of U.S. Route 42 (US 42) and US 224, which together form the four-lane bypass of Lodi. SR 421 serves both as a de facto business route for US 42 and US 224 for Lodi, as well as a connector between the two U.S. routes and SR 83, which SR 421 intersects in downtown Lodi. Route description SR 421 begins at a four-ramp parclo interchange in Harrisville Township that also doubles as the western split of the concurrency of US 42 and US 224\\\\. The first mile (1.6 km) of SR 421 is predominantly rural, amid a mixed landscape of farmland and woods. In this stretch, the state highway closely parallels the CSX railway that runs to the north of the route. It also crosses the East Fork of the Black River through this area. At SR 421's intersection with Lodi Road, the pre-1959 routing of US 42 southwest of Lodi, the highway briefly turns north to pass underneath the CSX railway and into Lodi, then immediately shifts to the northeast, as the rural landscape gives way to a primarily residential setting. After bending to the east-northeast, SR 421 crossing a second set of railroad tracks, then passes several more houses prior to its junction with SR 83 in downtown Lodi. From here, SR 421 turns to the northeast, and continues through a residential area where it passes numerous side streets through its intersection with Redfield Street. After passing some businesses, the highway meets Highland Drive at a flashing beacon intersection, then enters into a wooded area lined with a few homes upon departing Lodi and re-entering Harrisville Township. SR 421 soon arrives at its endpoint at an interchange that doubles as the eastern split of the US 42/US 224 concurrency. No portion of SR 421 is included within the National Highway System. History With the completion of the Lodi Bypass in 1959, US 42 and US 224, which were both formerly routed into Lodi, were routed onto the new four-lane expressway. The SR 421 designation came into being that year, being applied to the former US 224 from the new bypass to the west of the village to the former southwestern junction with US 42, the former concurrency of US 42 and US 224 into downtown Lodi, and the former US 42 from the northeastern junction with US 224 in downtown Lodi to the new bypass northeast of the village.

Background  Jiang Shen was perhaps born in 799, during the reign of Emperor Dezong. His family was originally from Yixing (義興, in modern Wuxi, Jiangsu), but had moved to the eastern capital Luoyang at least by the time that his father Jiang Ai () was serving in governmental service.New Book of Tang, vol. 132. Jiang Ai's grandfather Jiang Gui () and father Jiang Jiangming (), as well as Jiang Ai, all served in the Tang imperial government as governmental scholars,New Book of Tang, vol. 75 with Jiang Ai reach prominence as a historian, authoring works on the lives of chancellors, as well as a number of contributors to the reign of the great early Tang emperor Emperor Taizong, and being created the Duke of Yixing. Jiang Shen was the second of Jiang Ai's five known sons, with at least one older brother, Jiang Xi (), who also reached great prominence and was created the Duke of Huaiyang. Jiang Shen had at least three younger brothers who also served in the government, Jiang Jie (), Jiang Xian (), and Jiang Ji (). Jiang Shen himself passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class, and thereafter served on the staffs of various regional governors.Old Book of Tang, vol. 149.  During Emperor Xuānzong's reign  In 848, by which time Emperor Dezong's great-grandson Emperor Xuānzong was emperor, Jiang Shen was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as You Bujue (), a low-level advisory official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng), as well as an editor of imperial history. (It was said that while both Jiang Shen and his nephew Jiang Zhao (蔣兆, Jiang Xi's son) were talented writers, they were not considered exceptional in their style, but were considered good historians.) He later served as Jiabu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of rites (禮部, Libu) and was put in charge of drafting edicts. In 851, when the chancellor Bai Minzhong was put in charge of overseeing the campaign against Danxiang rebellions, Bai was allowed to retain a number of imperial officials to serve on his staff, and he chose Jiang to serve as his deputy in his role as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Binning Circuit (邠寧, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249. Jiang later returned to Chang'an and was made acting deputy minister of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang). In 855, he was made an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi), and was later made the chief imperial scholar (承旨, Chengzhi). In 856, he was made the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang) and the director of taxation. It was said that Emperor Xuānzong respected Jiang's opinion. On one occasion in 858, when he was meeting Jiang privately (as the officials who were one level below chancellors, known as the \\"Second Tier Officials\\" (次對官, Cidui Guan) were allowed to do),Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 60 [858]. Jiang made the comment to Emperor Xuānzong, \\"These days, it is easy to gain official positions, and people take dangerous risks.\\" Emperor Xuānzong, in surprise, responded, \\"If this goes on, disturbances will occur.\\" Jiang responded, \\"Not yet, but if too many people take dangerous risks, it is not difficult for disturbances to occur.\\" As Jiang was about to leave, Emperor Xuānzong kept him three times, stating, \\"Soon I will not be able to meet with you again privately.\\" Jiang did not understand Emperor's implications, but it soon became clear, as Emperor Xuānzong gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. (After he was named chancellor, he would have to meet with Emperor Xuānzong along with other chancellors, and could no longer meet with Emperor Xuānzong alone.) Four months later, he was relieved of his director of taxation responsibilities, and given the additional title of Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎, deputy head of the legislative bureau).  During Emperors Yizong's and Xizong's reigns  Emperor Xuānzong died in 859 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Yizong. Jiang Shen remained chancellor, and was also made the minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu) and put charge of overseeing the editing of the imperial history. In 862, he was removed from his chancellor position and made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), continuing to carry the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. He was later transferred to Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan); the order transferring him also referred to him as the Duke of Le'an, indicating that he had been created that title sometime prior. Soon thereafter, though, he was made an advisor to the Crown Prince, with his office at Luoyang.As there was no crown prince at the time, the title was entirely honorary. In 866, he was made the prefect of Hua Prefecture (華州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). He was later again made an advisor to the crown prince, when he retired on account of age. He probably died in 881, during the reign of Emperor Yizong's son Emperor Xizong.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 149. * New Book of Tang, vol. 132. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 249, 250.

The band released two albums and with the exception of Krieger and Densmore, they consisted of different band personnel on each. History Butts Band came about as a consequence of the Doors trying to find a replacement for lead singer Jim Morrison who died in July 1971. The three remaining Doors had released two albums (Other Voices in 1971 and Full Circle in 1972) with Ray Manzarek and Krieger sharing vocals. Unable to recruit a singer in the US, the three Doors were in London in 1973 looking for an experienced lead singer and auditioned several British singers including Howard Werth (the singer with Audience), Kevin Coyne (from Siren) and Jess Roden (who was the leader of Bronco). Howard Werth rehearsed with the band for a week with a view to stepping into Morrison's shoes. Elektra records founder Jac Holzman favoured Werth as he had at one stage foreseen Audience taking over the Doors' spot on Elektra – but Audience had fallen apart and he now saw Howard and the Doors merging as the 'new Doors'. However, the three remaining Doors felt that adding a new singer wasn't working out and decided to call time on The Doors. With Manzarek returning to Los Angeles, Krieger and Densmore began looking for a new project, linking up with Roden, Phil Chen and Roy Davies to form the Butts Band (allegedly named after a cave where Roden’s previous band used to practice). The band signed with Blue Thumb and began working on their first album with long-time Doors' sound engineer/co-producer Bruce Botnick taking the producer role. Recording was split between studios in London (three weeks at Olympic Studios and in Kingston, Jamaica (for another three weeks) on their way home to California. Their debut, the self-titled album Butts Band was released in 1973. Krieger was quoted as saying, \\"It's not 'head music', it's 'heart music'. It's 'up music'. It's music you can dance to.\\" Following the album's release the band appeared on The Midnight Special and the Old Grey Whistle Test. Following the pressure of having two members living in California and three in London, this incarnation of the band split up. The former British musicians were replaced by musicians from the LA-area: Michael Stull (guitar/piano), Alex Richman (keyboards), Karl Rucker (bass), Bobbi Hall (congas) and an additional drummer, Mike Berkowitz. This line-up released Hear and Now in 1975. The Butts Band then split completely after the second album, Krieger and Densmore going off to do solo projects. In 1978, the three remaining Doors reunited for the first time working on An American Prayer.

The monument was built to commemorate the Volunteer Fire Department in Church Square Park on May 30, 1891. History The Firemen's Monument in 1905 Starting in the 19th Century, statues of firemen who died in the line of duty were placed in municipal burial plots, which eventually led to placement of monuments in more accessible public places and often to commemorate various departments or events. The monument in Hoboken was built to commemorate the end of the Volunteer firefighters in the city, as earlier that year, firefighting became a paid profession. The first statues were made using marble, but many, including the Firemen's monument in Hoboken, were sculpted using zinc and cast in bronze by Caspar Buberl and sold by J.W. Fiske. Monument Inscription with memorial flowers Standing in the west end of Church Square Park at Garden Street and 5th Street, the Firemen's Monument sits atop a 20-foot granite pedestal that features emblems of a ladder, pike poles and a fire hose on its face. The statue itself is approximately 8 feet tall and features a mustached firemen in uniform, holding a small child in nightdress in his left arm and a lantern in his right hand. Similar statues have been noted as being modeled after statues of the Virgin Mary cradling the baby Jesus. The monument reads: Legacy With Hobokens' rich history and multiple National Register of Historic Places sites, a tour is run yearly and begins with the statue. Because of Hobokens vicinity and viewpoint to New Jerseyians during the September 11th attacks which resulted in the lives of many firefighters being lost, appreciation of these zinc statues has been renewed.

It has been restored into a country house hotel by David and Catherine Gardner. It is 45 minutes from Florence. The history of Villa Bordoni Villa Bordoni is a ‘Patrician Villa’ – the former country residence of the Bordonis, a family of wealthy merchants from the city of Florence. To understand the history of the Villa, one has to understand the history of the Greve Valley and beyond to the cluster of city-states that are known today as Italy. Florence and Siena were separate countries in the Middle Ages - great rivals, frequently at war with one another. The valley of the river Greve, which gives its name to the nearest town, was of great strategic importance, and all too frequently the battleground of the Florentine and Sienese armies; hence the concentration of castles and fortified villages present in the area. The origins of Villa Bordoni date back to the 11th century, when all that stood there were a stone tower or a keep, with thick walls and arrow slits, attached to a solid dungeon for prisoners of war. Over the centuries a network of fragile alliances brought relative peace to the region, and permitted the structure to evolve into a farmhouse, albeit a fortified one. During the 17th century, this ‘casa colonica’ was purchased by a wealthy family from Florence, as a form of summer country residence and hunting lodge, and was slowly transformed into a Villa, with its stuccoed façade and Italian garden. During the 18th century, Giuseppe Bordoni made this Villa his permanent home and invested heavily in the vineyards, producing a renowned Chianti Classico since 1782, taking the name of ‘Mezzuola’ - the hamlet which surrounded his residence. At that time, the entire hamlet and several dozen hectares of excellent farmland belonged to the Bordonis. During the industrial revolution, and the ensuing process of urbanisation, the region of Chianti became uninhabited, blighted with poverty, and the sons of many farmers fled the countryside to search for a better life in the cities of Italy and abroad. After the Second World War, the heir to the dwindling family fortune tried her best to defend the family property, but over the years found herself having to sell off parcels of land and entire farmhouses in order to preserve the Villa and the core of the farm. Being married to an artist of dubious talents did not help, as he helped the fortune to dwindle by paying for exhibitions of his work all over Europe. During the 1980s and 90s the then widowed, heirless, ageing Mrs. Bordoni became gradually more eccentric. A tiny lady, less than 5 feet tall, she dressed in thick tweeds and hunting capes even in midsummer; one could say a Dickensian character. That was not to say that she is not lucid even in her dotage, often managing to ’put one over’ on the local farming folk in her wine and olive oil trading. However, latterly, her eccentricity became too much, as she started to live almost as a tramp in just one room of the villa, with no running water, surrounded by bundles of old newspapers that she refused to throw away, and also by a large collection of stuffed animals (including an alligator) - hunting trophies of her great- grandfather... With only her many cats and at least 20 tortoises for company, but with little human contact, in 1997, with great difficulty and reluctance, she made the painful decision to leave the spartan conditions of Mezzuola behind her, and retire to an old folk's home in her native Florence...

The Duke, who later became the King of Württemberg, was the head of the state church as the summus episcopus, meaning the ruler united secular and religious power in his person. The former Catholic bishops lost all privileges. Johannes Brenz was enpowered to reform the state church following the teachings of Martin Luther. He is entombed in the Stuttgart Stiftskirche. The Evangelical State Church in Württemberg was from the beginning a Lutheran church. However, the form of the church service followed the Reformed tradition, meaning that it is rather plain. The form of the Lutheran church service is hardly ever practiced. It is however practiced in Hohenzollern.Antonia Lezerkoss: Kirche: Liturgie nach alter Preußenweise. Südwest Presse Online, 3.

Ungnad von Weißenwolff printed 30000 bibles and smuggled over the borders guarded by local hunters.Bibelschmuggler Up to 1806 the Duchy of Württemberg was a purely evangelical territory. Only after Württemberg became a kingdom and, due to Napoleon, larger Catholic territories (Upper Swabia) were added, the uniform religious structure ended. Evangelical parishes have also been established in the former Catholic territories of (southern) Württemberg since the late 19th century. After the end of World War I, King William II of Württemberg was forced to resign. The church therefore formally had no ruler because his children had also been disqualified for royal succession due to improper marriage. Since the 1890s the head of a Catholic ducal branch line of the royal house has been named as his legitimate successor, but the Lutheran state church could obviously not accept him as summus episcopus. As a result, leading clergymen took over the church. After King William II had died in October 1921, the Evangelical State Church in Württemberg enacted a new constitution in 1923/24 and installed a church president as the leader of the church; in 1933 the leader was given the title Landesbischof.1939 During World War II, YMCA was involved in supporting millions of POWs .“One of the most important tasks of the Y.M.C.A. delegates was, if time permitted, to sit down and talk to the internees about their personal problems and, thereafter, try to establish the contacts with families and friends in the outside world and to secure the items wished for.” „Wartime Logs“,Barbara Stelzl-Marx: Zwischen Fiktion und Zeitzeugenschaft, S. 111–114.

It was constructed in the years 16 to 15 B.C.E. One of the most famous and visited landmarks in Spain, the Roman Theatre of Mérida is regarded as a Spanish cultural icon and was chosen as one of the 12 Treasures of Spain. The theater has undergone several renovations, notably at the end of the 1st century or early 2nd century CE (possibly during the reign of Emperor Trajan), when the current facade of the scaenae frons was erected, and another in the time of Constantine I (between 330 and 340), which introduced new decorative-architectural elements and a walkway around the monument. Following the theatre's abandonment in Late Antiquity, it was slowly covered with earth, with only the upper tiers of seats (summa cavea) remaining visible. In local folklore the site was referred to as \\"The Seven Chairs\\", where, according to tradition, several Moorish kings sat to decide the fate of the city. It was built as part of an entertainment complex together with the Amphitheatre of Mérida. Nowadays both are part of the Archaeological Ensemble of Mérida, which is one of the largest and most extensive archaeological sites in Spain. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993. Enclave J. Laurent The theatre is located in the archaeological ensemble of Mérida, one of the largest and most extensive archaeological sites in Spain. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993. The theatre was located on the edge of the Roman city adjacent the city walls. Some of the seating was built into a hill called the Cerro de San Albin. Structure Constructed in faithful accordance to the rules of the treatises of Vitruvius, the building corresponds to the typical Roman model. The structure exhibits similarities with the theatres of Dougga (Tunisia), Orange (France), Pompeii (Italy) and Rome. Stands and orchestra The semicircular shape of the grandstands cavea is incorporated into the gradient of San Albin hill. In its time it had a seating capacity of 6,000. The diameter is about 86 meters (282 feet). The stands are divided into three areas: the innermost ima cavea, (22 rows) media cavea (5 rows) and summa cavea, the latter being severely deteriorated today. The first rows ima cavea, where the wealthier social classes were seated, is divided into five radial sectors cunei, delimited stairs, a horizontal level, and a corridor praecinctio that separates it from the upper bleachers. Six doors at the top give access to a corridor covered by a semicircular dome ring that serve as entry and exit doors at the two extremities. The middle and upper caveas have five rows of seats each and are supported by a complex system of arches and barrel vaults. In total, thirteen outside doors facilitate access and entrance to the theatre. The orchestra is a semicircular space paved with white and blue marble intended for the chorus. It is surrounded by three tiers of honour for authorities and separated from the stands by a marble parapet, of which fragments remain. In the front there is a low wall with alternating straight and curved sections and separated from the stage. Stage Stage The leading edge of the stage proscenium was stone and the rectangular platform pulpitum was originally covered in wood. It has holes in the floor that in antiquity served to place scenic backdrop posts and other infrastructure. The downstage setting porticus post scaenam (frons frons) is the most spectacular feature of the theatre. It is 7.5m wide, 63m long and 17.5m in total height. It consists of a base of red marble paved stones, upon which stand Corinthian columns with blue-veined marble as the shafts with white bases and capitals. These columns support an entablature with architrave and richly decorated friezes and cornices. A large marble wall encloses the back of the stage scaenae frons. The décor of this part is completed by provisional sculptures between columns- the originals are kept in the nearby National Museum of Roman Art. They are the goddess Ceres, Pluto, Proserpina and other characters with togas and armour that have been interpreted as imperial portraits. Three doors allow the entry of actors onto the stage, one central valva regia and two lateral valva hospitalium. On the sides and back are several units that were used by the performing actors and technicians. It is unknown how the original stage front was, as the present one seems to have been built under Emperor Trajan. Peristyle Behind the stage is a garden area surrounded by columns and a quadrangular portico. The peristyle was used as a recreation area. At the bottom of this garden, on axis with the main door of the stage, there is a small room dedicated to the imperial cult, as reflected in the finding of a sculptural portrait of the emperor Caesar Augustus dressed as Pontiff Maximus. In the northern corner of the peristyle, high above the garden, there are latrines and to the west the remains of a house built after the abandonment of the theatre. This residence features a courtyard surrounded by columns and pilasters and several rooms, some topped with an apse and most with murals depicting life-size human figures. Excavation and restoration  One of the statues on the theatre stage. Until the late 19th century, the only visible remains of the theater were the so-called \\"Seven Chairs\\", remains of the tops of the bleachers and a formed concrete base covered with granite blocks that made up the façade of the building. The excavations of the theater began in 1910, directed by archaeologist José Ramón Mélida. Having limited resources and methodology was not conducive to the reconstruction progress, which delayed excavation until the late twentieth century, when most of the building was excavated, documenting numerous columns, cornices, statues and other building materials, especially the front stage. The excavated theater was first used to stage a production in 1933. In the 1960s and 1970s the front stage was rebuilt under the direction of the architect and archaeologist . Current use Besides being the most visited monument in the city, it has been home to the development of the Festival de Mérida (Festival of Classical Theatre of Mérida) since 1933. The Mérida Classical Theatre Festival is the oldest of its kind celebrated in Spain.

He lives and works in Paris.  Biography  In 1983, Engbrox obtained a baccalauréat specialising in graphic arts. He then decided to start earning as a traditional graphic artist, assistant photographer on set and a light technician. These experiences allowed him to work with Wolfgang Flur from the group Kraftwerk, on photo shoot locations. In 1984, he began to paint. In 1986, he left Düsseldorf to live in Paris. From 1988 to 1991, he was a student at the École nationale supérieure de la photographie, in Arles (Bouches-du- Rhône). There he was a student of Arnaud Claass, Christian Milovanoff and Christian Gattinoni. He also had the opportunity to be Larry Fink’s photographic assistant. From 1999 to 2005 he created and managed with two friends in Paris an independent music label. He also contributed to the writing and the composition of titles with Sporto Kantes.  Work  The first three works featured in his catalogue are from 1994: Helen, Hotel Aya and Air Disaster 1. These canvases are oil paintings based on images found in small format and poorly printed general press. The artist’s work mainly introduces characters in elaborate and improbable settings. Since 2015 Sylvester Engbrox also creates photographs. Tina, Flight Data Recorder (2009)  Quotes  *‘I paint based on images found in holiday catalogues, television programmes… I have collected large quantities of images to class them according to an invented typology. This part of the work today is through the Internet and my own photographic archives. This completely useless catalogue of a depicted world clarifies nothing: the more images we see, the less we understand. But this ordering, this perpetual comparison of one portrayal with another ends by creating bridges between some of them. Sometimes these confrontations lead to a new image. It is this image, which appeared without me knowing, that I paint. My painting comes from this obsessive filing.’ Sylvester Engbrox, February 2008. *‘When a hard disk fails, a recovery programme is launched to try to save the data. My canvases try to repair a time-space that has been disrupted following a crash, to redefine it, by overlapping what remains: bits of gathered images.’ Sylvester Engbrox, February 2008. *‘His painting is totally representative of our period. Clearly figurative, linked completely to the long pictorial history, without any complex regarding official views, it opens up our imaginative fields. It proves to us, better than long speeches, the amazing vitality of painting which crosses technical evolutions (photo, video, Internet…) by digesting them greedily.’ Gérard Gamand, Azart magazine, September 2008. *‘From the heart of the proliferating mass of Web images, Sylvester Engbrox picks out those which will allow him, those to which he is sensitive, not to accomplish who knows what desire by deluding it (which is what the academic XIXth century nude painters did), but to methodically disappoint it by exposing his machinery.’ Jean-Luc Chalumeau, Sylvester Engbrox, exhibition catalogue, 2008. *‘In this way, the artist recognises it. He is only an intermediary, a tool, a machine. It is why he explains nothing in his painting, he suggests nothing, neither eroticism, nor guilt, or suffering. He is only showing.

Toward A Nomadic Criticism In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Denson reached beyond conventional art criticism to establish a reputation as a nomadic ideologist. As such, he developed an approach toward the criticism of art that matches the concerns of his subjects. He does this by entering into the ideological models presented to the viewer by an artist rather than carrying with him some pre- established criteria that is projected onto all art. Among the philosophical issues Denson addresses are those of pragmatism, historicism, cultural relativism, and mythopoetics, all of which are ideologically suited to dismantling the need for a master narrative or identity. In so doing, he effectively dismantles cultural, national, racial, sexual, and gender biases in the critique of art and culture.Capacity: history, the world, and ... – Thomas McEvilley, G. Roger Denson – Google Books. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 21 October 2011. About Denson's commentary in Capacity, the art critic Michelle C. Cone wrote in the College Art Association's Art Journal that \\"the unusual antiphonal structure of the book proves to be an interesting as well as novel way to reframe and 'add value' to previously published material. G. Roger Denson, a curator and critic who is McEvilley's commentator throughout the book, perceptively analyzes the relativist attitude. Denson's observations provide a particular edge to McEvilley's critique of Clement Greenberg's determinist interpretation of painting's evolution toward flatness. Exposing Greenberg's myopia toward ancient and non-Western cultures, he points out that 'In extending Greenberg's historicism and avant-garde logically in space and time, McEvilley takes us to societies that were the originators--the true avant-garde--of flat painting.\\"Art Journal'', Spring 1998, Vol. 57, No. 1, College Art Association.

Among Denson's most influential essays count \\"Going Back to Start, Perpetually: Playing the Nomadic Game in the Critical Reception of Art,\\" which first appeared in Parkett issue #40/41, 1994, (in English and German) and was republished (in Spanish) in El reverso de la diferencia, Caracas, 2000. It is here that Denson states, \\"To a great degree the nomad is to late twentieth-century intellectuals what the noble savage was to Enlightenment writers like John Dryden, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and François-René de Chateaubriand. I write this not to debunk the nomadic model in postmodern culture, but to stress how some intellectuals (I think especially of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari) have romanticized a pragmatic, decentered, migrant existence as a dissident response to global institutions and technologies that are becoming increasingly centralized and fortified at their boundaries.\\" This is despite, as Denson argues, there being \\"a host of global conditions in the world that are adversarial to the spread of nomadic methods of conceptualization, judgment, and discourse, whether in reference to the shifting significations that come with cross-cultural or multicultural convergence, or the multiplicity of conceptual models that breed with today's radical skepticism, deconstructive suspension and deferral of belief, and provisional and pragmatic views of discourse and political action. The nomadic tendency, then, is the intellectual's game, though it is also at work in the mainstreams of postindustrial nations ... the willed and pragmatic response to diversity and displacement that leads to prosperous and protean results.\\" In the end, Denson concludes, \\"No doubt a kind of conceptual and cultural nomadism has been mediated for centralized and static populations through journalism, network and cable television, cinema, the internet, and virtual reality. From here one can distinguish what we mean anthropologically by \\"nomadic\\"—from our metaphorical usage of it critically and theoretically to describe the shiftings and migrations occurring in a global civilization. ...Paradoxically, this logic proceeds to make the couch potato or armchair traveller a potentially formidable player of nomadism.\\"Parkett issue #40/41, 1994, pgs. 154–155. Expanding on this notion a year later in Migrations of the Real and the Ideal: Exploring a Nomadic Criticism, (published in the premiere issue of Trans>Arts, Culture, Media), Denson writes: \\"Because there are so many models of reality and identity existing simultaneously, because there are so many societies and cultures converging in a global community, because discourse is being negotiated among them, and because we are recognizing multiple histories of the world, we require a critical attitude that rides with the shifts in civilization's discourse. The best of today's critics are ready to visit the models of any given community—ideological, spiritual, political, economic, technological, scientific, aesthetic—at any given time without obstructing communication and insinuating personal models on them. This does not mean that we must have expertise in those models or even accept them personally, but we must be ready to defer and then adapt all personal criteria responsively in acknowledgement of the world's diversity. ...When two or more ideas conflict, the temptation often is to reconcile them. Nomadic criticism doesn’t require this. We needn’t reconcile an idea to any other, including the model of nomadism. We can just move among them, using them when we need to, putting them on hold when we don’t. The nomadic ideal also doesn’t position two or more models in opposition. We think only of two or more ideas as being opposed if we think we hold a more comprehensive, singular, or foundational truth; nomadism holds that there are only shifting and contingent models that are as temporally relative as the condition among individuals, communities, and environments that produce them.\\"Trans>arts.culture.media, Issue No. 1, 1995, pg. 15. In 1996, Denson gives example of the kind of nomadic criticism he has been referring to. In Capacity: History, the World, and the Self in Contemporary Art and Criticism, Denson writes of the art critic Thomas McEvilley. \\"Through his reference to various models around the world, readers get an idea of how much more liberating it is to capaciously represent and experience the world's heterogeneity. ...Globalism and diversity, as McEvilley represents them, have come to replace the esteem of universality. Globalism, in contrast to universalism, compels cooperation and exchange from multiple sources (cultures and geographies) without posing any one as primary; it is the composition or network potentially encompassing all diversity without imposing a unity or other singular principle on it.\\"Capacity: History, the World, and the Self in Contemporary Art and Criticism, Routledge, 1996, pgs. 91–92. Most recently, Denson drew considerable attention to the application of nomadic criteria in art history when, in Huffington Post, he published \\"Colonizing Abstraction: MoMA’s Inventing Abstraction Show Denies Its Ancient Global Origins\\". In reviewing the survey of significant early 20th-century abstraction at The Museum of Modern Art in New York from December 23, 2012 to April 15, 2013, most of it by European and American painters, Denson claimed that by calling the show \\"Inventing Abstraction, 1910-1925\\", the curators at MoMA appear \\"unwilling to admit that visual abstraction existed outside of Europe, let alone that it can be found on all six habitable continents for at least tens of thousands of years.\\" Denson went on to propose, \\"Abstraction is the basic principle underpinning the production of all art—however literal and pictorial, formalist and conceptual. Its “invention” is now thought to have occurred at least over fifty-thousand years ago, as it can be said to have originated spontaneously as much in Africa as in Asia as in Australia as in America as in Europe.\\"G.

The Authoring of Authority Underpinning Denson's nomadic approach to art and criticism and tangential to his relativism is his view on the authority implicit in all authorship. “Authoring Authority in the Rhetoric of Art Criticism\\" is an essay Denson contributed to a collection of essays by contemporary art critics centered around the issue of Cultural Permissions.ACME Journal, Volume 1, No. 3, 1994, pgs. 26–41. Printedmatter.org In this essay Denson elaborates on the authority granted authors in contemporary society despite the appearance (really a very modern assumption) that authorship itself has such authority implicit within it when in reality it does not. Denson finds the evidence for the evolution of our widespread misperception of an author's authority in the etymology of our language. “Thought, in its very formation, reinforces its own power of persuasion in the languages it generates and, in turn, is generated by. The Latin etymologies of author, (auctor: originator, promoter) and authority (autorititat: opinion, decision)\\" indicate that, although the Bronze and Iron Age monarchal and priestly authors of official, self-aggrandizing narratives decreed writing to possess an historically absolute authority, this was not the belief system conveyed by the architects of written language. Eytymology, Denson holds, provides evidence that writing was conceived as, if not arbitrary narratives, then certainly as no more than narratives relative to an author's life conditions. It was only after the invention of movable type and the mass circulation of texts saturated cultural consciousness that the now printed and ubiquitously distributed opinion of an author became illusionistically equated with its authority. \\"He whose opinion becomes popularly received must hold autonomy of will\\" became a popular faith coursing through secular and religious affairs. \\"Thus evolves the will to power that Nietzsche saw driving all human behavior,\\" Denson writes. \\"When entering public discourse, the will to power, the self (the auto, the author) reifies itself over time and with material and linguistic (some might say metaphysical) persuasions, establishes itself as a worldly authority, an authority of opinion that is shared or widely consented to. For the rhetoric of a skilled author can summon a single, common mind from among the masses, especially those prone to give up their own points of view for a slogan or method.” Denson goes on to demonstrate that the autonomy of the will is not itself sanctioned by a public threatened by overt displays of power. Hence in democratic states the deferential nature of authorship is the author's buffer with the public, even as it sedates the reader's skepticism in the author. The effect is the authority conferred on authors by the public is largely conferred on those who successfully appeal to prior authorities, institutions, and ideas already enjoying some measure of support at least by the informed, reading public. Constructed in opposition to the ancient and long-running bias of logocentrism, the privileging of the spoken word over writing presumed to be the foundation for authentic ideas, reason, and even reality, Denson's authority of authorship is a model of the shifting but interlinking appeals made by an author to receive the reader's consent. Such appeals by an author imply the authority of a text is often conferred more in deferring to prior models, institutions, and authorities, than to any force of reason or individual vision textually conveyed. The obvious debts to and departures from the critiques of logocentrism by Ludwig Klages and the Deconstruction of Jacques Derrida are immediately evident. But Denson also at once aligns with and disputes Roland Barthes' 1967 essay, The Death of the Author, which attributes the aura, politics, ethnicity, faith, and nationality of the author as having undue influence in the reception of a text. Similarly, Denson both concurs with and removes himself from Edward Said’s 1983 critique, The World, the Text, and the Critic, when he sites the \\"anterior restraints\\" of past writers as that which both anchors an author's authority in history and prompts the author's celebrity at least in contemporary society. But such anterior restraints, Denson points out, are also what prevent authors from seeing and reporting on the deeper and unmediated significance of events in the larger context of human affairs, especially if such affairs are introduced in new ways and fashions. It is in Denson's own borrowing from and simultaneous arguing with perceived authorities that he came to see that deference to prior citations and expertise is not only unavoidable, it is something imposed on the writer by the very conditions of textuality and discourse. Entirely social, writing must be derived from reading, and in public expressions, especially those of criticism and theory, a writer's contribution has as much to do with channeling authors come and gone as it does in making unique contributions. In this arena, the measure of consensus with which an author is greeted is in large part contingent on the degree to which the writer appeals to recognized authorities and ideas—those fashionable or relevant to the public—more than the merit of the idea itself. This isn't to say that Denson doesn't see creativity, and even glimmers of originality, everywhere in the history of authorship. Yet, however revolutionary a text is touted to be, Denson believes it must be anchored, however discreetly (and often covertly), to prior authorities, institutions, customs, even whims and fashions, otherwise its individualist insights will likely go unappreciated. Without appealing to political, religious, societal, economic, ethnic, or engendered identities—the appeals Klages, Derrida, Barthes, and Said critique—an author will be lost to posterity. In the new global arena of texts, the authors capable of making the greatest mark on civilization, Denson holds, are those conversant with the greatest array of authorities and vaunted ideas of the past, while being able to make the authority of the past appear new and relevant to the largest targeted public. It is up to the reading public to learn to be aware of, and whenever possible to discern, which anterior traditions, institutions, ideologies and esteemed figures an author defers to buttress her own authority before accepting that author as authoritative. Early work Before becoming a cultural critic, Denson helped to launch the careers of a number of young artists as well as to exhibit the work of several who were already internationally acclaimed.

He sensed an opportunity and sent her publisher, Harold Warne, some examples of his work and offered his services. Harold was keen to publish more tales by the reluctant Beatrix and forwarded the books, and Ernest's letter, to her.

Letter 10 November 1917 Beatrix Potter's Letters, Judy Taylor, page 239. . Beatrix defended Ernest but advised Warne to remonstrate with the publishers.Letter 13 November 1917 Beatrix Potters Letters, Judy Taylor Page 240 Warne's did exactly that, and Ernest apologised direct to Beatrix, thus acknowledging his awareness of her literary identity. Letter to Potter 21 November 1917, V&A; Cat 1470.BP 609. Beatrix told her publishers that Aris was both \\"artlessly conceited\\" and a \\"little bounder\\" which put paid to plans for a partnership. He changed publishers and adopted pseudonyms; his work as Robin A Hood is well known, but few are aware that he issued six books as Dan Crow.  Designer of The Cococubs  In 1934, he designed a range of animal characters manufactured by the toy firm of Britain's and distributed free with a new line of Cadbury's Cocoa advertised as ‘The Children’s Cocoa’. The Cadbury Cococubs, Dudley Chignall, Lulu Publishing. Each of the animals had their own personalities, and the press release advised that they \\"were exclusively designed by an expert in child psychology\\". It was a huge success, with some 300,000 children collecting these toy figures, known collectively as the Cococubs, which were hailed as \\"one of the cleverest publicity schemes of the year\\" in advertising. Grocery and Provision Merchant journal, November 1934, page 276. Personal  Aris was hard of hearing, and by the age of 60, he was profoundly deaf. He returned to employment with the International Correspondence School distance- learning. He enjoyed the opera. His other interests included: fishing, travel, entomology, and swimming. He was an inveterate collector, hoarding matchbox labels and stamps as well as cigarette cards; he also enjoyed gardening, and collecting old furniture. He was obviously good company, as Beatrix Potter described him as both \\"amusing\\" and a \\"scamp\\", Letter dated 12 January 1921. Beatrix Potter's Letters, Judy Taylor, page 267. . whilst his pal Charles Bayne (the Editor of Little Folks from 1908 to 1915) said that he had an, \\"endless store of humorous ideas\\".Famous Animal Tales, George C Harrap, page 5.

The castle is currently used by a private riding club and is not open to the public. There are plans to convert the castle into a cultural centre and to use it for exhibitions and concerts afterwards. The roofs of the Romanesque palace and of several other buildings were renovated in 2010.  History  Hildesheim was founded as the seat of the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 815. The settlement around the cathedral of Hildesheim was ruled by the clergy for four centuries and it quickly developed into a town which was awarded market rights by King Otto III in 983.Neigenfind, W.: Unsere schöne Stadt, p.46. Hildesheim 1964. The town grew further and obtained city rights in 1249, developing into a very wealthy merchant city.Neigenfind, W.: Unsere schöne Stadt, p. 38. Hildesheim 1964. At the end of the 13th century, Hildesheim had about 5,000 inhabitants and was one of the biggest and richest cities in the North of Germany. The citizens gained more and more self-confidence and did not want to be governed by the bishop any longer. As the bishop did not want to reside in the rebellious and dangerous city any more, he ordered Steuerwald Castle in the North of the city to be built as a new residence. When the castle was completed in 1313, he left Hildesheim. The bishops of Hildesheim resided in Steuerwald Castle until 1763. Then a bishop's palace was built in the centre of the city opposite the cathedral. Castle keep and Tenant's House According to the orders given by Henry III, Steuerwald Castle was built in 1310–1313 near the river Innerste in the North of Hildesheim, about 3 kilometres from the citySegers-Glocke, Gabriele: Baudenkmale in Niedersachsen, Band 14.1 – Hildesheim, p. 276. Hameln 2007. The Castle was surrounded by a rampart with a moat. Bishop Otto II (1319–31), successor of Henry III, ordered the castle to be enlarged. The tall castle keep was built in 1325. In the Thirty Years' War, Steuerwald Castle was enlarged again in 1622 under bishop Ferdinand of Bavaria. Then it was besieged several times and conquered on 4 June 1632, but only slightly damaged. After the Thirty Years' War had come to an end in 1648, the bishops of Hildesheim continued residing in Steuerwald Castle. Bishop Clemens August of Bavaria ordered a part of the castle to be remodelled in 1728 once more. During the secularization, the Catholic Church lost the castle in 1803. It was transformed into a government-owned domain, and some buildings which had deep cellars were used as a brewery. Several barns and stables were built, and a part of the moat was levelled, as the space was needed for the construction of a tenant's house in 1819. The City of Hildesheim bought the castle on 1 September 1912 as most of its grounds were needed to construct an inland harbour and a canal. The small village of Steuerwald developed around the castle on the river Innerste. At the beginning of the 20th century it had 231 inhabitants, of whom most were working in the domain.Neumanns Ort- und Verkehrslexikon des Deutschen Reiches, p. 1043. Leipzig 1905. In 1912, the village of Steuerwald became a part of the city of Hildesheim.Neigenfind, W.: Unsere schöne Stadt, p. 48. Hildesheim 1964. Most of the buildings of the village had to be torn down when the inland harbour of Hildesheim was built. The harbour was inaugurated in 1926. During World War II, the roofs of the romanesque palace and of some of the barns received some damage, when a bomb exploded near Steuerwald during an air raid on Hanover on 9 October 1943.Aden,Menno: Hildesheim lebt, p. 238. Hildesheim 1994 After the war, Steuerwald Castle was used for residential purposes, as the city of Hildesheim had suffered severe bomb damage. In the 1970s, a race course was laid out behind the castle which has been used by a riding club since 1973.  Architecture  Steuerwald Castle has been remodelled and enlarged several times over the centuries, but the castle keep, the north and west aisles, a large barn and especially the romanesque palace, all dating from the Late Middle Ages, are well-preserved. *In the west, a part of the moat and the old wall with firing slits is preserved. In the second half of the 18th century, a large half-timbered store house was built outside the castle; this is to be renovated. *The castle keep reaching a height of 26 metres has a quadrate basis measuring 9.35 × 9.35 metres, firing slits and a tent roof. Due to its walls reaching a thickness of 2 metres it was used as a prison in former times. Originally there was a door in the basis of the keep which served as the main entrance to the castle. Today, the keep is surrounded by a stable which was built in 1819. *The inner court measures 175 × 175 metres.Zimmermann, Margret: Burgen und Schlösser im Hildesheimer Land, p. 69. Hildesheim 2001 The Romanesque palas, reaching a height of 23.15 metres, was built of sandstone at the beginning of the 14th century. Only the north and the west aisles are preserved. The palace has four floors and several gothic lancet windows. On the third floor there is a great hall.Segers-Glocke, Gabriele: Baudenkmale in Niedersachsen, Band 14.1 – Hildesheim, p. 278. Hameln 2007. The roof was renovated in 2010. *In the inner court there is a large barn, built of sandstone dating to the 14th century. *The Tenant's House is one of the buildings which were added later. It was built in 1819 with a flight of outdoor stairs. *St. Magdalena's Chapel was built in a Romanesque style in 1310. In 1507 it was remodelled in a gothic style and an apse with lancet windows was added. Above the entrance with a typical pointed arch there is a noteworthy sandstone relief showing the coat of arms of bishop John IV who ordered the chapel to be remodelled. The chapel, which was renovated in 1990, has 55 seats and is used for concerts and weddings.

Biography Hans Meinhard von Schönberg was born in Bacharach on August 28, 1582. His father, Count Meinhard von Schönberg auf Wesel (26 April 1530 – 22 April 1596), was a Feldmarschall of Johann Casimir of the Palatinate-Simmern and Amtmann of Bacharach. His mother was Dorothea Riedesel von Bellersheim (died 1610). Our first sign of Hans Meinhard von Schönberg in public life comes in 1609, when Frederick IV, Elector Palatine sent him as Ambassador to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, at a time when the Protestant German nobles were growing more and more alienated from the court of the Holy Roman Emperor. Schönberg seems to have done a good job, because soon after his embassy to present the German nobles' concerns to Rudolf, Frederick despatched Schönberg to the Dutch Republic to persuade the States-General of the Netherlands to intervene in the Jülich succession dispute (after the death of John William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg on March 25, 1609, the United Duchies of Jülich- Cleves-Berg were claimed by both Wolfgang William, Count Palatine of Neuburg and John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg). He thereafter participated in discussion with the French ambassador Jacques Bongars at Düsseldorf. In 1610, Schönberg was appointed commander of a regiment of Dutch troops. He was also named Governor of Düsseldorf. With the outbreak of hostilities in the War of the Jülich succession, he participated in the siege of Jülich to retake the fort at Jülich from the forces of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. When the fort finally fell, Schönberg made out well in the plundering that followed. On February 22, 1611, Schönberg entered the service of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg, who entrusted him with supreme command of his artillery corps in the Rhineland, with its headquarters at Wesel. He again served as a diplomat to The Hague on behalf of the Protestant Union. Later in 1611, he returned to the Electorate of the Palatinate to construct fortresses at Mannheim. On November 1, 1611, he was appointed hofmeister of Frederick V, Elector Palatine. He continued his diplomatic work for the Protestant Union, traveling to the Hague and Brussels. In 1612, he traveled to England to arrange the marriage of Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I of England to Frederick. During this trip, Schönberg met Anna Sutton-Dudley, daughter of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley and Theodosia Harington. The two were later married in London on March 22, 1615. Anna would give birth to a child, Frederick, subsequently the 1st Duke of Schomberg, in Heidelberg in December 1615. Anne died shortly after his birth. During the dispute between Frederick Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the city of Braunschweig, Schönberg entered Frederick Ulrich's service. Schönberg died in Heidelberg on August 3, 1616.

Life and career Ridout was a descendant of Thomas Ridout the first Surveyor General of Upper Canada during the administration of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. He attended University of Toronto with John Beckwith. During his time at the Toronto University, he was a pupil of Ettore Mazzoleni (conducting), Weldon Kilburn (piano), and Charles Peaker (organ and counterpoint) at its Conservatory of Music. He then taught on the conservatory faculty from 1940 to 1948. He left there to join the faculty at Toronto University, where he taught until 1982. Among his notable pupils were Walter Babiak, Walter Buczynski, Hugh Davidson, Alan Detweiler, Ben McPeek, Welford Russell, Alfred Strombergs, and Charles Wilson.Godfrey Ridout at The Canadian Encyclopedia He contributed articles to numerous Canadian music publications, notably serving as the assistant editor of both Canadian Music (1940–1941) and Canadian Review of Music and Art (1942–1943). From 1973 to 1984 he was the author of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra's program notes. As a conductor he served as the music director of the Eaton Operatic Society from 1949 to 1958. He was also highly involved with the Toronto Gilbert & Sullivan Society of which he was made an honorary vice-president. As a composer, Ridout is chiefly remembered for his symphonic and choral works. The Canadian Encyclopedia describes him thus: > \\"Essentially an eclectic, Ridout yet did not lack for individuality. His > music, though intensely felt, is prevailingly sunny and affirmative; it > eschews the 'doom and gloom' manner and self-conscious profundity of much > 20th-century concert fare. Ridout liked fun in music and could not easily > resist concluding a work with a 'good tune'. He saw no need to strive for > ever-new styles, or for a progress through styles, or for the role of > musical inventor; style for him was a means of communication, not the > 'message' itself. In this aloofness from contemporary conformity, Ridout may > be perceived to be more original than many innovators and one of the > determined communicators of his day.\\" In 1946, Ridout conducted Two Etudes for String Orchestra, after making alterations suggested by TSO music director Ernest MacMillan. In 1961, he composed one of his notable works, Fall Fair and in 1974 traveled to London to lead the Royal Philharmonic Society at Royal Festival Hall, his first visit to England.

It is long. Its southern end is in the vicinity of Interstate 70 (I-70) and its northern end is 53rd Place. An expansion was planned but funding has not materialized. Route description I-70 exit sign for SH 35 The route begins as Quebec Street near I-70. North of I-70, it becomes Northfield Quebec Street. It crosses Sand Creek and intersects I-270 and Northfield Boulevard; the interchanges overlap one another. The route then continues as Quebec Street, intersects 52nd Place and ends at 53rd Place, but Quebec Street continues northward towards Commerce City. History The route was established in 1972 as a road to Stapleton International Airport (now closed). It was planned to be extended in several locations, but it remains a short highway. Government records from the 1970s indicate that the route would have run all the way from the intersection of Quebec St. and Hampden Avenue north to I-80S (now I-76), southwest of Barr Lake, but construction never began, even though the project was still listed in transportation plans until the late 1990s. The route's southern end was at the Stapleton terminal access road from 1972 to 2000, when it was moved up to I-70. From 1972-1977 the northern end of the highway ended at I-70, then moved to 56th Ave, and then to I-270 in 1988 before ending around 53rd Place in the mid-1990s. Future Because of congestion in the areas around Quebec Street an extension of SH 35 into a major highway in the eastern metropolitan Denver area has been proposed. In theory, it would be useful to alleviate traffic jams in the Quebec St. area.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 11, 2010. The episode features the Griffin family as they attempt to live out their last day on Earth, after hearing an announcement on the local news about a black hole that is sucking in the entire solar system. As the countdown approaches zero, Peter suddenly reveals his secret dislike of being in his children's presence, seconds before the world is expected to end. Then it is revealed that it is all an April Fools' prank, and Peter is left to attempt to win back his children's respect. The episode was written by John Viener and directed by Joseph Lee. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 6.93 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by James Burkholder, Anne Hathaway and Jason Mraz, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"April in Quahog\\" was released on DVD along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011. Plot The local news reports that Stephen Hawking has discovered a new black hole at the edge of the solar system, but the Griffin family pays no attention to the announcement. Peter then alerts the family that he has been selected for jury duty, which he believes is an exclusive experience. After Brian informs him that everyone serves jury duty at some point, Peter tries to be kicked out of court by annoying the others, expressing fabricated prejudices, singing \\"Surfin' Bird\\", and attempting to discuss the trial outside of the courtroom. When Peter returns home that night, the local news announces that the Earth will be destroyed by the newly discovered, and continually expanding, black hole within the next 24 hours. Frantic over the news, everyone in Quahog attempts to live out the best last day possible. Herbert finally attempts to have sex with Chris, Quagmire has sex with Bonnie, and Peter manages to steal a lion from the zoo and say the \\"you-know-what word\\" in a black neighborhood - he is well respected as a result. As the countdown reaches its final seconds, Peter confesses to Lois that while he loves her, he hates spending time with his kids. Immediately afterward, the news anchors reveal the black hole report was an April Fools' prank. Even though their father said he was joking around, Meg, Chris and Stewie don't buy it and prevent themselves from making contact with Peter. After realizing how angry they are, Peter tries to reconcile with his kids by spending time with each of them. Peter tries to attempt to learn about his kids interests, first by asking Meg about her period, which she claims is not an interest but something she cannot control, then by asking Chris to do methamphetamine with him as a father-son activity, and finally by asking Stewie about his toys (the latter two reveal him getting high on the meth and destroying Chris' rooms wall and the roof in Stewie's room), all of which make things worse for Peter. After a heartfelt speech does not work, Peter finally buys his kids' love by giving them a new Xbox 360, and they proclaim Peter \\"the best father ever\\". At the end of the show, Meg asks if she can play the Xbox, but Peter is playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, albeit terribly, much to the other players' fury, two of them being Quagmire and Joe who tell Peter he sucks at the game. Production and development John Viener wrote the episode. As his first official episode for the series, the episode was directed by Joseph Lee, who had previously served as an assistant director and storyboard artist for the show. In addition, the episode was written by series regular John Viener, his second episode for the season, the first being \\"Jerome is the New Black\\". In promoting the episode, an image of Stan and Francine Smith meeting and speaking with Lois and Peter, along with an image of Peter, Brian, Joe and Quagmire drinking cans of beer in front of the house from King of the Hill was released by 20th Century Fox. A press release of a purported crossover was also made public. Having released the information on April Fools' Day, the crossover was revealed to be an April Fools' prank after the episode aired without a crossover occurring. \\"April in Quahog\\", along with the eleven other episodes from Family Guys eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on December 13, 2011. The sets include brief audio commentaries by various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\", a mini- feature entitled \\"The Comical Adventures of Family Guy – Brian & Stewie: The Lost Phone Call\\", and footage of the Family Guy panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. In addition to the regular cast, voice actor James Burkholder, actress Anne Hathaway and singer and performer Jason Mraz guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan, Johnny Brennan, Chris Cox, Ralph Garman, writer and showrunner Mark Hentemann, voice actor Phil LaMarr, writer Chris Sheridan, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener also made minor appearances. Recurring guest voice actors Adam West and Patrick Warburton made guest appearances as well. Cultural references In the opening scene of the episode, the Griffin family is seen watching the Channel 5 News, with Tricia Takanawa then beginning an interview with Stephen Hawking. Hawking, who is paralyzed due to neuro-muscular dystrophy, is seen sitting in his wheelchair. After the camera cuts, Hawking then jumps up from his chair, and admits it is just an act, before deciding to go surfing at the nearby beach. Anne Hathaway portrayed herself in the episode In mentioning that he has been summoned for jury duty, and implying its exclusivity, Peter is confronted by Brian who reveals that the only reason he was selected was because he had voted in the last election. Peter goes on to state that he actually stuffed the ballot box at the Oscars, when the nominees included Grover from Sesame Street, Bluto from Popeye, and Daniel Day-Lewis, among others. Actress Anne Hathaway presented the award. Going on to find out that everyone is asked to do jury duty, Peter soon seeks to be kicked out, just as he was from the rock band Coldplay once he suggested that they write a song that is \\"not whiny bullcrap\\". Further attempting to be kicked out of jury duty, Peter begins singing the song \\"Surfin' Bird\\" by The Trashmen, a song that was first introduced in the series in the seventh season episode \\"I Dream of Jesus\\". Before Peter is preparing to leave for jury duty, the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother, a parody of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, which features Henry Kissinger, whose heavy accent makes his speech unintelligible. Once Peter is dressed for court, he explains that even the vending machines at the courthouse are out of order, with Brian then being shown dressed and laughing in a similar manner as the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Muttley. Having learned of the impending doomsday, Mayor Adam West angrily writes an angry letter to outer space, expressing his intention of punching the constellation Orion. West then straps on a jetpack, as well as a fishbowl for his helmet, and flies into space, punching the constellation, causing the stars to form into the Orion Pictures company logo, causing West to claim \\"all [they] are is a failed production company\\". After it is revealed by Channel 5 News that the impending doomsday was actually an April Fools' Day prank, Brian reacts by angrily yelling, \\"You dicks!\\", a line uttered by Jeff Spicoli, as portrayed by Sean Penn, in the 1982 comedy film Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Unable to win over his children's affection, Peter decides to buy them an Xbox 360 to earn the respect once more. Before the end credits, Peter is then shown playing the Xbox 360 game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (Team Deathmatch on Favela), much to his children's chagrin. Peter, gamertag 'pgriffin69x', is killed by Infinity Ward's former Creative Strategist Robert Bowling, gamertag FOURZEROTWO. Reception In a slight decrease from the previous week, the episode was viewed in 6.93 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.4 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show, as well as the return episode of American Dad!, which had been put into a temporary hiatus, in order to accommodate Sons of Tucson. In addition, the episode significantly edged out all three shows in total viewership. Reviews of the episode were mostly mixed, calling it a \\"tragedy,\\" but \\"funnier than expected.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club noted that there are \\"funny lines tucked around the edges of every episode but there's nothing here that justifies the needlessly elaborate plots.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad gave the episode a more positive review, stating that Peter's attempts to bond with his children \\"brought some of the most hilarious visuals.\\" Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a much more negative review, noting that it did not \\"have many redeeming qualities,\\" and the jokes were \\"mediocre.\\" In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed \\"April in Quahog\\" as being \\"full of the lowest of the lowest-common-denominator 'jokes', with heavy reliance on toilet humor and the characteristic cutaway gags that have steadily gotten more random and less funny.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 8) episodes Category:April Fools' Day ","title":"April in Quahog"},{"id":"26542182","text":"Lana Spreeman (August 9, 1955 – November 29, 2016) was a Canadian athlete, who competed in alpine skiing at five Winter Paralympic Games.

Early life Leis was born into a musical family in Sedgwick, Kansas, near Wichita. His parents had a family band and played at local dances, weddings, and other events. When he was nine, he joined the family group on mandolin, an instrument whose neck was small enough for him to play comfortably. In his early teens he took up tenor guitar and began playing with other small groups. His father wanted him to play cello, and Leis negotiated a series of banjo lessons in exchange. During the late 1930s Leis listened to the swing bands of Goodman and to guitarists Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt. The introduction of the electric guitar changed the nature of the guitar player in dance bands so that they could play loud enough to be heard over the other instruments. He decided to focus on guitar. War years In early 1941, Leis enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps in Galveston, Texas, and was sent to Muroc Army Air Field in the desert north of Lancaster, California. Later this airfield would become known as Edwards Air Force Base, but in 1941 it was an airfield used to teach maneuvers in bombing and gunnery. While at the base, he took lessons from Dave Saunders, a student of George M. Smith, a studio and performing guitarist and author of George M. Smith Modern Guitar Method. These lessons formed the core of Leis's teaching system. Smith's method focused on teaching players the chord techniques for rhythm playing and improvising in contemporary jazz. Promoted to staff sergeant, Leis formed Gene and his Jive Bombers. The band was composed of GIs and civilians and toured the area for the next three years. Leis arranged, directed, produced, and emceed at these appearances. Leis was sent to India to organize entertainment for airbases in the China- Burma-India Theater of the war, playing in many different kinds of bands and at one time touring camps for several months with movie star and singer Tony Martin. Discharged in December 1945, Technical Sergeant returned to Lancaster and started a dance band. Preston Foster In 1948 Leis met actor/singer Preston Foster and taught him some guitar. He was in a trio with Foster and Foster's wife, actress Sheila Darcy. Leis wrote the arrangments, and the trio performed on radio and in clubs, appearing with Orrin Tucker, Peggy Ann Garner and Rita Hayworth. He learned about performing from watching professionals.[Ferris (October, 1971), p. 32] Foster broke up the trio and acted in the television series Waterfront. Tired of touring, Leis returned to Lancaster and sold real estate. The Nexsus Recorded Course At night he worked on creating a self-taught guitar course on record that he would sell through the mail. The brittleness of the 78s meant they sometimes broke in the mail, and their weight increased the cost of shipping. After Columbia Records was successful with its mail order program,[Marmorstein, Gary (2007). The Label: The Story of Columbia Records. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, p.221] Leis decided his idea could work. He enrolled in a school of broadcasting to develop his narration skills, studied writing, photography, and print layout and composition. He used a Varitype machine to lay out and print pages. He called his course the Nexus Course and bought ads in Esquire, Playboy, True, and Diner's Club magazine. The Complete Nexus Method Course included records, an instruction book, chord book, and chord maps. Tom Scanlan, jazz critic for the Army Times and DownBeart magazine, gave the course a favorable review.[Scanlan, Tom (1963). \\"Any Interest in Guitar?\\" In \\"Beautiful Guitar\\" [Album Insert]. Manhattan Beach: Gene Leis Studios, Inc.] Leis quit his job selling real estate to work on his mail order program. He moved to Manhattan Beach, California and in 1961 built a recording studio. In the first several years he sold 7000 courses and began selling chord books separately. With the encouragement and assistance of Jessy Stidham, one of his students, he introduced Play Guitar: Sounds of Today, designed to teach younger students how to play single string melody without going into complicated chords.[Leis, Gene (1962). Play Guitar: Sounds of Today, Volume1. Liner notes.] He recorded the album Beautiful Guitar with a multitrack approach pioneered by Les Paul. In 1963 Leis got his first distributor, in Boston. Within 10 years he had over 30 distributors and was distributing the books himself as well.[Ferris, Leonard (1971), p. 32] In 1964, he incorporated Gene Leis Distributing with the aim of offering a full range of accessories and instruments. He designed or created a line of guitar amplifiers, which appeared under the names Rodeo Music or Gene Leis, guitars, and accessories, which were distributed by White Front, Montgomery Ward, and other retail stores. He sold over 8,000 amplifiers before leaving the crowded amp market.[Ferris (1971), p. 32] In 1964 he revised the chord book, incorporating many more instructional elements, and called it the Instructional Chord Book for Guitar. He wrote Teacher's Pet Manuscript and Chord Diagram (Primary and Advanced) for students to write their own arrangements. By 1965, the Instruction Chord Book had sold over 250,000 copies.[Ferris (1971), p. 32] In 1966 he introduced Guitar for Two and Guitar for Fun. To promote his courses, books and accessories, Leis toured the west coast with his sons, playing rock and roll and ballads. After the concerts, he hosted question and answer sessions that helped him determine the interests of guitar students. He considered comments and letters to be one of his greatest assets in developing courses and method books. In 1965, Decca Records started a division known as Decca Home Entertainment Products, which for several years imported Japanese acoustic and solid-body electric guitars aimed primarily at the beginner market. Leis acted as an advisor to Decca, which sold over 30,000 of his chord books a year. Columbia Record Club bought 50,000 of his courses to pair with a line of guitars that it sold.[Ferris (1971), p. 32] In 1966, Leis collaborated on the book A Guitar Manual with Daniel Mari and Peter Huyn. Published by E&O; Mari, the manufacturer of La Bella guitar strings, the book focused on the history, anatomy, and use of the guitar. A year later he produced the albums Let's Duet and Learn to Play Guitar for Music Minus One, a company that created courses on record with one instrumental part missing so that students play along. During the same year he became a contributing editor for Guitar Player magazine. By the mid 1970s, Leis had sold over 225,000 of his recorded courses and over two million copies of the Instruction Chord Book for Guitar.[Leis, Gene (1974). Instruction Chord Book for Guitar. Manhattan Beach: Gene Leis Studio, inc., p.2] The studio in Manhattan Beach was a recording studio, a distribution center, and a retail store. In the late 1960s he built small studios for teaching guitar lessons. His students included Jeff Linsky.[Rodgers, Jeffrey Pepper (September, 2008). Have Guitar, Will Travel (interview with guitarist Jeff Linsky). Acoustic Guitar Magazine, p.70] In 1970 he recorded Gene Leis Plays Beautiful Music, also known as Music to Iron By. Leis performed with guitarist Ron Anthony at Beach Bum Burt's in Redondo Beach, California.[\\"Master Jazz Guitarist at Beachbums\\" (November 18, 1976). Long Beach Press-Telegram, p. A-29] He retired in the 1970s, selling the studio and moving to Santa Maria, California, where he continued to sell his books, play at local clubs, and record others. He died in Santa Maria on March 15, 1993 at age of 73.

The Security Council expressed its concern about the deteriorating political, military and humanitarian situation in Angola and that, despite all previous resolutions and efforts, peace talks were suspended and no ceasefire was in effect. Support was given to the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative Margaret Anstee to help resolve the crisis through negotiations. The United Nations, therefore, would continue to be present in Angola in order to secure full implementation of the \\"Acordos de Paz\\" peace agreements. The resolution extended the current mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II (UNAVEM II) until 15 December 1993. In the event of significant progress in the peace process, the presence would be increased. The position of the Angolan government to resolve the conflict peacefully was welcomed, while UNITA was reminded to accept the results of the 1992 elections. UNITA was also condemned for its military actions and attempts to seize territory which had caused suffering to the civilian population and Angolan economy, with the Council demanding that all such actions cease. Attacks by UNITA on United Nations humanitarian personnel in violation of international humanitarian law were condemned, urging both UNITA and the Government of Angola to ensure the safety of UNAVEM II staff and other humanitarian personnel. The Council also reiterated its demand that UNITA release all foreign hostages held against their will. The Council continued by strongly condemning UNITA, holding its leadership responsible for not complying with previous Security Council resolutions. In this regard, it determined UNITA's actions and the situation in Angola to be a threat to international peace and security and imposed sanctions on UNITA under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, within 10 days following the adoption of the current resolution, the following measures would take effect unless the Secretary-General reported that a ceasefire was in force and an agreement on the implementation of the peace agreement and United Nations resolutions had been reached. If the ceasefire or agreements were not observed, the sanctions would be reimposed and take effect immediately. All countries were prohibited from selling arms, petroleum and related products to UNITA, except for some places that were determined by the Angolan government, notwithstanding any international agreements, commitments, contracts or licenses. Proceedings would be brought against any persons or entities violating the resolution. A Committee of the Security Council was then established which would monitor implementation of Resolution 864. Its functions were to: :(a) examine reports by the Secretary-General; :(b) seek further information from countries regarding what action they are taking to implement the current resolution; :(c) consider information concerning violations of the sanctions; :(d) make periodic reports on the violations and implementation of Resolution 864; :(e) devise guidelines that facilitate exports. The Council called upon all states to report to the Secretary-General by 15 October 1993 on the measures they had adopted, providing all necessary assistance to the Committee. The imposition of further measures including travel restrictions and trade measures would be considered if no ceasefire had been agreed and the peace agreements were not implemented, or reviewed, if the agreement and ceasefire had been carried out. The resolution concluded by requesting Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to report back on the implementation of the current resolution and other developments by 1 November 1993 and 15 December 1993, including on recommendations for the future role of the United Nations in the peace process.

The following is an excerpt: :...the NTSB ran a study of the choices available. A simulator was programmed to duplicate the circumstances of Sullenberger's bird strike...and four pilots were enlisted to fly a series of attempts on LaGuardia. In the setup there were two important differences from the actual flight. First, the starting point was the location of the bird strike itself, not the location where Sullenberger came out of his turn. Second, the pilots knew the game in advance. ... In every case where the pilots were allowed to respond immediately to the loss of thrust by making a quick turn back to the airport, every one of them was able to land safely. ... In recognition [of the need to account for reaction time] the NTSB then imposed a thirty-second delay before allowing the simulator pilots to fly their returns--and every one of them crashed. Sullenberger made the right decision. No matter what. ... Even if people had died because of landing in the Hudson.

In the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis, Promontory was one of several consulting firms selected by federal banking regulators to conduct reviews of loan foreclosures initiated by 16 mortgage servicing companies. Promontory reviewed the foreclosure activities of Bank of America, PNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo, encompassing more than 250,000 loan contracts. Promontory was paid $927 million, which led to strong criticism and doubt about the independence of the examination. A hearing was arranged by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee to assess whether regulators had handed off too much oversight authority to private consulting firms such as Promontory.  New York State Enforcement Action  In August 2015, Promontory entered into an agreement with the New York Department of Financial Services to resolve the state's allegations that it had watered down compliance reports for a UK banking client, Standard Chartered Bank. Promontory agreed to pay a $15 million penalty and abstain for six months from accepting new consulting engagements in New York.http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1508181.htm  References  Category:Financial services companies established in 2001 Category:Financial services companies of the United States Category:Consulting firms of the United States Category:Information technology consulting firms of the United States Category:Consulting firms established in 2001 Category:Companies based in Washington, D.C. * Category:IBM acquisitions Category:IBM subsidiaries Category:2016 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Promontory Financial Group"},{"id":"26542442","text":"The Bellanger-Denhaut 22 (sometimes known by the military designation Bellanger-Denhaut HB.3) was a twin-engined bomber/reconnaissance flying boat designed by François Denhaut the technical director for seaplanes for the car manufacturer Bellanger.

As automobile usage began to increase, freight began to be transported more by trucks, and the street railway (trolley) company went bankrupt in 1927. The history of the railway is preserved in the Shelburne Falls Trolley Museum.  As a garden  In 1929, with the bridge covered in weeds, local housewife Antoinette Burnham came up with the idea of transforming the bridge into a garden. Since it was not needed as a footbridge and could not be demolished because it carried a water main between the two towns, the community agreed to her idea. The Shelburne Woman's Club sponsored the project in 1928. In 1929, eighty loads of loam and several loads of fertilizer were brought to the bridge. Several women's clubs around town raised $1,000 in 1929. In 1975, a photographic study was conducted of Shelburne Falls. One of the concerns of the town was the deterioration of the bridge structure. In 1981, funds were raised by those who owned the bridge, and a study was commissioned. The study determined that $580,000 in repairs should be made to the bridge. Various organizations raised money and repairs began on May 2, 1983. During the restoration, every plant that was removed was cared for in private. The restoration replaced the 8-inch water line, which carries up to half a million gallons of water a day. The bridge also contains two and a half feet of soil at the top of the arches and nine feet deep at the piers. On August 28, 2011, rain runoff from Hurricane Irene (at that point a tropical storm) flooded the Deerfield River and engulfed the Bridge of Flowers.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Born in Silesia, Mattenklott became a military officer in 1903 and fought in World War I. He remained in the downsized army of the Weimar Republic after the war, and by the start of World War II he was already a Generalmajor (Major General). He saw only limited involvement in the Battle of France in 1940, but his units played a decisive role during the German invasion of Greece in 1941 and, later the same year, during the Siege of Sevastopol and other operations in the Crimea. He was appointed as military district commander in mid–1944, and faced the Western allies during the final battles of the war in the spring of 1945. Although implicated in war crimes in both the Eastern and Western Fronts during World War II, Mattenklott was never convicted of any wrongdoing, dying a free man in the summer of 1954. Early years and World War I Franz Mattenklott was born on 19 November 1884 in Grünberg, a city in the Prussian Province of Silesia to Dietrich Mattenklott and his wife Elfriede, née Duttenhöfer. His father was director of a sugar factory in Ober Pritschen in Silesia, estate owner and a retired captain of the Prussian Army.Jahrbuch der Berliner Börse: Ein Nachschlagebuch fur Bankiers und Kapitalisten. Berlin 1895, p. 572. After completing his high–school studies, Franz Mattenklott applied to enter an infantry regiment in Metz, Alsace-Lorraine, then part of the German Empire. After successfully taking a written examination, Mattenklott entered service in the Prussian Army as an officer candidate on 28 December 1903. He received his commission as an officer in 1905. By 1912 he had advanced to the position of Adjutant of the regiment's 1st Battalion.Rangliste der Königlich Preussischen Armee und des XIII. (Königlich Württembergischen) Armeekorps für 1912, p. 226. Mattenklott served during World War I as a captain. Interwar period After the capitulation of the German Empire, Mattenklott was retained in the Reichsheer of the Weimar Republic. He continued to rise in the ranks of the Reichswehr, being promoted to Major in 1928. His next position was that of an instructor at the Infantry School in Dresden. In 1932, he rose to the rank of Oberstleutnant. Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 marked the end of the Weimar Republic. The following years, disregarding the confining Versailles Treaty, the Nazi regime intensified the German re-armament (Aufrüstung) and increased the size of the military. As part of this process, Mattenklott received the command of the newly formed Infantry Regiment Stargard on 1 October 1934 and he was promoted to Oberst (Colonel) on the same day. Mattenklott finally entered the general officers' ranks at the age of 53, with his promotion to Generalmajor (Major General) on 1 March 1938. His new position was at the west part of the Third Reich: on 1 July 1938, he was appointed commander of the Border Command Trier (Grenz–Kommandantur Trier). He was still in this post when Nazi Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, marking the start of World War II in Europe. World War II=France Upon the war's outbreak, most of the German army forces were fighting in Poland, but since the Western Allies had declared war on Nazi Germany, its western borders were vulnerable. Part of the critical task of border guarding was given to Mattenklott, who had three regiments — two infantry and one artillery — at his disposal to defend the border with Luxembourg and the adjacent part with France's. A few weeks later, on 19 September 1939, the units under his command were reorganized as the 72nd Infantry Division, with headquarters at Koblenz. Given its primary assignment, it is understandable that the division was not considered first priority, and as a consequence, it consisted of units of rather inferior fighting value. The following months, it remained on duty on the Western Front during the Phoney War. It didn't face the dreaded attack from the Western Allies, apart from some minor, light engagements. A few months before the German attack on France, in February 1940, Mattenklott was promoted to Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General). dragon's teeth) in Metaxas Line Mattenklott's units had a limited participation in the Battle of France in May–June 1940. One of the division's veterans claimed after the war that his unit was ordered to attack French positions in a forest, allegedly manned by inferior units. Mattenklott supposedly forbade air support, resulting in operational failure, prompting the veteran to bluntly call Mattenklott \\"an idiot\\". It is generally accepted that Mattenklott's division performed mediocrely, even though it faced only light resistance. By June 1940, France capitulated, and the 72nd Infantry Division was posted in France as an occupational unit, while Mattenklott was named commander of Metz, Alsace-Lorraine, in July of that year. Balkan campaign After a brief period of refitting in France, the 72nd Infantry Division was deployed to Bulgaria, then a member of the Axis powers, in the spring of 1941, in order to take part in the planned invasion of Greece, or \\"Operation Marita\\" (Unternehmen Marita). The division was placed under XVIII Mountain Corps (XVIII. Gebirgskorps) of General der Infanterie Franz Böhme, part of Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Wilhelm List's 12th Army (Wehrmacht). All in all, Böhme's Corps consisted of four infantry divisions and a reinforced infantry regiment; this formidable force faced three Greek Divisions and the heavily fortified Metaxas Line along the mountainous region of the Greek–Bulgarian border. Mattenklott's division was given the objective of breaking through the defenses southwest of Nevrokop, proceeding further to the southwest until Serres and then turn to the north and attack Fort Roupel from behind, in order to capture the vital national road crossing the narrow valley known as the Rupel Pass. The invasion began on 6 April, and until the night, Mattenklott's troops had failed to punch through the Metaxas Line, suffering heavy casualties. However, during the following day, a breakthrough was achieved, but the advance towards Serres was retarded by the mountainous terrain. Most of the Greek forts continued to resist until 9 April, but as the main forces were isolated by the German advance to the west, they finally capitulated on the same day. Suming up his experiences from the battle, Mattenklott praised the Greek Army for its firm resistance and bravery. Following these developments, the XVIII Mountain Corps advanced until Thessaly. Other units captured the rest of the country, which came under total occupation with the capture of Crete in June. Invasion of the Soviet Union At the time of the start of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, Mattenklott's division was in Romania; it was placed under 11th Army of Army Group South as a reserve formation. It fought initially near Nikolayev in Ukraine, then crossing the Dnieper River, a vital point which allowed the advance towards Crimea. Mattenklott led his units during the Crimean Campaign, reaching Sevastopol in late autumn. On 1 October 1941, he was promoted to General of the Infantry. The destroyed port of Sevastopol after the city's capture by the Wehrmacht (July 1942) For his leadership of the division during the siege of Sevastopol in the first half of November 1941, Mattenklott was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. While in Crimea, Mattenklott was confronted with the murder of Jews by special units, the Einsatzgruppen. When 400 Jewish men and 10 women were shot, ostensibly for acts of sabotage, Mattenklott \\"expressed his recognition and gratitude\\" to the responsible Einsatzgruppe D for the executions. During the following months, the 11th Army, under the command of General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) Erich von Manstein, continued to lay siege on encircled Sevastopol. A crisis ensued in late December 1941, when the Soviets launched an amphibious attack on the Kerch Straits and Feodosiya to retake Kerch and its peninsula, threatening to cut off Generalleutnant Hans von Sponeck's XLII Army Corps (XLII. or XXXXII. Armeekorps). Although Manstein had given explicit orders to Sponeck to hold his positions, while units from Sevastopol could arrive, Sponeck ordered his corps to retreat. Furious at this insubordination, Manstein relieved him of his command and replaced him with Mattenklott, who had just been given the command of XXX Army Corps. Mattenklott's units, along with XXX Army Corps, spent the next months in bitter fighting over eastern Crimea, managing to repulse Soviet attacks, suffering and inflicting heavy casualties. In May 1942, Mattenklott led his corps throughout Operation Trappenjagd, an attempt to crush the soviet bridgeheads in Kerch peninsula. The Germans managed to encircle and destroy several Red Army units, killing or capturing about 175,000 soldiers to fewer than 3,500 casualties for XXX and XLII Army Corps. After the ultimate capture of Crimea in July 1942, XLII Corps remained on duty on the peninsula, and Mattenklott was named commander of Crimea (Befehlshaber Krim) on 24 August 1942. Almost immediately, he became confronted with the problem of the nutrition of the population, as the callous policy of Manstein was to confiscate all raw materials to sustain the German troops. Mattenklott worried about the impact on the relations between the army and the civilians and wrote to the Army Group South in September, expressing the opinion that the German troops should not give promises to the population for ameliorating the situation if they were unable to keep them. Measures were not undertaken, however, and Crimea suffered food shortages and famines throughout 1942 and 1943. Under Mattenklott's command, hundreds of civilians were executed, including those accused, often wrongfully, as partisans, communists, invalids and the homeless, as well as numerous other groups labeled as \\"undesirable elements\\" by the Nazi world view. Among the perpetrators of these atrocities were also police units, with which Mattenklott reported to have \\"an excellent cooperation\\". Mattenklott was commander of Crimea until April 1943. Mattenklott commanded the XLII corps during the battle of Kursk in July 1943, but his unit played only a marginal role in the Wehrmacht's last major offensive against the Red Army. In January 1944, Mattenklott temporarily ceded command of the Corps to the commander of 112. Infanterie-Division, Generalleutnant Theo-Helmut (Theobald) Lieb. The same month, the Red Army tried to encircle and destroy the XLII and XI Army Corps, together with Corps Detachment B (Korpsabteilung B), during the battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket. During the ensuing battles, the head of the anti-Nazi National Committee for a Free Germany, General der Artillerie Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach, unaware of his absence, appealed with letter to Matteklott and other commanders, urging them to surrender so he could halt the impending destruction. This proposal, however, fell on deaf ears. After weeks of hard fighting, the Germans achieved a breakout, and Mattenklott was summoned back to oversee the refitting of the corps and the transfer of the units in occupied Poland, away from the frontline. He was also commissioned with the drafting of an after-action report (Abschlussmeldung) and estimating the casualties. During the following months, the aging Mattenklott (by then 59 years of age) did not play any important military role, save for his role during the battles in Kovel in north-western Ukraine, where he aided German units to break free after they were encircled by the Soviet forces. Late war When General der Infanterie Gerhard Glokke, Commander of Military District VI (Wehrkreis VI) in Münster, Westphalia, died in office of a heart attack in early June 1944, Mattenklott was chosen to succeed him, with effect from 15 June 1944. In many respects, he was extremely lucky to have been transferred away from the Eastern Front. Exactly one week later, on 22 June 1944, the Soviet launched a large-scale offensive, Operation Bagration, which shattered the Wehrmacht units and paved the way for the drive into Germany. Unbeknownst to Mattenklott, who apparently did not harbour any kind of anti- Nazi sentiments, some of his officers in the Wehrkreis VI were involved in the military resistance against Hitler. On 20 July 1944, after Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg detonated a bomb in Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia, the attempt to overthrow the Nazi regime (known as the 20th July plot) came in motion. Oberstleutnant Martin Bärtels, a conspirator in Mattenklott's staff, urged his superior to leave his headquarters and go on an inspection tour. However, the plot failed from the beginning in Münster. Soon thereafter, the commands from the conspirators' center in Berlin for the immediate arrest of the members of the Nazi apparatus in the Wehrkreis were signed from the retired Field Marshal (Generalfeldmarschall) Erwin von Witzleben. Still unsure of the situation, Matteknlott passively waited until information on the failure on Hitler's life and the coup reached him. To what extent the failure of the plot and the brutal response against those involved in it affected Mattenklott's stance towards the evergrowing denialism showed by Hitler in view of Germany's impending defeat is not known. But as the Western Allies made their push in western Germany in the spring of 1945, Mattenklott followed the unrealistic orders of his superiors. By then, Mattenklott was leading the Wehrkreis units in a desperate defence of the area around Paderborn in North Rhine-Westphalia. On 1 April 1945 he reported to his superior, the Supreme Commander West (Oberbefehlshaber West), Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, that Paderborn was lost to the enemy after \\"it was defended to the last man\\"; he was committed in holding the Teutoburg Forest, but warned he was not able to deploy any significant forces. A few days later, Mattenklott allegedly ordered the execution of Wilhelm Gräfer, the mayor of Lemgo, for treason, as he had tried to surrender the city to the US Army, in order to spare it from further destruction.Kriegsverbrechen/Lemgo. An einem Baum. In: Der Spiegel Nr. 9/1970, p. 56–57. Mattenklott himself surrendered to the Allies after some weeks. Post–war During his captivity, Mattenklott wrote several historical manuscripts for the US Army, including a report on the battle of Kursk. During the post-war years, Mattenklott successfully avoided persecution and conviction for the war crimes he was involved in. As a subordinate of General Hans von Salmuth, he testified in the High Command Trial in 1948 as a defense witness for his former superior. His signature was found on an order dated 28 November 1941, considering \\"Antipartisan warfare\\" in occupied territories. Among others, the order suggested establishment of various concentration camps where hostages \\"[...] are to be shot and hanged [...], if attacks by partisans occur in the area concerned\\", and, additionally, issued that civilians or \\"dispersed soldiers\\" would be shot on sight if they were caught armed. During his interrogation on 19 May 1947, Mattenklott claimed that such measures were \\"necessary and justified\\", but explained that he considered them to be of deterrent nature, as he stated that an execution of an armed civilian never came to his attention. He also told his interrogators that he had no knowledge of the systematic killing of Jews, Communists and other \\"undesirable elements\\" in the East, and categorically denied any involvement. Especially, he stressed that he knew \\"absolutely nothing\\" about the Holocaust.Trials of War Criminals Before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals Under Control Council Law No. 10, Nuernberg October 1946–April 1949, Volume XI. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1950 Only in the decades that followed did it became known that Mattenklott was fully aware of the Nazi policy of destruction and genocide in the Soviet Union, the activities of the Einsatzgruppen and that he often praised the \\"excellent cooperation\\" his units had with the perpetrators of these crimes. Another possibility for Mattenklott's persecution came in the following years. The above-mentioned execution of mayor Gräfer in Lemgo had sparked enormous outrage, and the public demanded the punishment of those responsible. One of them, the Generalmajor a. D. (retired) Paul Goerbig, president of the court-martial that convicted Gräfer, was arrested in Hamburg in April 1949 and brought to Paderborn. There he claimed that Mattenklott was aware that Gräfer's execution could lead to a conviction, but told Goerbig that this case was \\"totally under control\\". Mattenklott admitted that he had sent the execution order to one of his divisional commanders, Generalmajor a. D. Karl Becher, who, in turn, ordered Goerbig to proceed. Although, in his own words, Mattenklott took responsibility for the order, he attempted to place all the blame on Becher, who was responsible for the establishment of the court martial. According to Goerbig, Becher denied that he had drafted any such order. Mattenklott's and Goerbig's accusations against Becher were deemed satisfying, but the case proceeded extremely slowly. The prosecutor never summoned Becher to testify, and in 1959, two years after Becher's death, all proceedings were halted. By that time, however, Mattenklott was dead. He spent his final years in Braunlage, a health resort in the Harz Mountains in Lower Saxony. He died there on 28 June 1954 at the age of 69.

It housed the West Coast production of live-action original series produced for the Nickelodeon cable channel from 1997 until 2017. The theater will be preserved as part of a new development currently under construction, but a new operator has not yet been named. Pre-Nickelodeon history The Earl Carroll Theatre opened on December 26, 1938, with a lavish revue, “Broadway to Hollywood”, which featured sixty showgirls ascending 100 treads of stairs to a height of 135 feet. Many Hollywood celebrities were in attendance including Marlene Dietrich, Dolores del Río, the J. L. Warners, Richard Barthelmess, Sally Eilers, Edgar Bergen, Claudette Colbert, Constance Bennett, Errol Flynn, Lili Damita, William Gargan, Jackie Coogan, Betty Grable, Mary Livingstone, Phil Harris, Conrad Nagel, Mary Brian, Darryl Zanuck, David O. Selznick, and Norman Krasna. The $1,000 membership fee guaranteed a lifetime cover charge and a reserved seat. The building was designed in the Moderne style by architect Gordon Kaufmann. The interior design is attributed to both Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky and Frank Don Riha (1899—1957). As he had done at his New York theater, Carroll emblazoned over the entrance the words \\"Through these portals pass the most beautiful girls in the world\\". The theater-restaurant accommodated 1,200 diners and offered shows on a massive stage with a wide double revolving turntable and staircase and swings that could be lowered from the ceiling. The building's façade was adorned by what at the time was one of Hollywood's most famous landmarks: a neon head portrait of entertainer Beryl Wallace, one of Earl Carroll's \\"most beautiful girls in the world\\", who became his devoted companion. The sign survived several changes of ownership and venue name but was completely removed during major decorative overhauling in 1968. A re- creation made from photos is today on display at Universal CityWalk, at Universal City, as part of the collection of historic neon signs from the Museum of Neon Art. Another prominent exterior feature was the \\"Wall of Fame\\", on which were mounted more than a hundred individual concrete blocks autographed by Hollywood celebrities, including some of the biggest stars of the 1930s and 1940s. Earl Carroll Theatre, Hollywood The Moderne-style interior was lavishly decorated with zeon (a variation of neon) tube lighting and artwork, some of which remains extant. In 1939, Life magazine described the new building: “exhibits an ultramodern, super-streamlined interior with a patent-leather ceiling, 10,000 colored zeon lights, a 15-ft. statue, an acre of burgundy carpet...” The centerpiece of the foyer was the Goddess of Light, a 15-foot-tall aluminum-covered plaster statue (extant) designed by Martin Deutsch. With hands lifted to the ceiling, the statute held a fifty-foot zeon tube that wound its way to the ceiling. The columns in the lobby bar (extant) were filled with zeon lamps and zeon stalactites hung from the ceiling in the cabaret. A large painting of Carroll painted by the artist Strandanees hung near the main entrance. Later achieving various degrees of fame in films and on television, Jean Spangler, Mara Corday, Yvonne De Carlo, Phyllis Coates, Maila Nurmi, Gloria Pall, Tyra Vaughn, and Mamie Van Doren were some of the showgirls who performed there. The facility was a popular night spot for many of Hollywood's most glamorous stars and powerful film industry moguls such as Darryl Zanuck and Walter Wanger, who sat on the Earl Carroll Theatre's board of governors. The theater was sold following the 1948 deaths of Earl Carroll and Beryl Wallace in the crash of United Airlines Flight 624. It continued to operate but by the early 1950s it was falling on hard times. In 1953, Las Vegas showman Frank Sennes reopened the theater as a nightclub under the name Moulin Rouge. The popular TV contest show Queen for a Day was broadcast from the Moulin Rouge during part of the show's 1956–1964 run. In late 1965 it became the Hullabaloo, a minors-welcome rock and roll club, capitalizing on the popularity of the television variety show Hullabaloo. The venue was also used for the 1966 concert film The Big TNT Show.FZ Videography: The Big T.N.T. Show For several months in 1968 it was the Kaleidoscope and featured many top West Coast rock acts, with an emphasis on local bands such as The Doors. Later in 1968, the venue was redecorated in the psychedelic art style,The psychedelic paint job was by the Dutch design collective The Fool, which also created iconic late-1960s graphics for The Beatles, Cream with Eric Clapton, Procol Harum and other patrons. Several photographs of the Aquarius Theatre murals may be seen here (accessed October 26, 2014). renamed the Aquarius Theater, and rededicated as the home of a long-running Los Angeles production of the Broadway musical Hair. It was still sometimes used for rock concerts on Mondays, when the Hair company had its day off, and as a result the Aquarius is famous as the place where The Doors performed on July 21 & 22, 1969, making live recordings that were later issued commercially.Alison Martino's \\"Vintage Los Angeles\\": The Aquarius Theater In 1977 it was briefly known as the Longhorn Theatre and has also been called the Sunset Boulevard Theatre. In 1983, the Pick-Vanoff Company purchased the property and converted it into a state-of-the-art television theater that for nine years was the taping site of Star Search. The Pick-Vanoff Company also owned Sunset-Gower Studios, formerly the home of Columbia Pictures. For many years, it was used for the annual Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. In the fall of 1993, the theater was the venue for Fox Network's The Chevy Chase Show under the name The Chevy Chase Theater. The talk show was a disaster and was cancelled after five weeks; the theater reverted to its previous name soon after. Nickelodeon In the mid-1990s, Nickelodeon decided to move production of some live-action series to the West Coast from Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida at Universal Studios. After scouting soundstages for a year, the network's headlining mover All That spent a year at Paramount Pictures before Nickelodeon obtained a lease for the 6238 Sunset Blvd facility, acquiring the soundstage and rebranding it Nickelodeon on Sunset by 1997. Due to limited studio space and the need to control plot spoilage for several programs, only a few series were taped at Nickelodeon on Sunset at a time. As a result, other live-action series produced for the network were filmed in other stage facilities with closed set policies throughout the Hollywood area. Some of the shows filmed there for Nickelodeon include the ten-season run of All That, The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, and more recently iCarly and Victorious. In 2004, the venue was sold to a private equity firm as part of a larger parcel of property. Nickelodeon moved out of the property in 2017. With the addition of a new low rise building being constructed next to the theatre, the venue will once again revert to the \\"Earl Carroll Theatre\\" name in 2020.

Alf was born in Vila Isabel, Rio de Janeiro, and began playing piano at age 9. His father died when he was 3 and he was raised by his mother, who worked as a maid to raise him. He attended Colégio Pedro II, receiving support from his mother's employers. He played in nightclubs in the Copacabana neighborhood of Rio, where he was noticed by later bossa nova pioneers. His first single, \\"Falseta\\" was released in 1952, with a debut album following in 1961. Over his career, he recorded nine albums and appeared on nearly fifty others. He died in 2010, aged 80, from prostate cancer. Early life Johnny Alf (b. Alfredo José da Silva) was born on May 19, 1929, in Vila Isabel, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Oxford Music Online, par. 1. Alf's father, an army corporal, fought in the Brazilian civil war of 1932, the Constitutionalist Revolution, and perished in combat in the valley of Paraíba. His mother raised him alone, making a living as a maid.Castro 2000, p. 8. She found employment with a family in Tijuca, a quarter close to the centre of Rio. The family of the household, as well as being very welcoming to both Johnny and his mother, had much respect for music and supported Alf as he began to discover the art form.Neder, par. 2. Alfredo's mother was able to enroll him at the IBEU (Instituto Brasil-Estados Unidos or Brazilian-American Institute), and it was there that Alf received his first formal musical training, studying classical piano with instructor Geni Bálsamo; it was there too that young Alfredo earned the Americanized nickname that would accompany him through the entirety of his musical career. Due to his purported shyness Alf spent much more of his time listening to records (the music of the Nat “King” Cole Trio (Nat King Cole) and of the strongly classically influenced English pianist George Shearing being specific favorites) than practicing his technical skills on the piano.Castro 2000, p. 9. It was Alf's growing desire to enhance his technical abilities on the piano that led him to seek acceptance into the recently founded Sinatra-Farney Fan Club. The Sinatra- Farney Fan Club was a performer's collective of sorts, an appreciation for the crooning vocal jazz epitomized by artists such as Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and Brazilian born Dick Farney (b. Farnésio Dutra, a Carioca) being the thread that unified all of its members. Alf's membership in the club finally allowed him regular access to a piano (which he was permitted to use for practice only on weeknights that had no other scheduled club activities), as well as a group of musically sympathetic peers with which to play and experiment. The jam sessions held by the Sinatra-Farney Fan Club provided Alf his first taste of collaborative music-making and public, musical performance, the club's status being respectable enough around Rio for its members to be allowed to play (without pay) venues such as the Tijuca Tennis Club, the Fluminense Club, and the Athletic Association of the Bank of Brazil.Castro 2000, p. 13. In 1950 the death of the mother of two of the founding members stranded the club without a rehearsal headquarters and it was at this point that Alf began to pursue a professional musical career.Castro 2000, p. 14. Career Alf received his first professional break in 1952 when he was hired (on Dick Farney's recommendation) as the pianist at the newly inaugurated Cantina do César where his appointed task was, apparently, to “aid the digestion of the guests”.Castro 2000, p. 58. The food proving in most a cases a meager incentive for the customers’ return, the cantina's owner, César de Alencar (a popular radio host in Rio at the time), soon converted the space into a proper club—or inferninho (little hell)—and gave Johnny Alf free musical reign. Alf would receive frequent visits from artists such as pianist João Donato, vocalist Dolores Duran, and guitarist/vocalist João Gilberto would often accompany his colleagues in a duet or two before they were on their way. The musical fare in the first years of Alf's professional career rarely varied from the usual Samba-cançãoes (meaning, simply, samba-songs) and foxtrots, however Alf's familiarity with American Jazz styles imbued his playing, his vocal performances, and his on-stage banter with the mystery and prestige of New York's 52nd Street. As Alf's modest reputation slowly grew he managed to catch the eye of producer Ramalho Neto, who expressed interest in recording Alf. This brief pairing would produce Alf's first two recordings. Alf assembled a trio (in the style of Nat “King” Cole) composed of guitarist Garoto, double-bassist Vidal, and himself on Piano and recorded two tunes: “Falseta” (Deceit) composed by Alf himself, and “De cigarro em cigarro” (From Cigarette to Cigarette) composed by fellow Brazilian Luiz Bonfá. The recordings garnered no more than a pittance of recognition for Alf at the time, but would later (in the early 1960s) be hailed as the progenitors of the Bossa Nova style. Various opinions are now held about the validity of such a statement, but it can confidently be said that these two recordings displayed a largely novel sound, one that had not yet been heard by the majority of Brazilians. Following these sessions Alf would continue to find nightly work in the clubs of Rio de Jainero, musical companions such as João Gilberto, João Donato, and eventually the young pianist Antonio Carlos Jobim, following him from venue to venue provided they could afford the cover fee.Castro 2000, p. 57. For two years Alf contented himself with ephemeral engagements at clubs including the Monte Carlo in Gávea, the Clube da Chave, the Mandarim, and the Drink before settling at the Hotel Plaza nightclub in 1954. The Hotel Plaza nightclub was known throughout Copacabana as a haunted venue, which conveniently allowed Alf the freedom to experiment musically to a degree that would not have been possible had he been playing for anyone other than his loyal fan-base. He was able to play his own early compositions (“Rapaz De Bem”, “Céu E Mar”, and “O Que É Amar” among others) in a professional setting as well as the compositions of his colleagues and fellow innovators. During the early hours of the evening before the club had attracted any audience, Alf would hold impromptu jam sessions with whomever happened to show up and it was by way of these improvisatory collaborations that the harmonic and rhythmic structures that would eventually blossom into the style now known as Bossa Nova, were originally developed.Castro 2000, p. 59. While Alf's tenure at the Plaza Hotel may have been musically and artistically convenient it was far from economically convenient and when, in 1955, Alf was offered a position as the house pianist at a new club, Baiúca, opening in São Paulo, he jumped at the opportunity, even though it meant leaving the tight-knit musical community he had helped to create in Rio. At Baiúca Alf would form a duo with himself on the piano and double-bassist Sabá. Unfortunately, however, the group had time only to establish a moderate following before the Baiúca was closed down for reasons pertaining to health-code violations.Castro 2000, p. 226. Once again Alf found himself pounding the pavement on a nightly basis in search of steady work and, while he never starved he began (by the estimations of some) to stagnate musically. The musicians Alf had left in Rio had continued to innovate in his absence while he himself had had no time for anything more than the work required to earn his daily wages. By the time Alf recorded his first full-length LP (“Rapaz De Bem”) in 1961 his songs had begun to sound stale.Castro 2000, p. 227. That same year Alf, who had never been fond of the term Bossa Nova, and had always tried to distance himself from the connotations the title entailed, declined an invitation to play at Carnegie Hall's historic Bossa Nova Festival. Alf's decision not to attend the aforementioned festival marks a decisive point in his professional history. After 1961, very little was heard from Alf, although he continued to produce albums infrequently throughout the 60s and early 70s, many of which display a sound very similar to that which was displayed on “Rapaz De Bem.” The rest of Alf's career would be spent in São Paulo, collaborating with other artists from time to time, occasionally embarking on solo recording projects, and earning most of his living from his performances in the clubs of São Paulo. Alf would eventually gain employment at a local conservatory of music.Rohter 2010, par. 10 Death Johnny Alf died on March 4, 2010, in Santo Andre, Brazil (just outside São Paulo, his home of the past fifty years) of complications caused by prostate cancer. He left no immediate survivors.Rohter 2010, pars. 1, 11 Music Alf's first recordings (“Falseta” and “De cigarro em cigarro”) were similar rhythmically and structurally to the well-known samba-cançãos of the day, they differed only in their harmonic richness and their melodies, both of which aspects were heavily influenced by American jazz styles and improvisations of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Alf's live playing at the Plaza Hotel was heavily influenced by jazz and “stamped with the imprimatur of George Shearing [and] Lennie Tristano”. New York Times columnist Larry Rohter relates, on behalf of Alf's music, that it possessed “a light and airy feeling that expressed the optimism and joie de vivre that Brazilians think of as among their defining national traits”.Rohter 2010, par. 9. Alf has said of his own music: “I always played in my own style […] I had the idea of joining Brazilian music with jazz. I try to bring everything together to achieve an agreeable result”.Rohter 2010, par. 8. Legacy Much conjecture surrounds the significance of Alf's role in the development of the Bossa Nova style. Many believe the title ‘Father of Bossa Nova’ to be hyperbolic while others believe firmly that Alf's earliest recordings (“Falceta”, “Rapaz de Bem”, etc.) paved the way for the entire stylistic shift that became Bossa Nova. While we cannot lay to rest these disagreements we can say confidently that Johnny Alf was, in his endeavor to mix traditional Brazilian music with American jazz, a sound innovator, and a great influence and inspiration to his peers, some of whom would go on to acquire fame under the heading Bossa Nova. “From him I learned all of the modern harmonies that Brazilian music began to use in the bossa nova, samba-jazz and instrumental songs” said pianist and arranger João Donato, “He opened the doors for us with his way of playing piano, with its jazz influence. When my generation arrived, he had already planted the seeds”Rohter 2010, par. 5. added guitarist and composer Carlos Lyra.

It is at the junction of the Épinay-Villetaneuse–Le Tréport-Mers railway and the Pierrelaye–Creil railway. The station is served by trains of the Transilien line H and the TER Hauts-de- France (Paris-Nord – Beauvais). Since it is the last station before Picardy, the STIF fare structures no longer apply beyond it except on trains linking Pontoise and Creil. In 2002, the number of passengers per day was between 2,500 and 7,500. History Entrance Persan-Beaumont is located on the original Paris–Lille railway line, that was opened on 20 June 1846 by Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord (Nord Railway Company). This line passed along the Montmorency Valley (Ermont-Eaubonne), and headed towards the Northeast at Saint-Ouen-l'Aumône, continuing through the Oise valley. In 1859, a more direct line along Chantilly was opened, bypassing Persan-Beaumont. The Chemin de fer du Nord opened the line between Épinay and Persan-Beaumont via Montsoult on 5 April 1877, thus creating a direct link between Paris and Beauvais, and further to Le Tréport.Michel Rival, Le Refoulons, ou, Le chemin de fer d'Enghien à Montmorency: petite histoire d'une grande ligne, 1866–1954, Paris: Valhermeil, 1989, , p. 248. The present station is the third built on the site. The first, which dated to the opening of the line, was destroyed by bombing in August 1944. It was replaced in 1955 by a building that proved inadequate, which was in turn replaced by the present station when the Paris – Beauvais line was electrified.La gare de Persan-Beaumont avant 1944 , valmondois.fr, retrieved 29 June 2010 The original station Located at the junction of several important lines: * Paris-Nord via Montsoult-Maffliers * Paris-Nord via Valmondois and Méry-sur-Oise * Paris-Nord via Valmondois and Pontoise * Beauvais and Le Tréport * Creil and Northern France The station was equipped with a roundhouse from 1917 on. 35 locomotives were maintained there, including 29 for suburban service and 4 for shunting. There were numerous employees both attached to the maintenance facility and staffing trains. The maintenance facility worked in tandem with the Joncherolles depot at Villetaneuse to maintain the steam locomotives on the suburban network serving Paris-Nord. In the final years of steam service, a pool of 141 TC locomotives were used, with two locomotives specifically assigned one each to Joncherolles and the other to Beaumont. In 1968, the pool locomotives of the two depots pulled 264 daily trains for a monthly service distance of between 240,000 and 265,000 km. In 1967, they covered 2,838,000 km.Didier Leroy and Paul-Henri Bellot, Paris Nord et sa banlieue, Paris: Vie du Rail, 2009, The steam maintenance facilities have been demolished and replaced by a carpark.

The Studio vol 12 (1898) Tea Cosy designed by Jessie Newbery and Bella Rowat from The Studio vol 15 (1899) Jessie Newbery (28 May 1864 – 27 April 1948) was a Scottish artist and embroiderer. She was one of the artists known as the Glasgow Girls. Newbery also created the Department of Embroidery at the Glasgow School of Art where she was able to establish needlework as a form of unique artistic design. She married the director of the Glasgow School of Art, Francis Newbery, in 1889.  Early life and education  Born Jessie Wylie Rowat in Paisley, she was the daughter of Margaret Downie Hill and William Rowat, a forward-thinking shawl manufacturer. A visit to Italy when Newbery was aged 18 stimulated a lifelong interest in textiles and other decorative arts. She enrolled as a student at the Glasgow School of Art in 1884.  Work and career  Sensim Sed cushion cover of embroidered linen with silks, designed and embroidered by Jessie Newbery ca 1900. The stitches emphasise the simple structure of the design. The colours, texture, lettering and stylised rose is characteristic of the Glasgow School. The cushion cover is inscribed with a Latin poem that remarks upon the passage of time and encourages daily work. Newbery became an accomplished and original embroideress, though embroidery was not formally taught at the Glasgow School of Art. The profile of embroidery was raised at the school through the work of the \\"Four\\" – Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Herbert McNair, Frances Macdonald and Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh – who all designed embroidery as part of their decorative schemes. Newbery started the first needlework and embroidery class at the school in 1894. Newbery was noticed for embroidery designs that were quite different from the output of the Royal School of Art Needlework. Her works had a hint of seventeenth-century crewel-work and her designs featured floral forms with angular stems and a strong decorative quality. She also imported the new Glasgow style lettering into her embroidery designs. Students who took part on her embroidery classes did so as an extra subject, or because they hoped to earn a livelihood as professional embroidery workers. At the turn of the century the Scottish Education Department issued guidance which envisaged embroidery as an important part of the national school curriculum. Hence women teachers attended Newbery's classes as part of their teaching qualification. Newbery was considered an \\"enthusiastic teacher and encouraged a strong sense of design in her pupils' work.\\" She opened the doors to women students with a generous admission policy and a reformed curriculum. Keen to promote embroidery as a form of art for all levels in society and for men and women, Newbery established an Embroidery Department and Saturday classes, attended by over 100 women, at the Glasgow School of Art. Newbery was careful in her choice of colour and materials. She preferred to use a lighter palette than was traditional, focusing on light purples, greens, blues and pink. She also encouraged the use of \\"unusual techniques such as needle weaving\\" and included additions like beads, ribbons and card as well as contrasting hemming, Newbery felt that design, in addition to utility, was important in her work. Her approach to design was egalitarian: \\"I believe that nothing is common or unclean: that the design and decoration of a pepper pot is as important in its degree, as the conception of a cathedral.\\" She got noted for her \\"materialism, her commitment to socialism and her contribution to community.\\" And her approach was commended in The Studio magazine, for its innovation and taking everyday things and \\"seeks to make them beautiful as well as useful\\". Newbery incorporated elements of the emerging Glasgow Style in her design works and in turn shaped the decorative style of the movement. She is credited as the inventor of the angular Glasgow rose, which has been likened to a cabbage. Together with her husband she promoted a range \\"novel genres\\", such as metalwork, glasswork, pottery and woodcarving, at the Glasgow School of Art. The Glasgow Boys had emerged as the pioneers of a revolt against the Scottish artistic establishment and its grip on institutions. In this spirit Jessie and Francis Newbery established the Glasgow Girls as a group that embraced a range of genres and placed arts and crafts on an equal footing with other works of art. She taught dress design alongside embroidery. She thought clothing should be practical and took an interest in rational dress, while also believing that clothes should be beautiful. This approach to women's clothing was considered \\"avant-garde\\" and \\"radical\\". Newbery first experimented with a \\"Renaissance flavor\\" in her own clothing, often choosing looser styles, materials such as silk velvets and lightweight wools which she embroidered herself. Additionally, she held classes in mosaics, from 1896 to 1898, in enamels from 1895 to 1899, and also in book decoration in 1899.  Support for women's suffrage  Newbery was an active member of the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists. Along with sponsoring many friends and students for membership, she also provided exhibition and studio space for women artists. She was keen for woman to have more of a place in society, and was an active member of the Women's Social and Political Union, organising the \\"Arts and Curios\\" stall at the Grand Suffrage Bazaar held at St Andrews Halls, Glasgow in 1910. She helped to make materials for related movements, such as the suffrage banners, along with Ann Macbeth, including one with embroidered signatures of 80 force-fed Holloway prisoners, which was in the mass suffragette procession from 'Prison to Citizenship' in London, 1911.  Later life  After an illness Newbery retired in 1908 as Head of Embroidery at the Glasgow School of Art and was succeeded by Ann Macbeth, a former student of hers who had been her assistant since 1901. Newbery did continue to create her own work and showed her embroidery in exhibitions, including one at the Louvre, Paris. In 1911 she took part in the planning for the Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry, on the committee of the Decorative and Fine Arts Section. Newbery died in Corfe Castle, Dorset, where she and her husband, Francis Newbery, had gone to live after retirement.

History In late 2001, Matthew A. O'Malley and James Horan proposed Park Grill and Park Cafe to \\"provide both white-tablecloth meals and picnic-hamper fare for visitors in Millennium Park\\". In 2003, the Chicago Park District awarded a 20-year contract to run the Park Grill to a partnership, including several of Mayor Richard M. Daley's friends and neighbors. Background of managing partners The current managing partners of the Park Grill are O'Malley and Horan. O'Malley, who once worked for the U.S. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, runs the re-purposed firehouse, Chicago Firehouse Restaurant, which is located around the corner from the home of Mayor Richard M. Daley, who has been a steady customer. The son of Alderman Edward Vrdolyak has also been a business partner with O'Malley. Matthew O'Malley and his brother Paul were picked to run the Clock Tower Cafe at the Sydney Marovitz Golf Course in Lincoln Park on the Chicago lakefront. James Horan is a restaurant owner and caterer. He is president of Blue Plate Catering, which runs a cafe at Gallery 37, an after-school program created and fostered by Mayor Daley's wife, Maggie Daley. Background of investors Many investors are linked to Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. O'Malley obtained commitments from over 80 prospective Park Grill investors, including some of Mayor Daley's friends and neighbors. Each share of the restaurant cost investors $200,000. Among the investors are Daley's friend Fred Barbara, a nephew of the late Chicago Alderman Fred Roti. Barbara has ties to the Hired Truck Program scandal and the blue bag recycling controversy. Other investors include relatives of Daley's political adviser Timothy Degnan, two neighbors of the mayor, Ray Chin, an O'Hare Airport contractor, and Rick Simon, a controversial figure who runs a janitorial business and sits on the board of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau. Also among the investors was Daley's cousin Theresa E. Mintle, then the Chicago Transit Authority's director of governmental affairs and former congressman Morgan F. Murphy, who has had business dealings with convicted labor union official John Serpico. Among the vendors for Park Grill was an architectural metal company owned by the son of then Chicago Alderman Burton Natarus (42nd). Contract award process O'Malley's and two other groups submitted proposals to run the restaurant in September 2001. The Park Grill group's proposal was twice as long as the other two but, technically, promised the Park District the lowest revenues. By the end of the year, O'Malley's team had been selected to run the restaurant, souvenir and concession stands, and a cafe in the new Millennium Park. The Park Grill contract was signed February 11, 2003. The contract requires that Park Grill to pay a percent of net sales and an additional fee of $275,000 per year, but the latter was not due until the Park Grill recouped half its build-out costs. As part of its deal, the Park District pays for water, gas, and garbage collection at Park Grill. The garbage pickup costs taxpayers about $245,000 annually. Park District project manager's relationship with contractor The Park District team, including an outside consultant, spent 18 months negotiating a contract with O'Malley's group. During that time, Laura Foxgrover, a top official in the Park District department directly overseeing the deal, gave birth to O'Malley's child. Prior to working for the Park District, Foxgrover had been an employee of O'Malley as director of operations at the Chicago Firehouse Restaurant. Foxgrover held the title \\"senior project manager\\" at the Park District at an annual salary of $94,000. In May 2002, Foxgrover wrote a memo recusing herself from negotiations, without saying why, and never told her superiors she was carrying O'Malley's child. The girl was born in September, 2002. Foxgrover remained involved in the Millennium Park restaurant after she recused herself from contract negotiations in May, 2002. In October 2003, Foxgrover spoke in favor of the restaurant getting a liquor license before a Chicago City Council committee while O'Malley owed Foxgrover at least $5,000. On the same day, Foxgrover worked to get O'Malley's Clock Tower Cafe a liquor license. In one July 2003 e-mail, Foxgrover, then the acting director of park services, said that if O'Malley's contractor had any questions for the Park District, she will be the point person. In August 2003, Horan sent out an e-mail mentioning a discussion Horan had with Foxgrover, in which Horan asked Foxgrover if the Park District would waive a form of insurance on the restaurant's construction. A provision in the Park Grill contract allows the restaurant to arrange a series of summer concerts on the Millennium Park ice-skating rink, drawing crowds that bolster food and drink sales. In summer 2004, O'Malley and his partners asked Clear Channel-owned WNUA Radio to conduct the concerts. In February 2005, Foxgrover led a five-member Park District committee that chose Clear Channel over JAM Productions to operate the new concert venue at Northerly Island on the former site of Meigs Field. Foxgrover was the subject of an ethics investigation. An ethics officer for the Chicago Board of Ethics concluded that Foxgrover did not violate the district's ethics ordinance and should be allowed to keep her $90,000-a-year job as the Park District's director of development. By 2008, Foxgrover had left the Park District to work for O'Malley's restaurant management company. Exemption from property tax On March 16, 2005, Cook County Assessor, James Houlihan's office sent Horan and O'Malley a letter notifying Park Grill that it was being assessed at $502,550 and that it would be sent a bill in the fall for 2004 property taxes. On August 5, 2005, Horan and O'Malley filed a lawsuit against the assessor, asking that a judge prohibit the county from imposing property taxes. The owners asserted that their contract to run Park Grill was a property tax exempt concessionaire agreement and not a taxable lease. The state's attorney's office, which defended the assessor in the case, said \\"our position is that the Park Grill is a leaseholder and as a leaseholder they are subject to taxes.\\" In 2009, an appellate court affirmed the circuit court's finding that the agreement to run Park Grill was not a lease but a license. In December, 2010 the Illinois Supreme Court with a 4-3 vote affirmed the lower court decisions maintaining the Park Grill's \\"agreement with the Park District created an untaxable license as opposed to a taxable lease\\" to do business. Daley administration response Mayor Richard M. Daley criticized the Park Grill deal, blaming Chicago's Corporation Counsel Mara Georges, saying that lawyers for the city and the Chicago Park District erred and that the city wanted to renegotiate the pact. \\"Lawyers do make mistakes,\\" Daley said. \\"That's what it was. ... It's embarrassing to them. Yes it is - the corporation counsel and the Park District counsel.\\" Chicago Park District Superintendent Tim Mitchell said the Park District also wanted to renegotiate the contract. In a February 9, 2005 letter to O'Malley and Horan, Georges warned that the concession agreement \\"does not authorize your occupation of the Park Grill facilities\\" because the city owns the land, and City Hall should have been party to the original agreement when it was not. On February 11, 2005, Daley asked state lawmakers to impose tougher penalties for defrauding tax payers, and was questioned by reporters about why the Park Grill had not paid any property taxes and gets free gas, water and garbage pick-up. Erma Tranter, president of the Friends of the Parks watchdog group, speaking at a Park District Board of Commissioners meeting, questioned why the Park Grill contract had yet to be renegotiated 11 months after Mayor Daley vowed to do so. The Chicago Sun-Times dubbed the Park Grill the \\"Clout Cafe\\" and included the contract award process in a year-end review of 2005 Daley administration scandals. Profitability The grand opening was set for November 24, 2003. In its first year of operation, Park Grill paid $162,656.72 in rent. The Park Grill began making money for its investors in 2006, its third year of operation, when investors split $527,250 in profits. In 2008, the Park Grill was named one of the top 100 highest-grossing independent restaurants in the U.S., serving approximately 300,000 meals and grossing approximately million in sales, making it the seventh largest independent restaurant in terms of sales in Chicago in 2007, according to Restaurants & Institutions magazine. The Park Grill remains exempt from property taxes, and the contract has not been renegotiated.  Emanuel administration response  Daley announced he would not seek a seventh term, and in the final months of Daley's last term, the owners of the Park Grill, including O'Malley and Barbara were reported as interested in selling. Daley's successor, Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed Theresa E. Mintle, one of the Park Grill investors, as his $174,996-a-year chief of staff. Three days after Emanuel took office and Mintle started work as his top aide, Mintle transferred her financial stake in the restaurant to her husband. On December 1, 2011, the Emanuel administration sued the Park Grill operating company, and the Chicago Park District, asking a judge to end the generous 2003 concession agreement with the Chicago Park District. The city wants the Park Grill operator, which is trying to sell the restaurant, to pay more for the privilege of operating at the park. On December 15, 2011 the Park Grill operators filed a counter suit against the City and Park District. In June, 2013 O'Malley and Foxgrover were married by Illinois Supreme Court Justice Anne M. Burke. By October, 2013 the City had paid more than $749,000 and the Park District more than $585,000 in legal fees. Deposed in August, 2013 in the lawsuit, Daley responded \\"I don't recall\\" 139 times. \\"In the Park Grill situation, city taxpayers were taken advantage of. They did not get a fair pricing for that property,\\" Emanuel said. Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mark Brown summarized \\"the Park Grill story\\" as > Guy meets girl. Guy owns a restaurant. Girl handles valuable Park District > restaurant concession. Guy and girl make a baby together. Guy gets > concession deal. Mayor knows nothing. Nothing! But a bunch of his pals > invest in what city lawyers later call a \\"sweetheart deal.\\" On September 24, 2015, the court ruled in favor of the Park Grill, rejecting the Emanuel administration's claims that the contract was invalid. Menu The menu is traditional American food with international influences. Zagats describes the cuisine as New American. Bernard Laskowski, formerly of Chicago restaurants Marche and mk, is the executive chef. The Park Cafe, adjacent to the Park Grill, offers takeout food such as salads and sandwiches. Critical reviews Outdoor seating at the Park Grill Plaza is highly regarded for its views. The restaurant is notable for its views, its location, and its cuisine, especially its hamburgers. Zagat lists Park Grill as one of the \\"choice outdoor spots in town.\\" New City Chicago magazine named it one of the top 100 essential restaurants in the city, urging, \\"Ignore the scandal over sweetheart deals with the city for a moment and consider this: Park Grill sits in the hottest spot in the city today, if not in America.\\" In the 2006/07 and 2008/09 editions, Zagats respondents ranked it among the best of Chicago in the \\"Outdoors\\" and \\"Views\\" categories and lauded its fireplace. Park Grill hamburgers achieved high citywide rankings in several publications, including best burgers in Time Out Chicago (2005), Chicago Magazine (2008) and Citysearch (2008). The Unofficial Guide to Chicago points out the \\"spectacular view of the Chicago skyline, fronted by the ice rink at Millennium Park.\\" Fodor's Chicago 2010 says \\"Location trumps service at Park Grill, where a seat on the patio in summer, in full view of Millennium Park, is among the best in the city. Sadly, the waitstaff lapses ...\\" Review also online The National Geographic's website's Chicago Walking Tour: Millennium and Grant Parks recommends the Park Grill as it \\"allows you to admire the surrounding architecture passively.\\" The restaurant was noted as one of the \\"99 Best of Chicago,\\" named as one of three under the category of \\"Best Restaurants with a View\\" in Night+Day Chicago. The location, \\"under 'the bean' or next to a swarm of ice skaters, all convenient to the Loop,\\" was cited by Crain's Chicago Business as a reason for including Park Grill as one of Chicago's best restaurants for business dining in 2010.

It occurred on the very first day of the Pacific War, 7 December 1941, not long after the major attack on Pearl Harbor. Two Imperial Japanese destroyers bombarded Sand Island of Midway Atoll. The Japanese successfully damaged the U.S. Marine base before being engaged by American shore batteries and forced to flee. Background Before the beginning of the Pacific War, American marines were stationed on Midway and had established a small base with the ability to service land, sea and air forces. The marines also constructed all of the bases' fortifications; civilian contractors constructed the buildings. They used 5 inch (127 mm) guns, built in 1916, and 3 inch (76 mm) guns of 1921 to defend the islands. Fortifications dating back to 1905 were also manned. Not only were Pearl Harbor, Wake Island and the Philippines attacked in the opening phase of the conflict, but Midway was shelled as well by two Japanese destroyers, and . Bombardment A shore gun on Sand Island. The two destroyers were part of the Japanese fleet that had just attacked Pearl Harbor. Overall, the unit was under the command of Captain Ohishi Kaname, though Lieutenant Commander Yoshitake Uesugi skippered Ushio and Lieutenant Commander Hiroshi Uwa skippered the other destroyer. The engagement began at 09:31 and lasted 54 minutes. The American command, communications and power plant building was damaged by a shell, which deflected off an adjacent laundromat. Battery \\"H\\" commander—First Lieutenant George H. Cannon—was hit by shrapnel in the pelvis while inside the command building. By this time, the communications were down from enemy fire, so Lieutenant Cannon refused medical attention until he was assured that the communications were restored to the post and the wounded marines around him were evacuated. Ushio from the side. By the time Cannon received aid from a medic, it was too late; he perished due to blood loss. For Cannon's \\"distinguished conduct in the line of his profession, extraordinary courage, and disregard of his own condition\\", he received the first Medal of Honor issued to a U.S. Marine for actions in the Second World War. A street on Sand Island was named after Cannon and continues to be known by that name, a 1943 destroyer escort——was also named after him. Six Japanese rounds struck and entered the main PBY Catalina hangar and destroyed a PBY inside; the Pilot and Fireman were killed (see next paragraph), while other civilians inside survived without injury. The hospital was hit also and burned. All of the damaged buildings were quickly rebuilt by the civilian contractors. Shell craters littered the ground all around the buildings of Sand Island. The Marines did not use aircraft against the attacking Japanese. They did use their artillery batteries and managed to damage one of the destroyers when they came within range. The other destroyer quickly laid a smokescreen and the two vessels retired. Four men died on Midway that morning: Navy Ensign Donald J. Kraker and Fireman Second Class Ralph E. Tuttle and Marines Lieutenant Cannon and Private First Class Elmer R. MorrellWorld War 2 - United States Navy at War - UNITED STATES NAVY CASUALTIES. Several others were injured. Navy Chief mechanics engineer John J. Szajkowski survived with another sailor by jumping in the water when they saw the planes coming for the hangar. Japanese casualties are unknown. Ushio fired 109 rounds and Sazanami fired 193. Aftermath In February 1942, a Japanese submarine bombarded the atoll. In June 1942, the Battle of Midway was won by American forces. The Marines by that time had received reinforcements, both personnel and some newer and bigger guns, all of which were used by the Marine garrison when they engaged attacking Japanese A6M2 Zeros in June 1942.

Since the late 1990s, the company has been developing a retractable pontoon system for the float plane industry, which has been patented as Retractable Amphibious Pontoon Technology or RAPT.http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/aviation_week/on_space_and_technology/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&plckBlogPage;=BlogViewPost&newspaperUserId;=a68cb417-3364-4fbf-a9dd-4feda680ec9c&plckPostId;=Blog%3Aa68cb417-3364-4fbf-a9dd-4feda680ec9cPost%3Acd60a1cb-1736-443f-bada-1db8c2f8aee9&plckScript;=blogScript&plckElementId;=blogDest RAPT system The retractable float concept aims to reduce aerodynamic drag by folding the floats into a streamlined pannier under the fuselage of the aircraft. The reduction in drag improves performance of the aircraft and reduces its operating cost, such as fuel consumption. Reduction in drag also increases the range, payload, speed, and productivity of the aircraft. The drag reduction occurs due to the reduction of surface area exposed to the airstream and concealing the hydrodynamic features of the floats.CFD Analysis of the Tigerfish Retractable Float System on a DHC-Twin Otter It is designed as a retrofit, and is potentially capable of application to any existing aircraft. The technology has been applied on a one-sixth scale Cessna Caravan for concept-proving. Technical details As of 2010, Dornier 228 NG is the first proposed aircraft to be retrofitted for the RAPT system, besides the small-scale Cessna. The retractable float system can be used in a wide range of aircraft including regional aircraft, utility aircraft, executive aircraft, military transports, VLJs, and UAVs. The University of Adelaide, with assistance of the South Australian Government,http://www.innovation.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/17053/Case_Study_Book.pdf has performed CFD analysis and other studies on the DHC-6 Twin Otter showing that the RAPT system would result in a significant cost benefit. Unlike traditional floats, RAPT pontoons are made of lightweight composite materials, but suffer additional mass penalties due to the electric, hydraulic and structural systems required to retract the pontoons. Total mass penalty has been estimated at for a Dornier 228 NG variant.

Hurwitz graduated from Barnard College in New York City with a Bachelor of Arts. She was a student at Midreshet Lindenbaum in Talpiot, Israel, a post-high school religious seminary, not degree-granting. She went to the Drisha Institute in New York City as part of Drisha's three-year Scholar's Circle Program. Drisha is a women's religious studies institution. She has a certificate from Drisha. Hurwitz has a rabbinic degree issued by Rabbi Avi Weiss in a private 5-year study program; Controversy regarding honorific Rabba  In June 2009, Weiss ordained Sara Hurwitz with the title \\"maharat\\" (an acronym of manhiga hilkhatit rukhanit Toranit) rather than \\"Rabbi\\". In February 2010, Weiss announced that he was changing Maharat to a more familiar-sounding title \\"Rabba\\". The goal of this shift was to clarify Hurwitz's position as a full member of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale rabbinic staff. The change was criticised by both Agudath Yisrael and the Rabbinical Council of America, who called the move \\"beyond the pale of Orthodox Judaism\\". Weiss announced amidst criticism that the term \\"Rabba\\" would not be used anymore for his future students. Nevertheless, in 2015, Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the Yeshivat Maharat, which Weiss founded. The same year Lila Kagedan was ordained as Rabbi by that same organization, making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi. Hurwitz continues to use the title Rabba and is considered by some to be the first female Orthodox rabbi.https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q;=cache:KCRr-i6GiWEJ:columbusjudaism.org/wp- content/uploads/2010/08/Bulletin-for-website- May-2012.pdf+%22sally+priesand%22+%22first+reform+woman+rabbi%22&hl;=en≷=us&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEESiSpc6F3OkisK4Sn_iip26YBRs9D0CBa9i6tdy0Tu- VJRDyMnlg84qQL1dLCGZG6YPhXvUm4AjaDkZr86Nk2vaNNsCN2e_PvlILFbeJR0eckiOekxNRor3PReBXOo1SwYH4msFp&sig;=AHIEtbRDDbGrmJUgRyB44ggo5-Ryvj3AAQ Interdenominational meetings On December 6, 2010, Hurwitz met for the first time with Sally Priesand, the first Reform female rabbi, Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, the first Reconstructionist female rabbi, and Amy Eilberg, the first Conservative female rabbi, at Temple Reyim in Newton, Massachusetts.

The Council stressed the importance of continuing the peace process initiated by the Addis Ababa agreement, welcoming the efforts of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), Arab League and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. The international community would help the country achieve peace, but ultimately it was the Somali people who were responsible for the reconciliation and reconstruction of their country. Meanwhile, the improvement of the situation with United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) was welcomed, particularly with the eradication of starvation, establishment of numerous district councils, opening of schools and the resumption of normal life for most Somali people. At the same time, the Council recognised the need to continue efforts to achieve reconciliation and establish democracy, and in this respect all parties were urged to show their political will to achieve the aforementioned. Concern was then expressed at reports of violence in the capital Mogadishu, violence against UNOSOM II and the lack of law enforcement and legal institutions in the country. The Council reiterated its request to the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to assist with the re-establishment of the Somali police and the restoration of peace, stability and order. The improvement of the conditions and the beginning of the rebuilding of the country were praised, while attacks on UNOSOM II were condemned, stating that the perpetrators would be held individually responsible. The Council affirmed the importance it attached to the UNOSOM II mission including facilitation of humanitarian assistance, restoration of law and order and national reconciliation in a free, democratic and sovereign Somalia so that it could complete its mission by March 1995. The Secretary-General was asked to draw a detailed plan concerning the future strategy of the mission and redouble his efforts to achieve reconciliation at all levels. Member States were invited to help by staffing UNOSOM II positions. The Security Council agreed to the recommendations of the Secretary-General on the re-establishment of the police and the legal and penal system, urging immediate steps to implement them. In this regard, the Secretary-General's decision to convene a meeting of Member States interested in assisting in this process was welcomed. Finally, the Secretary-General was also asked to ensure that the Somali police and legal institutions would continue until December when more financial resources would become available from Member States.

Thornycroft & Company of Woolston, Southampton. She was designed to carry 500 passengers and cargo between Penzance, Cornwall, to the offshore Isles of Scilly.Description on Hearts of Oak The Penzance/Isles of Scilly Mail Packets. Serving the Isles of Scilly The ship was ordered on 18 March 1954 at a contract price of £250,000 (equivalent to £ as of ), planned as a replacement for the first Scillonian which had been in continuous service since 1926. The new ship was laid down on 25 March 1955, completed on 15 November 1955 and christened by the Duchess of Gloucester. The second Scillonian was powered by two 6-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines (manufactured by Ruston & Hornsby) which propelled two three-blade screws, giving the ship a maximum speed of 15.5 knots. The new passenger ferry made her first trip to the Isles of Scilly on 23 March 1956, sailing from Southampton to St Mary's. On her arrival, critics found the second Scillonian \\"too big, they will never hold her, not suitable or not as good a sea boat as the old boat\\" (the same had happened when the first Scillonian went into service in 1926 and would happen again with Scillonian III in 1977).\\"Scillonian III Back in Service after £1,700,000 Refit\\" in Scilly up to Date, issue 120 (April 1999), accessed 2011-08-16 Like her predecessor, the second Scillonian operated mainly between the Isles of Scilly and Penzance, although she sometimes diverted to Falmouth or St Ives in bad weather. A frequent traveller aboard the ship was Harold Wilson who had a holiday home in the Isles of Scilly. Between 1964 and 1966 she was joined on her route by the Queen of the Isles. Scillonian was eventually replaced by Scillonian III in May 1977, and was sold to P & A Campbell.The Scillonian (II)'s history on www.simplonpc.co.uk. Later history MV Syllingar in Kirkwall, 5 August 1985 P & A Campbell renamed her Devonia and she joined the Balmoral, offering coastal cruises around the South Coast. In her first season Devonia deputised for Balmoral on the Bristol Channel, and ran on the Thames. P&A; Campbell hoped to use her freight capacity to serve Lundy, work eventually taken over by the Oldenburg. Over the winter of 1977/1978, Devonia was chartered for oil rig ferry work at Loch Kishorn, before returning to the Bristol Channel. P & A Campbell ceased operations in 1980, after which the ship was acquired by Torbay Seaways and renamed Devoniun in 1982. She operated trips to the Channel Islands and local excursions from Torquay. In 1984 she was sold to Norse Atlantic Ferries, and renamed Syllingar after arriving in the Orkney Islands in November 1984. She made up to two return trips each week between Kirkwall, Westray and Scalloway, plus additional cruises to Foula and Fair Isle. Financial problems forced the service to cease in August 1985. Following her period as Syllingar the ship was renamed Remvi in 1986, and ran across the Adriatic for Hellenic Cruising Holidays until 1989. As Africa Queen she was operated by J.A.R. Atlantic Ocean Ltd of Belize from 1989 to 1997 and sailed off West Africa. The latter company renamed her the Princess Eliana in 1997 before her final sale in 1998 as Olga J to the Cypriot Greek ship-owner, John Christodoulo, who was director of Asterias Maritime, a company registered in Belize.

In an 1858 issue of Building News similarly negative sentiments were expressed of \\"those juvenile highwaymen who, broom in hand, take possessions of our crossings and level black mail upon the public in general, and timid females in particular.\\"Mark Bills, 'William Powell Frith's 'The Crossing Sweeper': An Archetypal Image of Mid-Nineteenth Century London', The Burlington Magazine, May 2004, pp. 301-3. Frith's sweeper is ostentatiously deferential, while also pushing close to the woman, setting extremes of poverty and wealth up against one another, a theme the artist explored in other works such as Poverty and Wealth, For Better, For Worse and The Derby Day.

Frith created several copies in the 1890s, at a time in his career when much of his output comprised variations on his famous works. An 1893 version covers the brief glimpse of red stocking seen in the original with a lace undergarment.

Peach Point Plantation is an official historic landmark of Texas located in Jones Creek, but from the 1830s through the Civil War, Peach Point was an agricultural business located in Jones Creek. Peach Point was also the place Stephen F. Austin called home.http://www.munsons-of- texas.net/c11.html As proprietor of Peach Point Plantation, Stephen S. was responsible for agricultural planning, together with financial and legal decisions related to the business as well as the homestead. Stephen S. was advised by Mordello Munson. Stephen S. opted to focus on sugar cane growth in the 1850s. In the process of decades of responsible management and communication, Stephen S. received and cataloged original source papers and manuscripts of early Texas history. James F. and Stephen S. Perry Papers Named in part for Stephen Samuel Perry, whose grandson by exactly the same nameNotes from talk by Light T. Cummins on January 28, 2010, Brazoria County Historical Museum, Angleton Texas donated them, one of the key sets of historical accounts of early Texas history is kept at the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin. These are called the James F. and Stephen S. Perry Papers, 1785-1942. Stephen Samuel Perry maintained extensive records of communications related to the management of not only the plantation, but also land deeds, growth, and the very settlement of Texas in the 1800s. In fact, the archives and manuscripts presented to the school were so extensive that they are officially measured as 13 feet, 9 inches in width.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~txgalves/bibliographies.html In fact, virtually all books related to Stephen F. Austin or settlement of Texas footnote or reference the James F. and Stephen S. Perry Papers. As described by the library catalog, \\"Papers of Perry and his son Stephen Samuel Perry and their extended families cover significant events in Texas history from the early years of colonization up to the twentieth century. Collection relates to Stephen F. Austin's land holdings, James Franklin Perry's mercantile business and other family-related business enterprises, the establishment and operation of Peach Point Plantation, and the daily concerns of paternalistic slaveholders who found it difficult to make ends meet raising cotton, corn, and sugar; to educate their children where there were no public schools; and to handle chronic health problems. The papers accentuate the contrast between life in various sections of the United States since the Perrys traveled for business, health reasons, and pleasure; attended schools in Ohio, Connecticut, and Virginia; and corresponded with and visited relatives in the northeast as well as Ohio, Iowa, and Missouri.\\" The \\"James F.\\" in the title refers to James Franklin Perry, second husband to Emily Austin Perry. James and Emily Austin Perry Papers Professor of History, Light Townsend Cummins, of Austin College, the official Historian of the State of Texas at the time of this writing, points out that despite her important participation in and contributions to Texas history, there is no collection of letters archived under Emily's name; rather, the collection archived in the 1930s was titled for her husband and son, \\"the James F. and Stephen S. Perry Papers.\\" Cummins, who has reviewed the papers housed at the Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin, notes that this collection includes \\"as much of Emily's letters, documents, and papers as those of her husband and son.\\" Cumins points out that the archive was named in the 1930s, and were they named under archiving standards in 2009, they would very likely instead have been called, \\"The James and Emily Austin Perry Papers.\\" Family Stephen is the son of James F. Perry and Emily Austin Perry, and grandson to Moses Austin and Maria Brown Austin, and nephew of Stephen F. Austin. Stephen is the half-brother of Guy Morrison Bryan, William Joel Bryan and Moses Austin Bryan. Stephen attended school taught by Thomas J. Pilgrim. Stephen married Sarah McLean Brown (September 18, 1830 - August 4, 1888) on April 5, 1853.http://www.bchm.org/gene/d0000/g0001600.html#I581 Sarah was born in Delaware, Ohio and died at Peach Point Plantation.

It portrays the Renaissance condottiero Erasmo da Narni, known as \\"Gattamelata\\", who served mostly under the Republic of Venice, which ruled Padua at the time. Description Head of Erasmo da Narni After Erasmo of Narni's death in 1443, according to John Julius Norwich, the Republic of Venice, as a sign of gratitude and respect, paid for a sculpture in his honor. (This payment has been disputed. See below.) Measuring 340 x 390 cm (the base measuring 780 x 410 cm),Sullivan, Mary Ann. \\"Equestrian monument of Erasmo da Narni, called Gattamelata\\". it is the earliest surviving Renaissance equestrian statue and the first to reintroduce the grandeur of Classical equestrian portraiture.Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner’s Art Through the Ages, p 551 After its conception, the statue served as a precedent for later sculptures honoring military heroes.Sullivan, Mary Ann. “Equestrian monument of Erasmo da Narni, called Gattamelata\\". The statue, as were all bronze statues of this time, was made using the lost wax method. The statue sits on a pedestal, and both the condottiero and his horse are portrayed in life size. Instead of portraying the soldier as larger-than-life, as in the classical Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, where a sort of hierarchy of size demonstrates the subject's power, Donatello used emotion, position, and symbolism to convey the same message. Thus, Donatello makes a statement of the power of the real-life individual; he does not need to embellish or make grander whom Gattamelata was – the simple depiction of the real man is enough to convey his power. The pedestal under the horse is composed of two reliefs toward the top with fake doors underneath. The doors symbolize the gates of the underworld, lending the feeling of a tomb, though the monument was never a burial place.Sullivan, Mary Ann. “Equestrian monument of Erasmo da Narni, called Gattamelata.” One relief shows Gattamelata's coat of arms flanked by two putti that are pointing to it. The other relief is of angels displaying battle armor. Style Detail Erasmo da Narni (Gattamelata) sits high on his horse, looking out to the distance. The emotion on his face is serious. Donatello portrays Gattamelata as a composed, alert and watchful leader. The depiction of force of character and the reference to the power of real people flows with the Renaissance themes of individualism and humanism. The horse echoes the alert, self-contained and courageous air of the rider. The realistic depiction of its muscular form reveals the Renaissance concern with anatomical study that was later developed in Leonardo da Vinci's studies for the Sforza equestrian monument. Donatello also conveys Gattamelata's power with symbolism. He commands a powerful horse and both appear ready for battle. The horse's front left hoof rests on an orb, a cannonball, which symbolizes military advances, representing his power of the Venician army. Gattamelata was hired by Venice and made many advances to solidify the \\"terra\\" or earth around Venice for the Venician Government. This statue was raised by his family to honor the General. . This is especially rare and noticeable as Gattamelata was not a head of state.Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner’s Art Through the Ages, p. 551 Gattamelata is portrayed as a warrior figure, carrying a baton symbolising his military leadership and with a lengthy sword. While Gattamelata died in his 70s, Donatello depicts him at the height of his power, further emphasizing his might and abilities. The statue in its context The Equestrian statue of Gattamelata is a sharp departure from earlier, post-Classical equestrian statues, such as the Gothic Bamberg Horseman (c. 1230s). While the Bamberg Horseman depicts a German emperor, it lacks the dimension, power, and naturalism of Gattamelata. While that rider is also in fairly realistic proportion to his horse, he lacks the strength of Gattamelata. The latter is portrayed as a real man, his armor a badge of status; this ruler, however, appears almost deflated, lost in the carefully sculpted drapery that covers him. His power is derived solely from his crown, reflecting the differences that Renaissance individualism produced: here, position – the crown – is what matters, whereas in Gattamelata, it is the individual and his character that matter. A comparison between the sculpture and that of Marcus Aurelius' equestrian statue shows how closely Donatello looked to classical art and its themes. In this depiction of Marcus Aurelius, the emperor dwarfs his horse, dominating it by size. However, the emperor also has a facial expression of dominance and determination. Marcus Aurelius's horse is dressed up, and, while the emperor himself is clad in robes, not armor, he appears both the political and military leader. The attention to the horse's musculature and movement and the realistic depiction of the emperor (forgiving his size) are mirrored in Gattamelata. Also similar is the feeling of grandeur, authority, and power both portraits exude. Another element that Donatello took from ancient sculpture is the trick of adding a support (a sphere) under the raised front leg of the horse, which appears also in the lost Regisole of Pavia, a bronze equestrian statue from either the late Western Roman Empire, the Ostrogothic Kingdom or the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna. In this sculpture a standing dog was used to carry the load under the horseshoe.

It is modeled as a sustainable community. UniverCity has won several awards for sustainable planning and development. It is currently home to over 4000 residents. History The groundwork for UniverCity was laid in 1963, when Arthur Erickson and Geoff Massey submitted their initial plan for Simon Fraser University. Complementing their vision for the mountain-top campus, their plan saw the new university anchoring a dense residential community. It took another 30 years before the implementation of this initial plan would begin with Simon Fraser University agreeing to transfer more than 320 hectares of university-owned land to the City of Burnaby to more than double the size of the Burnaby Mountain Conservation Area. In return, the city approved an Official Community Plan (OCP) in 1996, allowing SFU to begin development of a residential community, later named UniverCity.http://www.univercity.ca/about_us/overview.2.html The OCP had a goal of creating a compact community surrounding the campus to ensure residential expansion that was accessible. The makeup of the neighbourhoods is two districts; with one being to the south and the other to the east of campus. The OCP original concept included provisions for community facilitates such as a school, commercial core, prominent pedestrian paths and biking trails all along campus. In its completion, UniverCity is hoping to accommodate up to 10,000 residents. SFU itself had varying visions regarding the development of such a residential community. It identified two specific aims of constructing UniverCity; to establish a more inclusive community on the mountain with varying options of housing and amenities, as well as to create an Endowment Fund to assist in further teaching and research for the campus. However while the land is fully under SFU ownership, there are serviced and subdivided parcels that are available to builders upon request and a 99-year lease agreement. Present In 2003, Simon Fraser University commenced construction on a new residential and commercial area occupying approximately adjacent to the campus, atop Burnaby Mountain, called UniverCity. The area will contain up to 10,000 residential units in a number of neighbourhoods, along with a new town centre, schools, parks and other amenities. As of March 2015, approximately 4000 people lived in UniverCity. A new elementary school was scheduled to be opened in the fall of 2010 to accommodate families in the area, along with new child-care facilities. A number of new developments have taken place, including the construction of a new supermarket and several residential complexes.https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/news/development-picks-up-at- univercity.shtml UniverCity also prides itself on a sustainability campaign that has support from the Province of British Columbia and the SFU Community Trust. They have partnered with Corix Utilities to develop new and improved sustainable energy systems that aim to provide eco-friendly heat and local hot water for developing housing projects within the community. Projections estimate that this will decrease greenhouse gas emission by over 80 percent with utilities all over the campus and mountain. The project is still in early stages of construction as roughly only four completed buildings have it as of 2015, but all future buildings will incorporate environmental policies and systems. Gordon Harris, FCIPGordon Harris (Vancouver) is the President and CEO of SFU Community Trust, the organization that oversees development of UniverCity.

For years he was a leading member of the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI), but in 2013 he formed his own party, the Dynamic for the Republic and Recovery (DRD). Early life and education Mampouya was born across the Congo River in Kinshasa in February 1964. He and other nationals of Congo-Brazzaville were expelled from Congo-Kinshasa by its Prime Minister, Moise Tshombé, in July 1964. Thus he grew up in Congo-Brazzaville and attended the Marien Ngouabi University, receiving a law degree in 1992.Mena Lila Antsoutsoula, \\"Portraits de six nouveaux membres du Gouvernement\\" , Le Choc website . Political career An early member of the MCDDI, Mampouya co-founded the MCDDI Youth in 1991, acting as its Secretary for Foreign Relations. Together with six other parties, the MCDDI formed the Union for Democratic Renewal (URD), an opposition coalition, on 27 August 1992; the MCDDI was the leading participant in the coalition,Joachim Emmanuel Goma-Thethet, \\"Alliances in the political and electoral process in the Republic of Congo 1991-97\\", in Liberal Democracy and Its Critics in Africa: Political Dysfunction and the Struggle for Social Progress (2005), ed.

He was also designated as Spokesman of the MCDDI and was placed in charge of the party's communications department, with responsibility for mobilization. During the same period, MCDDI President Bernard Kolélas was Mayor of Brazzaville, and Mampouya was his communications attaché. Under serious pressure as a result of the 1997 civil war, President Pascal Lissouba appointed Kolélas, his old rival, as Prime Minister at the head of a national unity government in September 1997. Mampouya was then appointed as Kolélas' Political Adviser and Spokesman. Lissouba's attempt to secure his position through the formation of a national unity government was unsuccessful, however: the rebel forces loyal to Denis Sassou Nguesso captured Brazzaville in mid-October 1997,Howard W. French, \\"Rebels, Backed by Angola, Take Brazzaville and Oil Port\\", The New York Times, 16 October 1997, page A10. and Mampouya, who had a firm personal loyalty to Kolélas, fled into exile along with the MCDDI President on 14 October 1997. In May 2000, a Congolese court sentenced Kolélas to death in absentia for war crimes.\\"L'Assemblée nationale adopte la loi amnistiant Bernard Kolelas\\" , Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 24 November 2005 .

The National Assembly unanimously adopted a law granting a full amnesty to Kolélas on 23 November 2005, thereby enabling him to resume his place in the nation's political life. Government service In mid-January 2007, Mampouya--acting as the representative of the MCDDI--met with François Ibovi, the Minister of Territorial Administration, to discuss preparations for the 2007 parliamentary election, along with representatives from various other parties.Gankama N'Siah, \\"Le ministre de l'Administration du territoire rencontre les responsables des partis politiques\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 19 January 2007 .

In his constituency, he received 29.79% of the vote in the first round, slightly behind the former warlord and independent candidate Willy Matsanga, who received 30.65% of the vote.\\"Premier tour des législatives, résultat des partielles\\", Congopage website, 23 July 2007 . Since neither of them obtained a first round majority, the two proceeded to a second round in August 2007.Thierry Noungou, \\"Second tour des législatives : Hellot Mampouya met la lutte contre le désœuvrement des jeunes au cœur de ses préoccupations\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 2 August 2007 . During his campaign for the second round, Mampouya vowed that, if elected, he would work energetically to solve his constituency's problems. He particularly focused on the problem of youth unemployment, promising to provide training programs for young people. Mampouya also said that he would work to improve the quality of education for children and provide resources to introduce children to new computer technology. The PCT supported Mampouya in the second round, and Mampouya praised the PCT's commitment to the alliance; he said that the PCT's efforts constituted \\"a model\\" for cooperation between the two parties and expressed optimism regarding the future of the alliance. Nevertheless, Matsanga defeated Mampouya in the second round,\\"La liste complète des députés\\" , Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 11 August 2007 .\\"Les résultats des élections législatives, avant l'examen des contentieux électoraux\\", La Semaine Africaine, No. 2720, 21 August 2007, page 7 . receiving 56.74% of the vote. Despite his defeat in Makélékélé, Mampouya was appointed to the government as Minister of Scientific Research and Technical Innovation on 30 December 2007; along with Guy Brice Parfait Kolélas (Bernard Kolélas' son), he was one of two MCDDI members to be appointed to the government.\\"Formation d'un nouveau gouvernement au Congo\\", Panapress, 31 December 2007 .Marchés tropicaux & méditerranéens, issues 3233-3249 (2008) . Reacting to the appointment, Mampouya described it as \\"the most important of my entire political career\\" and thanked Sassou Nguesso. He took over from Pierre-Ernest Abandzounou at the ministry in January 2008.Roger Ngombé, \\"Ministère de la Recherche scientifique. Hellot Matson Mampouya succède à Pierre Ernest Abandzounou\\" , Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 10 January 2008 . Mampouya then made visits to a large number of research centers in Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville in early February, meeting with the researchers and reviewing their work, as well as their working conditions.Faustin Akono, \\"Hellot Mampouya Matson : « Avec la volonté du président de la République, la recherche donnera plus qu'elle ne donne aujourd'hui »\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 9 February 2008 . The MCDDI held its First Convention on 24-25 May 2008 in Brazzaville. The meeting was notable for designating Brice Parfait Kolélas as the Coordinator of the MCDDI National Executive Bureau and National Secretary for Development Strategies, effectively making him the MCDDI's de facto leader in light of Bernard Kolélas' advanced age and failing health. Mampouya delivered the closing speech at the convention on behalf of Bernard Kolélas, who was present but chose not to give the speech himself.Joël Nsoni, \\"Guy Brice Parfait Kolélas, numéro deux du parti\\" , La Semaine Africaine, number 2,796, 3 June 2008 . As an ally of the PCT, the MCDDI supported Sassou Nguesso's bid for re-election in the July 2009 presidential election and Mampouya worked on his campaign.Willy Mbossa, \\"Élection présidentielle : la direction de campagne de Sassou N'Guesso invite les militants à ne pas céder aux intimidations\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 8 July 2009 . In his capacity as Interim Spokesman of the Government, Mampouya read a statement on 3 July 2009 that constituted a warning to the opposition. In the statement, he criticized some opposition leaders for resorting to \\"bellicose, seditious, dangerous, and misleading\\" rhetoric that could threaten the prevailing \\"climate of peace\\", and he warned them against any actions disturbing public order. However, he also expressed confidence that the election would be conducted \\"in peace and quiet\\".\\"Avant la présidentielle, le gouvernement prévient les \\"perturbateurs\\"\\", AFP, 3 July 2009 . At a rally in Brazzaville on 7 July 2009, Mampouya argued that Sassou Nguesso had concentrated on developing infrastructure during his previous seven years in office and that the infrastructure would facilitate future industrialization. He called on the people to vote for Sassou Nguesso in overwhelming numbers and warned them to be vigilant with regard to \\"troublemakers\\". After winning re-election, Sassou Nguesso moved Mampouya to the post of Minister of Fishing and Aquaculture on 15 September 2009.\\"Gouvernement - La nouvelle équipe compte trente-sept membres\\" , Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 16 September 2009 . Bernard Kolélas died on 13 November 2009. Following his death, Mampouya, as Spokesman of the MCDDI, expressed the commitment of all party members to continuing in his footsteps.Roger Ngombé, \\"Dernier hommage de la République à Bernard Bakana Kolelas\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 21 November 2009 . Guy Brice Parfait Kolélas and Bernard Tchibambélela were considered the main potential successors to Kolélas, while Mampouya reportedly played a \\"balancing\\" role between the two sides.Thierry Noungou, \\"Le Mouvement congolais pour la démocratie et le développement intégral au centre de tous les regards\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 6 January 2010 . Mampouya, still serving as Minister of Fishing and Aquaculture, stood again for the seat representing the fourth constituency of Makélékélé in the July-August 2012 parliamentary election. No candidate received a majority in the first round, leading Mampouya to again face the incumbent, Willy Matsanga, in a second round. However, Mampouya withdrew from the race a few days before the second round was held, reportedly due to concerns that there could be disorder in the constituency.Roger Ngombé, \\"Second tour des législatives : Hellot Matson Mampouya se retire de la course\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 3 August 2012 . Following the 2012 election, Mampouya was moved to the post of Minister of Primary and Secondary Education and Literacy on 25 September 2012.\\"La nouvelle équipe gouvernementale rendue publique le 25 septembre\\" , Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, number 1,584, 26 September 2012 .\\"Remaniement ministériel au Congo-Brazzaville\\", Radio France Internationale, 26 September 2012 . Mampouya and MCDDI leader Guy Brice Parfait Kolélas fell into conflict, and Mampouya eventually decided to create his own political party. He announced the creation of his new party, the Dynamic for the Republic and Recovery (DRD), on 18 May 2013.Cyr Armel Yabbat-Ngo, \\"Hellot Matson Mampouya a créé un parti: la D.r.d\\", La Semaine Africaine, 21 May 2013 . As President of the DRD, Mampouya inaugurated a bridge in the Pool Department, connecting the Goma Tsé-Tsé and Mbanza-Ndounga districts, on 23 March 2014. The party had the bridge built by a private company in order to facilitate trade in the area and help local residents, who had long expressed a need for a bridge.Jean-Jacques Koubemba, \\"Le président de la Dynamique républicaine pour le développement (DRD), Hellot Matson Mapouya, a inauguré le 23 mars à Mayala, village situé à 40 kilomètres de Brazzaville, le pont reliant les districts de Goma Tsé-tsé et de Mbanza- Ndounga\\", ADIAC, 24 March 2014 .

It was the southernmost fort built to defend Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War.  Occupation of Northern Virginia  Following the surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 14, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln declared that \\"an insurrection existed,\\" and called for 75,000 troops to be called up to quash the rebellion. The move sparked resentment in many other southern states, which promptly moved to convene discussions of secession. The Virginia State Convention passed an ordinance of secession and ordered a May 23 referendum to decide whether or not the state should secede from the Union. The U.S. Army responded by creating the Department of Washington, which united all Union troops in the District of Columbia and Maryland under one command. Brigadier General J.F.K. Mansfield, commander of the Department of Washington, argued that Northern Virginia should be occupied as soon as possible in order to prevent the possibility of the Confederate Army mounting artillery on the hills of Arlington and shelling government buildings in Washington. He also urged the erection of fortifications on the Virginia side of the Potomac River to protect the southern terminuses of the Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge. His superiors approved these recommendations, but decided to wait until after Virginia voted for or against secession.Cooling, Benjamin Franklin, III, Symbol, Sword, and Shield: Defending Washington During the Civil War Second Edition Revised (Shippensburg, PA: White Mane Publishing Company, 1991), pp. 32-26, 41. On May 23, 1861, Virginia voted by a margin of 3 to 1 in favor of leaving the Union. That night, U.S. Army troops began crossing the bridges linking Washington, D.C. to Virginia.  Taking the High Ground  Washington D.C. Fortifications map Over the seven weeks that followed the occupation of northern Virginia, forts were constructed along the banks of the Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.J.G. Barnard and W.F. Barry, \\"Report of the Engineer and Artillery Operations of the Army of the Potomac from Its Organization to the Close of the Peninsular Campaign,\\" (New York: D. Van Nostrand, 1863), pp. 9-10. While the Potomac River forts were being built, planning and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts to protect the city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In the days that followed the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack.Margaret Leech, Reveille in Washington (New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1941), pp. 101-110. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington. On July 26, 1861, five days after the battle, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the subsequently renamed Army of the Potomac. Upon arriving in Washington, McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city's defenses. > In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous > resistance to a respectable body of the enemy, either in the position and > numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works... > not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side. There > was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy > range, which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without > resistance.U.S., War Department, The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of > the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, 70 Volumes > (Washington, DC: The Government Printing Office, 1880-1901) I, Volume 5, p. > 11. To remedy the situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the defenses of Washington. At all points of the compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack.Official Records, Series I, Volume 5, Chapter 14, p. 679. Alexandria, which contained the southern terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and one of the largest ports in the Chesapeake Bay, was an object of \\"anxious study.\\"Official Records, Series I, Volume 5, Chapter 14, p. 680.  Planning and construction  Fort O'Rourke was named for Patrick Henry O'Rourke, killed at Gettysburg. It was constructed during the latter part of 1862 and early 1863 as a Redoubt to Fort Lyon.Cooling, Benjamin Franklin, III, and Walton H.

It is accredited is by the New England Association of Secondary Schools. As of 2013, the school has about 1,300 students and over 90 faculty and staff members. WHS was founded in 1870; the current building was originally built in 1907 and underwent a major renovation/addition in 2000-2002 thereby adding many new classrooms, labs, a new library and cafeteria as well as a general modernization of the interior. The campus is located one mile from downtown Walpole on Common Street. Curriculum Jean Kenney, the assistant superintendent, stated in 2015 that almost every student takes at least two years of foreign language instruction even though the high school only requires one year. As of 2015, foreign languages offered included Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Latin, and Spanish. That year, about 600 students studied Spanish, about 150 studied French, about 100 studied Latin, about 45 students studied German, and about 30 studied Chinese. Kenney stated in 2015 that many students take at least two foreign languages.

It has around 17,000 members and 450 local chapters. Activities Among the society's activities are folk dance, theatre and the spreading of knowledge and use of traditional costumes (). Several activities are directed towards youth and children. Some local chapters, such as Bondeungdomslaget i Oslo, run their own sports clubs (IL i BUL), or also music societies. From 1913 to 1956 the society had a shared secretariat with the Nynorsk language organization Noregs Mållag. The society has been a driving force for the building of assembly houses, coffee houses and lodging houses (), folk high schools and secondary schools. The society works closely with institutions such as the Nynorsk theatre Det Norske Teatret and the children's magazine Norsk Barneblad. They organize dance festivals and theatre festivals. After 1900 the societies were also active in supporting defence and the military. History The society has its roots in a number of societies for reading and discussion formed in the last part of the 19th century, often related to the folk high schools. In a founding meeting in Trondheim in 1896 delegates from seven of the earlier formed county societies were gathered, and the national umbrella organization Noregs Ungdomslag was formed. A central task from the start was enlightenment of the people, in particular by providing speakers to the local chapters. These activities closed down when radio and other mass media became widespread. The local societies could provide libraries, organize cinema, and work for obtaining assembly houses (), often through collective voluntary work (dugnad). Leaders Among the early leaders of the society were author Sven Moren, who chaired the society for two periods, Klaus Sletten, Nikolaus Gjelsvik, and Olav Midttun. The current leader (chairman of the board) is Kristian Fjellanger, while Eli Ulvestad is Secretary General.

As of 2019, he remains a member and has played on all five of their studio albums. Prior to that, at the age of 18, he joined thrash/punk band Suicidal Tendencies. Other notable work includes his soul/rock side project Bobby Church, and contributions to a diverse range of bands and artists such as (Suicidal Tendencies funk metal offshoot band) Infectious Grooves, Everlast, Kelly Osbourne, The Veronicas, and Ashley Parker Angel.  Early life  Paul started on drums around the age of four. His parents were both gospel musicians, and he drummed in his grandfather's Dixieland band. At seven years old he appeared playing drums in the Don Henley music video for the song \\"The Boys of Summer\\". He switched to playing bass around the age of 10 when his family moved. > \\"I loved playing drums... still love playing drums... but, we moved into an > apartment, and landlords just don't like drums [laughs]\\" He played in various bands around L.A. during this time and was active in the music scene. He mentions \\"...[hanging] out with the members of the band Fishbone a lot\\", and at only 15 had earned an endorsement for bass guitar. He was 17 or 18 when he got a call from a friend Brooks Wackerman to ask if he would play in Suicidal Tendencies.  Musical career = Suicidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves (1996–2002)  The chance to join Suicidal Tendencies was, according to Paul... > \\"...a dream come true, because I was to replace Robert Trujillo, who's one > of my idols\\" He joined at a time when the band was coming back from one of several breakups, and in the meantime many members had started or further pursued other projects (Trujillo had joined Ozzy Osbourne's band), leaving only Mike Muir (vocals) and Mike Clark (rhythm guitar). His friend Brooks was hired on as the new drummer, and the two were with the band until around 2002, when the band went through another change of lineup. During his time with Suicidal Tendencies, Paul played on the EP Six the Hard Way, the albums Freedumb and Free Your Soul and Save My Mind, and guest played track 3 of the album 13 (released in 2013). Trujillo remained in Muir's supergroup Infectious Grooves after having left Suicidal Tendencies, but Paul also recorded three tracks for their Mas Borracho album.  Transition period (2002–2006)  He left Suicidal Tendencies amicably in 2002 explaining... > “Punk had such a huge impact on where I was growing up, so being a part of > that band was really a dream. [...] It was a hard decision to leave, but I > wanted more time to focus on making my own music and producing other > artists. Plus, I was looking for the challenge of playing different kinds of > music with other bands.” Between 2002 and when he joined Daughtry in 2006, he worked and toured with a wide variety of other projects including (in no particular order) Kelly Osbourne, Everlast, The Veronica’s, DJ Samantha Ronson, and Ashley Parker Angel as a bassist and/or musical director. He says of that time period... > \\"Every project pushed me in different directions and allowed me to grow > musically, but they didn’t give me the creative outlet I really wanted.\\"  Daughtry (2006–2012, 2013–present)  Paul auditioned to play bass in Chris Daughtry's band and was hired in 2006. He says of joining Daughtry... > \\"... It’s a collaborative effort and we all have a voice in the music. This > band really is something special.” He has played on all of their releases to date, including five full albums, and the band is currently working on its sixth. He briefly (amicably) left the band in 2012 but rejoined in 2013.  Personal life  As of 2015, Paul lives in Nashville, TN, and has four sons.  Instruments  He plays and endorses Warwick Basses, EMG pickups, and GK amps and cabs.

The family lost the ownership of the estate in 1889.Selma Lagerlöf-sällskapet Selma Lagerlöf bought back the main building in 1907 and in 1910, she could buy back the whole estate with the help of the prize money she received from the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909. The manor house was rebuilt in 1921–1923 based upon designs by architect Isak Gustaf Clason (1856–1930). She had the building reconstructed; not much of the original appearance of her childhood home remained. Together with horticulturist Ruth Martina Brandberg (1878-1944), she created the garden comprising a wide variety of bushes, shrubs, fruit trees, vegetable and flower. The original red-painted cottage was extended eastward, a new floor and an attic were added and the grand facade completed its transformation into an elegant manor. Today In her last will and testament Selma Lagerlöf wrote that Mårbacka should be preserved as a memorial estate and be shown to the public. Mårbacka is now kept as a memorial estate, as a result of the author writing in her testament that Mårbacka should be preserved and shown to the public in the condition it was at her death. By paid entrance, visitors can get a guided tour of the main building and next to the building is also a garden, a cafe and a bookstore. At Mårbacka Barn (Mårbackas Lada) there is a memorial exhibition of Lagerlöf's life and writings.

Originally a choir that specialized in mounting oratorios, the group eventually morphed into a light opera company in the early 1930s. History Originally a choir, the Eaton Operatic Society was titled the Eaton Choral Society when it was formed by employees of the T. Eaton Co department store in 1919. The group performed annual concerts in Massey Hall, assembling an orchestra mainly of players from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Notable performers to have appeared with the choir included harpist Carlos Salzedo and singer Paul Althouse. Herbert M. Fletcher was the group's first conductor, serving in that role until 1925 when he was succeeded by T.J. Crawford. In 1931 the organization was retitled the Eaton Operatic Society and then began to produce operetta productions in addition to presenting choral concerts, at a new auditorium at The Carlu. Eventually the choir was completely disbanded during the mid-1930s. The first operetta staged by the society was Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe at the Eaton Auditorium on 2 March 1932. The group continued to mount operettas at the Eaton Auditorium every Spring through 1965. The group also toured frequently with their productions to other cities in southern Ontario and performed at Canadian army bases during World War II. In its early years, the Savoy operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were the chief part of the society's repertoire, including Iolanthe (1932, 1938, 1950), The Gondoliers (1933, 1939, 1948, 1954), The Mikado (1934, 1940, 1949), The Yeoman of the Guard (1935, 1941, 1952), and The Pirates of Penzance (1936, 1942, 1953). Beginning in 1954, the society's repertory consisted exclusively of musicals and other operettas, including The Vagabond King (1957, 1965) and Rose-Marie (1959). In 1947 Harry Norris succeeded T.J. Crawford as the Eaton Operatic Society's music director. He left after only one season when Godfrey Ridout became director. Ridout remained for nine years, and then was succeeded by Lloyd Bradshaw (1959-1961) and Horace Lapp (1962-1965). Lois Marshall performed with the company.

It is located at 34°10'50N 72°18'56E with an altitude of 319 metres (1049 feet).Location of Dandoqa - Falling Rain Genomics It is surrounded by the villages of Tarakai, Yarhussain, Dagi and Sikandari on its north, west, east south respectively. Its population is 4000 to 7000 (2007). The entire village mostly has an arid climate with minimum rainfall. The land is mostly of agricultural use and the population is multi-racial. History Dandoka village: \\"The Broken Sword: sharp & lethal\\", The Land of Warroirs/Kings/Martyrs in Khyber PakhtoonKhwa, Pakistan. Founded by The Grand Elders of Jaokhel tribes (The Warriors, The Kings). In the past the land of dandoka village was the large fraction of the village Dagi. The land of dandoka was once a battle field in the old times between the tribes of Dagi and Turlandi, has emerged quickly as a portion of populated territory between Dagi and Tarakai. Its population is about 7000 (in 2007) and is one of the smallest villages in District Swabi. Basic tribes of this village includes the Jaokhel, Qurashi, Kaka Khels and others. The issue, that how this area was named Dandoka, has been controversial both for historians and archeologists. According to Archeologist the area got its name Dandoka due to its geographic location between to ancient streams. Any natural stream is called dund in Pushto language. As the area is between two natural dund (Streams) so peoples of the time called it Dandoka, This is the view of Archeologist, which is acceptable according to his geographics principles but its a gossip only and wrong information about the history of this village. Actually the history of Dandoka is correctly explain by Roshan Khan. According to Mr. Roshan Khan in his famous book, \\"History of Swabian Pathans\\" the term Dandoka means \\"Broken Sword\\". He further mentions that the famous Muslim warrior, Mehmood Ghaznavi met the Indians in a war at this spot. During the battle, the sword of one of his soldiers broke into two pieces. Upon breaking of his sword, he said, \\"Ah! Dan doka\\" (Oh! My sword has broken). These words of Ayaz were later on used as a name for this area. However, the local uneducated people accept the views of Archeologist. But the strong family background history individuals and educated class of this village has rejected the idea of Archeologist and they consider the views of Mr. Roshan Khan to be correct. The exact meaning of Arabic word dandoka is Broken/Cut sharp & lethal sword. It is concluded that the views of Mr.Roshan Khan is correct according to Historians and the elders of this area. so the Dandoka means \\"Broken Sword\\" and the Broken Sword is more sharp & lethal than the normal one.  Origin of the term Dandoqa, Dandoka  The issue, that how this area was named Dandoka, has been controversial both for historians and archeologists. there are two theories about it. According to an Archeologist, the area got its name Dandoka due to its geographic location between to ancient streams. Any natural stream is called \\"Dund\\" in Pushto language. As the area is between two natural \\"Dunds\\" (Streams) therefore peoples of the time called it Dandoka. On the other hand, according to Mr. Roshan Khan in his famous book, \\"History of Swabian Pathans\\" the term Dandoka means \\"Broken Sword\\". He further mentions that the famous Muslim warrior, Mehmood Ghaznavi met the Indians in a war at this spot. During the battle, the sword of one of his soldiers broke into two pieces. Upon breaking of his sword, he said, \\"Ah! Dan doka\\" (Oh! My sword has broken). These words of Ayaz were later on used as a name for this area. However the ideas of Mr. Roshan Khan are accepted on a large scale by the peoples. The term Dandoqa, is derived from the Tartaric Language, which means \\"My Broken Sword\\" which justifies the view of Mr. Roshan Khan. Today Today Dandoka, due to its unique geographic location is considered as a separate village from both Dagi and Tarakay. The Grand Elders of Jaokhels sub cast of Yousafzai Malaks Hashimzai tribes put the foundation of this village after conquering and then buying the lands from the peoples of Dagai by legal payments to them. Muqarrab Khan who has a prominent personality also do settled down the long lasting wars & battles between the tribes of Dagi and Turlandi. Therefore, Jaokhel tribes first conquered and then buy this land by putting a barrier between the two villages and to settle down the war and rage between the tribes of Dagi & Turlandi. As the meaning of the name shows \\"Broken sword\\". This land Dandoka have been capture back after long lasting wars and battles. And the elders of Jaokhel tribes do shed their blood to conquered this land. Jaokhel tribes were called warriors at that times as they conquered this area, by pushing back the stronger warriors of Turlandi tribes from occupied lands of Dagi tribes. So first to settle in this area were the Jaokhel of Yousafzai Malaks Hashimzai tribes. The Kaka khels, Qurashi and other different small tribes relocate, migrate to dandoka in search of bread and butter. Jaokhel Malaks yousafzai hashimzai tribes high-profile elders did like to gift lands to their new relocating/migrating tribes. Whenever a child born in dandoka particularly in migrated families., the father of child always get a piece of land as a token of gift from the Elders of Jaokhels Malaks of Yousafzai, Hashimzai, Malaks tribes. Nowadays Dandoka is a separate Village. Jaokhels of Yousafzai Malaks Hashimzai tribes actively participated in the Pakistan Movement in British India. The village lies between the ancient two streams, Developmental status Developmental works are however negligible in the village as Jaokhel sub cast of Yousafzai, Malaks, Hashimzai tribes affiliated with Pakistan Muslim League during the time of Independence Movement of Pakistan. and Then later joint the Nationalist party of ANP. Due to the affiliation with Nationalist Party ANP most of the local government officials of the region always ignore Dandoka in the development to change the political views and vision of Jaokhel Yousafzai, Malaks, Hashimzai tribes but the said tribes never ever did changes their strong and firm nationalist beliefs, views and vision. Dandoka village have only been Middle schools for both boys and girls constructed while No high schools. Similarly no steps have been taken by the government officials to provide services of Post office, health, irrigation and drainage etc. In the present times the leading head Elder of the Village Haji Mohammad Khurshid Khan (the grandson of Hashim Khan) due to his non-violence, educated and humanitarian (Khudai Khidmatgar) life style\\" is trying his best to do development work in all sectors. The self- esteem frame of mind individuals belonging to different tribes either Jaokhel Yousafzai Malaks Hashimzai or kaka khel or qurashi do work in their field of expertise to serve and upgrade the life standards of the peoples of this village. It is hopeful, that a number of developmental works should be launched in the current government so as to improve the life standards of the peoples here. Major tribes The major tribes of (Dandoka) Dandoqa are \\"Jaokhels of Yousafzai, Malaks, Hashimzai\\", \\"Qureshi\\" and the \\"Kakakhels\\" and others.. Jaokhels of Yousafzai Malaks Hashimzai  The first Tribe to settle in this area were the Jaokhel tribe is the sub-cast of Yousafzai, Malaks, Hashimzai tribes. From the day of his foundation the Jaokhel Malaks tribes Elder was leading head Elder of this Village. Once Muqarab khan was the head of the tribe and village Dandoka in the past. The Leading Head Elders of the village and Tribe changes time to time but it is confirmed that it was always from Jaokhel tribes. The grandfather of Haji Mohammad Khurshid Khan, Mr. HASHIM KHAN was the one of the leading and high-profile personality of Khudai Khidmatgar Tahreek. Nowadays a prominent Khudai Khidmatgar worker (the son of Khwaja Mohammad Khan and the grandson of Hashim khan) Haji Mohammad Khurshid Khan is the Leading Head Elder of the Jaokhel tribe and Dandoka as well. Jaokhels of Dandoqa migrated to this village from \\"Fateh jang\\" of District Attock in late 18th century. Though these peoples are not Punjabis but they were settled in Fateh Jang for their trade promotion. Muqarrab Khan was the first to have migrated to village Dandoqa and was the first chief of his Jaokhels tribe. He was succeeded by Hashim Khan. It was the time when the second major tribe, the Kakakhels entered the village and settled. Hashim Khan was succeeded by Dilawar Khan. At the cutting edge of his life, he appointed Mr. Nasrullah Khan as the chief of Jaokhels tribe in Dandoqa. Nasrullah Khan was succeeded by his son, Malak Abdul Wahab (not an ethnic Malik but by family leading role). He was an influential man in the politics of the area and was famous for his non violent character unlike his political rivals, the Kakakhels, who were known for their aggression in politics. He was a member of the union council of his area and a hard working person. In broader sense, he was the actual asset of not only his tribe but for his village also. His sudden death in 2002 created a power vacuum for the position of chief in his tribe, but thanks to the good behaviour and skills of his cousin, Haji Khurshid Khan who successfully overcome these difficulties. Upon the death of Malak Abdul Wahab, his cousin, Haji Muhammad Khurshid Khan was appointed as the chief of his tribe and he is still serving as head of his tribe with no controversies.

His sons and grandsons are now serving in respectable departments like Health, Judiciary, Business, Education, Engineering and Humanitarian Work. The Jaokhels of Yousafzai Malaks Hashimzai at Dandoqa, live a traditional life dominated by Pakhtoon Culture. Education has recently made growth in this tribe, with just a single family to have the greater number of graduates in different fields. The rest of Jaokhels lack any interest in education and that's why literacy ratio is limited to the home of the current chief of tribe only.

He was recommended for a Distinguished Conduct Medal but there is no record of him having received it. His treatment has been seen as an example of the lack of recognition accorded to Black Canadian soldiers. Campaigns to have him receive the medal posthumously eventually resulted in his being awarded the Canadian Forces Medallion for Distinguished Service on February 22, 2010. Military service Jones enlisted as a private with the 106th Battalion (Nova Scotia Rifles), CEF on June 19, 1916 in Truro, Nova Scotia. He had to lie about his age saying his birthday was on March 29, 1877 which would have made him 39 instead of his real age 58. 716221 Private Jeremiah (Jerry) Jones served in France with The Royal Canadian Regiment. He joined the regiment in the field on 9 Feb 1917 and was evacuated (wounded) to England on 12 April 1917. During the Battle of Vimy Ridge in World War I, Canadian troops were pinned down by German machine gun fire. Jones volunteered to attack a German gun emplacement. He managed to reach the machine gun nest, tossed a hand grenade and killed several soldiers. The remainder surrendered to him and Jones forced his captives to carry the machine gun back across the battlefield to the Canadian lines, where they were ordered to deposit it at his commanding officer's feet. For his heroics, Private Jones was reportedly recommended for a Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) which he was never awarded. Jones was wounded in action at Vimy Ridge and again at the Battle of Passchendaele. He was discharged in Halifax on May 8, 1918 after being found medically unfit to serve. Jones never actually received the DCM, although it was widely reported at the time that he was recommended for it by his commanding officer. Several veterans have since supported the claim that Jones was to be awarded the DCM, but no records have surfaced to prove that he ever received it. Campaigns for recognition Over the years, The Truro Daily News has published several articles highlighting Jones' heroics on the battlefield and his recommendation for the DCM. A letter from a Truro soldier based in Witley Camp, Surrey, England on July 29, 1917, that was published in the Truro Daily News, quoted the writer as saying, Jones, \\"had captured a German machine gun, forced the crew to carry it back to our lines, and, depositing it at the feet of the CO. said;- 'Is this thing any good?'\\" On September 21, 1917, Jones's sister Martha told The Truro Daily News said that Jones \\"won the DCM by capturing a German machine gun and crew\\". The newspaper once again alluded to the medal recommendation, in an article on Jerry's 79th birthday. This time they reported \\"His valor won for him a recommendation for the DCM\\" For most of his adult life, Senator Calvin Ruck lobbied to get the Canadian government to award a medal posthumously to Jerry Jones. Senator Ruck argued that the racist climate of the time precluded Jones or other black soldiers from getting their due recognition, and he felt that it would be appropriate for the government to award the medal to Jones on behalf of all black veterans. Senator Ruck died in 2004, without achieving success. Posthumous recognition On September 9, 2000, The Last Post Fund erected a new grave stone for Jones with full military honours. The Truro Millennium Committee, 125th Anniversary Committee and The Jones Family sponsored a tree carving of Jones as part of the Truro Tree Sculpture Project, in November 2000. The Canadian Government finally recognized Jeremiah \\"Jerry\\" Jones, posthumously, on February 22, 2010, with the awarding of the Canadian Forces Medallion for Distinguished Service. Rear Admiral Paul Maddison, Commander, Maritime Forces Atlantic/Joint Task Force Atlantic, said \\"Today, on behalf of General Walter Natynczyk, Chief of the Defence Staff, I feel extremely privileged to finally acknowledge the gallantry of private Jeremiah Jones on the hills of Vimy Ridge in 1917 during the First World War.\\" Personal Jeremiah married Ethel Edna Geraldine Cook from Amherst, Nova Scotia on March 30, 1898. They remained married until her death on February 12, 1940. The couple had 9 children. Jeremiah's grandson was the well-known Nova Scotia activist Rocky Jones (from his son Elmer Alvin Jones).

Originally from Kumamoto city, the pair first met in high school when Arita and Ueda found a common interest in pro wrestling. Both of them attended Waseda and Rikkyo Universities, but dropped out to pursue comedy. More than 15 years later, Ueda and Arita are popular personalities on Japanese television, and can be seen performing daily, often on multiple shows in one day, sometimes on different channels simultaneously. As with many Japanese kombi, one of the comedians is referred to as the boke, and the other the tsukkomi. As the boke, Arita is loud and prone to strange comments, while Ueda (sometimes called tempa, see note) is the more reasonable of the two, often criticizing Arita's remarks while setting up further jokes and often providing Arita with a one-man audience (even when nobody else is laughing). Ueda also distinguishes himself from most tsukkomi as the king of unchiku (うんちく), or the ability to lecture on about something that the speaker's audience really has no interest in whatsoever.

Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1–157.Jebb, M. 1994. NEPENTHES revision for Flora Malesiana. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, September 9, 1994. It was published in 2001 by the National Herbarium of the Netherlands as the fifteenth volume of the Flora Malesiana series. The species descriptions presented in the monograph are based on the authors' field observations in Borneo, New Guinea, and Peninsular Malaysia, as well as the examination of plant material deposited at 20 herbaria. Content Cheek and Jebb recognised 83 species from Malesia, including three nothospecies (N. × hookeriana, N. × kinabaluensis, and N. × trichocarpa) and one \\"little known species\\" (N. deaniana). In addition, they mentioned four \\"excluded species\\": N. cincta (likely a natural hybrid between N. albomarginata and N. northiana), N. cristata (\\"a nonsense species based on mixed types\\"), N. lindleyana (of which the original material could not be located), and N. neglecta (which the authors considered likely to represent N. gracilis). In \\"Nepenthaceae\\", Cheek and Jebb revised several of the taxonomic determinations made in their 1997 monograph, \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\". They supported Charles Clarke's interpretation of N. borneensis and N. faizaliana in Nepenthes of Borneo, synonymising the former with N. boschiana and restoring the latter as a distinct species, separate from N. stenophylla.Kurata, S. 2002. Proceedings of the 4th International Carnivorous Plant Conference: 111–116. In addition, N. philippinensis, which the authors had previously considered a doubtful taxon, was treated as distinct. Of the species described since the preparation of their skeletal revision, Cheek and Jebb accepted N. benstonei, N. lavicola, N. mira, and N. sibuyanensis. However, the authors rejected N. angasanensis, sinking it in synonymy with N. mikei.

The initial idea was conceptualized by Claus Wedekind through his famous \\"sweaty t-shirt\\" experiment.Wedekind, C., et al. \\"MHC-Dependent Mate Preferences in Humans.\\" Proceedings.Biological sciences / The Royal Society 260.1359 (1995): 245-9. Males were asked to wear T-shirts for two consecutive nights, and then females were asked to smell the T-shirts and rate the body odors for attractiveness. Human body odor has been associated with the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) genomic region. They discovered that females were attracted to men who had dissimilar HLA alleles from them. Furthermore, these females reported that the body odors of HLA- dissimilar males reminded them of their current partners or ex-partners providing further evidence of biological compatibility. Evidence of biological compatibility Following the seminal research done by Dr. Wedekind, several studies found corroborating evidence for biological compatibility. Garver-Apgar et al.Garver-Apgar, C. E., et al. \\"Major Histocompatibility Complex Alleles, Sexual Responsivity, and Unfaithfulness in Romantic Couples.\\" Psychological science : a journal of the American Psychological Society / APS 17.10 (2006): 830-5. presented evidence for HLA- dissimilar alleles playing a factor in the healthiness of romantic relationships. They discovered that as the proportion of HLA-similar alleles increased between couples, females reported being less sexually responsive to their partners, less satisfaction from being aroused by their partners, and having additional sexual partners (while with their current partner). Additionally, Ober et al.Ober, C., et al. \\"HLA and Mate Choice in Humans.\\" American Journal of Human Genetics 61.3 (1997): 497-504. conducted an independent study on a population of American Hutterites by comparing the HLA alleles of married couples. They discovered that married couples were less likely to share HLA alleles than expected from random chance; thus their results were consistent with tendencies for same-HLA alleled partners to avoid mating. Further evidence of the importance of genetic compatibility can be found in the finding that couples sharing a higher proportion of HLA alleles tend to have recurring spontaneous abortions,Reznikoff-Etievant, M. F., et al. \\"HLA Antigen-Sharing in Couples with Repeated Spontaneous Abortions and the Birthweight of Babies in Successful Pregnancies.\\" American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y.: 1989) 25.1 (1991): 25-7. reduced body mass in babies, and longer intervals between successive births.Ober, C., et al. \\"HLA Sharing and Fertility in Hutterite Couples: Evidence for Prenatal Selection Against Compatible Fetuses.\\" American Journal of Reproductive Immunology and Microbiology : AJRIM 18.4 (1988): 111-5. Reasons for biological compatibility There are several biological reasons why women would be attracted to and mate with men with dissimilar HLA alleles:Penn, D.J ., and Potts, W.K. “The evolution of mating preferences and major histocompatibility complex genes.” The American Naturalists, 153 (1999): 145-164. * Their offspring would have a greater assortment of HLA alleles theoretically giving them a wider diversity of antigens present on the surface of cells compared to HLA-homozygous offspring. The wider variety of antigens allows the immune system to target a greater number of pathogens making the offspring more immunocompetent. * Any HLA allele which becomes a more resistant allele would not simply become an inherent allele in all individuals. Through evolution, there will always be some pathogens that can become resistant to this allele, and spread to create a selection against the allele. HLA-dissortative mating can be considered a method to cause the adaptations that pathogens have to their host to become obsolete in their offspring; In other words, allow us to keep up in the \\"Red Queen's race\\". * HLA genes are highly polymorphic between individuals. Any two individuals with similar HLA genes could be possibly related. Mating of two related individuals would result in inbreeding which can be harmful to the offspring since it would result in a greater amount of genetic homozygosity thus increasing the chances of recessive mutations.

Unlike its competitors, POWDR focuses on being an adventure lifestyle company rather than on real estate development. It is owned by the Cumming family and headquartered in Park City, Utah.http://www.powdr.com/site/ John Cumming, who co-founded the clothing company Mountain Hardwear, and, prior to that, traveled the globe climbing big mountains as a guide for Rainier Mountaineering, founded POWDR and currently serves as Chairman. In June 2018, Cumming stepped down as CEO and appointed Wade Martin, previously POWDR's chief revenue officer, and Justin Sibley, previously POWDR's chief financial officer, as co-presidents. Prior to joining POWDR in 2013, Martin launched the Dew Tour and served as CEO of NBC and MTV's joint action sports venture, Alli. History POWDR was founded in 1994 by John Cumming with the purchase of Park City Mountain Resort. Later that year, the company expanded into California with the purchase of Alpine Meadows near Lake Tahoe. In August 1995, the company continued its expansion in California with the purchase of the Boreal and Soda Springs ski areas. In April 2001, POWDR acquired Mt. Bachelor ski area from a group of shareholders.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dnIVAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=musDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2112,5288468&dq;=mount+bachelor+sold&hl;=en The company bought Las Vegas Ski and Snowboard Resort in November 2003. Killington and Pico were sold to POWDR by American Skiing Company in May 2007 and in December 2019 POWDR purchased SilverStar Mountain Resort, its first mountain resort in Canada. In July 2007, POWDR sold Alpine Meadows to JMA Ventures. Since 2008, when POWDR acquired Outside TV, POWDR has diversified its focus to adapt to the changing ski industry scene and evolve into an “adventure lifestyle company.” POWDR acquired Copper Mountain in Colorado in December 2009 from Intrawest.http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20091117/NEWS/911179997/1008&parentprofile;=1055 Powdr acquired \\"World of Adventure Sports Presented by GoPro\\", an Emmy Award- winning TV series on December 3, 2013.http://www.saminfo.com/news/powdr- enterprises-acquires-adventure-sports-tv-series In July 2011, POWDR bought majority share of action sports’ Camp Woodward. In March 2015, Louisville, Colorado-based event-production company Human Movement Management was acquired by POWDR, evolving the company's portfolio from just ski resorts into an active lifestyle enterprise. Since POWDR's June 2016 acquisition of Eldora Mountain Resort in Colorado, POWDR has invested significantly to return the 55-year-old ski area to its roots as Boulder's backyard hill. In fall 2017, POWDR opened its fifth Woodward facility and first location in Mexico, at the Hard Rock Hotel Riviera Maya. In September 2018, POWDR broke ground on its Woodward Park City youth sports complex. Lawsuits=Non-honoring of certain passes offered by prior Killington owner In July 2010, A federal judge dismissed a class action lawsuit against Killington Resort over so- called 'lifetime' ski passes. Judge Christina Reiss found that the resort's owner was under no legal obligation to honor the investor season passes when it purchased Killington Resort in 2007. POWDR was not named in the lawsuit. Loss of Park City lease When Park City Mountain Resort, a POWDR resort, mistakenly failed to renew a \\"sweetheart lease\\" for a portion of its ski terrain acreage, the company was eventually evicted from the property and, after a protracted legal fight, \\"reluctantly\\" sold its remaining area assets to Vail Resorts for approximately 180 million dollars in late 2014.http://www.ktvz.com/news/mt-bachelors-parent-sells-big-utah- resort/28038840https://www.law360.com/articles/540606/park-city-mountain- resort-loses-lease-after-costly-error Properties= West  *Boreal Mountain Resort, California *Soda Springs, California *Mt.

Kaston, was an American arachnologist. Kaston was born in New York City and graduated from North Carolina State University in 1930. In 1934, he earned a PhD in zoology from Yale University, where he first began studying spiders. After graduating from Yale, Kaston worked for four years at the Connecticut Experiment Station studying elm beetles and Dutch elm disease. In his spare time, he studied spiders and published several papers on them. In 1938, he obtained a teaching position at Brenau College in Gainesville, Georgia, a small liberal arts college for women. In 1941, Kaston completed his first book, Spiders of Connecticut. Its publication was delayed for seven years, however, due to World War II. After a summer research fellowship at Harvard University, Kaston joined the faculty of the Zoology Department of Syracuse University in 1945. He only stayed at Syracuse for one year, however, before accepting a position at Teachers College of Connecticut (now Central Connecticut State University). While at Teachers College, he wrote and published his second book, How to Know the Spiders (1953). Kaston retired from Teachers College in July 1963. In addition to his books, Kaston also published 86 scientific papers, mostly about spiders. Kaston continued writing until shortly before his death in 1985.

He works in the fields of painting and drawing. \\"...the guiding principle that organizes Manuel Vilarinho's landscapes is the walk, the slow enjoyment of the visible though completed by the fleetingness of someone who drives on the road, taking in, in and extremely quick way, such visual information as stands out from the bulk of natural landscape.\\" He began taking part in exhibitions in the 1980s, and, in 1985, had his first solo exhibition.

A journey should, for example, drive you through every stopover imaginable; there is always something you haven’t seen yet, some unknown place, one thing or another, or maybe some new event: nearby landscapes; ruins; outskirts... Manuel Vilarinho captures the environment cognitively and organizes it in his canvas using either geometrical or figurative shapes: landscapes - hills, with green colors, earthy browns, the red earth - where the local pathways where travelers wander open themselves; views that agglutinate, that juxtapose themselves, in their multiple plans as the sum of environments, of natural objects and, of the urban world as well, the ruins, the signs, the letters signaling paths, the chimneys, the walls with bare bricks, the constructed fences, a maze that forms the pathway, several undefined shapes, the rough brushstroke, an expressive stroke, and colors and shapes meet in this cluster of feelings, views of the landscape, cuttings recorded on painted canvas.”Rui Almeida Pereira (Direcção Artística do Museu Jorge Vieira), in catálogo da exposição individual na Galeria dos Escudeiros, Beja, 2005.

The victims, Holly Marie Wells and Jessica Aimee Chapman, were lured into the home of a local resident, Ian Kevin Huntley, who subsequently murdered the children—likely via asphyxiation—before disposing of their bodies in an irrigation ditch close to RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk. The girls' bodies were discovered on 17 August 2002. Huntley was convicted of the murder of both girls on 17 December 2003 and sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment, with the High Court later imposing a minimum term of 40 years. His girlfriend, Maxine Ann Carr—the girls' teaching assistant—had knowingly provided Huntley with a false alibi. She received a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for conspiring with Huntley to pervert the course of justice. The efforts made to locate Wells and Chapman in the thirteen days of their disappearance have been described as one of the most intense and extensive in British criminal history. Disappearance At 11:45 a.m. on Sunday, 4 August 2002, Jessica Chapman left her home in Brook Street, Soham, to attend a barbecue at the home of her best friend, Holly Wells, in nearby Redhouse Gardens. Prior to leaving her home, Chapman informed her parents of her intention to also give her friend a necklace engraved with the letter H she had purchased for her on a recent family holiday to Menorca. The two girls and a friend named Natalie Parr played computer games and listened to music for approximately half an hour before Parr returned home. By 3:15 p.m., both girls had changed into distinctive replica Manchester United football shirts; one of which belonged to Wells and the other to her older brother, Oliver. At 5:04 p.m., a photograph of the two friends was taken by Wells' mother before the children ate dinner with the other house guests. They then returned to playing in Wells' bedroom at approximately 6:10 p.m. At approximately 6:15 p.m., the two girls left the Wells residence without informing any of the house guests to purchase sweets from a vending machine at the local sports centre. While returning to 4 Redhouse Gardens, Wells and Chapman walked past the College Close home of Ian Huntley, the senior caretaker at the local secondary school. Huntley evidently lured the girls into his house, stating that his girlfriend, Maxine Carr—the girls' teaching assistant at St Andrew's Primary School—was also present in the house. (Carr was actually visiting her mother in Grimsby, Lincolnshire on this date.) The precise chain of events to occur after the girls entered 5 College Close is unknown, although investigators believe sections of Huntley's later claims in initial interviews granted to the media prior to his arrest and his later trial testimony—such as that he had been cleaning his dog at the time the girls passed by his house at approximately 6:30 p.m. and that one girl had been suffering from a mild nosebleed—may have actually been true. In any event, the cause of death of both girls was later ruled to be asphyxiation. Chapman's Nokia mobile phone was switched off at 6:46 p.m. At 8:00 p.m., Nicola Wells entered her daughter's bedroom to invite the girls to say goodbye to her house guests, only to discover both children were missing from their home. Alarmed, she and her husband, Kevin, searched their house and nearby streets. Minutes after their daughter's 8:30 p.m. curfew had expired, Nicola Wells phoned the Chapman residence to determine if the girls were at this location, only to learn Leslie and Sharon Chapman were becoming concerned why their youngest daughter had not returned home. Following subsequent frantic efforts by the families of both girls to locate their daughters, Wells and Chapman were reported missing by their parents at 9.55 p.m. Investigation Police immediately launched an intensive manhunt to locate the missing children. Over 400 officers were assigned full-time to search for the girls. These officers conducted extensive house-to-house enquiries across Soham; their efforts to search local terrain were bolstered by the assistance of hundreds of local volunteers and, later, United States Air Force personnel stationed at nearby airbases. To assist in their public appeals for information, Cambridgeshire Police released the photograph Nicola Wells had taken of the children less than two hours before their disappearance depicting both girls wearing distinctive Manchester United replica football shirts. A physical description of each girl was also released to the media, describing both girls as being white, approximately 4 ft 6 in tall, and slim. Chapman was described as being tanned, with shoulder-length, brown hair; Wells was described as being fair, with blonde hair. The parents of both girls were adamant their daughters had been wary of talking with strangers, having warned them not to trust individuals they did not know from early childhood. This insistence was supported by the headteacher of St Andrew's Primary School, who informed reporters: \\"The possible danger from strangers is something we have impressed upon [the children] from an early age.\\"Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 98 Suspecting the children had been kidnapped, investigators questioned every registered sex offender in Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 171 Over 260 registered sex offenders across the UK—including fifteen high-risk paedophiles—were also questioned, although all were eliminated from the enquiry. Police also investigated the possibility that the girls had arranged to meet with an individual either or both had contacted via an internet chat room, although this possibility was soon discounted. On 8 August, CCTV footage of the girls, recorded minutes before their disappearance, was released to the public. This footage depicted the children arriving at the local sports centre at 6:28 p.m. A televised reconstruction of the children's last known movements was also broadcast nationally on 10 August, and both sets of parents granted an interview with presenter Colin Baker on ITV's current affairs programme Tonight, which was broadcast on 12 August. Other family members and friends of both girls also appealed via the media for the safe return of the children.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 5 These appeals for information regarding the whereabouts of Wells and Chapman would see more than 2,000 phone calls and tips received from the public, with all information obtained entered into the investigation's HOLMES 2 database. A candlelight vigil was held by the community on 7 August. Shortly after the children's disappearance, Staffordshire Police contacted their counterparts to report their suspicions the girls' likely abduction may be linked to an abduction which had occurred in their jurisdiction the previous year, in which a six-year-old girl had survived an indecent assault by an abductor who was still at large and whose green Ford Mondeo was identified as having number- plates which had earlier been stolen in Peterborough. The individual responsible for this abduction and assault was also believed to have followed a 12-year-old girl in the same area, although in this instance, his car had been fitted with number-plates which had been stolen in Nottinghamshire. The same vehicle had recently been sighted in Glatton, Cambridgeshire. This information was later included in a televised appeal pertaining to the children's disappearance on the BBC's Crimewatch, although this potential lead ultimately failed to bear fruition or relevance. Sightings Several members of the public reported having seen the children in the early days of the investigation. One individual, Mark Tuck, informed investigators that as he had driven past the girls upon Sand Street in Soham town centre at approximately 6:30 p.m. on 4 August, his attention had been drawn toward their Manchester United replica shirts, causing him to remark to his wife, Lucy: \\"Look! There's two little Beckhams over there.\\" A young woman named Karen Greenwood also reported seeing the girls walking \\"arm in arm\\" along College Road approximately two minutes later. Another woman living in the nearby village of Little Thetford claimed to have seen two girls whose appearance and clothing matched those of Wells and Chapman walking past her home the morning after the children had been reported missing. Police also received statements regarding a white van that had been seen in Soham on the evening of the children's disappearance. Investigators located and seized this vehicle from a caravan park in Wentworth on 7 August, although this lead ultimately proved fruitless. On 12 August, police launched a media appeal to trace the driver of a four-door, dark green saloon car seen struggling with two young girls by a taxi driver who stated he had observed this individual \\"thrashing his arms\\" as he struggled to either placate or contain two female children inside his vehicle as he had driven upon the A142 south of Soham towards Newmarket on the early evening of 12 August. The following evening, a jogger alerted police to two mounds of recently disturbed earth he had encountered at Warren Hill, just outside Newmarket. The initial speculation by this individual had been that these mounds of earth may be the impromptu burial locations of the two missing girls. However, an overnight examination of this location revealed the two mounds of earth to simply be badger setts. One individual who claimed to have spoken with the girls immediately before their disappearance was 28-year-old Huntley, who informed investigators on 5 August he had engaged in a brief conversation with both girls on his doorstep the previous afternoon. According to Huntley, Wells and Chapman had briefly enquired as to whether his partner, Carr, had been successful in a recent application for a full-time teaching assistant position at their school. When he had replied Carr had been unsuccessful, one of the girls had said, \\"Tell her we're sorry\\" before both children had walked along College Street in the direction of a bridge leading towards Clay Street. Police were suspicious of Huntley's account of the children's disappearance. His house was searched by a single police officer on 5 August. Although no incriminating evidence was discovered on this date, this officer noticed numerous items of clothing upon the washing line despite the fact it had been raining. In reference to the evident extensive cleaning of the house's interior, Huntley stated: \\"Excuse the dining room. We had a flood.\\" This officer was unconvinced by Huntley's claims and suspicious of his agitated demeanour, and he remained a strong suspect. One day later, on 6 August, Huntley drove from Soham to Grimsby to pick up Carr. Shortly before the two returned to College Close, a neighbour of Carr's mother named Marion Clift observed the couple standing at the rear of the vehicle, with the boot open. According to Clift, a \\"pale, shaking\\" Huntley had simply gazed into the boot for several moments, while Carr stood alongside him, her head bowed, weeping. When Huntley became aware of Clift's presence, he had abruptly closed the boot. Media interviews In the weeks following the disappearances, Huntley reluctantly granted several television interviews to media outlets such as Sky News and the regional BBC News programme, BBC Look East, speaking of the general shock in the local community and his apparent dismay at being the last individual to see the children alive. In one interview granted to Sky News correspondent Jeremy Thompson during the second week of the search, he claimed to be holding on to a \\"glimmer of hope\\" the children would be found safe and well, claiming that he had last seen the girls walking in the direction of a local library. Having actively participated in the search for the children, Huntley also made efforts to ingratiate police officers; regularly asking questions as to how their investigation was progressing and just how long DNA evidence could survive before deteriorating. One of these officers observed three vertical scratches upon Huntley's left jaw, each measuring approximately three centimetres, which he claimed had been recently inflicted by his dog. Carr was also interviewed by the press during the second week of the search for the children. In this live interview, Carr corroborated Huntley's claims to have conversed with the children on their doorstep as she had been bathing before both girls had walked away from their doorstep, adding: \\"I only wish we had asked them where they were going ... if only we knew then what we know now. Then we could have stopped them, or done something about it.\\"Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 187 Discussing the individual personalities of each girl, Carr described Wells as being the \\"more feminine\\" of the two, adding that Chapman was \\"more of a tomboy\\" and that on one occasion, she had jokingly remarked to Chapman how, unlike many of her friends, she seldom wore a skirt. To this question, Carr stated the child had expressed her desire to be a bridesmaid at her own future wedding, adding how Chapman had said she would willingly wear a dress for such an occasion.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 188 Carr also displayed a thank-you card to this reporter which had recently been given to her by Wells on the last day of the school year. Referring to Wells in the past tense, Carr stated, \\"She was just lovely, really lovely\\", before making a direct appeal to the children: \\"Just get on the phone and just come home. Or if somebody's got them, just let them go.\\" By the second week of the children's disappearance, Huntley had begun to lose weight and vividly displayed symptoms of insomnia.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 11 To one officer, he begged the question: \\"You think I've done it? I was the last person to see them!\\" before beginning to weep. His erratic and distressful behaviour led to his being prescribed anti-depressants on 13 August. Police suspicions On 16 August, twelve days after the children's disappearance, Huntley and Carr were first questioned by police. Both were questioned for approximately seven hours. Each provided formal witness statements to investigators before being placed in a safe house in the village of Histon.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 215 By this date, police had received information from several Grimsby residents who had recognised Huntley in the television interviews he had granted to the media; these individuals recalled that he had been accused of rape several years earlier. Other individuals recalled that, contrary to her own televised claims, Carr had in fact been socialising in Grimsby town centre on the night that the girls had disappeared, and not at home in Soham as she had indicated in the interview she had granted to the media. Soham Village College. Police discovered charred remnants of the children's clothes at this location on 16 August The same evening, police conducted a thorough search of both 5 College Close and the grounds of Soham Village College where Huntley worked as a senior caretaker as the couple remained under police watch at separate locations outside Soham. Although each room of Huntley's home had evidently been recently and meticulously cleaned with what was later described as being a \\"lemony\\" cleaning fluid, these searches located numerous items declared as being of \\"major importance\\" to the ongoing investigation. Although the evidence and artifacts were not made public at the time, the items recovered from the school grounds included items of clothing the girls had been wearing when last seen, including their charred and cut Manchester United shirts, which were recovered from a bin within a hangar at Huntley's place of work. Fibres recovered upon these items of clothing proved to be a precise match to samples retrieved from both Huntley's body, his clothing and from 5 College Close. Furthermore, his fingerprints were recovered from the bin. Huntley's car was also subjected to a detailed forensic examination on 16 August. The forensic examination of this vehicle revealed the car had also been recently, extensively cleaned, although traces of a distinctive mixture of brick dust, chalk and concrete of precisely the same type used to pave the road leading to where the girls' bodies would be discovered were found around the wheel arches and upon and around the pedals. Furthermore, a cover from the rear seat was missing, and the lining of the boot had been recently removed and replaced with an ill-fitting section of household carpet. Arrest Having discovered the children's clothes at Soham Village College, police decided to arrest Huntley and Carr. Both were arrested on suspicion of abduction and murder at 4:30 a.m. on 17 August. Although investigators had previously (on 7 August) publicly stated they strongly believed the children had been abducted, they publicly announced their strong suspicions both girls had been murdered. During initial questioning, Huntley refused to answer questions and appeared evasive, confused, and emotionally detached; occasionally drooling throughout police attempts to question him in an effort to feign symptoms of mental illness. This tactic left police with no option but to initially refer Huntley to a mental hospital to undergo an extensive psychological evaluation. By contrast, Carr quickly confessed to detectives she had lied about her whereabouts and her partner's actions on 4 August as, shortly before she had returned to Soham from Grimsby three days later, Huntley had claimed to her in a phone call to have seen the two girls shortly before their disappearance, admitting: \\"The thing is, Maxine, they came in our house!\\"Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 157 According to Carr, Huntley then informed her the children had entered their home in order that Wells could stanch her nosebleed. He then claimed to her Chapman had sat upon their bed as he had helped Wells control the bleeding from her nose before both girls had left their home. Referencing one of the 1998 rapes he had committed but had earlier claimed to her to have been falsely accused of in this phone call, Huntley then began voicing concerns as to again being falsely accused of involvement on this occasion, also claiming his previous arrest had caused him to suffer a nervous breakdown. She had therefore later agreed to concoct a false story with her partner to support his version of events. After being informed of the discovery of the children's bodies and the ample evidence attesting to Huntley's guilt, including his fingerprints being recovered from the bin in which the children's clothes had been found, Carr burst into tears, shouting: \\"No! He can't have been! It can't have been! He hasn't done it!\\" Despite these revelations, Carr initially remained emotionally attached to Huntley and professed her belief in his innocence to both the police and her family.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley pp. 258-259 Discoveries At approximately 12:30 p.m. on 17 August, a 48-year-old gamekeeper named Keith Pryer discovered the bodies of both girls lying side by side in a five feet deep irrigation ditch close to a pheasant pen near the perimeter fence of RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk;Crimes That Shocked The World p. 65 a location more than 10 miles east of Soham. Pryer had noticed what he later described as an \\"unusual and unpleasant smell\\" in the vicinity several days earlier; when returning to the area with two friends on 17 August, he had decided to investigate the cause of this odour. Walking through an overgrown verge approximately 600 yards from a partially tarmacked road, Pryer and one of his companions, Adrian Lawrence, discovered the children's bodies. Immediately upon viewing the corpses, Lawrence turned in the direction of his girlfriend, Helen Sawyer, and shouted: \\"Don't come any closer, Helen! Get back in the van!\\"Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 2 Lawrence immediately reported the discoveries to police. Both girls had been missing for thirteen days when their bodies were found, and both corpses were in an advanced state of decomposition. In an apparent effort to destroy forensic evidence, the murderer or murderers had attempted to burn both bodies. In addition, no clear footprints were discovered at the crime scene.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 137 Despite the perpetrator(s) efforts to destroy evidence and hinder identification, investigators rapidly deduced who the two victims most likely were, and that both had not died at the location of their discovery. Numerous hairs later determined to belong to Chapman were also discovered on a tree branch close to the location of the girls' bodies. The following day, a Cambridgeshire Deputy Chief Constable named Keith Hodder released a press statement to the media confirming the discovery of the children's bodies, adding that both families had been informed of the developments and that although positive formal identification would take several days, investigators were as \\"certain as [they] possibly could be\\" the bodies were those of Wells and Chapman. Ely Cathedral. A service to remember and celebrate the lives of the children was held at this location on 30 August 2002 Identification On 21 August, the bodies of both girls were conclusively identified via DNA testing. Nine days later, a public memorial service was held at Ely Cathedral to remember and celebrate the lives of both girls. This service was attended by approximately 2,000 people, including the girls' classmates, teachers and the six family liaison officers who had provided 24-hour service for both families. The Reverend Tim Alban Jones officiated at this service, informing all present: \\"Would not the best and most lasting memorial to these two lovely young girls be a change for the better in how we behave towards each other? Today's service is a small milestone in our shared journey of grief and sorrow ... it is our hope that we may perhaps draw a line under one phase of our grieving and begin to look forward.\\"Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley pp. 237-238 An online book of condolence attracted more than 31,000 messages of grief and sympathy and on 24 August, football clubs across Britain held a minute's silence prior to commencing scheduled football matches. Inquest The formal inquest into the children's deaths was held at Shire Hall, Cambridge, on 23 August 2002. At this hearing, coroner David Morris testified the bodies of both girls were partially skeletonized, and that no precise cause of death could be determined for either decedent, although Morris stated that the most likely cause of death of both girls had been asphyxiation. Furthermore, Morris stated the girls had almost certainly not died at the location where their bodies had been discovered, and that both bodies had been placed at this location within 24 hours of their deaths. These conclusions were physically supported by an analysis of the shoots of nettles located at the crime scene which enabled forensic ecologist and palynologist Patricia Wiltshire to approximate that the actual time the bodies had been placed at this location had been almost two weeks prior. Formal charges By 20 August, investigators had established sufficient physical evidence from Huntley's home, vehicle and Soham Village College to formally charge him with two counts of murder. He was formally charged with these offences while detained for observation at Rampton Secure Hospital, and all preliminary hearings against him were postponed until the conclusions of his mental health assessment. Carr was also charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice on this date. She was further charged with two counts of assisting an offender on 17 January 2003. While held on remand at Holloway Prison, Carr regularly enquired as to Huntley's welfare,Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 15 and is known to have penned several letters in which she professed her continued love for him. Carr would only sever all contact with Huntley in December 2002. Mental health assessment To determine Huntley's state of mental health, he was detained under Section 48 of the Mental Health Act for almost two months at Rampton Secure Hospital. Here, his mental state was extensively assessed by Dr Christopher Clark, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, to determine whether he suffered from any form of mental illness and whether he was mentally competent to stand trial. Clark concluded in October that, although psychopathic,Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 14 Huntley did not suffer from any major mental or psychotic illness. Resultingly, on 8 October, Huntley was deemed mentally competent to stand trial. Having been declared mentally fit to stand trial, Huntley was faced with a sentence of life imprisonment if a jury could be convinced of his guilt. He was subsequently transferred to a segregation unit at Woodhill prison in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. On 9 June 2003, he attempted suicide by consuming 29 antidepressants which he had accumulated in his cell. Although staff initially feared Huntley might die as a result of this overdose, he was returned to his prison cell within 48 hours. Huntley was later transferred to London's Belmarsh prison. Funerals The funeral services for Wells and Chapman were conducted on consecutive days in September 2002. Services for both children were held at St Andrew's parish church and both were officiated by the Reverend Tim Alban Jones. Both girls were laid to rest in private ceremonies attended by only family and close friends. At the request of both families that their privacy be respected, the media refrained from reporting upon either service. Pretrial hearing At a preliminary hearing held at the Old Bailey on 16 June 2003, Huntley pleaded not guilty to the formal charges of murdering Wells and Chapman, although he chose to plead guilty to the charge both stood accused of: conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Carr pleaded not guilty to the charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice and assisting an offender.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 264 Trial The trial of Huntley for the murders of Wells and Chapman opened at the Old Bailey on 5 November 2003 before Justice Alan Moses; Huntley was charged with two counts of murder, to which he entered a formal plea of not guilty. Carr was charged with two counts of assisting an offender and one count of perverting the course of justice. In his opening statement on behalf of the Crown, prosecutor Richard Latham QC described the last day of the friends' lives and how, by \\"pure chance\\", they had happened to pass by Huntley's home at a time when Carr was not present. Latham contended Huntley had deliberately lured the girls into his home at approximately 6:37 p.m. and that both girls had been murdered shortly thereafter, with cell site analysis proving Huntley had switched off Chapman's mobile phone either outside his home or within the grounds of Soham Village College after both girls had been murdered. Latham further emphasised that mobile phone records and eyewitness accounts proved Carr had been in Grimsby on the evening in question, thus proving the statements she had given to police and press alike had been false. Latham then outlined the details of how Keith Pryer and his two friends had discovered the children's bodies on 17 August at a location Huntley had known to be restricted via his plane spotting hobby and thus where they were unlikely to be discovered. Referencing the likely motive for the girls' murder and the actual cause of death of each decedent, Latham stated that due to the extensive state of decomposition of the bodies, the coroner had been unable to determine the precise cause of death of either child, or whether the girls had been sexually assaulted before or after death. However, Latham stated neither body showed signs of compressive neck injuries, knife wounds, drugging or poisoning, and that both girls had most likely died of asphyxiation. In a direct reference to Huntley's claims both girls' deaths had been accidental, Latham stated that \\"only one person knows what happened\\" after the friends entered his home. However, he further stressed the cause of death was undoubtedly murder, adding: \\"Ten-year-old girls don't just drop dead.\\" In reference to Carr's attempts to pervert the course of justice, Latham stated that \\"as surely as night follows day\\" the two had conspired to concoct a false alibi to divert suspicion from Huntley, although he warned the jury Carr could only be convicted of assisting an offender if they believed she had known Huntley had murdered the girls, adding her actual motive for providing lies to police with reference to the charge of perverting the course of justice was irrelevant. Over the course of three days, Latham outlined the efforts of both defendants to divert suspicion away from Huntley, and Huntley's own efforts to destroy all physical and circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime, although despite these efforts, investigators had retrieved enough evidence to prove the children had been murdered within his home and—within approximately twelve hours of their deaths—transported in his vehicle to the location where their bodies would be discovered on 17 August. This had included ample fibre evidence retrieved from Huntley's vehicle, clothes and carpets which had been a \\"precise match\\" to the Manchester United shirts the girls had been wearing at the time of their disappearance. Latham then closed his opening statement by again bringing the jury's attention to Huntley's claim both deaths had been accidental, remarking, \\"We pose this question: Two of them?\\" He then speculated Huntley's defence counsel may try and argue that he had been confused, commenting: \\"In that case, they would have to consider [Huntley's] behaviour over the fortnight between the girls' disappearance and their bodies being found.\\"Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley pp. 268-269 Testimony pertaining to the forensic evidence linking Huntley was heard on 24 November. On this date, a forensic scientist named Helen Davey testified as to the biological evidence recovered from the girls' clothing, footwear and a dishcloth discovered within the hangar at Soham Village College on 16 August. Davey testified she had found minute traces of blood and saliva upon these garments, although she had found no positive traces of semen upon the clothing. She further explained the reason for the lack of any definitive traces of semen being discovered could have been a result of the charred and melted condition of the articles she had inspected. A scenes of crime officer also testified on this date that, despite Huntley's exhaustive efforts to remove any physical evidence of his crime from his home, a forensic examination had revealed several traces of blood spattering about the hallway and main entrance to the master bedroom. Defendants' testimony On 1 December, Huntley testified before the court in his own defence. Responding to questioning by his own defence counsel, Stephen Coward QC, Huntley admitted both girls had died in his house but denied that either death had been intentional. According to Huntley, he, Wells and Chapman had entered his bathroom to stem a mild nosebleed Wells had been suffering when the girls had walked by his home. The bath was already filled with water as he had been cleaning his dog that afternoon. In the bathroom, he had slipped and accidentally knocked Wells into his bath while helping her stanch her nosebleed, and this unintentional act had caused her to drown as he himself had simply \\"panicked and froze\\". He further claimed Chapman had witnessed this accident and began repeatedly screaming, \\"You pushed her!\\" and that he had then accidentally suffocated her while attempting to stifle her screaming, which had preoccupied his attention as opposed to ensuring Wells did not drown. By the time his state of panic had waned, it had been too late to save the lives of either of the children and that his first coherent memory had been of himself sitting on his vomit-stained landing close to Chapman's body. When questioned as to his failure to call emergency services and subsequent, extensive efforts to both destroy evidence and divert suspicion from himself, Huntley insisted he had first become preoccupied with whether the police and public alike would believe the girls' deaths had actually been accidental, and he had therefore decided to conceal all evidence of the deaths as opposed to either notifying police or paramedics. Weeping, Huntley admitted responsibility for both deaths, but repeated his insistence both deaths had been accidental. He further tearfully claimed he had not attempted to feign insanity upon his arrest; insisting the trauma of the children's deaths had temporarily erased his memory and his being in the presence of police had caused his mind to temporarily seize. On 3 December, Carr took the stand to testify in her own defence. Responding to questioning from her own defence counsel, Michael Hubbard QC, Carr briefly discussed her initial acquaintance with Huntley, their subsequent relationship and plans to start a family once they both obtained financial stability before Hubbard directed his questioning toward her return to Soham on 6 August and her discovering Huntley had recently washed their bedding and had evidently cleaned sections of the house. To these questions, Carr explained that her first impression had been that Huntley had \\"had a woman in the house\\", adding their bedding had been washed shortly before 4 August. Carr further testified to having noted a crack in the enamel of the bathtub which had not been there when she had travelled to Grimsby four days previously. When questioned as to why she had then assisted Huntley in extensively cleaning their home in the days following the children's murder, Carr claimed she had done so as she had always been \\"obsessive about tidiness.\\"Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 278 Questioned as to the efforts she had subsequently made to mislead both police and the media to divert suspicion from her partner, Carr emphasised she had only lied to police, the media and \\"anyone who asks\\" to protect Huntley, who had repeatedly assured her of his innocence of any wrongdoing and his fear or being \\"fitted up\\" by police for the girls' disappearance should they discover the 1998 rape allegation made against him. She further claimed to have referred to Wells and Chapman using past tense merely because she had worked with the children in the past. Carr further claimed she had initially attempted to persuade Huntley to contact police and \\"be open\\" as to his claims to have invited the children into his home in order that Wells could stanch her nosebleed, but that he had refused to do so, as inviting children into their home had been a violation of the rules imposed by St Andrew's Primary School. She further explained her focus had therefore been to protect Huntley's job and reputation, adding that had she known of Huntley's actual guilt, she would never have attempted to provide him with a false alibi, stating to her counsel: \\"If, for a minute, I [had known] or believed he'd murdered either of those girls I would have been horrified.\\" Concluding his questioning, Hubbard cautioned the jury not to succumb to the temptation of judging Carr's morality, but to consider her state of mind prior to her arrest when considering whether the lies she had told warranted any criminal liability, stating she had \\"done no wrong\\" on the date of the children's murder, and had not returned to Soham until 6 August. Closing arguments On 10 December, counsels for both prosecution and defence delivered their closing arguments to the jury. Latham delivered his closing argument on behalf of the prosecution by describing both Huntley and Carr as \\"accomplished liars\\" before outlining the prosecution's case both children had to die to satisfy Huntley's \\"selfish self-interest\\" before Huntley—with Carr's support—had embarked on twelve days of \\"cynical deception\\", with Carr only revealing the truth about her lies to police after being informed of the discovery of the children's bodies. Referencing Huntley's likely motive for the murders and his claims at trial that both deaths had been accidental, Latham stated: \\"We invite you to reject the accounts of both deaths [being accidental] as desperate lies; the only way out for him. We suggest that this whole business in the house was motivated by something sexual. But, whatever he initiated, plainly went wrong. Therefore, in this ruthless man's mind, both girls had to die in his own selfish self-interest.\\" Referencing Carr's conscious efforts to deceive the police and media alike, Latham simply stated: \\"She had the prospect of marriage, a baby, a nice home and a new start. She preferred to do what she could to make the best of the position she was in. That involved at all costs protecting Ian Huntley.\\"Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley pp. 277-279 Following the conclusion of the prosecution's closing argument, Coward delivered his argument on behalf of the defence. He conceded his client was indeed guilty of physical responsibility for the girls' actual deaths—as Huntley had admitted—and therefore deserved punishment, although he argued the prosecution had failed to provide definitive proof Huntley had actually intended to actually murder the children or cause them actual bodily harm. Furthermore, Coward contended the prosecution had failed to provide conclusive evidence to support their claim that Huntley's actual motive for the murders had been sexual. Coward concluded his closing argument by requesting the jury deliver a verdict of manslaughter in relation to both deaths. Following the conclusion of both counsels' closing argument, Judge Moses announced the jury would begin their deliberations on 12 December. Convictions The jury deliberated for four days before reaching their verdicts against both defendants.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 279 On 17 December 2003, they returned a majority verdict of guilty on two counts of murder against Huntley. He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of imprisonment to be imposed by the Lord Chief Justice at a later date. Huntley's face displayed no emotion as the verdict was announced, although the mothers of both Wells and Chapman burst into tears.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 280 Although Carr willingly pleaded guilty to the charge of perverting the course of justice, she pleaded not guilty to the charge of assisting an offender. The jury accepted Carr's insistence that she had only lied to the police and media in order to protect Huntley because, prior to their arrest, she had actually believed his claims of innocence. As such, she was found not guilty of assisting an offender. Carr was sentenced to serve three-and-a-half years in prison for perverting the course of justice. Minutes after the convictions, the parents of both girls granted an interview to the media. Discussing Huntley's mindset, Leslie Chapman opined: \\"I think he was a time bomb waiting to go off and both our girls were in the wrong place at the wrong time. I hope the next time I see him, it will be like we saw our daughters—and it will be in a coffin.\\"Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 281 Motive Huntley's actual motive for killing the children is unknown, although minutes prior to encountering Wells and Chapman, he is known to have engaged in a heated argument with Carr, culminating in his slamming the telephone down. Huntley had allegedly suspected Carr of conducting affairs throughout their relationship, leading both his mother and some police officers to suspect Huntley had killed the two girls in a fit of jealous rage. However, prior to his trial, a criminal profile had resulted in his being ruled by an eminent criminal psychologist as a \\"latent, predatory paedophile\\" who had chosen to lure Wells and Chapman into his home upon a moment of opportunism. The prosecution had contended at Huntley's trial a likely sexual motive existed for the murders. Testimony from Carr had indicated her suspicions sexual activity had occurred in their home in her absence as, although Huntley had insisted throughout the entirety of their relationship that Carr perform all domestic chores, she had observed that he had washed the quilts, pillow cases and sheets of their bed in her absence. However, pathological evidence retrieved from the bodies indicating at least one of the girls had been subjected to a sexual assault either before or after her murder was not disclosed to the jury at Huntley's trial. The reason for this decision had been that both bodies were too extensively decomposed and damaged by fire to enable a conclusive determination of either the actual cause of death or if either girl had been subjected to a sexual assault. Although prosecutors at Huntley's trial contended he had intentionally lured the children into his house with a likely sexual motivation, investigators found no evidence of premeditation in relation to the murders.Court Number One: The Old Bailey Trials that Defined Modern Britain ch. 11 However, at the September 2005 hearing in which the minimum term Huntley should serve before any form of parole eligibility was decided, Justice Alan Moses stated: \\"There is a likelihood of [a] sexual motivation, but there was no evidence of sexual activity, and it remains no more than a likelihood.\\" Psychology Prior to murdering Wells and Chapman, Huntley had established an extensive record of consensual and unconsensual sexual activity with females—many of whom had been beneath the legal age of consent. He would typically use guile and/or force to achieve his desires. Between 1992 and 2002, he had committed numerous acts of physical and sexual violence against women and children for which he had been legally unpunished. The youngest girl Huntley is known to have raped had been 12 years old, with another girl he had attempted to rape being 11 years old.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p.34 Following his arrest, several former girlfriends and sexual partners stated that, although Huntley presented himself as a charming and considerate individual in the early stages of a relationship, he would become domineering and violent upon having established a sense of control.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 37 Having established control over his partner, Huntley severely restricted and supervised any contact she held with her family or social acquaintances. He would also emotionally blackmail his partner if he detected any signs of her developing resistance to his control or indicating a desire to leave him.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 45 According to one columnist, the fact that Huntley had remained unpunished for these often blatant and continuous acts had embellished Huntley's confidence and reinforced his domineering, misogynistic mindset in addition to fuelling his recidivism. Psychologists have also determined Huntley has mentally blocked any attempts to accept either the reality or enormity of his actions pertaining to his repeated violence against females in order that he may cope with the consequences of his actions. Sentencing The minimum term of imprisonment Huntley should serve before being considered eligible for parole was decided on 29 September 2005. On this date, High Court judge Mr Justice Moses announced that Huntley must remain in prison until he had served a minimum of 40 years' imprisonment; a term which would not allow parole eligibility until 2042, by which time Huntley would be 68 years old. In setting this minimum term of imprisonment, Mr Justice Moses stated: \\"The order I make offers little or no hope of the defendant's eventual release.\\" Huntley avoided eligibility for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, as the passing of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 had been just one day after his conviction; thus taking effect on 18 December 2003 and applying solely to murders committed on or after this date. Ian Huntley Ian Kevin Huntley was born in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, on 31 January 1974, the first of two sons born to Kevin Huntley and his wife, Lynda (née Nixon). The Huntley family were working class and at the time of the birth of their first child, lodged with Lynda's parents in Grimsby. Following the birth of their second child, Wayne, in August 1975, the family moved into a rented property in Immingham, where Huntley attended school.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 19 Huntley was a timid child, and something of a mother's boy. In his early years, he frequently threw tantrums in order to obtain his mother's attention, although childhood friends would later remark how markedly afraid he was of his stern father.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 22 At both primary and secondary school, Huntley was an average scholar. He was regarded as a loner, an oddball and an attention seeker by his peers, and became a frequent target for bullies.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 20 The bullying Huntley endured escalated when he entered Healing Comprehensive School at age 11, resulting in his academic performance waning. As a result, Huntley's parents enroled their son in Immingham Comprehensive at age 13. He was again the target of physical and verbal bullying at this school, although he did form a few friendships via a shared interest in computer games. Huntley also enjoyed football, and was an avid supporter of Manchester United. At the urging of his father, Huntley joined the Air Training Corps at age 13. His activities with this youth organisation fuelled an interest Huntley had held since childhood for aeroplanes, and he seriously considered a future career with the Royal Air Force. Huntley also developed a hobby of plane spotting. Via this hobby, he became familiar with the environs of RAF Lakenheath.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 24 Despite having few friends, Huntley did form several relationships with girls while attending Immingham Comprehensive. Each of these girls was at least one year younger than himself, although none of these relationships lasted longer than a few weeks.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 25 In 1990, Huntley finished his schooling, obtaining five GCSE passes. He chose not to enrol in college or university and instead committed himself to finding employment. Between 1990 and 1996, Huntley worked in a succession of menial jobs, although he seldom held any job for an extensive period of time. He also viewed himself as something of a ladies' man, and was scrupulous with regards to his personal appearance and personal hygiene.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 10 Marriage In June 1994, Huntley began dating 18-year-old Claire Evans, with whom he first became acquainted through his employment at a local Heinz factory. After approximately two months of courtship, Huntley proposed to Evans. The couple married at Grimsby Registry Office on 28 January 1995, although the marriage lasted scarcely one week due to Huntley's volatile temper. On one occasion, he is known to have beaten his wife so extensively she suffered a miscarriage. Shortly after their separation, Huntley's wife formed a relationship with and later married Huntley's younger brother, Wayne. Previous criminal offences In March 1996, Huntley was charged with burglary. In this offence, he and an accomplice allegedly broke into the house of a neighbour in Grimsby and stole numerous electrical goods, jewellery and cash. Although this case reached court, the prosecution offered no evidence, resulting in a judge ordering the offence to lie on file. Between August 1995 and May 1996, Huntley established numerous sexual relationships with teenage girls, all of whom were under the legal age of consent. Three of these girls were aged 15, and one 13. One of these girls would become pregnant, and gave birth to a baby girl in 1998. Although reported to police on three occasions, Huntley was not charged for any of these offences as each of the girls denied having engaged in sex with Huntley. Each refused to file criminal complaints and/or rebuffed offers of help from social services. Despite not being charged with any of these offences, rumours of Huntley's sexual interest in underage girls soon became community gossip, and he was regularly insulted by neighbours and work colleagues. As a result, Huntley began rebuffing any offers to socialise with work colleagues for fear of being attacked while alone in their company. In April 1998, Huntley was arrested on suspicion of raping an 18-year-old woman. He admitted engaging in sex with the claimant, but claimed the act had been consensual. He was not formally charged with this offence. Just one month later, Huntley was charged and remanded in custody at HM Prison Wolds for one week after another 18-year-old Grimsby woman claimed to have also been beaten and raped by Huntley while walking home from a local nightclub. This complainant further stated Huntley had threatened to kill her before assaulting her. Huntley admitted engaging in sex with this woman, although he insisted the act had been consensual. The criminal charge was dropped a week later after the Crown Prosecution Service, having examined CCTV footage from the nightclub and environs and finding evidence of the two socialising within the nightclub, determined insufficient evidence existed to secure a conviction for this offence. As a result of this criminal complaint, further rumours regarding Huntley's sexual violence also became community gossip,Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 49 resulting in Huntley being fired from his job and forcing him to move into his mother's home. Furthermore, he was forbidden from initiating contact with his baby daughter or her mother. In July 1998, police were notified Huntley had also sexually assaulted an 11-year-old girl in September 1997; having also threatened to kill the child if she informed her mother. He was never charged with this offence, although he subsequently confessed to this attack in April 2007. The final criminal allegation against Huntley prior to his committing the Soham murders dates from July 1999. In this instance, a woman was raped and Huntley–by this stage suspected by police as being a serial sex offender–was interviewed. Huntley supplied a DNA sample to assist in their enquiries, with Carr also providing an alibi to support his claims of innocence. The victim of this assault subsequently stated her belief that Huntley had not been the perpetrator of her assault. (This would prove to be the sole instance in which a suspected or proven victim of Huntley had not identified or named him as being her assailant.) By 2001, Huntley's proven and alleged criminal activities had been reported to Humberside Police on ten separate occasions and to the social services on five occasions. Acquaintance with Maxine Carr In February 1999, Huntley became acquainted with 22-year-old Maxine Carr, whom he first encountered in a Grimsby nightclub. On this occasion, Carr had been drinking with a former boyfriend named Paul Selby when Huntley—a casual acquaintance of Selby—approached the two and immediately initiated a conversation.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 70 According to Carr, she was \\"instantly attracted\\" to Huntley's self-certain and pleasant persona, and agreed to begin dating him that same evening. Within four weeks of their acquaintance, she had moved into Huntley's Barton-upon-Humber flat, and the couple informed relatives of their eagerness to start a family. Shortly thereafter, the couple moved to a ground-floor flat in Scunthorpe, where Huntley formally proposed to Carr in June 1999.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 78 Although publicly a besotted couple, Huntley was notably possessive of Carr, and is known to have both emotionally abused and/or physically assaulted her on numerous occasions, often culminating in Carr returning to live with her mother before Huntley persuaded her to return to live with him. Furthermore, both Huntley and Carr are known to have conducted affairs throughout the course of their relationship. Noting how Carr often became flirtatious whenever she had consumed alcohol, Huntley actively sought to minimise any opportunity for her to drink or otherwise socialise outside his presence for fear of her cheating on him with other males. At the time of their acquaintance, Huntley temporarily worked for an insurance company in Market Rasen. He soon found alternate employment at a finance company in Binbrook while Carr maintained her employment packing fish at a local fish processing factory. The couple would relocate to East Anglia in early 2001. Shortly thereafter, Huntley secured employment as a bartender. By 2001, Huntley had re-established contact with his father, who worked as a school caretaker in the village of Littleport, near Ely. He would regularly travel to Cambridgeshire from East Anglia on his days free from work to help his father, and soon developed aspirations to become a school caretaker himself. Via his father, Huntley learned of a school caretaker vacancy in nearby Soham Village College in the summer of 2001. He applied for and secured employment as a senior caretaker at this secondary school in September 2001, supervising the work of four other employees. Maxine Carr Maxine Carr was born Maxine Ann Capp. She was born in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, on 16 February 1977, the second of two daughters born to Alfred Capp and his wife, Shirley (née Suddaby).Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 52 The marriage between Capp's parents was marred by frequent arguments. Following a heated argument in the summer of 1979, Shirley ordered her husband to leave the household. Shortly thereafter, she and her daughters relocated to the village of Keelby. Alfred seldom maintained contact with his wife and children, and refused to provide any financial support for his daughters. Capp and her older sister, Hayley (born 1967), were largely raised by their mother and grandparents. The family regularly experienced severe financial difficulties, although Shirley would later state she \\"spoiled\\" her daughters to the best of her financial ability.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 53 As a child and adolescent, Capp was viewed by her peers as something of a timid outcast, with few friends. She performed poorly academically, although she always held aspirations to become a teacher.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 83 By the time Capp entered adolescence, she was slightly overweight, leading her to become insecure about her physical appearance. Although she had shunned the company of boys as a child, as a teenager, she craved—but seldom received—the attention of boys her age, occasionally leading to bouts of binge eatingBeyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 56 in addition to her developing the habit of self-harming. By age 15, Capp weighed more than 10 stones, resulting in her becoming the recipient of bullying by her classmates. In an effort to lose weight, she developed a habit of forcing herself to vomit after eating. This habit led to Capp developing anorexia by the age of 16, with her weight at one stage plummeting to just six stones, and her mother forcing her to eat in order for her to regain weight. In 1993, Capp finished her schooling, having obtained no qualifications. She briefly worked alongside her mother in a fish processing plant as she considered which career path she should choose before enrolling at the Grimsby Institute of Further & Higher Education, having chosen to study general care. Capp obtained her diploma in 1996. The same year, she and her mother moved from Keelby back to Grimsby. Shortly thereafter, she briefly obtained employment as a junior care assistant at a care home for the elderly in Grimsby before opting to return to work alongside her mother as a labourer at Bluecrest fish processing plant.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 61 Several of Capp's colleagues would later remark how they found her to be a distant and immature figure with few friends and few hobbies. To one colleague, Capp would talk incessantly about her dreams of leaving this employment and embarking on a teaching career. By the time Capp had obtained employment at Bluecrest, she had garnered sufficient courage to begin dating men, although none of these relationships lasted more than a few months. Notably shy and reserved and prone to wear clothing which concealed her figure when sober, Capp became markedly flirtatious when having consumed alcohol, and is known to have occasionally engaged in exhibitionism in addition to frequently engaging in one-night stands with individuals she encountered in pubs and clubs. While Capp resided with her mother in Grimsby, she unofficially adopted the surname Benson. She later legally changed her surname to Carr in an apparent effort to distance herself from her father. Soham employment In September 2001, Huntley responded to a job advertisement relating to a vacant position of senior caretaker at Soham Village College. He applied for this position using the alias Ian Nixon.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 81 No form of background check was conducted before or after this job interview, and although Huntley lacked extensive experience in this form of employment, his application for this position was successful. His employers assisted in his securing the tenancy of 5 College Close, and he and Carr relocated to Soham in late September. Huntley began his employment at Soham Village College on 26 November. He worked as a senior caretaker at these premises until the date of his arrest. In February 2002, Huntley secured part-time employment for Carr at St Andrew's Primary School, although Carr did lie as to her academic qualifications when applying for this position. Although this employment was initially voluntary work, Carr later became a teaching assistant in the school's Year 5 class. Wells and Chapman became two of the pupils she taught, and both girls were notably fond of her. In July 2002, Carr applied for a vacant full-time teaching assistant position at St Andrew's Primary School. She received notification on 23 July that her application was unsuccessful. One of the children to express dismay at this decision was Wells who, having broken down in tears upon learning Carr's application for the teaching position had been unsuccessful, had presented her with a hand-drawn card, depicting a smiling face, in which she stated: \\"I'll miss you a lot. Thank you! C ya! Miss ya! Luv Holly.\\" Maxine Carr, seen here on 8 August 2002 displaying the hand-drawn card given to her by Holly Wells. This card was made approximately two weeks before the child's murder.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 190 Summer 2002 By the summer of 2002, the physical relationship between Huntley and Carr had begun to deteriorate. By Huntley's own later admission, he had become sexually frustrated, and he had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade a married colleague to date him on the weekend Carr visited her mother in Grimsby.Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 107 At 9:53 a.m. on 4 August, Huntley attempted to phone Carr, although she did not answer her mobile phone. Carr only replied to his missed call at 6:23 p.m. This four-minute phone call escalated into a heated argument, culminating in Huntley angrily terminating the phone call after she informed him of her intentions to again socialise in Grimsby that evening. Four minutes later, Carr sent Huntley a text message which read: \\"Don't make me feel bad because I'm with my family.\\" Huntley did not reply to this message. Bichard enquiry Immediately following Huntley's conviction, his previous criminal history was disclosed to the public. These disclosures revealed that, despite his extensive record of sexual offences against underage girls and young women and evident criminal recidivism, not only had police failed to pursue these previous criminal complaints and allegations, but Huntley had secured a position of employment facilitating his access to children. Upon learning of these public disclosures, Home Secretary David Blunkett announced a public enquiry into the intelligence-based record keeping and vetting system which had allowed Huntley to obtain employment as a school caretaker despite these previous criminal complaints, which had been reported to both police and social services. Chaired by Sir Michael Bichard, the Bichard enquiry opened on 13 January 2004. The results of this enquiry were published in June that year. The stated purpose of the Bichard enquiry was: One of the pertinent issues of concern to be scrutinised by the Bichard report surfaced almost immediately when Humberside Police stated their belief in it being unlawful under the Data Protection Act to hold data regarding criminal allegations which had not led to a conviction; this claim was criticised by other police forces who thought this too strict an interpretation of the Act. The enquiry severely scrutinised the actual investigation by Cambridgeshire Police into the children's disappearance and murder, as almost two weeks had elapsed following the disappearance of Wells and Chapman before Cambridgeshire Police became aware of Huntley's previous criminal background, despite his claims to be the last individual to see the children alive. Further criticism was directed at the force for their initial failure to scrutinise Carr's claims to have been in Soham on the date of the children's disappearance. The enquiry also severely criticised Humberside Police for deleting information relating to the previous criminal allegations against Huntley and also criticised Cambridgeshire Police for not following standard vetting guidelines. Both the Humberside and Cambridgeshire Police were heavily criticised for their failings in maintaining criminal intelligence records on Huntley. Bichard later ordered the suspension of the Chief of Humberside Police, David Westwood, for ordering the destruction of criminal records pertaining to alleged child molesters which had not resulted in a conviction. (This suspension was later overturned.) Westwood retired from the position of Chief of Humberside Police in March 2005. The Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Tom Lloyd, was also subjected to severe criticism as his force had failed to contact Humberside Police during the investigation into Huntley's criminal background prior to his securing employment at Soham Village College. An added complication in these criminal vetting procedures was the fact that Huntley had applied for the caretaker's job under the name of Ian Nixon, although he did divulge upon the application form for this position that he was previously known as Ian Huntley. It is believed that Cambridgeshire Police failed to perform a background check under the name Huntley. Had they actually done so, they would have discovered an outstanding burglary charge on file relating to his November 1995 arrest for this crime. Recommendations The Bichard enquiry recommended the implementation of a mandatory registration scheme for people working with children and vulnerable adults such as the elderly and mentally handicapped. This recommendation later led to the foundation of the Independent Safeguarding Authority. The findings also suggested a national system should be implemented for police forces to share intelligence information, and that all police forces should follow a clear code of practice on record-keeping. These findings ultimately led to the tightening of various procedures within the Criminal Records Bureau system, including compulsory checks into potential criminal backgrounds of people who apply to work with children. Aftermath An orange-petalled rose, dedicated to the memory of Wells and Chapman, was unveiled by representatives of Soham Town Council at the 2003 Chelsea Flower Show. The inspiration for dedicating a flower to the children's memory sourced from a poem read aloud at the memorial service at Ely Cathedral on 30 August 2002 by the father of Wells, titled Soham's Rose. On 3 April 2004, the three-bedroomed house in College Close in which the murders occurred was demolished and the site levelled, with all rubble from the property being destroyed and later discarded in various undisclosed locations. The site where 5 College Close once stood is now a vacant patch of grass. Within days of Huntley's formal sentencing, he reflected to the media on the prospect of his spending the remainder of his life behind bars and of his fears for his security, exclaiming: \\"I'm going to rot inside this place. I'll rot in here, I know it. I'll spend the rest of my life in here ... I'm going to be inside forever, and it'll be torture.\\" In the years since his incarceration, Huntley has been repeatedly attacked by other inmates. On 14 September 2005, he was scalded with boiling water while incarcerated at HM Prison Wakefield by a fellow inmate named Mark Hobson. The injuries Huntley received in this attack resulted in him being unable to attend the hearing at which his minimum term of imprisonment was decided. Following this attack, Huntley alleged that prison authorities had failed in their duty of care towards him, and launched a claim for £15,000 in compensation. He was reportedly awarded £2,500 in legal aid to pursue this claim. Huntley was transferred from Wakefield prison to Frankland prison on 23 January 2008. Three years later, on 21 March 2010, he received non life- threatening injuries to his neck after his throat was slashed by a convicted armed robber named Damien Fowkes. The injuries Huntley received in this attack required hospital treatment. Huntley again applied for compensation for the injuries he received in this attack, seeking £20,000 in damages. On 5 September 2006, Huntley attempted to commit suicide by taking an overdose of antidepressants he had accumulated in his prison cell. This suicide attempt resulted in his hospitalisation and a thorough search of his cell, in which a cassette tape was recovered. This cassette tape contains a markedly different account of the murders of Wells and Chapman than that to which Huntley had testified at his trial. In what Huntley had believed would be his posthumous confession, he claims to have confessed to having murdered both girls to Carr prior to their arrest and his plans to confess to authorities, to which, Huntley alleged, Carr had slapped his face and informed him to \\"pull [himself] together\\" as she did not wish to lose the teaching position she had yearned for all her life. Huntley further alleges Carr had encouraged him to burn both bodies in an attempt to destroy all forensic evidence linking him to the crime. It is believed Huntley had agreed to make this recording for a fellow prisoner (who had hoped to later sell the confession to the media after his release), in return for his being provided with the antidepressants he had used to attempt suicide. In April 2007, Huntley confessed to having sexually assaulted an 11-year-old girl whom he had dragged into an orchard in 1997. This admission—in which Huntley also confessed to having a sexual interest in children while insisting the murders of Wells and Chapman had not been sexually motivated—was welcomed by the victim of this sexual assault. Following Huntley's admission of guilt, this victim issued a press statement in which she confessed to feeling \\"a massive sense of relief\\", although she concluded this statement with the sentence: \\"Yet, I still feel upset that Huntley was left at large, resulting in the deaths of two innocent children.\\" Carr was released on probation from HM Prison Foston Hall on 14 May 2004 after serving a total of 21 months' imprisonment (including the 16 months she had been detained while on remand).Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley p. 285 She was given a secret identity to protect her from threats of attack from vengeful members of the public in addition to being provided with a new home in an undisclosed location. Carr is one of four former prisoners in the United Kingdom to be given an entirely new identity upon release. Carr won an injunction on 24 February 2005, granting her lifelong anonymity on the grounds that her life would otherwise be in danger. The costs of imposing this order have been reported by differing tabloid newspapers as being between £1 million and £50 million. At least a dozen women have been falsely identified as being Carr and either persecuted or physically attacked due to false stories speculating as to her whereabouts and new identity which have been printed in tabloid publications. Shortly after her release from prison, Carr and her family contacted a Tyneside-based publishing company with view to publishing her autobiography. Although Mirage Publishing initially agreed to publish Carr's autobiography, the company soon withdrew their offer after a feature on BBC Radio Newcastle prompted scores of complaints from the public.

(commonly known by its acronym MIX) is a non-profit organization that provides market data and intelligence on financial service providers catering to low-income populations around the world. Founded by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and sponsored by the Citi Foundation, CGAP, the Mastercard Foundation, MetLife Foundation, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and others, MIX has offices in Washington DC, New York, Lima (Peru), Baku (Azerbaijan), Dakar (Senegal), and Hyderabad (India). MIX's mission is to provide data analytics to empower decision-makers - socially responsible investors, policy makers and financial services providers - to build an inclusive financial services ecosystem. Since its founding in 2002, MIX has built the digital information infrastructure needed to bring greater transparency to financial sectors serving low-income populations in emerging markets, including providing market data on over 3,000 financial services providers (FSPs). In 2016, MIX shifted its strategy to help improve the information flow in other segments of financial inclusion, like smallholder agricultural finance, fintech, digital financial services (DFS) and green energy finance.  Market intelligence data  MIX collects, validates and publishes financial, operational and social performance data from financial service providers (FSPs) including non-bank financial institutions, rural cooperatives, fintechs, agricultural businesses, and others, in addition to business information from networks, funders and socially responsible investors. This data is standardized and made available to users through subscriptions on an online platform: MIX Market. MIX also produces a variety of publications covering the sector such as Barometer Forecast, Annual Benchmark Reports, and Quarterly Factsheets, as well as a number of ad hoc publications each year like the Global Outreach and Financial Performance Benchmark Report.  Custom data analytics  MIX works with major funders of financial inclusion to carry out projects related to data and information provision for financial services sectors in emerging markets. Because many investors and FSPs in these regions struggle to make business and investment decisions due to the limited flow and availability of data and information, MIX and its partners identify these information 'gaps' and develop solutions to address them. Examples of efforts to support the healthy development of financial markets through better information include One Acre Fund's Smallholder Finance Product Explorer, the Council on Smallholder Agricultural Finance's State of the Sector report and analysis, and the CGAP Cross Border Funder Survey; all are initiatives supported by MIX's custom data analytics.  Platforms = MIX Market  MIX Market is an online platform for delivering data and information on FSPs serving low-income and bottom of the pyramid clients in emerging markets like India, Cambodia, Ghana and others. MIX Market provides online data on over 3,000 financial service providers, networks and funders. In FY2015, 1,033 financial service providers reported data through MIX Market. Those financial service providers total 116.6 million borrowers, corresponding to a gross loan portfolio of USD 92.4 billion. These financial service providers also have savings products that reach 98.4 million depositors and account for USD 58.9 billion in deposits. Data collection and analysis – After receiving self-reported data from financial service providers, MIX analysts “review the data, ensuring there are no outliers and extremes. [They] double check against source documents such as audits and ratings, and standardize [the data] according to internationally accepted accounting standards and to provide for a more useful intra-regional comparison.” Data products – The main, publicly-accessible data products of MIX Market include FSP profiles (including financial indicators, trends, and benchmarks), and country and regional market overviews. * FSP profiles – The most basic medium through which data can be accessed on MIX Market is through individual FSP profiles which provide financial, operational, and social performance data as well as relevant documents, such as audits. With this data, users can view and compare performance data of several FSPs (by countries, indicators, and trends), create customizable performance and trend reports, and create benchmarks to view aggregated data in median values. * Country-level and regional profiles – These options permit a wider perspective on MFI performance data, allowing users to view information on a country-level scale or a regional scale. MIX Market currently has country profiles for 115 countries divided into six regions: Africa or Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Latin America and The Caribbean (LAC), East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), and South Asia (SA).

Description The narrative of Mass pictured the Philippines during the years prior to and after the imposition of Martial Law in 1972, which occurred within the scope of the middle and the late periods of the twentieth century. It narrated about a movement advocating reform, the resulting struggle for human rights, students’ rights, tenants’ rights, and women’s rights, and mass protests that were manipulated by \\"fraudulent leaders\\". The uprising failed. One of the characters went back to Central Luzon to discover his origins in order to rebuild his life. Characters The main character of Mass is José “Pepe” Samson, a resident of Tondo, Manila. He is the illegitimate son of Antonio “Tony” Samson, the primary character in José’s The Pretenders. Pepe was also the great-grandson of Istak, the principal protagonist in José’s Po-on. Instead of becoming like his father who was enticed by wealth, Pepe became a follower of a former commander of the Hukbalahap(Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon) rebels turned local affairs devotee and student leader in Manila. Pepe Samson was raised by Emy in Cabugawan, then goes to live with an aunt in Manila in order to study in college. He became a drug dealer for a gangster named Kuya Nick. After leaving the illegal job, Pepe joined the revolutionary group known as The Brotherhood. In the end, Pepe committed a \\"revolutionary act\\".

Since 2009, she has served in the Michigan State House of Representatives. A Democrat, Roberts represents the 24th State House District, which is located in eastern Macomb County and includes the city of St. Clair Shores and Harrison Township, as well as the small portion of Grosse Pointe Shores that is located within Macomb County. Prior to being elected in 2008, Roberts represented Northern St. Clair Shores in the Macomb County Commission. Biography Sarah Roberts was born on December 9, 1974 in Michigan to Helen and Charles Roberts. She graduated from the University of Iowa, receiving her bachelor's degree in 2000. She served as a community organizer for Clean Water Action of Macomb County from 2003-2005. She worked in the Communications Department of the House Democratic Caucus in the Michigan State House of Representatives from 2005-2006 before being elected to the Macomb County Board of Commissioners. Political career In 2006, Sarah Roberts announced her campaign for the Macomb County Commission. She ran for the 24th District, located in Northern St. Clair Shores. The 24th was being vacated by Democrat Peggy A. Kennard and leans Democratic. Roberts defeated Republican Richard A. Doan by a large margin. She served on the Commission for two years before being elected to the State House of Representatives. In January 2008, Roberts filed to run as a Democrat for the 24th State House District, which was being vacated by Republican Jack Brandenburg, who was barred from running for re- election due to term limits. She faced seven other Democrats in the primary election, but still carried 63% of the vote. The 24th District is a narrow district that runs North-to-South along Lake St. Clair. It includes the city of St. Clair Shores, Harrison Township, and a small portion of Grosse Pointe Shores, and is normally a battleground district, although it historically favored Democrats (prior to Jack Brandenburg, the seat had been held by a Democrat going back to the 1970s). In the general election, Roberts faced Republican Bryan Brandenburg, an unsuccessful candidate for Macomb County Commission and son of then-current Representative Jack Brandenburg. The race for the 24th District was one of the most competitive in Michigan. The State Democratic party alone invested over $220,000 in the race, an extraordinary number for a State House race. The race featured a large amount of negative campaigning, including adds that raised questions about four incidents involving Brandenburg in which the police investigated but no charges were filed, including an assault accusation at a party. On election day, Roberts emerged narrowly victorious by just over 1,000 votes, or about 2%. President Obama carried the 24th District by a similarly narrow 51.5%-46.4% margin. Sarah Roberts took office on January 1, 2009. She sits on the Education, Energy and Technology, Great Lakes and Environment, and Military, Vet. Affairs, and Homeland Security Committees.

The Council noted the Peace Agreement signed on 25 July 1993 and to the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) for help in implementing it. Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) would be responsible for the implementation of the military terms of the agreement while the United Nations would supervise, very much in the background. It would be the first time that a United Nations peacekeeping mission would cooperate alongside an already existing peacekeeping mission of another organisation. The importance of close cooperation between UNOMIL, ECOMOG and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was stressed. At the same time, the Council welcomed the establishment of the Joint Cease-Fire Monitoring Committee (JCMC) composed of three Liberian parties, ECOMOG and the United Nations, and that the Peace Agreement called for elections to take place within seven months. UNOMIL was then established under the direction of the Secretary-General through his Special Representative for a period of seven months, subject to the provision that it will continue beyond 16 December 1993 only upon a review by the Council on whether progress had been made in implementing the agreement. The mission would include military observers and medical, engineering, communications, transportation, electoral and support personnel in accordance with the Secretary-General's report, and would have the following mandate: :(a) investigate violations of the ceasefire; :(b) ensure compliance with the peace agreement; :(c) monitor the electoral process; :(d) assist in the coordination of humanitarian assistance; :(e) develop a plan and assess financial requirements for the demobilisation of combatants; :(f) report violations of international humanitarian law; :(g) train ECOMOG personnel in the demining process; :(h) cooperate with ECOMOG in its duties. The intention of Boutros-Ghali to define the roles and responsibilities of UNOMIL and ECOWAS in the implementation of the Peace Agreement was welcomed, requesting African states to provide troops when required to ECOMOG. The Secretary-General had established a fund through which Member States could contribute to the mission. The resolution called upon the parties in Liberia to disarm and demobilise. Their decision to form a provisional government was welcomed by Council and was urged to sign a status of mission agreement within sixty days of UNOMIL's installation. Preparations for the Election Commission were told to be finalised so that organisation of the elections by March 1994 could begin, to be held as envisaged in the peace agreement. Finally, they were called together to work on the safe distribution of relief supplies and protect UNOMIL and humanitarian personnel, requesting the Secretary-General to report back on 16 December 1993 and 16 February 1994 on the implementation of the current resolution.

Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq it was part of the 5th Corps in the north, alongside the 1st Mechanised Division. It was disbanded along with the rest of the army by Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2 in mid-2003. It was later reformed with the rest of the Iraqi Army. The 4th Division’s battalions are former Iraqi National Guard units, recruited locally. The division is ethnically diverse and had operational control of a number of Strategic Infrastructure Battalions protecting oil pipelines. The Strategic Infrastructure units have now been split off to become the 12th Division. The 4th Brigade of the 4th Division was transferred to the 12th Division, and a new 17th Brigade was being trained in July 2008. Today its base is in the city of Tikrit. It was certified and assumed responsibility for most of Salah ad Din Governorate and At-Ta'mim Governorate provinces, including the major cities Samarra and Tikrit in 2006. However in mid-2010 it relinquished responsibility of the At-Ta'min Governorate and currently remains responsible for the security of the majority of Salah Ad Din.

He was one of the Canadian Opera Company's principal conductors during its early years, working there from 1958 to 1968. For many years he was the program annotator of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) and also served as the orchestra's associate conductor from 1942–1948. He became a naturalized Canadian citizen in 1949. Born to Swiss-Italian parents in Brusio, Ticino, Switzerland, Mazzoleni earned a Bachelor of Music and a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Oxford in 1927. He went on to study piano at the Royal College of Music while simultaneously working on the school's opera staff from 1927–1929. While there he had the opportunity to work closely with Sir Adrian Boult and Ralph Vaughan Williams. In 1929 Mazzoleni immigrated to Canada to join the music and English faculties of the Upper Canada College, where he remained until 1945. He also frequently worked as a consultant for the opera program at the Toronto Conservatory of Music (TCM), beginning with the school's 1929 production of Vaughan Williams's Hugh the Drover. In 1932 he joined the TCM's music faculty where he taught music history and conducting. He later succeeded Donald Heins as the director of the TCM's symphony orchestra in 1934. While still teaching at the TCM, Mazzoleni was appointed the director of the Opera Division at the University of Toronto (UTOD) in 1952, a post he held until 1966. During his tenure he also worked with the Opera Festival of Toronto (OFT) which had been founded by the UTOD in 1950; serving variously as the festival's artistic director (1953), managing director (1954), and general director (1955–56). In 1958 the OFT became a full-time professional opera company, the Canadian Opera Company, and Mazzoleoni was highly active conducting operas with the company until his sudden death in a car accident in 1968. Among his notable pupils were musicians Howard Cable, Robert Fleming, James Gayfer, Godfrey Ridout, and Rudy Toth.

The narrative is set in an undatable post-apocalyptic world, somewhere in present-day Morocco. It follows the inner and outer life of Manuel Venator, a historian in the city-state of Eumeswil who also holds a part-time job in the night bar of Eumeswil's ruling tyrant, the Condor.Booklist, John Schreffler The book was published in English in 1993, translated by Joachim Neugroschel. Themes The key theme in the novel is the figure of the Anarch, the inwardly-free individual who lives quietly and dispassionately within but not of society and the world. The Anarch is a metaphysical ideal figure of a sovereign individual, conceived by Jünger. Jünger was greatly influenced by egoism thinker Max Stirner. Indeed, the Anarch starts out from Stirner's conception of the unique (der Einzige), a man who forms a bond around something concrete rather than ideal,Warrior, Waldgänger, Anarch: An essay on Ernst Jünger's concept of the sovereign individual by Abdalbarr Braun, accessed 14 May 2016.An exposition of the figure of the Anarch through citations from Juenger's Eumeswil. but it is then developed in subtle but critical ways beyond Stirner's concept. Reception Publishers Weekly reviewed the book in 1994: \\"In this acute if labyrinthine study of a compromised individual, [Jünger] telescopes past and present, playing over the sweep of Western history and culture with a dazzling range of allusions from Homer and Nero to Poe and Lenin, displaying his erudition but failing to ignite the reader's engaged interest.\\"Publisher's Weekly Review 1994-05-09 http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-941419-97-0  References  External links  * English Language copy of the book * Blog discussing and exploring Jünger's anarch through excerpts from Eumeswil * Association Eumeswil, a Florentine cultural association dedicated to the study of Ernst Jünger's life and works. * Category:1977 science fiction novels Category:1977 German novels Category:German science fiction novels Category:German-language novels Category:Novels by Ernst Jünger Category:Novels set in Morocco Category:Post- apocalyptic novels Category:Novels about time travel ","title":"Eumeswil"},{"id":"26545141","text":"Araneagryllus is an extinct monotypic genus of cricket in the subfamily Phalangopsinae with the sole species Araneagryllus dylani. The fossil was recovered in the Dominican Republic from early Miocene Burdigalian stage Dominican amber deposits on the island of Hispaniola. Araneagryllus is the first Phalangopsinae cricket to be described from the fossil record. The genus is known from a single long female specimen, the holotype, currently deposited in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, as number \\"DR-12-32\\", and which was first studied by Dr. Sam W. Heads. Dr. Heads published his 2010 type description in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society volume number 158. The genus name is a combination of the Latin aranea meaning \\"spider\\" and gryllus, meaning \\"cricket\\" in reference to the common name given the subfamily where Araneagryllus is placed. The species name is in honor of Dylan L. Heads, son of Dr. Heads. The female has a notable development of a white \\"emulsion\\" developed around the mouth parts and on the abdomen. Araneagryllus dylani possesses a wide shield-like, pronotum which has irregularly spaced setae and prominent ridges along the center and margins. The legs are long with areas of short and long setae, and are marked with a pattern of dark marking ranging from spots on the profemur to stripes on the mesotibia. The metatibia sports two rows of ten to twelve spines, four subapical spurs, and three apical spurs. The middle apical spur is notably longer than the other two spurs. Both cerci the joint of one hind leg and the ovipositor are incomplete, having been removed during shaping and polishing of the amber specimen. Cladistic analysis places Araneagryllus within a clade composed of Arachnopsita, Leptopedetes, Longuripes, Mayagryllus, Nemoricantor, and Prolonguripes.

Samson was unable to fulfill the plan of marrying Pepe's mother because he became engaged with Carmen Villa in the U.S. Antonio married Carmen Villa, who was the daughter of Don Manuel, an “agro-industrial baron”, mestizo and “buyer of people”. The Don was able to purchase even a magazine journalist whom Antonio Samson considered a “man of integrity”.

She was originally a luxurious private auxiliary steam yacht for a number of wealthy owners and in 1903 was acquired by the Royal Navy, serving until 1914. She was sold to James Patrick Steamships Ltd and converted to a merchant ship for the Australian coast and finally hulked in 1924.The Sydney Morning Herald, Wednesday 31 December 1924, p.12. History Built by Robert Steele and Co, Greenock in 1878 for Charles Joseph Lambert as a private yacht named Wanderer and described as \\"the most luxurious private steam yacht ever built\\". She was registered with the Royal Yacht Squadron and became known as RYS Wanderer, based at Cowes, Isle of Wight. On her shake-down cruise in the Bay of Biscay, September 1879, she was dismasted. The crew managed to cut away the broken rigging and she reached Falmouth under her own power. The high pressure steam engines also proved to be so problematic that they were replaced before she went into service with the Lambert family. During the repair works, additional accommodation was added in the form of poop decks fore and aft. In 1880, Lambert, with his family undertook a 2-year world cruise on board, covering almost 49,000 miles and published an account on their return titled The Voyage of the \\"Wanderer\\". In 1888 after a number of cruises around the world, she was sold to the Principe di Torlonia and renamed Vagus. In 1896 she returned to the British register at Cowes, and then, had a series of owners including in 1900 the American millionaire William Kissam Vanderbilt who renamed her Consuelo, his daughter's name.Bastock, p.145.This information conflicts with contemporary sources - see section Conflicting source data, By 1903 Consuelo was still registered at Cowes, but now owned by the Earl of Crawford.

Owned by Admiralty In 1903, Consuelo was purchased by the Admiralty and initially commissioned as HMS Investigator. In 1904 after refitting as a survey vessel, at a cost of £20,000, she was renamed HMS Sealark and sailed from Portsmouth in September 1904 to serve on the China Station. In 1910, she sailed from Penang for the Australia Station.The Mercury, Monday 23 May 1910, p.4. She undertook various hydrographic surveys around Australia and the South Pacific between 1910 and 1914. With the beginning of World War I, and the threat of German Empire expansion in the South Pacific, she sailed to Suva, Fiji with a cargo of coastal guns, for a gun emplacement on a hill in Suva. After returning from Fiji via New Zealand to Sydney, she was paid off in 1914. In 1919, Australian shipowner Captain J. H. Patrick purchased her for £2500, converted her into a merchant ship at a cost of £15,000, initially renaming her Sealark III, and then Norwest. She plied the interstate trade for James Patrick Steamships Ltd until 1924, when the English, Scottish and Australian Bank seized her to repay debts owed. After James Patrick Steamships Ltd failed, the bank sold her to William Waugh Ltd., Balmain, Sydney for about £500. William Waugh dismantled her and converted her into a hulk. Figurehead The figurehead was presented to the Royal Australian Navy and was mounted at the Dockyard on Garden Island. Anchor  Located in Hallsville, New South Wales, next to the main road between Tamworth and Manilla, is the anchor from HMS Sealark. Known as the Oxley Memorial, as it is dedicated to the first Surveyor General of New South Wales, John Oxley, who took this route in 1818. The plaque reads that it was \\"donated by the Naval Board Melbourne\\". A contemporaneous newspaper article said that \\"the anchor, which has been on Garden Island since the Sealark went out of commission, was landed at man-o'-war steps and conveyed to Darling Harbour railway station for transport to Tamworth\\". The memorial was erected in 1926. Conflicting source data John Bastock’s book Ships on the Australian Station is at odds with other reference sources by stating that HMS Sealark was originally constructed in 1887 by Gourley Bros & Co of Dundee, and attributing ownership of Consuelo, between 1900 and 1903, to W. K. Vanderbilt. Contemporary records, including the Lloyd's yacht registers from 1900 to 1904 and The Mercantile Navy List and Maritime Directories of the same period, confirm that Sealark was built by Robert Steele and Co. in 1878 as Wanderer, and the registered owners between 1900 and 1903 were Sir Richard Henry Williams-Bulkeley and the Earl of Crawford, not Vanderbilt.

The church was located on 309-315 East 33rd Street, in the Kips Bay area of Manhattan, New York City. It has since been replaced by a chapel under the same name. History=Parish church The parish was established in 1914, to serve an estimated population of 10,000 Italian Americans living in the area. A brick church was built in 1916 for $35,000 to designs by Nicholas Serracino of 1170 Broadway. The first rector was Joseph M. Congedo. The parish was established in 1914 and construction of the church was begun the following year with the laying of the cornerstone on October 4 by Cardinal John M. Farley, the Archbishop of New York. The completed church was dedicated on October 1, 1916, by Archbishop Giovanni Bonzano, P.I.M.E., Apostolic Delegate to the United States at the time. There were a few little changes later with the replacement of the original oak doors with cruciform windows with black metal doors with square windows.Our Faith always brought us here . . . The parish operated a school with the same name from 1925 through 1937. The parish also operated Immaculata High School, which was run by the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The high school was closed in the 1970s. The parish was closed in January 2007, one of several closed that year by the then-archbishop, Cardinal Edward Egan. It was then merged with the Church of Our Lady of the Scapular–St. StephenOur Lady of the Scapular–St. Stephen (Roman Catholic) and the church and school were demolished.New York Landmarks Conservancy Advocacy for Threatened Sacred Sites In November 2014, it was announced by the archdiocese that the existing parish was to be merged into Our Saviour Parish as of the following year.

He came from the Prussian family of the Burgraves of Dohna. Biography Dohna was born in 1583 in Mohrungen (Morąg), Duchy of Prussia (a fief of the Crown of Poland), the son of Achatius von Dohna by his marriage to Barbara von Wernsdorf. After brief instruction by a private tutor, Dohna attended a series of educational institutions: the University of Rostock (1597), the University of Altdorf (1598), the University of Heidelberg (1599), the University of Siena (1601), the University of Perugia (1602), the University of Geneva (1604), and then in 1606 he returned to the University of Heidelberg. Upon leaving his final university, Dohna entered the service of Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg. On the death of Frederick IV, Elector Palatine in 1610, Frederick IV was succeeded by his 14-year-old son Frederick V, Elector Palatine. Christian of Anhalt-Bernburg became one of Frederick V's most trusted advisers, and, as Frederick's chancellor, exercised a large degree of influence over the young Elector. Upon Christian's recommendation, Frederick made Dohna a member of his Council (Rat). Under Christian's tutelage, Dohna rose to become Frederick's Chamberlain (Oberstkämmerer) in 1620. He married Ursula von Solms-Braunfels on March 23, 1620. Dohna had also remained active as a scholar and was invited to join the Fruitbearing Society in 1619 due to his learning in the healing properties of natural herbs. He adopted the oregano plant as his emblem. Following the collapse of Frederick V's policies in 1620 and the occupation of his territories by imperial troops later in 1620, Dohna fled to Küstrin. He later moved to Spandau, where his wife was entitled to an appanage. He spent the years between 1624 and 1628 as living privately on his ancestral estate at Carwinden (Karwiny).. In 1628, he was forced to flee from there when the Polish–Swedish War spread onto his property, going first to Emden. In October 1630, Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, appointed his brother-in-law Dohna as Governor of the Principality of Orange, a post he held until his death. He died in Orange on 1 July 1637. Marriage and issue Christopher was married to Ursula, a daughter of John Albert I of Solms-Braunfels. Together, they had the following children:WW- person database by Herbert Stoyan * Frederick of Dohna (1621-1688) * Christian Albrecht zu Dohna (1621-1677) * Heinrich zu Dohna (1624-1643) * Elisabeth Charlotte zu Dohna-Carwinden (1625-1691) * Henriette Amalie zu Dohna-Carwinden (1626-1655) * Catharina zu Dohna-Carwinden (1627-1697) * Christoph Delphicus zu Dohna (1628-1668) * Louise zu Dohna-Carwinden (1633-1690) Literary output A man of letters, Dohna composed poetry in German, Italian, and Latin.

It is the sequel to Green's film, Hatchet. Picking up right where the first film ended, Hatchet II follows Marybeth as she escapes the clutches of the deformed, swamp-dwelling killer Victor Crowley. After learning the truth about her family's connection to the hatchet-wielding madman, Marybeth returns to the Louisiana swamps along with an army of hunters to recover the bodies of her family and exact the bloodiest revenge against the bayou butcher. The film sees the return of Kane Hodder and Tony Todd who portrayed Victor Crowley and Reverend Zombie in the 2006 film, respectively. Danielle Harris portrays Marybeth, a role originally played by Tamara Feldman. The film was originally screened at the 2010 London FrightFest Film Festival on August 26, 2010. It was released unrated in the United States on October 1, 2010. Plot Picking up immediately where the first film ended, Marybeth is attacked by Victor Crowley, but manages to escape. Jack Cracker finds her, pulls her out of the river, and takes her back to his cabin. After finding out her last name, he forces her to leave, telling her that if she wants help, she needs to see Reverend Zombie. Moments after she leaves, Jack views Shapiro's camcorder, which he found in the swamp. The footage shows Shapiro filming different topless women, including Misty and Jenna. It also further reveals Shapiro's plan to venture into the swamp. After Jack finishes watching the video, he is killed by Victor Crowley, who gouges his intestines out and strangles him with them until he decapitates him. Marybeth returns to Reverend Zombie's shop and, after demanding to speak with him, he reluctantly lets her in. It's revealed that Rev. Zombie had a small business going on with Shawn, the tour guide who was murdered the night before, and the boat was one of his own. After learning her last name, he tells her that her father was one of the boys responsible for causing the fire that led to Victor Crowley's death. He also tells her that Thomas, Victor's father, cheated on his wife Shyann with her nurse Lena after she was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Moments before dying, Shyann placed a curse on the child conceived by Lena from the affair. Months later, Lena died after giving birth to the deformed Victor Crowley. After Thomas accidentally killed Victor whilst trying to save him, he confronted the three boys responsible for the fire, but due to his violent attitude, and the shotgun he threatened them with, they, along with their parents, denied it. Thomas became a shut-in and eventually died ten years later of a broken heart. The story is then complemented by various scenes in which the undead Victor slaughters anyone who wanders into Honey Island Swamp. Marybeth tells Reverend Zombie she wants to go back and retrieve the remains of her father and brother. He agrees, but tells her she must bring a family member with her. After she leaves, Zombie calls Justin, Shawn's brother, and reveals Shawn never returned with the boat. He lies, saying they are going into the swamp to find Shawn and the boat. He tells Justin to summon a group of hunters, specifically a man named Trent Graves to go with them. Marybeth returns home, where her uncle, Bob promptly shows up. He tells her she must stay away from Reverend Zombie, but reluctantly agrees to accompany her to a recruitment meeting in Zombie's shop. Zombie tells the hunters he will pay them $500 each to retrieve his boat and $5,000 for the head of Victor Crowley. He tells Trent he will pay him double to go, and Trent agrees. The hunters proceed to venture into the swamp with Marybeth and her uncle. As night descends, they find the boat and, as the rest leave, two of the hunters, Cletus and Chad stay by the boat while the others fan out. Marybeth, Zombie, Justin, Bob and Trent look for Crowley's shed, as well as the bodies of his victims. Along the way, Zombie explains to Justin that Trent and Marybeth's father and uncle were the kids who started the fire that led to Victor's death. Zombie believes that if Crowley kills Bob and Trent, his soul will be at peace and he will finally leave the swamp. After not finding the bodies in the shed, they check the main cabin. Meanwhile, the rest of the hunting party are systematically murdered by Victor: Chad is violently hacked in the face with Victor's hatchet, and Cletus' face is mutilated by a boat propeller. While Layton and Avery are having makeup sex, Victor appears and decapitates Layton. Avery tries to run away, but Victor chops her between the legs and in the chest with his hatchet. Finally, John and Vernon are simultaneously split in half from the groin up with a long chainsaw. While searching the cabin, the remaining party members hear Victor outside. As they hide, Justin tells Marybeth of Zombie's plot to get her uncle and Trent killed after Marybeth tells Justin that Shawn is dead. As she runs to warn Bob, Justin jams the door shut with a chair, but Victor appears behind him and kills him by wearing half his head away with a belt sander. Bob, in an attempt to save Justin, accidentally releases Victor. Marybeth attempts to attack him, but is tossed against the wall. Victor then on seeing Trent immediately goes after him and spearing him into the kitchen where the final battle occurs. Despite Victor's strength, Trent uses the nearby surroundings to his advantage, temporarily pinning Crowley against a support. He beats Victor with tables and chairs, but when Trent tries to kill Victor with a cleaver. Victor kills him by breaking his leg, then severs the top half of his head by kicking it against a table. Meanwhile, Zombie grabs Marybeth and drags her out of the house, trapping Bob inside with Victor. Zombie restrains Marybeth while she screams as she hears Bob being murdered by Victor inside. She falls to the ground in tears, and Zombie declares, \\"That's it. All over,\\" and claims Victor Crowley is dead. Marybeth tells Zombie that she will report his crimes to the police, but Zombie responds by preparing to shoot her. Only now does Marybeth reveal that Bob was not her real uncle; her father's brother had died of leukemia when she was twelve, and Bob was her father's best friend. Zombie turns to see Victor breaking through the wall of the cabin, now realizing his plan to kill Victor Crowley has failed. Zombie advances towards Victor and attempts to choke him, but Victor kills him by severing him in half before ripping out his severed spine, effectively skinning him alive. Just after Victor tosses Zombie's skinned upper body into the woods, Marybeth strikes him in the forehead with his own hatchet, knocking him to the ground. She then hysterically beats his head into a bloody pulp. She eventually stops and walks off, just as Victor's hand twitches. She then returns with Zombie's shotgun and fires the gun into the remains of his head, seemingly killing him. Cast Joel Murray, Mercedes McNab and Joleigh Fioravanti reprise their roles from the first film in minor cameos as Shapiro, Misty and Jenna respectively. Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell also cameo, with Bell reprising her role as Parker O'Neal from Green's previous film Frozen in a scene taking place after the events of that film. Also making uncredited cameos were directors Adam Green, Joe Lynch, Marcus Dunstan, Lloyd Kaufman and Ryan Schifrin. Production=Development Hatchet II was announced in November 2008 when Anchor Bay Entertainment released a teaser poster for the film. Adam Green stated that he would be writing and directing, depending on how long the other projects he was working on took. He also stated that if the projects took too long, he would pass writing and directing duties on to someone else. On November 24, 2009, it was officially announced that Adam Green would return to write and direct. The final draft of the script was completed on December 7, 2009. In order to keep details under wraps, even the crew did not receive copies of the script and the majority of cast only received select pages. Fake scripts, fake endings, and fake story lines were circulated around the industry and no visitors or guests were allowed near the set. The cast gathered for their first table reading on December 15, 2009. Casting On November 24, 2009, along with the announcement that Adam Green would return to write and direct, it was announced that Kane Hodder would reprise the role of Victor Crowley. On November 25, it was announced that Tony Todd would be returning. On December 3, 2009 scream queen Danielle Harris announced on her official Twitter account that she would be taking over the role of Marybeth, which was originally played by Tamara Feldman. On December 8, 2009 AJ Bowen and director Tom Holland joined the cast. The rest of the cast was announced on December 28, 2009, R.A. Mihailoff, Kathryn Fiore, Parry Shen, Rileah Vanderbilt, Ed Ackerman, Rick McCallum, Colton Dunn and David Foy. Filming To accommodate Green's promotional duties for the film Frozen shooting had to be split into two parts. The first portion began shooting on January 7, 2010 and ended on January 23. The second portion began January 15, 2010 and shooting for Hatchet II wrapped on February 24. Release Hatchet II premiered in Europe on August 26, 2010 as part of London's Frightfest. The film was released unrated in 68 theaters across the United States by AMC Theatres as part of their AMC Independent program on October 1, 2010. The film was scheduled to be released in Toronto and Montreal theaters in Canada on the same day, but it was pulled because it was not rated by the cities' provincial rating agencies. The film was also pulled from U.S. theaters on October 4. Hatchet II was released on DVD and Blu-ray February 1, 2011.  Controversy with the MPAA  Adam Green had already had a problem with the MPAA over the original Hatchet. \\"With the first Hatchet, I had an epic battle with the ratings board,\\" he says. \\"They kept giving the movie an NC-17. There is absolutely no way that movie should have gotten an NC-17. All the gore in it is so ridiculous and over-the-top that you can't take it seriously. It was a terrible, terrible loss when Hatchet came out in theaters. None of the fun stuff that people had been reading about for two years was in the movie anymore. But the MPAA is notoriously hard on independent movies. It's a money thing with them. The studios pay the salaries, so they're willing to let things slide for studio movies. One of the examples I use is The Hills Have Eyes remake (which was distributed by Fox Searchlight). I'm not slamming these movies — I like them. But The Hills Have Eyes got an R-rating, and Victor Crowley chasing somebody with a belt sander got an NC-17. How is that possibly fair? It's a sham. The whole thing is a sham.\\" However, with this sequel, Dark Sky Films made a deal with AMC Theatres to organize an unrated release in 68 theatres across the US and Canada. This was the widest release of an unrated horror film since 1978 with Dawn of the Dead. However, within hours, the movie started vanishing from various theatres. Within a couple of days, it was gone altogether. Green called foul and claims AMC had given in to the MPAA, who were supposedly pressuring them. One of the reasons to back up his claim was the fact that Hatchet II, the very first film pulled in such a short space of time, happened to be the widest theatrically-released unrated horror film in 25 years, while other films that were performing much worse financially, such as Chain Letter, were allowed to stay. Green also expressed his concerns that he is now \\"a marked man\\", in terms of his relationship with the MPAA. \\"It's bad,\\" says the director. \\"I know they're going to be out for blood with me. And the ratings board, I'm sure, is very certain that we're not going to do any business and then they're going to say to everybody, 'You see what happens when you don't play by our rules?'\\". When the DVD was released, the R-Rated cut had over 2 minutes of gore removed, including entire death scenes. However, the film was also released unrated. Reception Hatchet II has received negative reviews from critics. Based on 33 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall 36% approval rating from critics, with the consensus stating \\"Funnier and more gleefully gory than most slasher sequels, Hatchet II aims for so-bad-it's-good territory, but can't quite hack it.\\" By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 49, based on 11 reviews. Adam Green has personally said that this entry in the series is his favorite. Sequels Director Adam Green originally stated that two more sequels would follow and is interested in a 3D sequel. In 2011, Dark Sky gave the green light for Hatchet III. Green declined to helm the sequel himself, but he hand picked the director. Hatchet and Hatchet II cameraman BJ McDonnell takes over for Adam Green on the third film. Hatchet III will continue the horrific saga of Victor Crowley, known as the Bayou Butcher, and pick up where Hatchet II left off, with Marybeth Dunston seeking revenge against Victor who killed her friends and her father and brother. On March 22, 2012 he stated on Twitter, a social networking website: \\"Starts shooting in about a month. Release date to be decided but likely early next year.\\" According to Kane Hodder, who portrays Victor Crowley and his father Thomas Crowley, the redesigned makeup for Victor Crowley looks more \\"evil and scary\\" to him. Around late October to early November 2012, four new photos of the film were released. Derek Mears, who portrayed Jason Voorhees (a role in which Hodder himself is famous for portraying before) in the Friday the 13th (2009), will star as a detective seen in two new photos. In 2013, two new clips of Hatchet III have leaked onto the internet, along with newly released photos and a trailer. Hatchet III was first shown at Adam Green's fundraiser dedicated to the victims of the 2013 Boston bombings and the film will be released in theaters and Video On Demand on June 14, 2013 and will be released on home media sometime in Summer 2013. In August 2017, it was announced that a fourth Hatchet film had been secretly filmed and completed and would be released in October as Victor Crowley. Directed by Adam Green, the film takes place ten years after the events of the first three films with Kane Hodder reprising his role as Victor Crowley and Perry Shan reprising his role as Hatchet III survivor Andrew Yong. The film will be shown in select U.S. theaters as part of Dark Sky Films' \\"Victor Crowley Road Show\\" event in celebration of the first film's ten-year anniversary as well as international film festivals. A teaser trailer was released the day after the film was announced.

Background and early career Carmody was born at Malvern, a suburb of Melbourne, in Victoria. His father, Thomas Carmody, worked as a telephone mechanic for the Postmaster-General's Department and was later awarded the Meritorious Service Medal and Bar for bravery in World War I. Alan Carmody attended St Patrick's College, , New South Wales. Aged 16, he joined the Commonwealth Public Service on 18 March 1937 as a clerk for the Department of Trade and Customs in Canberra.

In 1975, Carmody pushed for the establishment of an agency to be known as the Australia Police, which he would have headed initially, formed by combining the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and Commonwealth police forces, roughly modelled on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The force would have dealt with smuggling and white-collar crime. The project never came to pass for political reasons.

Rahn later joined the University at Buffalo in 1956 as the Lawrence D. Bell Professor and Chairman of the Department of Physiology. As Chairman, Rahn surrounded himself with outstanding faculty and made the University an international research center in environmental physiology. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966 and the National Academy of Sciences in 1968. He served as the President of the American Physiological Society from 1963 to 1964. In 1981, Hermann Rahn became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

He concluded that the song should have been included on the standard version of 4. Alexandra Boisvert of Musiqtone wrote, \\"'Lay Up Under Me' is a song about exactly what it sounds like.

His life is the subject of the unreleased docudrama Baltimore Chronicles: Legends of the Unwired, which purports to be the true story behind The Wire. He was in the early stages of writing his autobiography at the time of his death.  Early life  Barksdale was raised in the Lexington Terrace projects in Baltimore. He was involved in boxing, as were other family members. When he was young, a man ran over Barksdale's leg with his truck after Barksdale stole from him. As a result, Barksdale underwent an amputation and subsequently became addicted to opiates.  Criminal career  Barksdale was a drug dealer in West Baltimore who purportedly survived 21 gunshots, some of which were fired while Barksdale was in hospital after a prior, failed murder attempt. In 1986, Barksdale was sentenced to 15 years in state prison for battery. In 2003, he was acquitted of a federal charge of being a felon with a gun. Barksdale's name appeared in the Baltimore Suns 1987 series Easy Money: Anatomy of a Drug Empire, written by David Simon, who went on to be the creator, executive producer, and head writer of The Wire. In the newspaper series, which focuses on the criminal career of Melvin Williams, Simon depicts Barksdale as a ruthless killer and a drug addict. Simon also writes that Barksdale once tortured three people in the Baltimore projects and that his battery conviction was related to the torture incident.  Legends of the Unwired  Baltimore Chronicles: Legends of the Unwired is an unreleased, low- budget docudrama based on Barksdale's life. It is directed by Bruce Brown, and Drew Berry is the writer and producer. Kenneth A. Jackson is the executive producer, and singer Troy May of The Manhattans is the narrator. Legends of the Unwired consists of dramatizations of alleged events in Barksdale's criminal career, interviews with his family and friends, and interviews of Barksdale by actor Wood Harris, who plays drug kingpin Avon Barksdale on The Wire.  Disputed connection to The Wire  Simon denies that Nathan Barksdale or any other individual is the basis for any specific character in The Wire. A major point of contention is Barksdale's claim that his middle name is Avon. According to Simon, this name was not associated with Barksdale in any official document, and Barksdale has failed to produce any documentary evidence of having any middle name. However, in his director's commentary to the first episode of The Wire, Simon says: \\"We tend to mix the names up … but it’s our kind of back-handed homage to the reality of West Baltimore. There really was a Nathan Bodie Barksdale. We split that up. There’s a Bodie character in this tale, there’s an Avon Barksdale character. The Barksdale family was famous in their day in West Baltimore back in the '80s for their endeavors in the projects. That’s how we’re playing it. They’re not based on real people, individually, but a character might be a composite...\\" Some connections between The Wire and Simon's reporting on Barksdale, however, are evident. In addition to the name and the boxing background, for example, in Easy Money, Simon claims that Marlow Bates and Timmirror Stanfield were rivals of Barksdale's. In The Wire, Marlo Stanfield becomes a major rival of Avon Barksdale's who eventually takes over the Baltimore drug trade. However, Nathan Barksdale claimed that Bates is a close friend of his. Later years and death In his later years, Barksdale worked for the city Health Department in Baltimore, in the Safe Streets program and counseled young people to help them avoid his mistakes. However, during that time, the Baltimore Sun reports: \\"Barksdale said he had lapsed back into heroin addiction and had been running a scam to feed his habit. He said he would try to get samples of heroin, promising to pass them on to big-time dealers, but would use the drugs himself.\\" In 2014, Barksdale was \\"ensnared in a Drug Enforcement Administration wiretap investigation\\", and after pleading guilty was convicted and sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison. He served time at a Federal Correctional Complex in North Carolina. In February 2016, he died from an undisclosed illness at a medical prison in Butner, North Carolina, aged 54.

He is most notable for being the father of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, the prince consort of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. Biography Prince Bernhard of Lippe, born as Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld in Oberkassel on 26 August 1872, was the 2nd son of Ernest II, Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld, regent (1897–1904) of the principality of Lippe, and Countess Karoline of Wartensleben. He was a younger brother of Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe, who succeeded as reigning Prince of Lippe in 1905. He pursued a career as a soldier, serving in the Prussian Army, and attaining the rank of major. The Lippe-Biesterfeld family had lived at Oberkassel, Bonn, ever since 1770, when count Frederick William (1737–1803) had married Elisabeth Johanna, Edle von Meinertzhagen (1752-1811), who inherited a small manor house at Oberkassel where the couple moved from Biesterfeld in 1770, and which became the home to the family for the following 209 years. Beethoven is said to have been a piano teacher to the couples' children. The manor house and farm at Biesterfeld were demolished around 1820. Prince Bernhard acquired the manor house of Reckenwalde in eastern Brandenburg (today Wojnowo, Poland), the family's new estate, where his children grew up. File:Lippisches Landhaus Oberkassel.jpgLippe House at Oberkassel, Bonn File:20111 Wojnowo palac.JPGReckenwalde House, Brandenburg On 4 March 1909, Bernhard entered into a morganatic marriage with Baroness Armgard von Cramm. Before this marriage, his wife was granted the title Countess of Biesterfeld (Gräfin von Biesterfeld) on 8 February 1909. She and her two sons Bernhard and Aschwin were created Princess (Prince) of Lippe-Biesterfeld (Prinzessin (Prinz) zur Lippe-Biesterfeld) on 24 February 1916 with the style Serene Highness, which brought their children into a more senior place in the line of succession, in which they hitherto had been the very last.

The sixteenth named storm of the 1997 season, Olaf formed on September 26 off the southern coast of Mexico. It moved northward and quickly intensified, reaching peak winds of 70 mph (120 km/h) before weakening and hitting Oaxaca as a tropical depression. In Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala, the system brought heavy rainfall, which killed 18 people and caused flooding and damage. It was originally thought that Olaf dissipated over Mexico, although its remnants continued westward for a week. It interacted with Hurricane Pauline, which caused Olaf to turn to the southeast and later to the north to strike Mexico again, finally dissipating on October 12. Meteorological history The origins of Olaf were from a tropical wave first noted over Central America on September 22. It moved slowly through the eastern Pacific Ocean, and gradually developed an area of convection. Concurrently, an upper-level low-pressure area moved from the Gulf of Mexico across Mexico into the Pacific, which produced wind shear across the region; wind shear is the difference in wind speed and direction in the atmosphere, and is usually harmful to tropical cyclogenesis. The disturbance associated with the tropical wave persisted and developed outflow. This caused the upper-level low to move away from the system. On September 26, it was sufficiently organized to be classified Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, while located about 345 miles (560 km) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A few hours after developing, the depression attained tropical storm status, or winds of at least 40 mph (65 km/h). Upon doing so, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave it the name \\"Olaf\\". The upper-level low, which was moving away from the region, caused the storm to move northward toward the Mexican coast. Olaf quickly intensified, as evidenced by reports from a nearby ship, and the winds reached 70 mph (115 km/h) by late on September 27; the NHC anticipated further intensification to hurricane status, or winds of at least 75 mph (120 km/h). Instead, interaction with the rough terrain of Mexico caused weakening. Olaf made landfall on Salina Cruz, Oaxaca early on September 29 as a 35 mph (55 km/h) tropical depression. Within a few hours, the circulation was not evident on satellite imagery, and the NHC discontinued advisories. Despite being considered dissipated, a re-analysis of satellite imagery indicated the circulation of Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf turned toward the east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900 km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf turned toward the north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (115 km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop. Impact and preparations Rainfall map Prior to moving ashore, a tropical storm warning was issued from Punta Maldonado, Guerrero to Tapachula, Chiapas and the Port of Chiapas, near the Mexico- Guatemala border. When Olaf was strengthening faster than anticipated, the advisory was upgraded to a hurricane warning, although it was downgraded to a tropical storm after the intensification did not occur. Upon making its first landfall, Tropical Depression Olaf produced gusty winds and heavy rains along the southeastern coast of Mexico. The peak 24‑hour rainfall total was 6.71 inches (17.1 cm) in Juchitán de Zaragoza in Oaxaca; the highest rainfall total throughout Olaf's duration was 27.73 inches (70.4 cm) at a station called Soyalapa/Comaltepec in Oaxaca. Heavy rainfall was also reported in Guatemala and El Salvador. Across the affected region, the heavy rainfall caused flooding, which resulted in 18 deaths. In Mexico, the flooding damaged of coffee, corn, and other crops; in Chiapas, the coffee crop damage represented a severe cut into the yearly total. The precipitation flooded many buildings across the region, including 30 houses in the Chiapas capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, when a river exceeded its banks. In mountainous regions, mudslides left dozens of small villages isolated from the outside world. Along the coast, high waves of up to 16 feet (5 m) forced the closure of all ports in three Mexican states, which affected thousands of fishermen. Further west, three fishing vessels were reported missing near Acapulco, prompting rescue parties. The storm also forced the closure of several airports. In its final landfall, there was no damage reported; precipitation in that region peaked at 2.96 inches (7.5 cm) in Coquimatlán, Colima. Following the storm, the Mexican government sent food, water, and housing supplies to affected families in Oaxaca. Less than a week after Olaf moved through southern Mexico, Hurricane Pauline struck the same region with much stronger winds. Pauline caused heavier rainfall and more damage, killing at least 250 people. Some regions received 10 days of heavy rainfall.

Dorris purchased a small frame Episcopal church on Carroll Street, and Bishop Loughlin dedicated it in honor of St. Stephen. Six years later, Rev. E.J. O'Peilly began the construction of a new church at the corner of Hicks and Summit. It was designed by Patrick Keely, and dedicated by Bishop Loughlin in 1875. For several years, the spire was illuminated at night and served as a beacon for mariners entering. The old church was converted to a school under the care of the Sisters of Charity. A new school was opened in 1908. In 1913, parishioners presented the church with four statues of Carrera marble depicting Ss. Stephen, Joseph, Mary, and the Sacred Heart.

The name Alma also has several meanings in a variety of languages, and is generally translated to mean that the child \\"feeds one's soul\\" or \\"lifts the spirit\\".Browder, p. 57. Origin The exact origin of the name Alma is debated, but it is most likely derived, in the female form,Grussi, p. 274. from the Latin word almus, which means \\"kind\\", \\"fostering\\", or \\"nourishing\\". It has been most familiarized by its use in the term alma mater, which means \\"fostering mother\\", or \\"nourishing mother\\", and in modern times is most associated with a collegiate hymn or song, or to encompass the years in which a student earned their degree. Also, the Arabic word for \\"the water\\" and \\"on the water\\" are el-ma and al-ma, respectively. It may also be of Greek derivation, where the word αλμη means \\"salt water\\".Buckton, p. 490. Early appearances The Alma River. It has been applied repeatedly for the title of goddesses, namely Diana and Ceres, as well as other deities of the light, earth, and day. Alma was used classically in connotation as a way to reflect the traditional female roles in providing nurture, following its derivation from its Latin root. It was introduced with minimal usage during the Italian Renaissance, as the likely result of a character by Edmund Spenser in his poem \\"The Faerie Queene\\". Alma, who is the head of the House of Temperance, is considered to parallel the spirit metaphorically.Reid, p. 512. On 20 September 1854 the Battle of Alma, named after the Alma River nearby, which was a war between the French, English, and Ottoman empires and the Russian empire was fought and ended. This battle is typically considered to be the first battle of the Crimean War. Alma is the Crimean Tatar word for \\"apple\\". The name had limited use for females prior to the war, and afterwards it began appearing in birth registers for both male and female, and in significantly higher frequency. Alma also came in conjunction with many terms related to the circumstances of the war, such as \\"Alma Victoria\\", \\"Alma Balaklava\\" and \\"Alma Inkerman\\".Murray, p. 348. Primarily in West England,Woldmar Ruoff, p. 799. many were christened with the name Alma.Charnock, p. 6. The widespread use has been attributed to the extensive news coverage of the Crimean War.Callary, p. 6. In the Book of Mormon, a collection of fifteen books first published in 1830 that is regarded as scripture by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Alma is given as the name of two characters—a father and his son. The characters are marked by a love for and service of God and appear in the Book of Mosiah and in the Book of Alma. The name Alma also appears in Irish folklore in the masculine form: the son of Nemed was named \\"Alma One- Tooth\\",O'Boyle, p. 150. a noble prince who fought repeatedly for a respite in taxes issued by Conann on his people. In the 1910 Census (Milan Texas Precinct 7), the name Alma appears within a family descended from Bohemia (or Czechoslovakia, depending on which other document is inspected). Name statistics Alma reached its highest popularity of usage in the year 1901, when it ranked No. 52 of most popular names. In birth registers, this constituted .47% of the population, or roughly 1 in every 213 births.1 / 213 ~ .0047 = .47%, per routine calculations. Its usage today has dropped into the thousands. In numerology, the name Alma corresponds to the number 9. The characteristics of this value mean compassion, charitableness, and civility; it is regarded as being the \\"Humanitarian\\". Meaning The name Alma, with its Latin origin, appears in various European languages, and has different meanings in each.Sheehan, p. 25. These varieties do not generally stray from the notion of the wise, nurturing mother, however. *ArabicKnowing, Knowledgeable, The Unbelievable but True *AramaicWorld *AzerbaijaniApple *BashkirApple (also the ancient female Bashkir name) *ChuvashApple (ulma) *Crimean TatarApple *FinnishFruit (hedelmä) *GagauzApple *GothicWorking One, Brave One *GreekSea *HebrewMaiden, Young woman *HungarianApple *IrishApple (ull) *ItalianThe Spirit, Soul *KalmykApple (almn) *Karachay-BalkarApple *KaraimApple *KarakalpakApple *KazakhApple *KomiApple (ulmö) *KumykApple *KyrgyzApple *LatinThe Nourishing One, Kind, Life Giving, Gentle, Loving, Bounteous One and The Spiritually Supportive One *LatinApple, an arboreal fruit (mālum) *MariApple (olma) *MongolianApple (Apple in Mongolia \\"Alim\\") *NogaiApple *PortugueseThe Spirit, Soul *SpanishThe Spirit, Soul *TatarApple *TurkishApple (elma) *TurkmenApple *UdmurtApple (ulmo) *UrumApple *UyghurApple *UzbekApple (olma) In the Hebrew Bible, Almah means maiden - a young girl or a young woman.

The movement was disaffected with mainstream Italian politics, and identified themselves at demonstrations and rallies by wearing items of the colour purple, chosen because it was not associated with any major Italian political party. The group originated in October 2009 when a group of bloggers, gravitating around the anonymous figure of \\"San Precario\\" (English: \\"Saint Precarious\\"), an activist from Catania, Sicily, organised demonstrations using word of mouth, Twitter and Facebook. In October, 2009, they launched the Facebook page \\"Una Manifestazione Nazionale per Chiedere le Dimissioni di Berlusconi\\", (English: \\"A National Demonstration to Ask for Berlusconi’s Resignation\\"), announcing a demonstration to take place in Rome on 5 December 2009. The page immediately reached an unexpected consensus. Only a few weeks after, more than 300,000 users had joined the page and had announced via Facebook their presence at the event, which would be called \\"No Berlusconi Day\\". Contemporaneously, hundreds of local groups sprung joining the initiative, both inside and outside Italy. Thousands of young Italians, forced by a high level of youth unemployment to leave the Country and move abroad, planned parallel campaigns in cities such as London, New York City, Paris, Sydney, and many others. Since then, thousands of people have attended several subsequent rallies. The movement declined after the successful campaign of the referendum of 15 June 2011, but, as of May 2016, its Facebook page is still active, counting more than 420,000 users.
