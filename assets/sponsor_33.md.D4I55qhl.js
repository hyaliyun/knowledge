Spannenburg-Pagels was born in Hallum. She later lived in Wommels. Between 1917 and 1933 she won a total of 56 prizes. Next to money prizes and two medals she also won a spoon, watch and a painting. The first prize she won was when she was eleven years old, and she finished second in a boys-and-girls competition in IJlst on 12 Februari 1917. Her partner in this competition was E. de Groot, also from Wommels. She won her last prize in Marrum on 30 January 1933, the last race of the winter of 1932-33 because it states dooien. Most of the races she rode together with Jouke de Groot from Jorwerd. When he was ill, she competed several competitions in December with O. Bijlsma from Eernewoude. D. Volbeda wrote a poem in Frisian about Pagels and Jouke de Groot. Her brother Romke was also a kortebaan speed skater. He won a 14‚Äì15 years competition in Heerenveen in 1926.

County homes were total institutions housing a wide variety of people, mostly poor: the elderly, the chronically ill, the mentally ill, children, the intellectually disabled and unmarried mothers. History The county homes were founded in the early 1920s after the formation of the Irish Free State. After the abolition of the existing system of workhouses, administration was centralised under the county councils, with the following model: *a central county home for the aged and infirm *a separate infirmary section to deal with chronic and long term cases, *a county hospital for major surgery, medical cases and abnormal midwifery *district hospitals for medical cases, minor surgical cases and midwifery *fever hospitals for infectious diseaseshttps://www.nationalarchives.ie/wp- content/uploads/2019/03/PRF_106780_SURVEY_OF_HOSPITAL_BOOK_V7.pdf These reforms were retrospectively legalised by the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923. The county homes were generally run by Catholic religious orders and financed by the state. Girls and women pregnant outside of marriage were sometimes sent to Magdalene asylums and Mother and Baby Homes, where they were required to perform heavy labour and often received substandard care; they were often forced to place their children for adoption. Women who kept their children were often not wanted by their families and struggled to find employment or housing, so a large number of unmarried mothers were forced to live in county homes. Orphans and illegitimate children were often placed in county homes for a long period of time; they were used as \\"dumping grounds\\" until children could be transferred to other institutions like industrial schools. A report of 1947‚Äì48 notes that many children were abandoned in the county home by their mothers. A Poor Law Commission's report of 1927 stated that County Homes were unsuitable for unmarried mothers and babies. In 1943, about 8,000 people were living in county homes. From the 1950s onwards, county homes were reformed and standards of care improved. By the 1990s, they had been abolished, with the buildings now serving as normal hospitals. List There was one in each of the twenty-seven counties of the Republic of Ireland (Tipperary was at that time divided into North and South), except that there was none in County Louth and three in County Cork. *Athy (County Kildare): St. Vincent's Hospital *Carlow (County Carlow): located in a former British Army cavalry barracks; renamed Sacred Heart Home in 1952 *Cavan (County Cavan): St. Felim's Hospital, a former workhouse *Cashel (South Tipperary): St Patrick's Hospital *Castlebar (County Mayo): Mayo County Home *Castleblayney (County Monaghan): St Mary's Hospital *Clonakilty (West County Cork) *Cork City: St Finbarr's *Dublin: St Kevin's Institution *Dungarvan (County Waterford): St Joseph's Hospital *Ennis (County Clare): St. Joseph's County Home *Enniscorthy (County Wexford): St Senan's Hospital *Killarney (County Kerry): St. Columbanus‚Äô Hospital *Longford (County Longford): St. Joseph's Hospital *Loughrea (County Galway): St Brendan's Hospital *Manorhamilton (County Leitrim): Our Lady's Hospital *Mountmellick (County Laois / Queen's County): St. Vincent's *Mallow (North County Cork) *Mullingar (County Westmeath): Midland Regional Hospital *Newcastle West (County Limerick): St Ita's Hospital *Rathdrum (County Wicklow): St Colman's Hospital *Roscommon (County Roscommon): Sacred Heart Hospital *Sligo (County Sligo): St John's Hospital *Stranorlar (County Donegal): St Joseph's *Thomastown (County Kilkenny): St Columbkille's County Home *Thurles (North Tipperary): Community Hospital of the Assumption *Trim (County Meath): St Joseph's Hospital *Tullamore (County Offaly / King's County): Midlands Regional Hospital Cultural depictions As a symbol of the failure of the newly independent state to provide for the needs of its people, the county home has occasionally featured in fiction. Sebastian Barry's 1995 play The Steward of Christendom takes place in a county home, depicting the fractured memories of a mentally- ill former policeman. The expression \\"Goodnight Ballivor, I'll Sleep in Trim\\", famous in County Meath, is possibly a reference to the Trim county home. In Colm T√≥ib√≠n's 2009 novel Brooklyn, the main character notes that New York's \\"forgotten Irish\\" remind her of \\"men from the County Home;\\" she is a native of Enniscorthy, where the Wexford county home was sited. Niamh Boyce wrote Kitty, a sequence of poems about her grandaunt, a seamstress in the Athy county home.

He was one of the founders and former secretary general of the True Montenegro, a right-wing populist political party in Montenegro, which he left in 2019.  Biography = Early life and education  Dajkoviƒá was born in 1992 in Cetinje, which at the time was a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He finished high school in Podgorica and later graduated from the Faculty of Economics, University of Belgrade and the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education at their Mexico City campus. He also received his master's degree at the Faculty of Political Sciences, University of Belgrade. He practiced his English language skills in Washington D.C. He declares himself a Montenegrin but also a Serb. He said that for him a Montenegrin represents a Serb, and a Serb represents a Montenegrin.  Political career  In 2014, Dajkoviƒá joined the \\"Movement for Neutrality\\" and served in the main board of the movement. He was also –∞ member of the centre-right DEMOS. In September 2015, he was beaten up outside of a bar in the center of Podgorica. He gave a statement to police where he said that the manager of the bar beat him up. After the incident, Dajkoviƒá stated that the manager of the bar is closely related to then Prime Minister and the current President of Montenegro, Milo ƒêukanoviƒá. He also stated that he won't stop his political activism until ƒêukanoviƒá leaves office. He also appeared in a TV talk show hosted by a Serbian-Canadian director Boris Malagurski. Dajkoviƒá has established himself as a fierce critic of the ruling DPS of Milo ƒêukanoviƒá, as well as the accession of Montenegro to NATO. In 2018, he was one of the founders and was named the general secretary of the True Montenegro, a right-wing populist political party in Montenegro which is led by Marko Milaƒçiƒá, also a former member of the \\"Movement for Neutrality\\". In September 2019, Dajkoviƒá and Milaƒçiƒá were arrested after Milaƒçiƒá climbed on the roof of the car and gave a speech he was supposed to give in front of the prosecutor's office. The Police Administration announced that he prevented the officers of the Communal Inspection from performing their official duties. In late 2019, Milaƒçiƒá removed Dajkoviƒá from his position as the general secretary due to the \\"insurmountable loss of professional and personal trust\\". He has participated in numerous protests against the government including the Montenegrin religious protests in 2019-2020. For the 2020 Montenegrin parliamentary elections, he endorsed the coalition For the Future of Montenegro, and its leader Zdravko Krivokapiƒá. He also announced that he will be joining the campaign of the coalition. He has received media attention for posting many anti-government humorous videos on his Facebook page which numbers more than 100,000 followers. He holds good relations with a Serbian nationalist politician, Mi≈°a Vaciƒá and a Republika Srpska politician, Dra≈°ko Stanivukoviƒá with whom he participated in an anti- government rally in Nik≈°iƒá on 28 August 2020. In October 2020, Dajkoviƒá went to Belgrade to pick up his master's diploma. During the trip he met with the son of the late paramilitary commander and criminal Arkan and Serbian turbo- folk singer Ceca, Veljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá causing a controversy in the Montenegrin public. His car also ended up keyed with the inscription \\"MNE\\" (abbreviation for Montenegro). He accused the people close to President ƒêukanoviƒá for this incident.

Research and career  In 2003 Graham was appointed Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech, where he leads the Electronics Manufacturing and Reliability Laboratory. His research considers the fabrication, encapsulation and packaging of semiconductor devices. Specifically, Graham has studied wide bandgap semiconductors (including gallium nitride, GaN, gallium oxide and hafnium dioxide), and how they interact with their substrates (including silicon carbide). Such materials are often used in radio frequency communications. In these devices, thermal resistance at interfaces limits their performance. To understand how the operational stability of devices based on these materials, Graham makes use of electro-thermal and thermomechanical modelling. Beyond his work on inorganic materials, Graham has worked devices made from organic electronic materials. Making use of vacuum-based deposition to create ultrathin barriers that protect organic materials from degradation. Such barriers are essential for the realisation of wearable devices and next generation displays based upon these materials. In 2018 Graham was appointed Eugene C.

It hosted seven NASCAR Grand National (now NASCAR Cup Series) races between 1962 and 1966. The track switched from a quarter mile to third mile between 1963 and 1964.  History  After the Cavalier Kennel Club (CKC) greyhound racing track was eliminated by the North Carolina General Assembly in the 1950s, Moyock began to host auto racing at the renamed Dog Track Speedway (DTS). Built on the former site of the CKC, the one-quarter-mile oval dirt track was then paved and lengthened to one-third of a mile in 1964. The track was accessible from North Carolina Highway 168. At the DTS, it hosted seven NASCAR races from 1962 until 1966. The Moyock 300 was held there from 1964‚Äì1965 in addition to the Tidewater 300 in 1965. Ned Jarrett won the most races at the track with four wins (1962, 1963, 1964, and one of the two 1965 races). The three other winners were Jimmy Pardue (first 1963 race), Dick Hutcherson (first 1965 race), and David Pearson (1966). In the 1964 race, the race was stopped due to rain with Pearson in the lead and the feature resumed to conclusion on the following night. The 1965 race was NASCAR's season finale. Ned Jarrett won his 13th race of the season to secure the season championship. It was his second championship; he would not win another NASCAR Richard Petty, a North Carolina native from Randleman, also raced there six times, driving a Plymouth in every race. Despite being on the pole twice (1965 & 1966), Petty never finished above 3rd place. He does hold the track NASCAR record speed of 63.965 miles per hour. The final NASCAR race at the DTS ran on Sunday, May 29, 1966. It was 301 laps (99.9 miles) as NASCAR scoring missed the length by one lap. David Pearson took the checkered flag in a 1964 Dodge with an average speed of 61.913 miles per hour (99.639 km/h) and winning $1,000. Wendell Scott was the only driver to start all seven NASCAR races. The track was closed later in 1966 due to declining attendance, poor revenues and larger tracks being built nearby.The site where Dog Track Speedway formally stood is now located on an abandoned lot in the Tidewater region.

Completed and commissioned in 1943, she served in World War II and disappeared after departing for her first war patrol in November 1943. Construction and commissioning I-40 was laid down on 18 March 1942 at the Kure Navy Yard at Kure, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 370. Renamed I-40 on 20 August 1942 and provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District that day, she was launched on 10 November 1942. She was completed and commissioned on 31 July 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, I-40 was attached formally to the Yokosuka Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 in the 1st Fleet for work-ups. During August 1943, she took part in testing of sonar and magnetic anomaly detector equipment in the Seto Inland Sea, serving as an antisubmarine warfare target for the minelayer . With her work-ups completed, I-40 was reassigned to Submarine Division 1 in Submarine Squadron 2 in the 6th Fleet on 31 October 1943. She departed Yokosuka on 13 November 1943 bound for Truk, which she reached on 19 November 1943. The Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign began on 20 November 1943 with the U.S. invasion of Tarawa and of Makin in the Gilbert Islands. That day, I-40 and the submarines , , , , , , , and all received orders to proceed to the Gilberts and oppose the invasion. I-40 got underway from Truk on 22 November 1943 to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area off Makin Island. The Japanese never heard from her again. On 26 November 1943, the 6th Fleet ordered I-40 to join I-19, I-169 and RO-38 in forming a picket line north of Makin, and on 2 December 1943 it ordered I-19, , and I-40 to report their positions. I-40 did not respond to either message. The circumstances of I-40‚Ä≤s loss remain a mystery. The destroyer sank a Japanese submarine southwest of Tarawa on 23 November 1943 which probably was I-39 but could have been I-40. It also has been proposed that land-based United States Navy aircraft teamed with the destroyer to sink her and that Radford alone sank her. On 21 February 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-40 to be presumed lost with her entire crew of 97 in the Gilbert Islands area. She was stricken from the Navy list on 30 April 1944.

Styles won the competition with his essay The Animal Creation: Its Claims on Our Humanity Stated and Enforced, which is an early work on animal rights. Styles based his arguments on Christian principles from the Bible, arguing that animals feel pain and suffer as humans do and that because God has given humans dominion over animals, they should treat them with benevolence and mercy. Historian Anna Feuerstein has noted that \\"Styles compares humans to a shepherd, positioning animal welfare as pastoral power\\". The book was positively reviewed in the The Herald of Peace and The Monthly Review. Styles opposed all forms of hunting and vivisection. Styles was not a vegetarian but did criticize the luxuries of meat-eating. Historian Rod Preece has suggested that Styles plagiarized from Thomas Young's An Essay on Humanity to Animals, 1798 and the SPCA jury did not notice. He died at Kennington on June 22, 1849.

France is one of the few countries in which it is legal to marry a partner posthumously.https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7dd1d624-6027-4412-9830-50e881615ef4  Origins  A few women were married by use of proxy to soldiers that had died weeks earlier. This practice came to be called posthumous marriage. Posthumous marriage for civilians originated in the 1950s, when a dam broke and killed 400 people in Fr√©jus, France, including a man named Andr√© Capra, who was engaged to Ir√®ne Jodart. Jodart pleaded with French President Charles de Gaulle to let her go along with her marriage plans even though her fianc√© had died. She had support from the media and within months was allowed to marry her fianc√©. It is likely that posthumous marriage (un mariage posthume) was made as an extension to France's proxy marriage.  Legislation  Within months after the Fr√©jus dam tragedy, France's parliament drafted a law permitting posthumous marriage. Since then, hundreds of women have formally filed for what is known as postmortem matrimony. Posthumous marriage became legal in France by Article 171 of the civil code which states: \\"The President of the Republic may, for serious reasons, authorize the solemnization of marriage if one of the spouses died after completion of official formalities marking it unequivocal consent. In this case, the effects of marriage dated back to the day preceding the death of the husband. However, this marriage does not entail any right of intestate succession for the benefit of the surviving spouse and no matrimonial property is deemed to have existed between the spouses.\\"  Rules  Anyone in France who wants to file for posthumous marriage sends a request to the President of France, who forwards it to the Justice Minister, who forwards it to the prosecutor for the surviving member's district. If the couple had originally planned on getting married and the family of the deceased approves, the prosecutor sends the application back to the President. One out of every four applicants for posthumous marriage is rejected. Examples of ways to legally show intent are for the man to have posted banns (official wedding announcements) at the local courthouse or written permission from a soldier's commanding officer. Requests also include records that show a serious cause such as the birth of a child or the death of the fianc√©. Pregnancy alone or a letter to that promises marriage does not suffice, partly because such letters have a reputation for being illegitimate. The marriage applies retroactively to the day before the deceased spouse died. Even if they were engaged and had published banns, a posthumous marriage will not necessarily happen, partly because living engaged couples can change their minds at the last minute. A posthumous marriage can also be thwarted by the testimony of a trustworthy individual. The judge's role is to make sure that the paperwork has been properly filled out. The judge cannot question the authority of the documents.  Review of application  Article 171 of the Civil Code requires that application refers to serious reasons for posthumous marriage. The President of the Republic carefully considers the seriousness of the circumstances of the death.  Ceremony  In France, a woman will often stand next to a picture of her deceased fianc√© while the ceremony is taking place. The mayor conducting the ceremony will read the Presidential decree instead of the deceased man's marriage vows.  Reasons  The primary reason for the posthumous marriage in France is to legitimize children that a woman might have. It is also done for emotional reasons. Posthumous spouses usually prefer to keep quiet about posthumously marrying. However, a recent spouse, named Christelle Demichel, wrote a letter to The New York Times to let people know that they have the option of marrying their lost loved ones. Dimichel described the marriage as perfect and stated that ‚Äúit remained in the spirit of a wedding‚Äù.  Inheritance  The law does not permit the living spouse to receive any of the deceased spouse's property or money. No matrimonial property is considered to have existed between the two living spouses.  Effects  After a posthumous marriage the living spouse inherently becomes a widow or widower. Posthumous marriage will also bring the surviving spouse into the family of the deceased spouse, which can create an alliance or moral satisfaction. The surviving spouse is also subject to impediments of marriage that result. Posthumous marriage also shows the strength of an individual to overcome a fianc√©'s death. Article 171 specifically states that the usual financial aspects of a marriage, such as liquidation of matrimonial regime or the granting of intestate inheritance (meaning the laws governing inheritances of people whose spouses die without a will) do not apply. The widow can, however, receive a pension and can be entitled to insurance benefits.

Alongside Kana Hasegawa and Shizunojo Takeshita, she was one of the first women to produce modern haiku. She is held as an equal to her male contemporaries, and her work is known for its gorgeous phrasing. She had a difficult home life and a turbulent relationship with her mentor, the poet Kyoshi Takahama. Her tragic life often became the source material for her work.  Biography = Early life  Hisajo Sugita was born in Kagoshima City in Japan's Kagoshima Prefecture in 1890. Her birth name was Hisa, not Hisajo. She was the third daughter of Renzo Akahori, the minister of finance, and his wife, Sayo. Her father was frequently transferred to different places for work, so before she turned 12 years old Sugita had lived in Naha, Okinawa; Chiayi, Taiwan; and Taipei. She graduated from Tokyo Women‚Äôs Higher Normal School (now Ochanomizu University High School) in 1908. In 1909, she married Udai Sugita, an art teacher and painter. Hisajo said she had always dreamed of marrying a painter. The couple moved to Kokura in Fukuoka Prefecture (now Kitakyushu), where her husband had been hired to teach. In 1911, she gave birth to her first daughter, Masako. Five years later, her second daughter, Mitsuko, was born.  Haiku career and turbulent home life  Sugita's older brother Gessen Akahori, who was a haiku poet, came to stay with her in 1917. It was then that he introduced her to writing haiku. Previously, Sugita had aimed to become a novelist, but she became fascinated with the haiku form. She began to write for the Japanese literary magazine Hototogisu, with her first poem debuting in the magazine in 1917. In May of that year, she met Kyoshi Takahama at a gathering of haiku poets hosted by Misako Ijima. By that time her husband had stopped producing art, and she was disappointed by her life with him. Instead, she became an ardent admirer of Takahama, and he became her mentor. Rumors of an affair swirled. In 1920, as Sugita began to suffer from kidney disease, she also began to talk of divorce. But her husband refused to agree to it. He blamed the family discord on her focus on her work, and she temporarily stopped writing haikus. In 1922, the couple were baptized and became Christians. Eventually Sugita resumed her work, and in 1930 she won a national prize for scenic haiku. In 1932, she founded the women-only haiku magazine Hanai, which ran for five issues. Sugita was desperate to publish her own book of poetry. She wrote again and again to Takahama, begging him to write the preface for it, even visiting Tokyo to make a personal appeal, but eventually she was forced to shelve the project. In 1936, for unknown reasons, she was kicked out of the Hototogisu literary community alongside Sojo Hino and Zenjido Yoshioka. At this point, she found herself unable to focus on her work and fell into a long depression. She returned to writing in 1939, putting a more autobiographical slant on her poems.  Death and legacy  After the end of World War II, in October 1945, Sugita was admitted to a hospital in Fukuoka due to nutritional deficits, as food shortages had plagued the country. On January 21, 1946, she died of a combination of malnutrition and the kidney disease she had long suffered from. She was 56 years old. She was buried in the Sugita family graveyard in Obara Village in Aichi Prefecture (now a part of Toyota City), and in 1957 some of her ashes were brought to the Akahori family cemetery in Matsumoto, Nagano. She did not live to see the publication of her long-awaited poetry collection, which her daughter Masako Ishi, who had become a poet herself, released in 1952.

From an initial circulation of 15,000, sales had risen to 32,000 by mid-1986 with half that number again sold abroad. The magazine cost 90p and consisted of around 70 pages.

The small two-seat, mid-engined car was the inspiration for the Fiat X1/9 that appeared in 1972. History In 1967 designer Pio Manz√π showed his mid-engined Prototipo 111 based on the transverse powertrain from the Autobianchi A111 sedan, and one year later displayed his Autobianchi Coup√© at the Turin Auto Show. A similar design that used the powertrain from the Autobianchi Primula was done by Dante Giacosa at Societ√† industriale ricerche automobilistiche (SIRA - Automotive Industry Research Company), with initial fabrication done by OSI, and a full prototype called the G31 built later by Centro Stylo Fiat in 1969. The Autobianchi A112 Runabout was designed by Marcello Gandini at Bertone. This small barchetta used the same transverse mid-engine layout as the much larger and more exotic Lamborghini Miura of 1966, which had also been designed by Gandini. The Runabout also exhibited the pronounced wedge shaped profile that would distinguish many of Gandini's designs from this time, including the 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo. With Fiat planning the end of the Fiat 850 product line, Bertone needed a car to replace the 850 Spider that it was building for Fiat at their Grugliasco factory. Around this time there was also growing concern that the United States would shortly implement rollover safety requirements that would effectively ban traditional convertibles. The Runabout, with chassis number 41258, debuted at the 1969 Turin Auto Show, which ran from 29 October 1969 to 9 November 1969. Gianni Agnelli saw the Runabout in 1971, and approved developing it into the X1/9. In September 2015 ownership of the Runabout passed to Automotoclub Storico Italiano (ASI - \\"Italian Historical Automobile Club\\"), when the club acquired the Bertone Carrozzeria collection. Features Bertone Runabout concept The overall shape of the car was inspired by the racing boats of the mid-1960s.The hood was long and flat with a tapering central indentation and an Autobianchi badge inset just back of the tip. There was also a full-length indented feature at the plimsoll-line. The car's rear aspect was reminiscent of a boat's transom with a shallow well. The front overhang was long, but the rear was short. The wide, low profile tires and wheels were enclosed under nearly flat wheel arches. There were no doors on the passenger or driver sides. The only items above the sill line were a low clear curved wind deflector and a foil-shaped forward-swept rollbar similar in appearance to the radar arches on some boats. The rollbar gave the car the appearance of a targa top. The headlamps were not mounted in the nose of the car. Instead they were in prominent nacelles incorporated into the lower legs of the rollbar/arch, behind the occupants' seats. On the interior, the only instrumentation was a speedometer, in the style of a nautical compass, mounted in the centre of the top of the dashboard. Although named for the Autobianchi A112 Supermini and retaining that car's transverse engine configuration, the Runabout did not use the A112's Tipo 100 overhead valve engine. Instead, it received the new- for-1969 Fiat 128 SOHC engine that had been developed for the Fiat 128 by former Ferrari engine designer Aurelio Lampredi. This engine featured a cast- iron block, aluminum cylinder head and a belt-driven single overhead camshaft. The engine in the Runabout displaced . It was mated to a transverse four speed manual transmission. Influence Some point to the G31 as leading to the X1/9. Others suggest that the 1971 De Tomaso 1600 Spider, which was startlingly similar to the later X1/9, was the predecessor. In the De Tomaso's case it has been suggested that this was either imitation as a form of flattery, or an elaborate joke at Fiat's expense. Regardless, the Runabout is generally considered to have been the inspiration for the X1/9, which is how it was described on Bertone's own website. Elements of the Runabout's design have also been noted in the subsequent Lancia Stratos.

Summary The Myth of the Birth of the Hero comprises three parts (the first two sections were originally published in 1909, and the final section was added when the work was republished in 1922). In the first section, Rank introduces his topic of investigation, noting: \\"Whatever one‚Äôs opinion as to their origin, one is struck by an insistent tendency in the myths to make all heroic figures fit the framework of a specific birth legend.\\" He then emphasizes \\"the role played by unconscious psychosexual life in myth formation.\\" In the work's second section, Rank closes analyzes mythes about the births of Sargon of Akkad, Moses, Karna, Oedipus, Paris, Telephos, Perseus, Dionysus, Gilgamesh, Cyrus the Great, Trakhan, Tristan, Romulus, Hercules, Jesus, Sigurd, Lohengrin, and Sceafa.The first edition does not include the stories of Dionysus and Trakhan.

His origin is preceded by difficulties, such as sexual abstinence, > prolonged infertility, or secret intercourse of the parents due to external > prohibition or obstacles. During or before the pregnancy, a prophecy, in the > form of a dream or oracle, warns against his birth, usually threatening harm > to the father. Therefore the newborn child, usually at the instigation of > the father or his representative, is doomed to be killed or exposed. As a > rule, he is surrendered to the water, in a box.

That year, the government of Atlanta, lead by Atlanta mayor Ivan Allen Jr., erected a barricade in the Cascade Heights neighborhood, mostly along Peyton Road, for the purposes of dissuading African Americans from moving into the neighborhood. The act was criticized by many African American leaders and civil rights groups in the city, and the following year the barricade was ruled unconstitutional and removed. The incident is seen as one of the most public example of white Americans fears of racial integration in Atlanta.  Background  Cascade Heights is an affluent neighborhood of Atlanta located in the southwestern part of the city. During the early 1960s, the neighborhood and surrounding area began to undergo a racial transformation as many African Americans began to move into the area. In December 1962, Clinton Warner, a D-Day veteran, civil rights activist, and founding member of the Morehouse School of Medicine, purchased a home in Peyton Forest, a white subdivision in Cascade Heights. Shortly thereafter, the neighborhood became the sight of blockbusting, wherein several of the white homeowners, fearful that more African Americans would move into their neighborhood, began to sell their properties to real estate agents who then sold the property to African Americans at a higher mark up. Following this, white homeowners in the neighborhood petitioned Atlanta mayor Ivan Allen Jr. to erect a barricade along Peyton Road and Harlan Road to deter more African Americans from moving into the area. The Atlanta Board of Aldermen approved their request on December 17, which was quickly signed into law by Allen, and work on the barricade started the next day. The move was seen as part of a larger effort by Allen to prevent \\"encroachment and penetration\\" into white neighborhoods of southwest Atlanta, and months earlier, Allen had vetoed a proposal to establish an African American cemetery near Westview Cemetery in the area.  The barricade  The \\"wall\\" was a short barricade, about tall, made of wood and steel. Almost immediately after the barricade was erected, the African American community began to voice their disapproval of the structure. Newspapers in the city called it \\"Atlanta's Wall,\\" and black Atlantans referred to it is \\"Atlanta's Berlin Wall\\". The reference to Berlin was especially poignant to Allen, who, in his inaugural address, said, ‚ÄúIt was in Berlin that the tragic and dramatic lesson of what happens to a divided city came home to me.‚Äù Protestors continued to evoke the image of postwar Europe with protest sayings such as, \\"We want no Warsaw Ghetto ‚Äì open Peyton Road.\\" According to historian Paul M. Farber, these efforts sought to link racial segregation in the United States to \\"Cold War division\\" and \\"Holocaust trauma.\\" African Americans lead a boycott in West End, Atlanta against the barricade. The Committee on Appeal for Human Rights (COAHR), the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and Atlanta's Committee for Cooperative Action (ACCA) formed a committee to coordinate efforts to protest the barricade. A statement signed by Martin Luther King Sr. and the president of the Atlanta chapter of the NCAA called the barricade \\"one of Atlanta's gravest mistakes and a slap at our national creed of democracy and justice.\\" In a December 22 letter sent by the COAHR to Allen, they describe the opposition to the wall by Atlanta University students and how they will continue to protest the \\"Atlanta Wall,\\" urging Allen to remove it. In a telegram sent the next day, Allen stated that he had assembled a committee to look into the matter. The student protests at the wall were covered in a January 1963 issue of Jet. Many other publications and journalists from across the United States covered the incident as well, with Time discussing the event in an article called \\"Divided City.\\" On January 7, 1963, Atlanta's board of aldermen again voted in favor of keeping the barricade in place, and following this the attorney representing those opposed to the barricade appealed his case to the Fulton County Superior Court. On March 1, 1963, a judge ruled the barrier unconstitutional, and within minutes of the decision Allen ordered the barricade to be removed. According to Allen, the day the judge was set to render his decision, he had a crew set up near the barricade, and after hearing the decision, they had it completely removed within 20 minutes. Ultimately, the barrier had remained in place for 72 days.  Aftermath  Following the removal of the barricades, the neighborhood and surrounding area continued to undergo a racial transformation, amplified by white flight from the area and Atlanta as a whole. Many middle class African American families moved into the area, and by July 1963, only 15 white families remained in the neighborhood. The incident is seen as one of the most public displays of white fear towards racial transformation, and during the 1960s and 1970s, approximately 160,000 white Americans moved from Atlanta, with many moving to nearby areas outside of city limits. Today, the area is home to many \\"black elites\\" in Atlanta. Criticism of the incident surprised Allen, who had believed that the barricade would put more focus on unused land north of Cascade Heights. Discussing the event years later in his autobiography, Allen claimed he was \\"completely in error in trying to solve the issue in such a crude way\\" and stated that he had not sought out sufficient advice prior to his decision. In general, the incident is viewed as a misstep by Allen, who has an otherwise strong legacy with regards to promoting civil rights.

The label was coined as an epithet by hard-line anti-communist Cuban exiles. The first dialogueros to emerge in the United States were Cuban students in the 1960s and 70s. These students developed various student organizations dedicated to discussing Cuban identity, culture, and politics. Many of these students were influenced by social movements and radical politics in the United States at the time. Various politically diverse publications were formed from these circles such as Nueva Generaci√≥n, Joven Cuba, ¬°Cuba Va!, Krisis, and Are√≠to. The emergence of dialogueros broke the staunch conservative atmosphere of Cuban exile politics, and opened the possibility of a Cuban-American left. History=Origins 1968 anti-war marchers carrying a picture of Che Guevara. By 1965 the last counterrevolutionary guerrillas in Cuba would be captured and another wave of Cuban emigration would start via the Camarioca boatlift. By this time hope in overthrowing Fidel Castro was fading, and exiles became concerned with new hardships faced in the United States. Cuban reformists would emerge who advocated for the needs of underprivileged Cuban emigrants. This interest in improving social conditions sparked an interest in some Cuban exiles in the social benefits brought to Cuba by the Cuban government. Many young Cubans who departed from the island in the early years of the Cuban exile would later struggle with their identity and assimilation in a foreign land. As young Cubans began to come of age in the United States many became interested in Cuban identity, exiles' relationship to Cuba, and Cuban-Americans' relationship with other American minorities. This younger generation also experienced the United States during the rising anti-war movement, civil rights movement, and feminist movement of the 1960s, causing them to be influenced by radicals that encouraged political introspection, and social justice. Figures like Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were also heavily praised among American student radicals at the time. Those most likely to become more radical were Cubans who were more culturally isolated from being outside the Cuban enclave of Miami. Formation Some of the first people to voice a desire to normalize relations with Cuba were academics. The Miami based Institution of Cuban Studies first met in 1969 and called for less aggressive relations with Cuba. Cuban and American based scholars began to collaborate and managed to cooperate on scholarly works at the time, despite legal restrictions. One of the first student organizations to call for a rapprochement with Cuba would be the Juventud Cubana Socialista in New York City. They would call for the return of Cuban exiles to Cuba to support government campaigns on the island. The organization was short lived but became a model for future organizations. Of the younger generation of more left-wing Cuban exiles many would feel obligated as Cubans to protest human rights violations in Cuba, others would come to view the Cuban Revolution as tolerable and an inevitable event in Cuba's history, and some would even come to give radical outright sympathies for the Cuban government. Those who felt obligated to protest the Cuban government joined protest organizations like Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil, or Abdala. Others would turn to writing and founded many journals like Nueva Generaci√≥n, Joven Cuba, ¬°Cuba Va!, Krisis, and Are√≠to where scholarly articles about Cuban history and culture would be shared as well as idealistic calls to action. These journals would reflect various political positions. Joven Cuba often advocated that Cuban exiles work for social change in the United States with other Latinos and minority groups, ¬°Cuba Va! often advocated that Cubans on and off the island constituted one single people, and Are√≠to was the most radical advocating that Cuban exiles are destined to Cuba and it's revolutionary changes. Of the young Cubans that were radicalized they still remained uncomfortable with their new beliefs, those that gained sympathies for the Cuban government still were repulsed by the regime's repressive activities, and those that would come to fully support the Cuban government found that other non-Cuban leftists often stereotyped them as right-wing anti-communists for being Cubans. Rapprochement and backlash Between 1972 and 1976 over a hundred terrorist bombings would occur in Miami targeting people believed to be conspiring with the Cuban government. In 1973 Lourdes Casal became the first Cuban exile to return to Cuba with the help of the Instituto Cubano de Amistad con los Pueblos. Contributors to the journal Are√≠to would be granted travel visas to Cuba and visited the island in 1977, the travelers eventually labeled themselves as the Antonio Maceo Brigade. In 1978 the Cuban government opened a dialogue with representatives from the Cuban exile community. The dialogue resulted in the release of political prisoners, and the ability for exiles to travel to Cuba which brought in 100,000 exiles to visit by 1979. In 1979 Carlos Mu√±iz Varela would be assassinated by extremists for his participation in the Antonio Maceo Brigade and 1978 dialogue. In 1982 when the Antonio Maceo Brigade opened a press conference in Miami they would be heckled until being forced to cancel the event. 1990 proposals In 1990 in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989 various observers believed the Cuban government would soon collapse as other Eastern Bloc countries had. Cuban activist organizations in Cuba and the United States began calling for negotiations with the Cuban government to ensure democratic measures would be put in place in Cuba. The idea stirred intense controversy again in Cuban exile circles and was never executed. Legacy=Cuban studies Journals and organizations dedicated to Cuban Studies emerged alongside the many dialoguero journals interested in Cuban culture at the time. By 1975 the journal \\"Cuban Studies\\" would begin publication. Disillusion Most of the original journals fell out of print by the late 1970s but Are√≠to continued into the mid 1980s. Many members of Are√≠to and the Antonio Maceo Brigade became disillusioned with the Cuban government with age, as they believed they saw the failures of the many promises the government made to advance the country.

During the Occupation of Alcatraz she worked as one of the cooks who provided food to those living on the island. Her career was as an administrator for various California Indian organizations. Subsequently she became a well-known doll maker, basketweaver, jeweler, and teacher of Pomo handicrafts. In 2008, she and her family were disenrolled from the Robinson Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California. She fought the action claiming it was politically motivated until her death. Posthumously, in 2017, her membership, as well as for her other family members, was reinstated in the first known case where a tribe reversed its decision on membership termination without a court ruling. Early life Luwana Kay Quitiquit was born on November 13, 1941 in Isleton, Sacramento County, California to Marie (n√©e Boggs) and Claro A. Quitiquit. Her mother was an Eastern Pomo and a member of the Robinson Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California. Her father was from Caoayan, in the Ilocos Sur province of The Philippines. Her entire family worked in agriculture as farm laborers in the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta. She attended the David Bixler Elementary School in Tracy, California and graduated from Tracy Joint Union High School. Career After her graduation, Quitiquit began working as a secretary at the University of California, Berkeley. In November 1969, she took her children, Alan and Christina Harrison, and Tyrone A. Douglas (1966‚Äì2004), sailing from Sausalito, California to Alcatraz Island. They participated in the Occupation of Alcatraz and along with Linda Aranaydo (Muscogee Creek), Quitiquit provided food for the people living on the island. While on Alcatraz, she met Edward D. Castillo (Luise√±o-Cahuilla), an activist and member of the initial board of directors for the Indians of All Tribes, with whom she would later marry and have a daughter, Suelumatra. Quitiquit and her children stayed on the island until the occupation ended in 1971. After attending courses at the University of California, Riverside, Quitiquit completed her bachelor's degree from University of California, Berkeley in 1977. During her schooling, she began taking basket weaving lessons from Mabel McKay, last surviving tribe member of the Cache Creek Pomo nation and a world-renowned Pomo basket maker. To reach McKay's home in Nice, California, Quitiquit had to travel over 80 miles. After completing her studies, Quitiquit moved to San Bernardino, California and became the executive director of the San Bernardino Indian Center and in 1979 worked in the Office of Criminal Justice Planning in Sacramento. By the early 1980s, Quitiquit was directing the Economic Advancement for Rural Tribal Habitats (EARTH) organization in Ukiah, which focused on economic development for American Indians living in Lake County, California, and in areas around Mendocino and Sonoma. She worked to obtain state and federal grants to assist in community infrastructure projects for the Coyote Valley Reservation and Hopland, Laytonville, Manchester-Point Arena, Robinson, and Upper Lake Rancherias. From 1986 through 2009 she represented the Robinson Rancheria on the InterTribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council. The Council was designed to conserve and protect 7,100 acres of land recovered from Georgia Pacific Corporation and which was eventually split by giving 3,300 acres to the Sinkyone Wilderness State Park and the remaining 3,800 acres to the consortium of 10 federally recognized tribal groups. Because of the need for native plants to make traditional baskets, she worked to establish gardens and pass on her knowledge of native plants to younger tribe members. Simultaneously with her work on the Council, Quitiquit worked in Redwood Valley, California as deputy director of the Consolidated Tribal Health Project and participated in educational seminars. Her vision of wellness for Native people included not only physical and mental health, but ties to artistic and cultural traditions. When she retired, Quitiquit began working on and exhibiting her handicrafts more regularly. Though mostly known for her basketwork and cradle weavings, she also produced dolls made of acorns and jewelry made from traditional abalone, beads, nuts and shells. Quitiquit organized a system to train Pomo weavers and preserve the traditional craft. Using her skills as a grant writer, she was able to find funding to establish training courses in both weaving and gathering traditional materials needed to carry on the craft. She taught one member from each of the seven Lake County Pomo tribes, who in turn trained others. She also operated the Pomo Fine Art Gallery in Lucerne to give native artists a venue to market their works.  Disenrollment controversy  In 2008, Quitiquit and her entire family were terminated from tribal membership in the Robinson Rancheria. The disenrollment occurred in a dispute which the Tribal Chair Tracey Avila characterized as removing improperly enrolled members. Avila stated that while the ousted members were definitely American Indian, she believed that they were enrolled in the wrong tribe. Quitiquit maintained that the issue had to do with a disputed election, in which her family had supported Eddie \\"EJ\\" Crandall, who won the election but whose victory was set aside by the claim by Avila that he should be terminated from membership and was disqualified from running in the election. As a result of the disenrollments, Quitiquit and her family lost their tribal housing benefits, health care, jobs, education benefits and cultural ties, as well as retirement benefits and elder meal services. She worked to raise funds to mount a legal battle against the termination of membership. In 2010, the Bureau of Indian Affairs refused to intervene, stating that the issue of tribal membership was an internal governance decision. After the ruling, the Tribal Council, conveined a Tribal Court in 2011 to evaluate eviction orders for the family members. During the trials, Quitiquit died and her family vowed to continue the quest for reinstatement to their tribe. Death and legacy Quitiquit died on December 23, 2011 at her home in Nice, Lake County, California. In 2012, the Tribal Court issued eviction notices for her family and posthumously for Quitiquit. In 2015, Crandall was elected Tribal Chair and led a campaign to readmit disenrolled tribal members. Two years later, under his leadrship, the Tribal Council voted to reinstate all members of the Quitiquit family and others who had been terminated from tribal membership in 2008. The reinstatement was the first known case in the country where a tribe reversed its decision on membership termination without a court ruling.

Definition For two treatments, differential effects is the effect of applying one treatment in lieu of the other. Differential effects are not immune to differential biases, whose possible consequences are examined by sensitivity analysis. Methods In statistics and data science, causality is often tested via regression analysis. Several methods can be used to distinguish actual differential effects from spurious correlations. First, the balancing score (namely propensity score) matching method can be implemented for controlling the covariate balance. Second, the difference-in- differences (DID) method with a parallel trend assumption (2 groups would show a parallel trend if neither of them experienced the treatment effect) is a useful method to reduce the impact of extraneous factors and selection bias . The differential effect of treatments (DET) was explored using several examples and models. In the biomedicine area, differential effects of early hippocampal pathology were investigated on episodic and semantic memory. The differential effects of apolipoproteins E3 and E4 were also examined on neuronal growth in vitro.

Early life  Kajiyama studied at the Imperial Japanese Army Air Academy from 1944 to 1945. After the end of World War II disbanded the Academy, he entered Nihon University, from which he graduated in 1947. He then took over his family's business in Ibaraki Prefecture for several years.  Political career  After a stint in the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly from 1955 to 1969, Kajiyama was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1969 general election, the first of nine electoral victories. Kajiyama drew controversy in 1990 when, following an arrest of prostitutes in Shinjuku, he commented: \\"'It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because blacks move in, and whites are forced out.\\" Kajiyama became a prominent supporter of faction leader Noboru Takeshita. He served as Minister of Home Affairs under the Takeshita cabinet from 1987 to 1989, as Minister of International Trade and Industry under the Uno cabinet from 1989 to 1990, as Minister of Justice under the Kaifu cabinet from 1990 to 1992. He then served as Secretary-General of the LDP from 1992 to 1993, resigning in the wake of the unsuccessful 1993 general election. In a political comeback, he was appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary under Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto from January 1996 to July 1998, and thereafter unsuccessfully challenged Keizo Obuchi for the presidency of the LDP. In the midst of a financial crisis, Kajiyama advocated allowing large banks to fail through a \\"hard landing\\" policy, rather than providing government support to keep them afloat. Kajiyama's supporters in his \\"rebellion\\" included Yoshihide Suga, who would later serve as Chief Cabinet Secretary under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the 2010s.

Early Life Derrickson was born on the Westbank Indian Reserve in the British Columbia interior to Ted Derrickson and Margaret (nee Schoven) on October 6, 1941. As a young man, he worked as a fruit picker and a welder and rancher before he was elected Westbank band chief in 1976. West Bank Band Chief Over the next ten years he led his band in a period of rapid economic development, taking it from one of the poorest in British Columbia to one of the wealthiest. He returned to band leadership in 1998 and broke new ground by leading his people on a logging venture on their Aboriginal title lands with an Indigenous rather than a provincial permit, an action that led to similar logging initiatives among B.C. Indigenous peoples. In 1986, the federal government launched an enquiry into Derrickson's tenure as chief in the form of the Hall Commission. The enquiry cleared him of any wrong-doing. Grand Chief and Author Derrickson was made a Grand Chief by the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs in 2012 in recognition of his lifetime of political and economic leadership.

Plot Jerry Morgan appears in the court. He has to answer for more than 250 parking violations that were actually committed by his friend Norm with Jerry‚Äôs car. On Norm's advice Jerry pleads guilty to receive a minor penalty, but now he has to go to jail for several weeks. Soon after his release, Jerry learns that, in the meantime, Norm has sublet his apartment and that his girlfriend has dumped him. As the two are short of money, Norm has the idea to hire a ship to Holland and to perform as knife throwers. Things go terribly wrong and they kill two of the ship‚Äôs servants. Therefore, they are taken into police custody when arriving in Amsterdam, where they are ordered to return to America on a cargo ship three days later. They have some time to visit the city, where they meet a talented female band, the Dolly Dots. Norm poses as an employee of Jerry, whom he introduces as Lou Winters, being the boss of Capitol Records. They offer the women that in case they ever visit Los Angeles, they will be welcome anytime. They attend another performance of the band in the evening, which results in a brawl, all ending up in police custody. The American attach√© in charge wants to get rid of the two Americans immediately. He chauffeurs them personally to a small airport and puts them into a shaky, hardly airworthy plane. The crew, a drunken female pilot and her simple-minded copilot, take them to the United States. Back in Los Angeles, Jerry and Norm are doing their normal, low-paid jobs. Jerry works in a hotel kitchen and Norm drives a cab around the city. The Dolly Dots actually come to Los Angeles to be managed by Lou Winters. They stay at the same hotel where Jerry works, because Lou Winters is staying there as well. Jerry and Norm manage to play their fake roles credibly in front of the band through various diversionary tactics. They arrange a small gig for the band and the go with them to a hip party. However, their cover is blown, as the lead singer of the band Dead Meat knows the real Lou Winters. The Dolly Dots are terribly disappointed by the two pretenders, hence, they want to leave Los Angeles for Holland again. Still, Jerry and Norm have a final plan, they want to make sure that the band gets their chance to play an important gig after all. In the evening Dead Meat performs in front of different music producers. Jerry and Norm disguise as roadies and are able to smuggle in the Dolly Dots. They lead helium through hoses to the microphones, so that the voice pitches of Dead Meat are changed. The band is booed off the stage, giving the Dolly Dots their chance to enter the stage and play. Lou Winters is really pleased and decides to sign the band.

Ewing's art explores and translates the literal and emotional dimensions of these subjects. Along with historical images of artifacts and victims of violence, Ewing often layers in quotations by different writers. Reading these quotations, sometimes obscured by the visual elements of the piece, creates another experience that is unique and nuanced within the context of the print, sculpture or installation.

It was later renovated in the 80's by Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osme√±a who also negotiated with the Belgian government for the construction of a nearby fish port. Through City Ordinance No. 1419, the city government in March 1992 renamed Bugallon Street, where the market is located, to Belgium Street to recognize the Belgian government's role in the area's economic development. Several incidents of protected species and products derived from them being sold in the market have also been reported such as manta ray, sting ray, green sea turtle, and shark meat.

He was created a baronet the same year, although it is unclear if the legal process was complete at the time of his death. Early life Edward Broughton was born in around 1620 into a gentry family, the Broughtons of Marchwiel, Denbighshire, with a tradition of military service in the Royal armies of England. The family probably originated in Cheshire; they first appear in Welsh records in the 16th century. Broughton's father, Sir Edward Broughton, was knighted in 1618, and was a Commissioner of Array for Denbighshire in 1642. At least two of Broughton's uncles and one brother were Royalist officers during the Civil War, while another brother, Francis, was said to have served as a captain in Parliament's army. Holding the rank of captain, Broughton accompanied his uncle, the peripatetic professional soldier and Thirty Years' War veteran Colonel Robert Broughton, to Ireland in 1641 as part of Charles I's efforts to suppress a serious rebellion. Broughton remained in the country for 18 months, fighting in the subsequent Confederate War and returning with the rank of major. English Civil War Prince Rupert of the Rhine. Broughton served under Rupert in 1644-5 Embroiled in a political crisis, Charles opened hostilities against the Parliament of England in August 1642 and on his return to England, Broughton joined a new Royalist regiment of foot being formed by Sir Michael Woodhouse in Shropshire. In October 1643 he took part in an attack on the Parliamentarian garrison at Wem, where he was wounded. It is possible that later the same month he was one of \\"two sons\\" of Sir Edward kidnapped alongside him from Marchwiel by the local Parliamentarian commander, Sir Thomas Myddelton. By Spring 1644 Broughton was serving under Prince Rupert, and appears to have been captured at Rowton Heath in September 1645. The war ended in 1646 with Royalist defeat, but Broughton continued to be known to the government as an active and committed Royalist supporter; he was fined ¬£180 in 1650 and in 1651 was ordered to be investigated further as a \\"bloody delinquent\\". Later in 1651, given a lieutenant-colonel's commission, he joined Charles II's attempt to reclaim the throne in the Third English Civil War and was captured at Worcester. Imprisoned in the Tower of London, his case was considered serious enough for a treason charge as \\"an example of justice\\", but he was eventually released on parole. Exile and Booth's Uprising On his release Broughton joined other Royalist exiles on the Continent. Elements of the exiled Royalist army fought in Spanish service during the Anglo-Spanish War; Broughton may have served in Flanders as part of a force under James, Duke of York. Broughton returned to England prior to 1659, when he took part in Booth's Uprising, an unsuccessful Royalist rebellion that August in Cheshire and North Wales: his former kidnapper Sir Thomas Myddelton also joined the rebels. As one of the more experienced rebel officers he was given command of the infantry at the Battle of Winnington Bridge; the rebels were routed, but along with others from the North Wales contingent Broughton escaped to Myddelton's home at Chirk Castle. Chirk surrendered to Parliamentarian general John Lambert at the end of the month but Lambert specifically excluded Broughton from the articles of surrender, likely due to his previous activities. Gatehouse Prison, Westminster; Broughton went from being a prisoner here in 1659 to holding its lease, on marrying the former keeper's widow Broughton was now in danger; a contemporary wrote it was feared \\"he will lose his life on account of having broken a former parole\\". He was moved from Chester to the Gatehouse Prison in London, but ongoing political instability in England meant that the main participants in Booth's uprising were not brought to trial before the Restoration brought Charles II back to power in 1660. In the interim Broughton instead spent his time courting Mary Wyke, the widow of the prison's keeper; she only agreed to marry him if he swore an \\"imprecation\\" to prove his sincerity. In it, he called down vengeance on himself and his \\"posterity\\" if he did not \\"utterly forebear all rash swearing and all manner of drinking and all manner of debauchery [...] or if ever I am guilty of finding fault with any thing my intended wife shall doe or say\\". The text of Broughton's \\"imprecation\\" later became moderately famous, being printed in Thomas Pennant's Tours in Wales and elsewhere. The local historian A. N. Palmer noted that on reading it \\"one can easily guess what sort of man Edward Broughton was\\". Broughton married Wyke on his release. A son, Edward, was born in 1661; they also had two other sons who died young. Later life and death Ths Royal Katherine; Broughton was fatally wounded while leading a detachment of the Foot Guards serving on board in 1665. Broughton's marriage gave him access to the lucrative revenues of the Wykes' lease on the Gatehouse, and he continued living there during the 1660s. Following the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665, Broughton served in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, being given command of a company drafted to serve as \\"sea-soldiers\\" on board the fleet. Broughton's company embarked on the Royal Katherine on 28 March. At the beginning of June the English fleet, under the Duke of York, attacked the Dutch Republic fleet under Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam in the Battle of Lowestoft. The Royal Katherine was engaged by the Dutch ship Orange, whose crew made several boarding attempts which the Guards successfully repelled; Broughton however was fatally wounded, surviving long enough to die at home on 20 June. He was buried in the north transept of Westminster Abbey. His contemporary David Lloyd wrote that \\"he valiantly lost his life, scorning to fall though in effect killed, and in his stubborn way blundring out Commands when he could not speak them\\". Broughton was knighted in, or before, 1664. He also appears to have been created a baronet but died before the award could be formally completed. The title was nevertheless used in legal documents and assumed by his only surviving son Edward (1651‚Äì1718), who inherited Broughton's estate at Marchwiel and Abenbury.

She was the daughter of Ferdinand van den Eynde, 1st Marquess of Castelnuovo, son of the magnate Jan van den Eynde, and Olimpia Piccolomini, of the House of Piccolomini. Through her marriage to Giuliano Colonna, Giovanna became a member of the House of Colonna, and the first Princess of Sonnino. Through his marriage to her, Giovanna's husband acquired the title of Marquess of Castelnuovo. Family She was born into the Van den Eynde family, a powerful and influential Neapolitan noble family of Flemish origin. Her father was Ferdinand van den Eynde, 1st Marquess of Castelnuovo, the son of Jan van den Eynde, a wealthy merchant from Antwerp who became one of the richest and most prominent men in Naples. The Marquess Ferdinand married Olimpia Piccolomini, of the House of Piccolomini, a nephew of Cardinal Celio Piccolomini, by whom he had three daughters, Catherine, the eldest, Giovanna, the secondborn, and Elizabeth. Her grandfather Jan had acquired the monumental Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano in central Naples in 1653, sumptuously renovating it in the following years. Jan van den Eynde was also the owner of the largest collection of paintings in Naples, which was bequeathed to his son upon his death. In 1674, just few years after his father's death, the Marquess Ferdinand also inherited a sizable collection of 70 or 90 paintings from his longtime friend and business partner Gaspar Roomer. However, Marquess Ferdinand her father died the same year, and his collection, and assets, were split between his then-infant daughters, Giovanna and Elizabeth (his eldest daughter, Catherine, was also meant to have a share, but according to some sources she was later judged incapacitated). Van den Eynde's assets were frozen until each of his daughter reached adulthood and married. Luca Giordano, another longtime friend of Van den Eynde, took care himself of the inventory for Van den Eynde's inheritance. While drawing up the inventory, Giordano counted ten paintings executed by himself in Van den Eynde's collection. Among the paintings inherited by Giovanna, there were six paintings by Giordano. Marriage In February 1688, she married Don Giuliano Colonna, of the House of Colonna, one of the most powerful families in Italy.

Built during World War II, the building has been described as \\"possibly the jewel in the crown of West Coast historic buildings\\". It has a Category I registration with Heritage New Zealand. Background Seddon Memorial Clock Westport was the first town on the West Coast to be settled by Europeans. It became an important centre after the discovery of coal, and Westport was both the administrative center for Westport Borough (from 1873) and Buller County (from 1877). The chief post office was an imposing structure, with a clock tower added in 1913 as a memorial to the former prime minister and West Coast personality Richard Seddon. The tower collapsed in the 1929 Murchison earthquake and the building was demolished soon after. Jack Kilkenny (1888‚Äì1972), mayor of Westport from 1933 until his resignation in 1939, proposed in 1936 that Westport Borough Council build municipal chambers including a clock tower to replace the tower that was lost in the 1929 earthquake. The borough council approved an NZ¬£8,000 loan towards the construction, professional fees, and the purchase of an adjacent section. Construction Archibald Macdonald, a local architect in Westport, was engaged for the design of the municipal chambers. Macdonald chose the Moderne architecture style for his design. The construction contract was tendered in August 1938 but as the tender prices were considered too high, the building was constructed using day labour instead. By December 1938, the previous council offices on the corner of Palmerston and Lyndhurst streets had been demolished and the site cleared for foundation work. The new council chambers were built in reinforced concrete, with interior work in rimu and terrazzo floors. Rising construction costs caused by the outbreak of World War II caused delays and financial problems. The building was complete, apart from the upper part of the clock tower, by April 1940. The finishing touches were done during 1941. The former proprietor of the local cinema, Harry Morgan, donated the clock. The building is coated in Motueka sand, which gives it a distinctive mustard colour. There were plans to add a town hall behind the building and for that reason there was never an official opening party held. The building cost NZ¬£18,423 and the donated clock was worth NZ¬£1,250. The economic depression during the war prevented the town hall plan from going ahead. There was a fundraising attempt during the 1960s, with a \\"hall-o-meter\\" displaying progress, but this did not reach its goal. Heritage registration On 30 August 1990, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (since renamed Heritage New Zealand) as a Category I structure, with registration number 5000. Reasons for this registration were the historical significance of the building (demonstrating the status of the town), the architectural quality (it is described as a \\"striking building with a dramatic appearance\\"), and its townscape / landmark value (it is the most prominent landmark in Westport). Current use Westport Borough was merged into Buller District in the 1989 local government reforms. Buller District Council vacated the Clock Tower Chambers soon after the building had been registered by the Historic Places Trust. Commercial tenants now occupy the building.

He has received an Emmy, GLAAD Media and several film festival awards, and his work has been supported by the Sundance Institute, Ford Foundation, ITVS and Pacific Islanders in Communications.  Life and career  Wilson was born and raised in Oil City, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1986 and served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the West African country of Mali from 1988 to 1990. Prior to filmmaking, he served as Director of the Human Rights program at the Public Welfare Foundation in Washington, D.C. Wilson's 2010 film Out in the Silence focused on the challenges of LGBT people in his small hometown of Oil City, Pennsylvania. It was motivated by the controversy that occurred when the local paper published the announcement of his wedding to partner and fellow filmmaker Dean Hamer. Out in the Silence was supported by the Sundance Institute, premiered at the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, and received an Emmy Award for its PBS broadcast. It also won a Special Jury Prize for Bravery in Storytelling from the Nashville Film Festival and Alternative Spirit Award from the Rhode Island International Film Festival. Subsequently, Wilson led a multi-year national film impact campaign that took the film to small towns and rural communities in every country in Pennsylvania and many locations across the United States. The campaign was highlighted in reports by the Center for Social Media at American University and The Fledgling Fund. Wilson and Hamer's 2014 PBS films Kumu Hina and A Place in the Middle were filmed in Hawaii and focused on Polynesian cultural perspectives on gender diversity and inclusion. Kumu Hina was produced in association with Pacific Islanders in Communications and ITVS, won the Audience Award for its national PBS broadcast on Independent Lens, and received the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary. It premiered as the closing night film at the Hawaii International Film Festival in the Hawaii Theater and won the Jury Award for Documentary at Frameline and a Special Jury award at the Pacific International Film Festival Tahiti. The accompanying educational short film A Place in the Middle premiered at the Berlin International and Toronto International Film Festivals. It was distributed to every school in Hawaii, and was also used in a national educational campaign to ‚Äúmake a place in the middle in every classroom‚Äù in collaboration with PBS Learning Media and Teaching Tolerance. When a transgender student in Hawaii was denied the opportunity to participate in her graduation ceremony, Wilson produced a Youtube video about her case that was used to demand fair and consistent treatment of students across the gender spectrum. This motivated the Hawaii Department of Education to adopt policies and guidelines that protect students against discrimination based on their gender identity and expression, despite the erosion of such principles at the federal level. In 2018, Wilson and Hamer released the feature documentary Leitis in Waiting about transgender life in the Kingdom of Tonga. The film was co-produced by the protagonist of Kumu Hina, Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, premiered at the British Museum in London, broadcast on the PBS series Pacific Heartbeat, and was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award. The accompanying documentary short Lady Eva premiered at the LA Film Festival and AFI Docs. Wilson and Joey Joleen Mataele, the film's protagonist and a leading Tongan human rights advocate, led an impact campaign to galvanize public support for a petition calling for the decriminalization of LGBTI people in the seven Pacific Island nations where such laws are still on the books. In 2020, Wilson, Hamer, and Wong-Kalu continued their collaboration by co-producing and directing the animated short film Kapaemahu. It is based on the hidden history of four stones on Waikiki Beach placed there as a tribute to four legendary mahu who first brought the healing arts from Tahiti to Hawaii. The film is narrated in Olelo Niihau, the only form of the Hawaiian language unbroken by Western contact and colonization.

Bd. 13, H√§xornas Europa 1400-1700: historiska och antropologiska studier, Stockholm: Nerenius & Sant√©rus, 1987 In this aspect, they are similar to the Witch trials in Iceland. They are badly documented, as many would have been conducted by the private estate courts of the landlords, which did not preserve any court protocols. History=Background The area of present day Estonia and Latvia was occupied by the German Teutonic Order in the 13th century. The Teutonic Order Christianized the territory and introduced a new Christian law, the Livonian Law, based on the German Sachsenspiegel from 1225, which included death by burning at the stake for sorcery. It was followed by the Riga Synod in 1428, where all Christian priests were commanded to report anyone practicing or hiring anyone to practice Paganism or sorcery, so that they may be burned. As the documentation of the legal courts from the middle ages is mostly lacking, it is not known if these laws resulted in any executions. The first confirmed witchcraft execution in Livonia took place on the estate Saku outside Reval in 1527, followed by the P√µlula witch trials in 1542, and five women executed in the Juuru witch trials of 1588 It is not until the 17th century, however, that enough documentary material is preserved to allow for a more systematic investigation of Baltic witch trials. A turning point was the publication of the German witchcraft handbook Neun Au√üerlesen und Wolgegr√ºndete Hexen Predigt by the Superintendent of the Livonian church, Herman Samsonius in Riga in 1625, which introduced the Western European Demonology and witchcraft ideology among the local elite, thus providing an ideological foundation for witchcraft persecution in Livonia. A reason for the witchcraft persecutions in the region was the fact that Christianity was weak. Christianity had been forced upon the indigenous population by the German Baltic elite, and Paganism was still widely popular and practiced in secrecy by the peasantry. This was resented by the German language clergy, nobility and merchant class, and witch trials were instrumental in the persecution of Paganism and efforts to ensure religious conformity and safeguard Christianity. In 1637, the Superintendent of the Livonian Church stated that the Consistory should persecute the widespread \\"Paganism, witchcraft and idolatry\\" still practiced by the peasantry and ordered the local vicars to report if the peasants still gathered in holy places in nature to worship Pagan gods and perform sacrifices. In 1667-68, the Church Commission performed an investigation in Southern Estonia and reported that in almost every parish, there were Pagans who gathered in holy Pagan places or houses and celebrated Pagan gods to whom they drank and performed rituals under the supervision of certain men and women who acted as Pagan priests and priestesses. Many peasants were hostile toward Christianity and refused to go to church. This Paganism was a cause of great dislike by the Christian German clergy and the German landlords, who referred to the Pagan priests and priestesses as wizards and witches and used the witch trials to exterminate Paganism and enforce Christianity upon the peasantry. The witch trials :See also Werewolf witch trials The population of Livonia did believe in sorcery as such, but seldom in witchcraft as it was defined in the modern Christian demonology of the time. People were normally accused by their neighbors for having caused harm on them, their animals or their farm by the use of enchanted food or drink. People in general does not appear to have believed in the Devil's Pact and neither the accusers, witnesses or the accused normally mentioned Satan at all until they were interrogated by the authorities, who used torture to adjust the confessions of the accused witches to modern demonology and the Devil's Pact and Sabbath of Satan described in the witchcraft handbooks of the continent. While the belief in Satanic witchcraft was rare among the peasantry, however, the belief in werewolves were strong and accusations was directed toward people accused of having harmed others while in their wolfe-shape: these form of accusations were also transformed in to witch trials by the authorities, who adjusted the confessions of the accused to fit the modern Christian witchcraft ideology. Torture was commonplace in Baltic witch trials, as was the ordeal by water, and the method of execution was to be burned alive at the stake, only in rare cases commuted to being decapitated beforehand. The name of the accused are seldom documented, but the majority appear to have been elderly people of the peasantry, often cunning folk or their relatives. Men appear to have been accused about as often as women and in some regions even more often: of the 206 accused in Estonia were the gender is known, 60 % were men. The Baltic witch trials were normally against only one or at the most four people at the same time, and large trials, such as the Paide witch trials with nine accused in 1615, was rare. A difficulty in the research of Baltic witch trials was the fact the peasantry was under the serfdom of the nobility and any crime committed by a peasant was thereby under the private jurisdiction of the local landlord, who could conduct a private trial on his or her estate. The German Baltic landlords seldom documented and preserved any protocol over the witch trials they conducted on their estates, and the result is the majority of the Baltic witch trials are those conducted in the cities during the 17th-century. Of those witch trials were documentation is preserved, 140 are known in Estonia between 1520 and 1725. Of those witchcraft executions were documentation are preserved, 65 were conducted between 1610 and 1650, of which 29 were women and 26 men. The end Torture was finally banned in Livonia in 1686 and in Estonia in 1699. The perhaps last executions for witchcraft were the three people executed in a witch trial in Dorpat in 1699, the last of whom were Tattra Santi Michel. A witch trial was conducted in Dorpat in 1723, resulting in a death sentence for Wilo Ado of Valguta in Ranno, but the sentence was transformed to a prison sentence. In 1816, the farmer Jakob was whipped and four accomplices, among them \\"Anna wife of Vana-Harm\\" was reprimanded for having claimed to be able to trace thieves by use of sorcery.

The game is a sequel to the studio's prior work, You Have to Win the Game, and is an homage to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. While critically praised, the game received lackluster sales, leading its lead developer Kyle Pittman to call it a \\"total failure\\".  Gameplay and story  Super Win the Game is strictly platform-based, with the player character having no offensive abilities against enemies, unlike The Adventure of Link. Like The Adventure of Link, the player has access to a map screen which contains villages with NPCs, dungeons with obstacles to overcome and abilities inside, and other secrets. In the game, the player character, known as \\"Wayfarer\\", is tasked with collecting pieces of the Hollow King's heart, which has been broken by an evil wizard. In order to get these pieces and confront the wizard the player must collect several upgrades and new abilities, which unlock new areas and sections of levels in a Metroidvania format. Throughout the game, the player character can speak with creatures known as Arcadians, who claim to be from the stars. After returning the king's heart, the world is saved from the Hollow King's rule and peace is restored. An Arcadian asks the player character if they are ready to leave. Accepting his offer restarts the game from its prologue, but with no progress erased.  Reception and sales  Super Win the Game was received positively by critics. Tom Sykes of PC Gamer praised the game's CRT simulation visuals as well as its open-ended gameplay. Angelo D'Argenio of GameCrate considered it \\"a game about secrets\\", comparing it to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Although met with positive reception, Super Win the Game sold only 850 units in its first month after release, which lead developer Kyle Pittman called \\"a complete and total failure\\". Following this, Pittman stated that he no longer wished to continue to make pixel-art platformers in the vein of Super Win the Game.

Titian and his brother Rembrandt Peale were trained by their father in oil painting. When George Washington sat for his portrait, they set up their own easels next to their father's. He died of yellow fever at the age of 18. He became the namesake of his half-brother, Titian Ramsay Peale (1799‚Äì1885), who was also an accomplished naturalist.  Biography = Family  Peale was the fourth son of Charles Willson Peale and Rachel Brewer. He was the brother of Sophonisba Angusciola Peale, and the namesake of Titian Ramsay Peale (1799‚Äì1785), his younger half brother, who was also an accomplished naturalist. Titian and his brother Raphaelle are the subjects of their father's painting \\"The Staircase Group\\".  Ornithology  Titian was an accomplished taxidermist and accompanied his father on several collecting expeditions. During the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic, father and son traveled to Cape Henlopen to collect and preserve birds, from August 21 to September 19, 1793. Titian's specimens were extremely valuable to his father, who used them as currency for trading with foreign naturalists. On June 22, 1796, Charles wrote to Thomas Jefferson: \\"My third Son having the Talents of preserving the various Subjects of the Animal Kingdom, affords me considerable aid‚Äîfrom which I flatter myself that a reciprocal exchange will be made on our part.\\" In a letter to √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire on April 30, 1797, Charles wrote \\"...with a Son that now collects and preserves with me, I promise myself to fill my store Boxes with many valuable subjects ready for exchange.\\" On May 31, 1798, less than four months before his son's death, Charles praised Titian's taxidermy skills in a letter to Pierre Adet: > ...with my son Titian I continue my hunting excursions to collect & preserve > Subjects with equal diligence as you have seen during the last season. > Altho' we cannot this year add so many new subjects yet we have got some > that are non-descripts.

Entomology  Titian was preparing illustrations and a manuscript for a work describing insects of the United States when he died in 1798. A draft of his entomology manuscript (dated 1796) is preserved in the National Agricultural Library.  Death  Charles Willson Peale reflected on his son's death in a letter to Palisot de Beauvois, dated June 16, 1799: > I am so much affected with the loss of that dear youth that I can scarcely > write this for floods of tears.‚ÄìI snatched him then from death, to take him > to New York, and vainly hoped that the affection and attention of a family; > (Mrs. Peale's Uncles) would have keept him from New York, in a high, airy & > healthy situation where he might recover his flesh & strength, but alass! he > would frequently be with me in the City and there caught the fever, his > being so much debilitated by his former complaint, that only 2 days sickness > took him from me.

The Netherlands are famous for having discontinued their witch trails earlier than any other country in Europe. History The Netherlands became an independent country after the Dutch War of Independence in 1579. During the late 16th century, the Netherlands did experience a couple of high-profile witch trials. In June 1593, the High Court (Hoge Raad) repealed a death sentence for witchcraft from Schiedam in the Province of Holland. This became a case of precedence which was henceforth followed as common practice in Holland, thereby de facto abolished the death penalty for witchcraft in the province.Ankarloo, Bengt, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe; Vol. 4: The period of the witch trials, London: Athlone Press, 2002 This case of precedence was followed by the Province of Utrecht from 1596, by Groningen from 1597 and by Gelderland from 1603 onward. The last person executed for witchcraft in the Netherlands has often been referred to as Anna Muggen of Gorinchem in 1608.Marijke Gijswijt-Hofstra; Brian Levack & Roy Porter. Witchcraft and Magic in Europe; Volume 5 The fact that the common practice of repealing death sentences ended witchcraft executions in the Netherlands, however, did not mean that there were no witch trials. Witch trials still occurred in the Netherlands the entire first half of the 17th century, though they were relatively few and did not result in executions. A high-profile case was one in Holland in 1659, when a woman was sentenced to pillorying accused of having sworn her three children to Satan. The lack of witchcraft executions in the Netherlands attracted attention in contemporary Europe. It was also a cause of national pride as well as political propaganda, as the Dutch pointed to the severe Witch trials in the Spanish Netherlands and stated that in contrast to the case of their Catholic neighbor, there was no need of witch trials in the Netherlands as no one had been proven guilty of sorcery and claimed sorcery had been proven to be illusions. The common belief in witchcraft among the public did however persist despite the lack of interest from the authorities to conduct such trials. Witchcraft accusations as part of defamation cases occurred the entire 18th century, and as late as in the 19th century there occurred lynchings of people pointed out as witches. In 1823 a woman, Hendrika Hofhuis famously demanded that the authorities allowed her to be subjected to the ordeal of water to clear her name in her community after she had been accused of being a witch. The authorities agreed in order to solve this defamation dispute, and she passed the test and cleared her name in the eyes of her neighbors. While not a witch trial in reality, as the authorities merely allowed her this to end the harassment from her neighbors, this can nevertheless be regarded as the last witch trial in the Netherlands.

In particular if a Garda suspects someone of committing a public order offence they may ask the person for their name and address and if the person refuses they can be arrested without warrant. Offences=Intoxication in a public place Intoxication in a public place is an offence under section 4 of the act. If a Garda suspects a person of being intoxicated they can confiscate any intoxicating substance from them. The penalty is either a fixed charge of ‚Ç¨100 or a maximum class E fine of ‚Ç¨500 if the Garda√≠ decide to prosecute and there is a conviction. Disorderly conduct in a public place It is an offence to engage in offensive conduct between the hours of 7am and midnight or at any time if a Garda asks you to. Offensive behaviour is unreasonable behaviour likely to cause serious offence or annoyance to other people. This is to deal with disorderly behaviour that falls short of threatening behaviour but which could still adversely affect people's lives. An example is people shouting loudly after leaving a night club, which could annoy local residents. The penalty for this is either a fixed charge fine of ‚Ç¨140 or the maximum class D fine if the Garda√≠ prosecute and there is a conviction. A person must give their name and address when asked for them if they want this offence treated as a fixed charge offence. Someone who doesn't give their name and address can be arrested without warrant and convicted of a summary offence for which the maximum fine is a class C fine. Threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place It is an offence to engage in threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place with the intent of breaching the peace. An example is someone trying to provoke a fight with someone else using insults. If found guilty of such an offence, someone can be given a class D fine and prison sentence of up to three months. Begging in an intimidating or threatening manner It is an offence to beg in an intimidating or threatening manner. Someone found guilty of this offence is liable on summary conviction to a class E fine or up to one month in prison or both. Garda√≠ can direct someone to leave certain areas if they are begging there - e.g. a shop entrance or at an ATM. It is also an offence to organise or direct someone else to beg. A summary conviction can mean a class A fine, up to 12 months in prison or both. Distributing or displaying threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene material in a public place It is an offence to distribute or display threatening, abosive, insulting or obscene material in a public place. A conviction can result in a class D fine, a prison sentence of up to three months or both. Because the interpretation of something being obscene may be subjective, courts will apply the \\"ordinary man\\" test when deciding whether material is obscene or not. Failure to comply with the direction of a member of An Garda S√≠och√°na It is an offence to not comply with a Garda's request to stop behaving in a way that the Garda believes endangers the safety of others, their property or the public peace. Garda√≠ can ask people to \\"move on\\" to avert potential trouble. It is an offence not to comply with these directions without a reasonable excuse or lawful authority to do so. Anyone convicted is liable on summary conviction to a class D fine, a maximum prison term of six months or both. Wilful obstruction It is an offence to prevent a person or their vehicle from passing freely in a public place without legal authority or a reasonable excuse. The penalty is a fine of up to ‚Ç¨400. Garda√≠ do not have a power to arrest for this offence, they can direct people to stop the obstruction. Failure to comply with the direction is an offence. Entering a building with intent to commit an offence It is an offence to enter a building or it's vicinity with the intent to commit an offence or interfere with property. It suffices to be on the property as this offence is defined, but the prosecution must prove intent. Anyone convicted will, on summary conviction, be liable for a class C fine, a maximum prison term of 6 months or both. Trespass It is an offence to tresspass in a way that is likely to cause fear in someone else. This does not include any intent to commit crime or interfere with property. Someone found guilty of this crime is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine, a maximum term of imprisonment of 12 months or both. A Garda can direct anyone they fine tresspassing in such a manner to leave the area in a peaceable and orderly manner. Failure to comply with such a direction without a reasonable excuse or lawful authority is an offence. Anyone found guilty of this offence is liable to a class D fine, a maximum of six months imprisonment or both. Riot Riot is one of the most serious public order offences. It is defined as when: *12 or more people use or threaten to use violence *with common purpose *their conduct would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or for that of someone else *they actually used violence. This offence can be committed in a public or private place. It can be used in situations where people assemble in protest and their behaviour becomes unlawful violence. The penalty is an unlimited fine, a period of imprisonment for up to 10 years or both. Violent disorder Violent disorder is a similar offence to riot, but is of a lesser degree. It is defined as when: *3 or more people are gathered at a place *they use or threaten to use violence *their conduct would cause someone of reasonable firmness who was present to fear for their own safety or that of someone else. Apart from the number of people involved the differences between riot and are that violence must have been used in riot but not in violence disorder and that in riot the group must share a common purpose which violent disorder does not require. The penalty is an unlimited fine, a period of imprisonment for up to 10 years or both. Affray This offence is when two or more people use or threaten to use unlawful violence between each other and their conduct would cause someone of reasonable firmness who was present to fear for their own safety or that of someone else. The violence must be between those involved and not aimed at innocent third parties. It requires unlawful violence, threats alone do not suffice. The penalty is an unlimited fine, a period of imprisonment for up to 5 years or both. Blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces It is an offence for a person to make unwarranted demands with menaces to make personal gains for themselves or someone else or with the intent to cause a loss for someone else. An exception exists if: *the person making the demands believes they have reasonable grounds for making them *they believe the use of menaces is a proper way of enforcing the demand. The courts have held that \\"menaces\\" are to be interpreted broadly. The penalty is an unlimited fine, a period of imprisonment for up to 14 years or both. Assault with intent to cause bodily harm or commit an indictable offence While the main law that deals with assault is the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, section 18 of this act creates another offence of assault with intent to cause bodily harm or to commit an indictable offence. It covers aggravated assaults when there is intent to injure or commit an indictible offence. The penalty is an unlimited fine, a period of imprisonment for up to 5 years or both. Assault or obstruction of a peace officer It is an offence to threaten a peace officer or someone providing medical services at a hospital. Peace officers are: *members of an Garda S√≠och√°na *members of the Fire Brigade *Ambulance personnel *Prison officers *members of the Defence Forces. This covers assaults on: *a peace officer or someone providing medical services at a hospital *anyone assisting a peace officer or someone providing medical services. It is also an offence to assault such people to prevent the lawful arrest or detention of someone for an offence. The penalty is an unlimited fine, a period of imprisonment for up to 7 years or both. Someone could also be guilty of this offence for obstructing: *a peace officer or someone providing medical services at a hospital *anyone assisting a peace officer or someone providing medical services. Someone found guilty of this crime is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine, a maximum term of imprisonment of 6 months or both.

In Lucinda, the eponymous protagonist is raped, becomes pregnant, descends into poverty, and dies shortly after giving birth. Booher classifies Lucinda as a work of sentimental fiction. In particular, following Nina Baym, she describes it as a \\"novel of seduction\\", in which the female protagonist becomes pregnant and comes to a tragic end as a result. Cathy Davidson, following Helen Papashvily, argues that Lucinda marks an end of the seduction plot in American literature‚Äîwith Hester Prynne as one outlier in this regard. Booher likens Lucinda to The Coquette (1797), noting that both works are preoccupied with the protagonist's so-called virtue, or abstinence from premarital sex.

This area has the highest proportion of tree cover in Thailand, with many forests dominated by Teak (Tectona grandis). The river valleys have been under pressure from human use: agriculture, teak plantations, and hunting have reduce plant and animal presence.  Location and description  The valleys in northern Thailand run north‚Äìsouth between a series a mountain ranges; this ecoregion's middle section covers the easternmost of these. The extensions to the west follow a west‚Äìeast bend in the mountains, and the extension in the north follows the west‚Äìeast course of the Mekong River in Laos. The valley floors are at 200‚Äì400 meters above sea level, and the transition to a montane ecosystem occurs around 800‚Äì1,000 meters. the highest point in the ecoregion is . The long, thin ridges of the ecoregion form a transition zone between the Luang Prabang montane rain forests to the south, the Northern Indochina subtropical forests to the north, and the Central Indochina dry forests to the west.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical savanna climate - dry winter (K√∂ppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year, and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, and is drier than the average month. Mean annual precipitation in the region is 1,000-1,200 mm.  Flora and fauna  About 75% of the region is closed forest, a mixture of deciduous broadleaf and evergreen types on the steep slopes. Another 10% is open forest. The forest has been degraded by human pressures, with selective logging taking much of the largest trees. The flat river valleys are mostly under cultivation. A study of a representative area of forest in Mae Yom National Park recorded 27% of the trees as Teak (Tectona grandis), 11% as Mai daeng (Xylia xylocarpa), 10% as Burma padauk (Pterocarpus macrocarpus), and 7% as Millettia (Millettia brandisiana). Bamboo is common in disturbed areas. Large mammals had been mostly eliminated in the wild by the early 1970s, and riverine habitats were disturbed by the construction of the Bhumibol Dam in the 1960s. Still, the ecoregion has one of the highest forest coverage rates in Southeast Asia, and the protected areas may support rare species.  Protected areas  Officially protected areas cover about 20% of the ecoregion, and include: * Mae Yom National Park, a mountainous area of the eastern Phi Pan Nam Range in northern Thailand. * Si Satchanalai National Park, at the far western edge of the ecoregion. * Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, in the middle section of the region in Thailand, on the Wang Thong River. * Wiang Kosai National Park, in the west of the region, home to the Mae Koeng Waterfalls.

The initial training course drew all its directing staff from the New Zealand Special Air Service (NZSAS). The name 'Rangers' was chosen as a reference to Gustavus von Tempsky (1828‚Äì1868) who raised a fighting unit during the New Zealand Wars known as 'von Tempsky's Bush Rangers'. The company was raised in October 1987 and disbanded in late 1989.  History  The Company was raised on 5 October 1987. A Defence White Paper had been published earlier that year that called for greater New Zealand defence self-reliance. At this time the New Zealand Special Air Service was preparing to provide high-level security for the 1990 Commonwealth Games, scheduled to be held in Auckland, New Zealand in 1990. In October 1987 Captain Dave Gawn, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, was posted in as Officer Commanding. In early 1988 selection and training commenced. Known as the 'Basic Ranger Course', the purpose was to 'identify volunteers suitable for service with 1 Ranger Company and to develop those individuals in the basic skills required to allow them to take their place within the unit'. All directing staff were drawn from the NZSAS. The 1st Ranger Company never reached its authorised strength, and was disbanded in late 1989 due to a reduction in the Army's funding. Many years later, in 2013, Gawn was appointed Chief of Army.  Selections  There were three parts: * Part A-Selection, 8 to 20 June 1988 * Part B-Amphibious and Cliff Assault, 4th to 31 July 1988 * Part C- Parachute Training, 1st to 31 August 1988 Throughout the Basic Ranger Course, candidates were assessed by Directing Staff in the skills of weapon handling, field craft, navigation and physical fitness. Candidates were expected to show good judgement, assimilation of tactics, physical endurance, honesty/integrity, maturity, reaction under stress and participation. At the conclusion of parts B&C;, 27 soldiers were selected to serve in 1st NZ Ranger Company. NZSAS had recently adopted the sand coloured 'ecru' beret worn by the British SAS. Soldiers within Ranger Company were 'capped' with the maroon beret, associated with airborne units.

In 2019, he was convicted of defamation of race based on his anti-Romani statements, and became the first Slovak parliamentarian to lose his seat because of a crime. However, he was reelected in the 2020 Slovak parliamentary election. Early life According to a former classmate of his, Mazurek smiled during a visit to Auschwitz concentration camp, and stated that the Jews invented the Holocaust. Political career=First term in parliament Mazurek worked as the deputy to Kotleba MP Andrej Medveck√Ω, and took over his mandate after Medveck√Ω's subsequent resignation (a week after the 2016 Slovak parliamentary election) for having been charged with a racist assault of a Dominican citizen. At this time Mazurek attracted media attention for shouting vulgar insults at an Arab family at an anti-Islam rally and for praising Adolf Hitler on social media. He was investigated by prosecutors for other posts denying the Holocaust, which is a crime in Slovakia. In an October 2016 speech on , Mazurek said \\"The Gypsy anti-socials have never done anything for the nation and never will,\\" comparing children of Romani ethnicity to \\"animals in the zoo\\". Conviction and removal from office In 2018, the Specialised Criminal Court convicted him under Article ¬ß 423 of the Penal Code, which prohibits \\"defamation of the nation, race, and belief\\", and fined him 5,000 euros. Mazurek appealed to the Supreme Court of Slovakia, which ruled on the case in September 2019 and upheld the sentence, increasing the fine to 10,000 euros. He paid the fine, making him eligible to run in the 2020 election. Following the Supreme Court's verdict, former prime minister Robert Fico recorded a Facebook video in which he said, \\"Milan Mazurek said what almost the whole nation thinks and if you execute someone for truth, you make him a national hero\\". Fico is now being investigated for promoting racism. ƒΩSNS put up many billboards stating \\"Milan Mazurek, fired from parliament for expressing an opinion\\". As a result of his conviction, Mazurek lost his seat in parliament in September 2019 due to the Constitution of Slovakia, becoming the first Slovak MP to lose his seat due to a crime. He was eligible for two months' severance pay and was immediately hired as a parliamentary secretary for ƒΩSNS, earning 2,700 euros per month. After he lost his seat in parliament he was replaced by Milan ≈†p√°nik, who is an independent regional politician who won his seat with Kotleba support. Re-election In February 2020, Mazurek was involved in an incident where counter-protestors against a LSNS meeting in Ni≈æn√° na Orave were physically attacked. Mazurek was re-elected in the 2020 Slovak parliamentary election. He was nominated for \\"Homophobe of the Year\\" in 2020 by and Rainbow Slovakia for denying the existence of transgender people.

Her case drew considerable media attention not only due to the heinous nature of the crime, but also due to initial misidentification of the perpetrator, resulting in an overturned conviction and debates about official procedures surrounding interrogations and information shared with suspects. Case and initial investigations Jodi Parrack, a fifth-grade student at the Riverside Elementary School, disappeared on November 8, 2007, while riding her bicycle. She was subsequently found near a headstone at the Constantine Township Cemetery; she had died of asphyxiation, and there was evidence of sexual assault. Suspicion initially fell upon Raymond McCann, a reserve police officer, after McCann had suggested searching the local cemetery. McCann insisted that his suggestion was based on his experience with criminal investigations, knowledge of the town‚Äôs geography and intuition, but some questioned if his suggestion itself indicated involvement. McCann later stated his interrogations were intensive and that authorities had (falsely) claimed that DNA evidence had linked him to the crime scene, a practice which the United States Supreme Court had allowed in its ruling in Frazier v. Cupp. McCann continued to deny any connection to Parrack‚Äôs abduction, and no concrete evidence had linked him to the crime. However, investigators subsequently charged him with five counts of perjury after claims that he had lied about his path during the search for Jodi, and that a surveillance camera near a creamery did not show him walking where he had claimed to be (it was later disputed if the camera had the correct angle to note his presence). McCann pleaded no contest to one of the perjury counts, and was sentenced to a term of 22 months to 22 years in prison. Perpetrator Authorities‚Äô focus changed when, nearly 8 years later, another girl from White Pigeon, Michigan was attacked in an attempted abduction by Daniel K. Furlong, 65, who had attempted to bring her into his garage. Furlong was a local youth sports coach, and he was taken into custody upon discovery of a ‚Äúkidnap list‚Äù in his home, with indications that Furlong had been targeting several girls in the region. The list not only aroused suspicion that Furlong might have been behind the abduction of Jodi Parrack, but also raised questions about a possible connection to the disappearance of another local little girl, Brittney Beers, who had disappeared in 1997. DNA samples from the crime scene where Jodi Parrack had been found were then matched to samples from Furlong. He confessed that he had snatched the girl from her bicycle while riding beside his home, after which he dragged her into his garage where she was tortured and raped in his boat. He bound her with zip-ties and then smothered her with a plastic bag, before bringing her body to the cemetery. Furlong was given a sentence of 30-to-60 years in prison. With the sentencing of the perpetrator, McCann continued to press his case to have his own charges discharged, and he subsequently fully exonerated of the crime with the overturning of his previous perjury conviction. The case has continued to receive discussion due to its circumstances and the tangled investigation, with the initial apprehension and indictment of a suspect who turned out not be the actual culprit, and debates about proper police procedure. These issues, and the case‚Äôs eventual resolution, were discussed in a number of articles and depicted in the episode ‚ÄúSmall Town Killer‚Äù on the true crime series ‚Äò‚ÄôScene of the Crime with Tony Harris‚Äô‚Äô.

He confessed to the first two and was strongly suspected in the third, and possibly linked to the disappearances of many other young girls in the region, before his death in prison by natural causes in 2012. Early life, psychopathic tendencies and criminal history Kondro was born to a Chippewa mother with six other children in Michigan, being handed over for adoption at birth and growing up with his adoptive family in Castle Rock, Washington, attending a Catholic parochial school. As he would later admit to police, he showed disturbing psychopathic tendencies from an early age, including engaging in frequent fights with other children, killing animals (including neighborhood pets), wielding a knife and drinking alcoholic beverages since grade school, as early as age 7. Kondro would subsequently elaborate on these early signs of psychopathy by explaining in detail his lack of empathy and violent desires, comparing himself to an alligator lying in wait, coming up occasionally to feed. He also admitted to molesting young girls while still a child himself, developing fantasies about murder as he grew, and began amassing a lengthy criminal record including auto and petty theft, drunk driving, domestic abuse, drug dealing and forgery. Kondro had several children but in significant part due to drug addiction and his recurring troubles with the law, he was not able to care for them. Disappearances of Chila Silvernails and Rima Traxler Rima Danette Traxler Chila M Silvernails In the early 1980s, authorities were baffled by the unexplained disappearances of several little girls in southwestern Washington State, including Chila Silvernails of Kalama, Washington, who vanished in 1982 on her way to catching a school bus. Her nude body was found the day after her disappearance; she had been raped and strangled. Kondro had dated Silvernails‚Äô mother, but he was not initially suspected in the crime. Then on May 15, 1985, another 8-year-old girl, Rima Traxler, a third-grader at St. Helens Elementary School in Longview, went missing. She had been a well-behaved and academically successful schoolgirl with little in the way of conflicts or behavioral issues, so the community suspected that she had become a kidnap victim rather than a runaway, but there was little trace of exactly when or how she had disappeared. Kondro had been friends with Rima‚Äôs mother and stepfather and apparently drinking beer with him on the day she vanished. He was questioned by police, but not named as a person of interest in the case. Abduction and murder of Kara Rudd, arrest and prosecution Kara Patricia Rudd On November 21, 1996, Kara Rudd, a 12-year-old girl, entered a car after having been dropped off to Monticello Middle School, and vanished. As with the Traxler case, Rudd had been a popular and successful girl with no behavioral issues so she was not suspected as a runaway, and again there was a connection to Joseph Kondro, but this time the suspicions were more concrete. Kondro had been a childhood friend of Kara‚Äôs mother, was known to the victim herself and had frequently stayed in the family‚Äôs garage, before being evicted due to his chronic drinking issues. He was seen with lacerations on his skin that he could not explain shortly after Rudd‚Äôs disappearance, possibly with flecks of nail polish (or nail design or nail art material), suggestive of scratches from a girl‚Äôs long nails acquired in a struggle. Most strikingly, Rudd had told a classmate of her plan to skip school on the day of her disappearance, and she was seen entering a Pontiac Firebird, a vehicle known to be associated with Kondro, who had been the last person to be seen with her prior to Rudd going missing. Authorities still lacked sufficient evidence to make an arrest, but after a fruitless search over 6 weeks for more clues, a detective on the case, Scott McDaniel, decided to look for additional evidence in the Mount Solo area near the Columbia River, which Kondro was known to frequent. There, police found an abandoned Volkswagen vehicle and Rudd‚Äôs body inside; she had been raped and strangled. The car had acted as a sort of refrigerator to preserve critical forensic evidence, and DNA samples from the crime scene were found to match samples from Kondro, who was arrested for the abduction, sexual assault and murder of Kara Rudd. Upon interrogation, Kondro admitted that on the day of Kara Rudd‚Äôs disappearance, he had lured the girl into his car and taken her to a swimming hole in Germany Creek, and then to an abandoned house near the Columbia River, where he raped and strangled her. Then, to avoid the death penalty, Kondro and his attorneys struck a deal with prosecutors, in which he confessed to the abduction, sexual assault and murder of Rima Traxler more than a decade before. Kondro explained that he was already known and liked by the Traxler family, and he was able to trick the girl into entering his vehicle by mentioning the word ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù, which was a safety password taught to her by her parents, and which Kondro had learned from Rima‚Äôs stepfather. He took her to swim at Germany Creek, where he raped, bludgeoned and strangled Traxler, burying her beside a tree. By the terms of the plea deal, he was sentenced to 55 years in prison at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. Because of his violent and psychopathic tendencies and long criminal rap sheet, authorities strongly suspected that Kondro had been involved in the unexplained disappearances of other preteen girls throughout the region, both before the abduction of Rima Traxler in 1985, and between her disappearance and that of Kara Rudd in 1996. Authorities were especially convinced of Kondro‚Äôs role in the kidnapping, rape and murder of Chila Silvernails in 1982, given the striking similarities in modus operandi between her case and those of the other girls, the location of the crime and the fact that Kondro had dated Silvernails‚Äô mother. Kondro himself admitted to having been a child serial killer preying on many little girls in the area, with additional convictions for molestation and further crimes, and detectives planned to question him further about the other unsolved disappearances, but he balked at discussing the other cases due to concerns about a capital punishment imposition, and died in prison of liver disease likely related to Hepatitis C infection. Media and criminal profiling Joseph Kondro‚Äôs cases, his victims and the circumstances surrounding his actions have all drawn considerable attention across print, Internet and broadcast media not only due to the heinous nature and horrors of his crimes, but also the possible factors and implications in the development of psychopathy, and the potential for psychological profilers to identify warning signs and traits of serial killers and violent criminals. Such criminal profiles can be used to identify criminals at high risk of becoming violent offenders, expediting both steps to monitor and alter the violent behavior (including in youth detention centers for juvenile offenders) as well as protect potential victims. Kondro exhibited many of the classical traits of psychopathy from a young age, including a short temper and ease to anger, impulsivity, frequent fighting with other kids, physical roughness, wanton killing of animals and early substance abuse, admitting to drinking before the age of 10. However, he later also showed many of the baffling and seeming contradictory qualities of criminals with antisocial personality disorder, and despite some differences in physical appearance, public persona and the M.O. of his crimes, he had many such traits in common with serial killer Ted Bundy. Like Bundy, despite his personal instability and tendency to crime and violence, Kondro was able to come off as quite charming and personable. This allowed him to win the trust of those around him, which he used in the commission of his crimes, often perpetrated against the young daughters of his friends. He was also aware on some level that his actions were immoral and monstrous, even apparently able to empathize with families‚Äô desires for justice, yet he said he could not stop himself and compared his drive to violent crime as an adrenaline rush. He was profiled by John E. Douglas, from the FBI Behavioral Science Unit (BSU) and one of the founders of criminal profiling, on the MSNBC documentary (and subsequently Netflix series) Mindhunter. Douglas also discussed his profiling of Kondro in-depth in his book (co-authored with Mark Olshaker), The Killer Across the Table. The detective work and investigations into the abductions of Rima Traxler and Kara Rudd, and possibilities of Kondro‚Äôs involvement with other disappearances in the region, were featured in several true crime articles and books, including The Longview Serial Killer by author Lori Carangelo, and a number of television documentaries, including On the Case with Paula Zahn (episode ‚ÄúBroken Trust‚Äù) and Cold Case Files (‚ÄúUnicorns and Alligators‚Äù).

White was also the last private owner of one of the first land grants in the state of Georgia, and she was the founding organizing regent of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Toccoa, Georgia. Life White was born Mary Jarrett, and was married to Virgil A. White. White was able to vote before women's suffrage was officially instituted in the state of Georgia through the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. When the amendment was passed, the state decreed that women could vote in the 1920 election only if they had registered 6 months before the election date, which was a tactic to suppress women's votes, since it would not have been reasonable to expect women to register to vote in an election when they did not yet have the right to vote. For reasons that are not known, Mary Jarrett White was the only woman who did actually register 6 months before the election took place, even though at the time the amendment had not been ratified. This made White the only woman to vote in the 1920 election, and the first woman to vote in the state of Georgia. White was also the last private owner of what is now the Traveler's Rest Historical Site in Toccoa, Georgia. The land was one of the first land grants in the history of Georgia, when it was given by the government to revolutionary war veteran Major Jesse Walton in 1785. White's grandfather, Devereaux Jarrett, bought the site near Toccoa, which came to be known as Jarrett Manor. White sold the home to the state of Georgia in 1955, when it was officially designated a historical site. The Historic American Buildings Survey commissioned drawings of the Traveler's Rest homestead in 1934, and the National Register of Historic Places named Traveler's Rest a National Historic Landmark in 1963. White was a founder and the first organizing regent of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Toccoa, and she also served as secretary of the chapter. Several events have been held commemorating her founding of the chapter. In addition to founding the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, White was an active volunteer with prison reform efforts and the Red Cross. White was an elector for Georgia in the United States Electoral College in 1932.

It was built in 1955, and it shares the space on the southwest corner of the park with Storyland, its sister park, and Fresno Chaffee Zoo. For most of its history, Playland and Storyland competed with the Zoo for guests, but after years of poor turnout, and the rise of prominence of the Chaffee Zoo, in 2015, Playland and Storyland underwent a massive overhaul and repair project, and the owner of Playland and Storyland, the Fresno Rotary Clubs, decided to collaborate with the nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that runs the Chaffee Zoo to offer discounts to encourage guests to visit all three parks. History=Opening and Competition Playland was opened in 1955, six weeks before Disneyland in Anaheim. Local Rotary Clubs, acting upon a proposal by Dr. Joe Logan, then-president of the North Fresno Rotary, teamed up to raise money and build the park. That first day, 14,000 ride tickets were sold, at 10 cents each, and the construction debt was repaid within three years. Playland was much smaller in scope and size than Disneyland, however, and because it offered a cheaper alternative, it was capable of drawing in above 250,000 guests in its debut season. Playland was built on the southwest corner of Roeding Park, bordered to the west by California State Route 99. At the time, Fresno Chaffee Zoo was small but popular, and building an amusement park was seen as a good way to capitalize on the zoo's popularity and contribute to the city's culture and raise funds for public projects. At the time of opening, Playland offered a merry-go-round, small roller coaster, and a miniature diesel train that travelled around Lake Washington, an artificial pond in which guests could swim in. Seven years later, Storyland was built on the other side of Lake Washington, and the diesel train system was connected with a second station, so passengers could travel between the parks freely. Because the park was owned and operated by the various Fresno Rotary Clubs, profits from the amusement park were planted back into the community by the Rotary Playland board of directors. It was Playland money that, in 1964, bought 50 acres of extra land to help form Woodward Park. More cash went toward the Zoo‚Äôs reptile house, a new exhibit for Nosey the elephant (the zoo's first elephant who had previously been held in a concrete and steel cage), land for Logan Park, and the Shinzen Friendship Garden. Playland and Storyland had little room to grow, because they were on the outer edge of Roeding Park. The zoo, however, had plenty of room to grow. This rivalry between Playland and the Zoo grew, forging an intimate business connection between the Rotary Clubs who operated Playland and Storyland. They formed the Playland and Storyland Board in order to better coordinate the two parks' interests. After decades of growth by the Zoo, it soon eclipsed Playland and Storyland in attendance, and the parks became unprofitable. Fresno Rotary kept the parks running as a part of Fresno history to be maintained and operated at a cost. Renovation and Re-Opening After years of decline, Playland and Storyland did not open for its 2015 season. It was announced by Daniel Leith, a Playland and Storyland board member, who stated that they would remain closed until they had gathered enough funds to repair tree-damaged sidewalks and irrigation systems, to improve landscape, attractions and bathrooms, and cover operations costs at a time when attendance was lagging. At the time, officials of the nonprofit that runs Fresno Chaffee Zoo, the Fresno Chaffee Zoo Corp., confirmed that they were in talks to possibly acquire both Playland and Storyland. However, while the Zoo was under renovation and expansion through funds from Measure Z, the corporation would not have been allowed to use any of those funds to assist the neighboring parks. When The Fresno Bee reported on Playland's closure for the 2015 season, and its mounting problems with funding, the news organization was inundated with a flood of local support throughout the year. On July 6, a letter to the editor by Cathy Caples was published that suggested that local residents turning 60 years old donate $60 to the Save Storyland campaign, as it was also Playland's 60th birthday. It was also suggested that the County of Fresno institute a \\"Storyland/Playland tax\\", a sales tax meant to send funds directly to the park itself. An editorial published in the Fresno Bee in 2015 recounted the history of both Playland and Storyland and asked for local donations. In September of 2015, Elaine Robles-McGraw, Storyland's volunteer operational director, announced that Storyland and Playland had received enough funding to reopen for the 2016 season. The Playland and Storyland Board also announced that they would also now be working alongside the Fresno Chaffee Zoo in cross promotions, such as offering discounts and planning special event days around Halloween and Christmas to mirror zoo‚Äôs schedule. COVID-19 Pandemic In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Playland, Storyland, and the Fresno Chaffee Zoo shut down. On June 22, the zoo reopened, but per Governor Gavin Newsom's executive order on July 13, 2020, the zoo is only open for outdoor recreation, and all indoor facilities remain closed. Operations=Closures Playland has had two season closures though its operation: * In 2015, after almost 60 years of operation, the park was closed pending funding for renovations.

Completed and commissioned in 1942, she served in World War II, making one war patrol that included the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, before sinking accidentally in September 1942. Refloated and repaired, she sank again in a diving accident during post-repair sea trials in June 1944. Construction and commissioning I-33 was laid down on 21 February 1940 by Mitsubishi with the name Submarine No. 152. Renamed I-41 on 25 March 1941, she was launched on 1 May 1941. Renamed I-33 on 1 November 1941, she was completed and commissioned on 10 June 1942. Service history Upon commissioning, I-33 was attached to the Kure Naval District and assigned to Submarine Division 15 in Submarine Squadron 1 along with the submarines and . First war patrol The Guadalcanal campaign began on 7 August 1942 with U.S. amphibious landings on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Florida Island, Gavutu, and Tanambogo in the southeastern Solomon Islands. I-33 got underway from Kure on 15 August 1942 bound for a war patrol in the Solomons area, where she took up a position as part of submarine picket line south of San Cristobal. The two-day Battle of the Eastern Solomons began on 24 August 1942, and she was on the surface that day heading for a new position when a United States Navy SBD-3 Dauntless dive bomber from the aircraft carrier attacked her at 11:05 at , but she crash-dived and avoided damage. She sighted a U.S. task force on 30 August 1942 but was unable to get into a position to attack it. She departed her patrol area on 20 September 1942 bound for Truk, which she reached on 25 September 1942. Sinking at Truk On 26 September 1943, I-33 was at Truk tied up alongside the 6th Fleet repair ship Urakami Maru with her stern moored to a wharf on Dublon. Half of her crew was ashore on leave, her commanding officer was aboard Urakami Maru, and her navigation officer was the senior officer on board. Early in the morning, I-33 crew members and three engineers from Urakami Maru began repairs to I-33‚Ä≤s No. 6 torpedo tube, one of the lowermost tubes. At 09:21 the navigation officer allowed the crew to open the drain cock of the aft main ballast tank in attempt to make the repairs easier by reducing the effect of swells in the lagoon on I-33 and by raising her bow. This so badly compromised the partially flooded I-33‚Ä≤s buoyancy that the hawsers securing her stern to the wharf broke, her forward torpedo hatch flooded, and she sank in two minutes with the loss of 33 members of her crew. A rescue operation began immediately. A diver found I-33 on the bottom in of water and reported that some crewmen were still alive aboard the submarine. Lacking the equipment necessary to try to save the crew, the 6th Fleet abandoned rescue attempts on 27 September 1942, and an investigation of the sinking began that day. Salvage and repair On 30 September 1942, the Ministry of the Navy ordered the salvage of I-33, and, without proper equipment available at Truk, the Combined Fleet passed this order to the 4th Fleet on 2 October 1942. Eventually, a salvage attempt began and on 19 December 1942 I-33‚Ä≤s hull was pressurized and her bow came to the surface, but three minutes later the pressure blew a hatch open and she sank again. The submarine rescue ship Mie Maru and tanker Nippo Maru began another salvage attempt on 25 December 1942 and this time succeeded, refloating I-33 on 29 December 1942. Nippo Maru departed Truk with I-33 under tow on 2 March 1943 bound for Japan. During the voyage, the auxiliary gunboats and joined them, and on 9 March 1943 the destroyer also joined the convoy. On 17 March 1943, the ships reached Saeki, Japan, and I-33 arrived at Kure on 18 March 1943 to undergo repairs at Kure Navy Yard. On 1 April 1944, I-33 was assigned to the Kure Guard Unit. Work on her ‚Äî including the installation of radar and a radar detector ‚Äî continued until early May 1944. I-33‚Ä≤s repairs were declared officially complete on 1 June 1944, and she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 in the 6th Fleet that day for work-ups. Loss I-33 got underway from Kure at 07:00 on 13 June 1944 to complete her acceptance trials by making a series of dives in the Iyo- nada in the Seto Inland Sea. When she conducted her second crash-dive of the morning at 08:40, her starboard main induction valve did not close, and all compartments aft of her control room flooded. Her crew managed to blow her main ballast tanks partially, and 10 minutes after submerging her bow broke the surface. Flooding continued, however, and few seconds later she sank, settling on the bottom at a depth of . I-33‚Ä≤s commanding officer and nine other men were trapped in the control room. With water rising in the control room, the commanding officer decided to remain aboard the submarine and drown, but he ordered the men with him to escape via the conning tower. Eight reached the surface, where they drifted apart in two groups that made for shore separately. Most became exhausted and drowned, only two of them reaching shore alive. Thirteen other men were trapped in the forward crew compartment. The lower hatch of the escape trunk jammed, preventing them from escaping. After 12 of the men suffocated, the last surviving sailor committed suicide. In all, 102 men lost their lives. A few hours after I-33 sank, fishermen found the two men from the control room who had made it to shore alive and took them to Mitohama, where they contacted naval authorities. The submarine tender soon arrived, picked up I-33‚Ä≤s two survivors, and headed for the scene of the disaster. On 14 June 1944, search aircraft found a diesel oil slick in the Iyo-nada and guided Ch≈çgei to it. Divers from Ch≈çgei found the wreck of I-33 on 15 June 1944 and brought the bodies of two men found entangled in the bridge enclosure to the surface. The divers also determined the cause of the disaster, finding a piece of wooden scaffolding in diameter which had slipped into the air-induction line during the repairs at Kure and jammed the valve, causing disastrous flooding. A salvage barge equipped with a crane arrived on the scene on 16 June 1944, but an approaching typhoon forced the Japanese to abandon all rescue and salvage efforts that evening. No inquiry into the sinking took place because most of the officers assigned to the investigation were killed in action during fighting in the Mariana Islands in the summer of 1944. The Imperial Japanese Navy struck I-33 from the Navy list on 10 August 1944. Final disposition After I-33 had lain on the bottom of the Seto Inland Sea for nine years, the Hokusei Sempaku salvage firm began work to refloat her in June 1953. Her wreck was refloated between 23 July and 18 August 1953, the salvors discovering that her forward compartments were not flooded. The wreck was scrapped at the Hitachi yard at Innoshima, Japan.

Shalom Y'All; Images of Jewish Life in the American South, Algonquin Books. The congregation first met in Tupelo City Hall. In 1945, the congregation added a holy ark, and was given its first Torah by the Vine Street Temple in Nashville, Tennessee. It later rented space on South Spring Street above the Fooks' Chevrolet dealership. In 1949, a student rabbi from Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, conducted Temple services for the high holidays. In 1953, it moved to space over Biggs Furniture Store. A synagogue building was dedicated on September 1, 1957, with then-Mayor James Ballard giving the remarks. The building was funded by Manny Davis, an Okolona sportswear manufacturing businessman, local banks, manufacturing companies, and other businesses, the local community, Jews from across the nation, and 41 percent by Gentiles. Leadership and congregants Due to its modest size, the Temple does not have a full-time rabbi, and instead uses a lay leader. Maury Stein was a lay leader of the congregation in the 1960s. Marc Perler has served as a lay leader of the synagogue. In 2011, Mississippi State University Bulldog broadcaster Jack Cristil was the lay leader of the congregation. As of 1955 Maurice Stein (who owned a dress shop on Main Street) was president of the synagogue, Len Shane and Linda Levy were later president of the temple, and as of 2020 Leslie Mart was president of Temple B‚ÄôNai Israel. Ron Baker serves as its Director of Religious Education. Gloria Lenhoff, who has Williams Syndrome (which among other things produces an aptitude for music), has served as the cantor of the Temple.

She was one of a group of 18 lawyers known for representing clients critical of the Turkish government, who were arrested in September 2017. Biography Timtik was part of a group of 18 lawyers arrested in September 2017. They were all members of either the Progressive Lawyers Association (, √áHD) or the People‚Äôs Law Bureau (), known for representing clients critical of the Turkish government. These included cases such as the miners who died due to government failings in the Soma mine disaster, Berkin Elvan, Engin √áeber, and Dilek Dogan. In March 2019, they were found guilty of membership or association with the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP-C) and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Timtik was sentenced to 13 years and 6 months in prison and Ayta√ß √únsal to 10 years and 6 months. Milena Buyum, Amnesty International's senior campaign manager on Turkey called the convictions \\"a travesty of justice and demonstrate yet again the inability of courts crippled under political pressure to deliver a fair trial.\\" She called for the lawyers to be unconditionally released and for the convictions to be quashed. In October, Timtik's appeal to the Istanbul Regional Court of Appeal was rejected and at the time of her death, her appeal to the Turkish Supreme Court was pending.  Hunger strike  On January 2, 2020, Timtik initiated a hunger-strike to fight for her right to have a fair trial and √únsal joined her on February 2. On April 5, on Turkish Attorneys day, both declared, that they would go through with their fasting until their death. On June 1, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers submitted a petition signed by 365 foreign and 400 Turkish lawyers to the Supreme Court urging it to acquit the imprisoned lawyers. In the early hours of July 30, Timtik and √únsal were taken from the high-security Silivri Prison to separate hospitals in Istanbul. On August 12, 2020, the European Association of Lawyers for Democracy and World Human Rights sent an open letter addressed to the United Nations, expressing their grave concern about the hunger-striking lawyers. Her cousin who visited her in the hospital said she was pressured into breaking her fast: \\"They are constantly manoeuvring to break her will. They're using every pretext.\\" After 238 days of fasting Timtik died on August 27, 2020, weighing only 30 kg. She became the fourth Turkish prisoner to die on a hunger strike this year, following the deaths of Helin B√∂lek, ƒ∞brahim G√∂k√ßek, and Mustafa Ko√ßak earlier this year.  Aftermath  Deutsche Welle reported the Turkish police impeded the participation at the burial ceremony in the cemetery by her supporters, countering them with armored vehicles, a helicopter and teargas.  Reactions to her death  News of Timtik's death was met with condemnations of the Turkish judiciary: * Turkish politician Nesrin Nas wrote on her Twitter: \\"I am so sorry. She just wanted a fair trial. A state that turns a deaf ear to its citizens‚Äô demand to a fair trial‚Ä¶Where are we running to?\\" * Turkish musician Z√ºlf√º Livaneli wrote on his Twitter that her death was the \\"death of humanity, justice and conscience\\" in Turkey. * Turkish opposition politician Sezgin Tanrƒ±kulu in an interview slammed the decision not to release her: \\"Shame on those who did not give a decision for release. We had begged the Court of Cassation [Supreme Court] to handle this file.\\" * European Democratic Lawyers tweeted: \\"We, from all over the world, tried our best, but as a result of injustice, the dysfunctional judicial system of Turkey, we could not get her from their hands.\\" * Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatoviƒá stated: \\"Ms Timtik‚Äôs death is a tragic illustration of the human suffering caused by a judicial system in Turkey that has turned into a tool to silence lawyers, human rights defenders and journalists, through systematic disregard for the most basic principles of the rule of law.\\" * A statement from the European External Action Service read: \\"The tragic outcome of their fight for a fair trial painfully illustrates the urgent need for the Turkish authorities to credibly address the human rights situation in the country, which has severely deteriorated in recent years, as well as serious shortcomings observed in the judiciary.\\" ReferencesExternal links * A statement by People‚Äôs Law Bureau-International Office regarding the martyrdom of lawyer Ebru Timtik, New Solution Magazine Category:1978 births Category:2020 deaths Category:21st- century Kurdish people Category:21st-century women lawyers Category:People who died on hunger strike Category:Place of birth missing Category:Human rights lawyers Category:Turkish lawyers Category:Turkish Kurdish people Category:Turkish people of Kurdish descent Category:Turkish Kurdish women Category:Kurdish women Category:Turkish communists Category:Turkish Marxists Category:Turkish socialists Category:Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front politicians ","title":"Ebru Timtik"},{"id":"65142170","text":"William Van Buren (June 29, 1935 - March 10, 2007) was an American Negro league pitcher for the Kansas City Monarchs in 1953.

For instance, in the sentence \\"Paulina doesn't drink beer but she does drink wine\\", the proposition that Paulina drinks beer occurs within the scope of negation, but the proposition that Paulina drinks wine does not. Scope can be thought of as the semantic order of operations. The scope of an operator need not directly correspond to the surface position of the expression which encodes it. Sentences can be ambiguous between different ways of construing scope, or there may be a determinate construal which does not match the spoken word order. Scope is a major concern of research in semantics, with an eye towards explaining which scope readings exist for different sentence types and how semantic scope relates to syntactic structure.  Phenomena = Scope ambiguity  The scope of an operator need not correspond directly to the word order of the sentence it occurs in. For instance, some sentences display a scope ambiguity in that the relative scopes of two operators can be construed in multiple ways. # Every hedgehog is friends with a giraffe. This sentence can be understood in two ways. On the inverse scope reading, there is a single giraffe who is very popular in the hedgehog community. On the surface scope reading, the sentence can be true even if the hedgehogs are friends with different giraffes.  Split scope  Split scope is the phenomenon where different components of an expressions item's meaning take scope in different places. Negative quantifiers are one category of expression which have been argued to take split scope. # The company need fire no employees. On the de re (non-split) reading, this sentence means that there is no employee such that the company needs to fire that employee. This is a non-split scope reading since \\"no\\" simply takes scope above the modal \\"need\\". On the split scope reading of this sentence, it means that it is not the case that the company needs to fire any employees. On this reading, \\"no\\" decomposes into a negation scoping above \\"need\\" and an existential quantifier scoping below it. Indefinites have been argued to have split scope, having separate existential scope and distributive scope. This fact can be seen in the following example: # If three relatives of mine die, I will inherit a house. Among this sentence's reading is one which means \\"There exists a set of three relatives such that, if those three relatives die, I will inherit a house.\\" On this reading, the indefinite \\"three relatives of mine\\" takes existential scope outside the conditional‚Äì‚Äì it asserts unconditionally that those three relatives do in fact exist. However, it the indefinite takes distributive scope inside the conditional‚Äì‚Äì the speaker will inherit a house if three relatives die, not if x dies where x can be any of those three relatives. Definite descriptions have also been argued to have split scope. Definites are classically considered to presuppose that their referents are unique. For instance, the definite description \\"the cat\\" is infelicitous in a context where there are multiple cats which the speaker could have in mind. However, this generalization seems to be contradicted by Haddock descriptions such as the following: # Context: In front of the speaker are numerous hats, one of which contains a rabbit. Haddock description: The rabbit in the hat This noun phrase is felicitous to use in this context, even though there is no unique hat. What seems to license this surprising use of the definite description is the fact that the context contains a unique rabbit-containing hat. To cash out this idea, it has been proposed that the uniqueness presupposition of \\"the hat\\" takes scope separately from the rest of the definite's meaning. In other words, a witness set is establishes low in the structure, but is checked for singletonness higher up.  Scope islands  While operators can often take scope above their surface position, there are not entirely free to take scope wherever they want. For instance, as illustrated by Sentence 1 below, quantifiers that originate inside an if-clause usually cannot take scope outside of that \\"if\\"-clause. This sentence cannot mean that Beth will inherit one house for each dead relative. # If every relative of mine dies, I will inherit a house. This fact parallels the fact that a wh-phrase cannot be extracted from an \\"if\\"-clause, as shown in Sentence 2. # Which relativei will you inherit a fortune if ti dies? Examples of this sort have been used to argue that scope relations are determined by syntactic movement operations. Aside from their theoretical significance, scope islands are also practically useful since they can be used to construct unambiguous paraphrases of sentences with scope ambiguities.  Exceptional scope  While most operators are unable to scope out of an island, others can. For instance, the indefinite \\"a\\" in the sentence below can take scope outside of its surface position inside an \\"if\\"-clause. This sentence can mean that there is a particular relative who must die for the speaker to get a house. # If a relative of mine dies, I will inherit a house. Examples of this sort have been used to argue that indefinites do not have standard generalized quantifier denotations. On the choice function approach proposed by Tanya Reinhart, indefinites contribute a variable over choice functions which can be existentially closed at any point higher in the structure. Angelika Kratzer proposed another choice function- based theory, which is similar to Reinhart's except that the choice function variable is left free. Recent work such as Charlow (2020) treats indefinites as denoting sets of individuals which can be type shifted so that they take scope in a manner similar to Karttunen's (1977) alternative-based mechanism for wh-questions.  Formal approaches to scope  Tanya Reinhart pioneered the structural approach to scope. The structural view of scope is one influential view which posits a close relationship between syntax and semantics. This approach is characterized by the following hypothesis, first formulated by Tanya Reinhart: :Hypothesis about scope and domain: The semantic scope of an operator corresponds to the position of the item which expresses it at some level of syntactic representation. This view is widely adopted in generative approaches such as that of Heim and Kratzer (1998). In these approaches, the relevant syntactic level is logical form and the syntactic notion which corresponds to semantic scope is typically identified as c-command. In structural approaches, discrepancies between an expression's surface position and its semantic scope are explained by syntactic movement operations such as quantifier raising. The movement approach is motivated in large part by the fact that quantifier scope seems to obey many of the same restrictions that movement does, e.g. islands. A prominent alternative to the structural view is the type shifting view first proposed by Barbara Partee and Mats Rooth. This approach uses type shifters to govern scopal relations. Since type shifters are applied during the process of semantic interpretation, this approach allows scopal relations to be partly independent of syntactic structure. The type shifting approach serves as the basis of many recent proposals for exceptional scope, split scope, and other troublesome scope- related phenomena.

In 1966, he was appointed the inaugural professor of microbiology at Massey University, where he remained until his retirement in 1989. Biography Born in Gisborne on 6 April 1926, Bacon was the son of Mabel Tui Bacon (n√©e Allott) and Frederick George Bacon. He was educated at Gisborne High School, and in 1944 began training as a medical laboratory technician at Cook Hospital. In 1947, Bacon began studying at the University of Otago, graduating Bachelor of Science in 1950, and Master of Science with first-class honours in 1954. From 1951, he worked as an assistant lecturer in the Department of Microbiology at Otago, assisting Molly Marples in the teaching of the second-year course and the introduction of the third-year course in microbiology. During the summer recesses between 1951 and 1955, Bacon joined health research teams funded by the Medical Research Council in Niue and Samoa. Assisted by a Fulbright Scholarship, Bacon undertook doctoral studies at Yale University in the United States, completing his PhD in 1958. His doctoral thesis was titled Studies of mutational processes in bacteria, and was particularly concerned with mutations in Escherichia coli. While at Yale, Bacon met his future wife, Flo Thanassi, a research assistant at the university; they became engaged in 1957 and later married. Bacon returned to teaching and research at Otago, until being appointed the first professor of microbiology, and head of the Department of Microbiology and Genetics, at Massey University in Palmerston North in 1966. He continued his research into the genetics of E. coli and associated bacteriophages until retiring in 1989. On his retirement, he was conferred the title of professor emeritus.

The chateau was the home of Voltaire and his lover √âmilie du Ch√¢telet from 1734 to 1749. Today the chateau is owned by the count of Salignac-F√©nelon. Various parts of the building and its interiors have been protected as a monument historique since 21 September 1981. History In the 17th century the seigneurie of Cirey was held by a member of an influential family from Lorraine, Louis-Jules du Ch√¢telet. He held an official post at the French court and was governor of Aigues-Mortes. However he sided with Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans in his intrigues against Louis XIII, fell from favour and was condemned to death by quartering. All his property was confiscated and he fled to escape execution. His wife Christine de Gleiseneuve succeeded in regaining the seigneurie, but could not prevent the 11th century castle from being slighted in 1633. When Louis XIII and his brothers were reconciled in 1634, Louis-Jules was amnestied and returned to his estates. In 1642 he began building a new house in the baroque style in the foundations of the old castle. Before his death in 1671, only one tower and an extension were built, of the planned structure with four towers and three wings. Chateau de Cirey in a lithograph c. 1830 The castle became famous in the second half of the 18th century when it was the home of the Marquis Florent-Claude du Ch√¢telet, Count of Lemout, Seigneur von Cirey. He was a lieutenant general in the army of Louis XV and had married the 18 year- old √âmilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil in 1724. The couple had three children before √âmilie met Voltaire in Paris in 1733 and began a relationship with him. With the consent of the Marquis, Voltaire moved to Cirey. When Voltaire arrived in 1734 he found a somewhat run-down building in the style of Louis XIII in red brick and pale stone. He set renovations in hand, and between 1734 and 1735 he had a new wing built, in which the couple installed their laboratory and a library of 21,000 books. In the following years, until the early death of Madame du Ch√¢telet in 1749, Cirey was a meeting point for literati and intellectuals from every part of France. From √âmilie‚Äôs son Louis Marie Florent du Ch√¢telet, later duke of Ch√¢telet, the chateau passed to his niece, later Madame de Simiane, Diane-Ad√©la√Øde de Damas, who received La Fayette there many times. Her heirs in the Damas d'Antigny family sold the property to a merchant, who sold it on in 1890 to a pen owner named Armand- Viellard, ancestor of the present owner. Description Part of the rich decoration in the gallery wing Teil The chateau stands on the bank of the river Blaise and consists of the main building and a large southwestern outer bailey. Together with several other buildings, these structures all lie within an English landscape garden. The main chateau building consists of a large pavilion tower with a square floor plan and a tented roof. Connected to this on the south side is an extension, built in the 17th century at the same time as the tower. The L-shaped gallery wing, which adjoins the pavilion on its west side, dates from the 18th century. It has an elaborately designed portal that was built according to Voltaire's designs, with reliefs indicating his interest in the sciences, philosophy and the arts. One of the oldest private theaters in France is located on the top floor, set up by Voltaire in 1735 to rehearse the plays he wrote during those years. A short northern extension to the pavilion dates back to the 19th century, as does the castle chapel, whose wall paintings date from 1851 and were executed by Constant M√©nissier. Inside, much of the valuable furnishings from the 17th and 18th centuries has been preserved, for example the dado and panelling in the billiard room and an oven in the dining room. Almost all of the castle's outbuildings date from the second half of the 19th century and are located around a rectangular inner courtyard, through whose driveway in the southwest corner the castle grounds can be entered. Access to the main castle is via a pavilion-like gatehouse with a round arched archway on the east side of the service yard. However, the building is not part of the original baroque development, but was only erected in 1915. The various buildings we‚Äôre formerly used as a stable and chicken coop, granary, dovecote, barn, shepherd's house and cattle shed. An icehouse has also been preserved. The chateau complex includes a large landscaped garden, dating back to the mid-15th century. Since 26 December 2001 it has been separately protected as a monument historique. The castle park has an approximately 566 meter long canal that is fed by the river Blaise. A metal bridge from 1880 leads over it. In addition to an orangery building, there is also a chalet in the park in a typical 19th century style.

To the north is a rainforest belt with less inundated land. The region is extremely fertile due to the river-borne silt (the Irawaddy Delta is the fifth most heavily silted river in the world), but nearly-total conversion to agriculture has degraded the ecology. There are no fully protected areas in this ecoregion.  Location and description  The ecoregion is flat, measuring about 170 km west-to-east and about 125 km north-to-south. It is bounded on the south by the Myanmar Coast mangroves ecoregion where the saltwater influence of the sea becomes dominant. The belt of mangroves sets the freshwater swamp forest about 70 km back from the Bay of Bengal. The ecoregion transitions to the north into the Myanmar coastal rain forests ecoregion. In the northwest is a small area of high ground at the southern end of the Arakan Mountains. The eastern corner of the region wraps around the capital city of Yangon, which itself is in the mangrove zone.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical savanna climate - dry winter (K√∂ppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year, and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, and is drier than the average month.  Flora and fauna  Over 80% of the ecoregion is cultivated cropland or permanent water. The small stands of forest are about equally divided between closed and open forest, but these stands are highly fragmented. The common trees are Teak (Tectona grandis), Mai maeng (a variety of Xylia xylocarpa often used in reforestation), Cotton-tree (Bombax ceiba), Ka-jaw (Millettia pendula), (Dalbergia), Wild mango (Spondias pinnata), Bahera (Terminalia balerica), and a variety of other trees. Bamboo (Melocanna bambusoides) is also common. The region is an important wetland for migratory birds. Notable populations include the relatively common Mongolian plover (Charadrius mongolus), the critically endangered Spoon-billed sandpiper (Eurynorhynchus pygmeus), the near-threatened Black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), and the common Asin openbill stork (Anastomus oscitans). The size of visiting populations has been shrinking in recent years.  Protected areas  There are no officially protected areas in this ecoregion.

After Swedish police prevented Rasmus Paludan, a Danish extremist politician, from entering the country, far-right anti-immigration activists held protests and burned the Quran. In response, a mob of 300 people gathered in counter- protest, burned tires, threw rocks and chunks of concrete at the police, and smashed bus shelters, and witnesses heard shouts of \\"Allah U Akbar\\" and \\"La ilaha ilallah\\". A prominent Malm√∂ imam responded \\"Those who are acting in this way have nothing to do with Islam\\". Incidents in Malm√∂ On 26 August 2020, police in Malm√∂ denied Rasmus Paludan, a Danish far-right politician and the leader of Denmark's extremist Hard Line party, permission to hold a meeting named \\"Islamization in the Nordic countries\\". On 28 August, he was deported and banned from entering Sweden. Swedish police suspected he would break the law. His supporters nonetheless went ahead with the event, and burned a copy of the Qur'an in Rosengard, a predominantly immigrant neighborhood. In a separate event, Paludan's supporters kicked a copy of the Qur'an around Malm√∂'s main square like a football, for which three people were arrested on suspicion of inciting hatred. At around 7 PM, about 300 people gathered in Malm√∂'s Amiralsgatan street, south of the Roseng√•rd Centrum Shopping Centre for a demonstration against the Qur'an burning, which soon turned violent. Rioters threw chunks of concrete and stones at the police, smashed bus shelters, overturned lampposts, and burned objects. Antisemitic chants were also raised in the gatherings. The riots continued till about 3 in the morning. The police in Malm√∂ received reinforcements from Gothenburg and police began using drones for aerial surveillance of the Roseng√•rd district. The unrest continued the following day, there were multiple incidents with arson in the Roseng√•rd, Bellevueg√•rden, R√•dmansv√•ngen and Solbacken city districts. The Gullviskolan school was severely damaged by suspected arson. Three people were arrested with bottles containing flammable liquid suspected for preparing attacks on police or rescue services. The riots gradually came to an end by 31 August after residents, police and religious leaders took to the streets to promote calm. The rioters caused damage worth about a million crowns (about 100 thousand euro). Most of the costs were due to replacing and repairing street lights, traffic lights, bus shelters and cleaning up the area. This sum does not include costs for police actions.  Incidents in Ronneby  The riots spread to Ronneby the following day when about 20 persons were involved in public violence in Ronneby, where they set fire to tires, threw rocks at police, resuce services and buildings. A policeman was wounded when he was struck by a rock. Three people were arrested and six were detained, suspected of violent rioting. According to an eyewitness, the rioters attempted to set fire to a church in Ronneby but a bystander put out the fire with his jacket, whereupon the rioters attacked him and he was wounded.  Aftermath  About 15 people were arrested, and several police officers were injured. On 31 August, the police started investigating reports of antisemitic hate speech from the rioters.

Bhd. (POEM) (lit. Electric Automobile Company (Malaysia)) is the name of a defunct Malaysian company that produced small electric vehicles in the late 1990s and early 2000s. POEM was established in 1996 as a joint venture between Tenaga Nasional and Frazer-Nash Research. The first POEM vehicle, the Eleksuria was touted as Malaysia's first electric vehicle upon its launch in December 1997. POEM electric vehicles were most notably used as personnel transporters during the 1998 Commonwealth Games and 2000 Summer Olympics. POEM had aspired to mass produce small electric vehicles for primarily business customers in domestic and export markets. Although prospects were reportedly positive, the joint venture quickly broke down and POEM quietly faded into obscurity by the mid-2000s.  History  Perusahaan Otomobil Elektrik (Malaysia) was one of several 'national car' companies set up in the 1990s under the purview of Mahathir Mohamad. The first of the national car companies, Proton was set up in 1983 as the result of the National Car Project, fast-tracked by Mahathir upon his ascension to the post of Prime Minister in 1981. Despite initial struggles and complications, Proton managed to firmly establish itself as a major player in the local market, and its success paved the way for a wave of new Mahathir-endorsed national car companies in the 1990s. Perodua commenced production of small economy vehicles in 1994, followed by USPD which produced non-mainstream Proton models in 1996, Modenas (1996) which produced motorcycles, Hicom (1997) and Inokom (1998) which produced trucks and vans, Bufori (1998) and TD Cars (1998) which produced retro classics, and POEM (1997) which produced small electric vehicles. Perusahaan Otomobil Elektrik (Malaysia) was incorporated in November 1996 as a joint-venture primarily between Malaysian state-owned electricity provider Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) (40%) and UK-based Frazer-Nash Research (FNR) (30%). The remaining 30% equity was divided between Musteq Industries, FIMA chairman Basir Ismail, and Composite Automotive Research (CAR), a company founded by former Proton general manager Nadzmi Salleh. It was reported that FNR approached TNB with the concept of electric vehicle production in 1996. Frazer-Nash Research is a subsidiary of Kamkorp, a company chaired by India- born, UK-based businessman Kamal Siddiqi. The close relationship between Mahathir Mohamad and Kamal Siddiqi was instrumental in the establishment of POEM. Under the original joint venture agreement, FNR had offered their electric vehicle technology, while TNB agreed to produce the end product using body components supplied by CAR and Musteq. The chairman of POEM, Ahmad Tajuddin Ali hoped that the joint venture would enable technology transfer for electric vehicle development in Malaysia while also reducing environmental pollution, whereas Mahathir opined that electric vehicles would offer more choices in the market. On 1 December 1997, the first product from the joint venture, the Eleksuria was launched in Bangi and subsequently exhibited at the 1997 Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (LIMA '97). POEM produced more electric vehicles for use as personnel transporters at various public events such as the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur and the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. By late 1999, POEM had shifted production to a larger facility in the Hicom Glenmarie complex which could produce 6,000 units annually. TNB also raised its equity stake in POEM from 40% to 92%, with the remaining 8% held by FNR. By late 2000, it was reported that POEM had sold over 3,000 electric vehicles to various business customers in both domestic and export markets. Proton Saga EV pictured) Tenaga Nasional made an electric-powered Kancil prototype in 1999. (regular Perodua Kancil pictured) However, the joint venture began to break down in 1999, and TNB subsequently relinquished its majority stake to FNR. By early 2000, POEM had been restructured as a 80:20 joint venture between FNR and TNB. The reasoning behind the breakdown is unclear, but it was reported that FNR was losing millions of pounds and was indebted to many of its business partners. Malaysia was also gripped by its worst-ever economic crisis in 1997/1998. Additionally, POEM's American battery supplier Electrosource also went bankrupt in November 2001. Nonetheless, TNB gradually acquired the technical know-how for electric vehicle development, and in October 1999, the company unveiled that it had developed a prototype of an electric-powered Perodua Kancil, which it claimed was ready for commercial production. TNB had previously developed an electric-powered van prototype as early as October 1996. Despite its early gains in electric vehicle technology, Tenaga Nasional did not pursue any subsequent large scale endeavours into the automotive industry. However, the relationship betweeen Mahathir Mohamad and Kamal Siddiqi held on and Frazer-Nash Research would go on to work with Proton in the late 2000s, leading up to several hybrid-electric prototypes of the Saga, Persona and Exora which participated in the 2011 RAC Future Car Challenge. The electric-powered Protons were hailed and touted for mass production, but like the FNR-TNB joint venture, the FNR-Proton project ultimately stalled, and Proton would go on to partner with Korea-based LG Electronics for its electric vehicle development. By the mid-2000s, Perusahaan Otomobil Elektrik (Malaysia) had effectively stalled and the company became a dormant entity. TNB later took FNR to court over failed debt repayments, and the ensuing legal tussle dragged on as late as 2018. In September 2015, FNR chairman Kamal Siddiqi became implicated in the 'Justogate' scandal. By the late 2010s, Frazer-Nash Research had incurred significant debt, and the British court ordered it to wind up along with its parent company Kamkorp.  POEM Eleksuria  The first product from Perusahaan Otomobil Elektrik (Malaysia), the Eleksuria was launched on 1 December 1997. The Eleksuria is a licensed produced version of the 'Solar Baby' developed by Frazer-Nash Research. The Solar Baby / Eleksuria is a fully-electric buggy-type vehicle which could seat four occupants. POEM commenced limited production of the Eleksuria in November 1997 at a temporary facility within Tenaga Nasional's UNITEN campus with a small workforce of 30 to 40 personnel. The conventional lead-acid batteries which powered the Eleksuria gave it a claimed range of 120 km between charges, and could be fully charged within an hour. The Eleksuria was reportedly produced with more than 50% local content, while the batteries for later models were known to be sourced from Texas-based Electrosource Inc.. It was reportedly priced around RM 40,000 in February 1998, and was sold to primarily business customers. The Eleksuria was never intended to compete against conventional vehicles such as the Perodua Kancil or Modenas motorcycles. The initial batch of Eleksuria produced were not road legal, and was only permitted for use on private property grounds such as at airports and resorts. However, by July 1998, the Eleksuria had received JPJ road legal certification for use on all Malaysian roads except highways. POEM also unveiled an updated version of the Eleksuria in July 1998, featuring a more car-like design with doors and headlights which were more spaced apart. Apart from the Eleksuria, POEM had also produced other variants and configurations to suit different applications and buyers. Where the Eleksuria was primarily designed as a people-mover, a 'Golf Buggy' variant was produced for golf resort use, a 'Harrods Buggy' version was designed for British department chain Harrods, and an 'Airport Buggy' model was made for use at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). Some of the variants produced also had roof-mounted solar panels. POEM also had plans to produce electric motorcycles. By late 2000, POEM had reportedly sold over 3,000 electric vehicles to business customers in both domestic and export markets. Around 500 units were reportedly sold to Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Al- Fayed for use at his luxury department chain Harrods. At least 300 POEM vehicles were reportedly supplied to the organisers of the 1998 Commonwealth Games. POEM electric vehicles were also supplied to TNB power plants throughout Malaysia. POEM supplied at least 324 electric vehicles to Frazer- Nash Australia for sale to the organisers of the 2000 Summer Olympics, half of which were reportedly Solar Baby / Eleksuria models. The POEM units exported to Australia were marketed as Frazer-Nash vehicles instead. After the Olympics concluded, the organisers sold the various electric vehicles to private buyers and local establishments. However, a report by the Sydney Morning Herald later detailed how many of the vehicles had broken down by 2002, and that Frazer- Nash Australia couldn't service or repair them, as Frazer-Nash UK had by then cut-off financial support to their Australian branch. One such Eleksuria unit from the 2000 Summer Olympics is currently preserved at the National Transport Museum in Inverell, NSW.

Her story is portrayed by the Oscar-nominated documentary The Cave, which tells of the struggles of running an underground hospital during the Syrian civil war. Early life Ballour was born and grew up in the east of Ghouta. She is the youngest among two brothers and three sisters. Her sisters married and became homemakers at a young age; the eldest was 15. Ballour, on the other hand, wanted to do more. She persisted on completing her education. Education Ballour had always wanted to be an Engineer, so she took up Mechanical Engineering at Damascus University despite experiencing gossip from others and receiving opposition from her family due to gender-based expectations. Her family, particularly her father, refused to support her until she eventually shifted to pediatrics. In 2012, she finished her general medical studies at the same university. She began studying pediatrics until she immediately abandoned it to help the casualties of Syrian Civil War. Saving Lives Amid The War At 24, Ballour was triggered to abandon her studies when she was summoned by neighbors to treat a 12-year-old wounded boy. The boy was a victim of the government‚Äôs attempt to crush rallies. He was a bystander during the protest and was shot with a bullet in his head. The boy's family was worried that the authorities would seize them if they went to the hospital, so they came to Ballour instead. When they arrived, the boy was already dead. Ballour started as a volunteer in a nearby, rebel stronghold hospital in Ghouta. There were only a few doctors, and there were only two full-time physicians like her. The hospital was intended to be a big, six-story medical center, and it was under construction during that time. The hospital operated despite frequent attacks from the government, until authorities successfully seized the area. With thirteen other doctors, Ballour decided to continue operating underground, beneath the unfinished building. The subterranean clinic was eventually known as the Cave; as its popularity grew, more medical volunteers appeared. The hospital thrived despite the siege. At times, they were able to use smuggled medical stocks paid by international and local NGOs, and equipments taken from other destroyed hospitals. Ballour is no trauma surgeon, but with the influx of casualties amid the Syrian Civil War, doctors in The Cave have to treat the wounded even though their affliction was not their specialty. Ballour recalled treating victims with missing limbs, and victims of chemical attacks who were suffocating in the subterranean hospital. The government bombed the hospital many times. She kept detailed journals about the days and the attacks. In 2016, at 29 years old, Ballour was elected and promoted as the hospital director. She became the first and only woman to manage a hospital in Syria. She ran the hospital until the Assad regime quelled the last resistance in 2018. Since then, Ballour have been exiled. She was forced to flee Syria and spent some time living in a refugee camp in Turkey.

It was designed in response to the French √âp√©e-Ba√Øonnette Mod√®le 1886.  Description  The Seitengewehr 98 is a bayonet that accompanies the Gewehr 98, a German bolt action rifle made by Mauser. It was superseded by the short- lived Seitengewehr 98/02, with a shorter and sturdier 44cm blade. Seitengewehr 98/05 followed shortly, with a still-substantial 37cm blade. All Mauser bayonets attached via a T-shaped bar fitted under the barrel. Although many bayonets of the time used a muzzle ring, Mauser avoided one since these altered the vibration harmonics of the barrel when fired, affecting accuracy. All the bayonets featured quillons that curved back towards the hilt. These were much less effective at catching the opposing blade than the forward-swept quillons used by some other nations. The first model had a grip made of one single piece of wood, which was wrapped around the tang. This was called a.A. which means in German ‚Äúalter Art‚Äù (old type). At the turn of the century the Germans simplified and strengthened their bayonet grips. The new type is called n.A. (neu Art) and the grip was made of two halves from wood. The two- piece grips were introduced in 1902.

He is the son of MƒÅori musician, guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter Billy TK. During the 2020 New Zealand general election, TK Jr. attracted media coverage both as the leader of the fringe New Zealand Public Party (NZPP) and for his belief in conspiracies. Both Te Kahika Jr and the NZPP have opposed the New Zealand Government's lockdown restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Early life and musical career Te Kahika Jr. is the son of MƒÅori musician Billy TK, who played with the New Zealand rock band \\"The Human Instinct.\\" His mother is PƒÅkehƒÅ. He grew up in MƒÅngere, Auckland. Te Kahika followed in his father's footsteps and became a guitarist, inheriting the title of the \\"MƒÅori Hendrix.\\" Since 1993, he has toured internationally, performing with various artists such as George Thorogood, Jimmy Barnes, The Neville Brothers, Ian Moss, Junior Wells, Little Willy Foster, and Joe Satriani. He has also performed at several gigs including the Sydney Blues & Roots Festival and Fiji International Jazz and Blues Festival. He also led a band called \\"The Groove Shakers.\\" Te Kahika joined the Army as he wanted to be an SAS soldier but ended up serving as a Private in the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment between September 2001 and January 2003. During that time he attended military intelligence courses. He was then a police recruit between May and July 2003. In January 2013, Te Kahika's band \\"The Groove Shakers\\" toured Picton alongside the American MoFo Party Band and the English Kingsnake Blues Band. In July 2016, Te Kahika announced plans to host the World Indigenous Festival in the Northland Region, establishing a company called the World Indigenous Festival New Zealand with himself serving as its CEO. This venture received the support of former New Zealand Prime Minister and the United Nations Development Programme's Head Helen Clark. Several taxpayer-funded bodies including Te Puni K≈çkiri invested NZ$40,000 in the World Indigenous Festival while Sport New Zealand invested NZ$20,000. Ultimately, the World Indigenous Festival, which was scheduled to take place in 2019 did not go ahead. Sport NZ and the Auckland Council's economic growth agency ATEED later stated that they did not give Te Kahika permission to use their corporate logos in material pitching their support. In the summer of 2018/19, Te Kahika and Irish vocalist Ronan Kavanagh toured Northland as part of the AA Solar Summer Music Series. In November 2018, Te Kahika and his father played at the Old Parakao Store Cafe/Bar in Pakotai. In October 2019, Te Kahika Jr. held a Road to Chicago tour across New Zealand as a warm up to his tour of the United States in early 2020. Between January and mid-February 2020, he toured the United States, performing with blues guitarist and singer Buddy Guy in Chicago on 13 January. In October 2020 an investigation by Stuff Circuit found that Te Kahika had repeatedly not paid musicians for gigs or expenses, and had misrepresented the New Zealand Government as backing a business proposal to install solar power in hotels in Samoa. Political career During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, Te Kahika founded the New Zealand Public Party, which was launched on 11 June 2020. The NZ Public Party has campaigned against the Government's COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 and opposes the United Nations, 5G technology, 1080 poison, fluoridation and electromagnets. Te Kahika has spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, alleging that the pandemic would enable globalist leaders to implement UN agendas that would subjugate people, and that billionaires had developed weaponised viruses and patented treatments for these viruses to enslave humanity. According to media reports, Te Kahika had researched fringe ideas circulating on social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube. His social media posts and live broadcasts were initially circulated for his Facebook friends, but gained a wider following and reached 30,000 views in May 2020. The popular reception to these broadcasts inspired him to found the NZ Public Party. Since the NZ Public Party had missed the deadline to register with the Electoral Commission, Te Kahika attempted to merge his party with Hannah Tamaki's Vision NZ and the New Zealand Outdoors Party but was unsuccessful. On 26 July 2020, the NZ Public Party announced an electoral alliance with independent Member of Parliament Jami-Lee Ross' Advance New Zealand party. Under this coalition arrangement, Te Kahika and Ross became co-leaders of the merged party. Te Kahika would also contest the MƒÅori electorate of Te Tai Tokerau and take the first list ranking on Advance NZ's list. In early August 2020, Te Kahika urged his party's supporters not to abuse the Outdoors Party's leadership after the Outdoors Party had rejected an offer to merge with the Public Party in April. However, he also alleged that the Outdoors Party's supporters had been abusive towards the Public Party. Following a second outbreak of COVID-19 community transmission in Auckland, Te Kahika participated in an anti-lockdown protest in Aotea Square that had been organised by Facts NZ and the Kotahitanga Movement Aotearoa. On 16 August, his Public Party was recognised by the Electoral Commission as a component party of Advance New Zealand. On 12 September, Te Kahika and fellow Advance NZ co-leader Ross took part in a \\"National Rally for Freedom\\" rally opposing the Government's COVID-19 lockdown in Auckland's Aotea Square, which attracted thousands of people. In mid October, Te Kahika attracted accusations of anti-Semitism after making remarks in a Facebook Live video dating back to June 2020 criticising the formation of Israel and propagating conspiracy theories related to the Rothschild family and Jewish control over the global financial system. In October 2020 it was revealed that Te Kahika's paid weekly interviews with New Zealand conspiracy theorist Vinny Eastwood had violated electoral law as they did not include a legally-required promoter statement. The Electoral Commission took no action as Te Kahika's sponsorship had been disclosed. Community involvement and public image Between 2009 and 2010, Te Kahika was involved with Holden's \\"Driving Towards a Future\\" programme, which sought to educate young drivers about road safety issues like drink driving, speeding and personal responsibility. Between August and October 2011, Te Kahika led a music tour to help The Salvation Army raise funds for families affected by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. In October 2019, Te Kahika organised a special benefit concert to raise support for Auckland's homeless community called the \\"Blues For the Homeless,\\" which played in Milford. Until late August 2020, Te Kahika also served as an ambassador for the anti-domestic violence charity White Ribbons. Following his controversial remarks about COVID-19 and other issues, White Ribbons severed relations with Te Kahika on the grounds that his remarks undermined the trust's evidence-based approach. This suspension accompanied an Advance NZ/NZ Public Party video alleging that the New Zealand Government had passed legislation forcing people to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Te Kahika defended his remarks and stance, claiming that the Government was corrupt and that COVID-19 was \\"nothing worse than a flu.\\" Te Kahika also alleged that he was the target of an international assassin. As leader of the NZ Public Party, Te Kahika has advocated on behalf of a woman known as \\"L.K.,\\" who was imprisoned in late August after she and her children breached managed isolation in Hamilton to attend her husband's funeral. Te Kahika described her as a \\"brave and courageous woman\\" who had \\"touched\\" his heart through her experience. He also claimed that he had lobbied the Government into releasing her after seven days.

Bulmer was the first archaeologist to carry out excavations in the New Guinea Highlands (1959-1960). Bulmer‚Äôs Fruit Bat, a New Guinea megabat, is named after her.  Early life and education  Bulmer was born in Ithaca, New York. Her father, Frederick Rudolph Hirsh Jr , was a postgraduate researcher in physics at Cornell University. Her mother, Adeline Nordendahl Hirsh, had also been a student at Cornell. Her older sister, Mary Adeline Hirsh, was born in 1929. In 1937 the family moved to Pasadena, California, where Frederick Hirsh taught physics at the University of Southern California. Education  Bulmer graduated from Cornell University with a BA majoring in anthropology in 1954. She then did a Master‚Äôs degree at the University of Hawaii, researching the Samoan diaspora. In 1955 she was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to continue her research in New Zealand. Bulmer arrived in Auckland in January 1956. Later that year she went on a field trip to Samoa. Two archaeologists from Auckland University, Jack Golson and Wal Ambrose, were running an excavation in Samoa near where she was staying. She would visit the excavation after her days of research interviews. This experience kindled her lifelong passion for archaeology. When she returned to New Zealand, Sue enrolled to do a second Master‚Äôs degree in archaeology at the University of Auckland, starting in 1957. University of Auckland MA (Archaeology) 1966 University of Papua New Guinea PhD 1976  Career  In 1959-1960 and 1967-1973 Bulmer carried out field research in Papua New Guinea, including excavations in the Port Moresby area and in the New Guinea Highlands, including Wanlek, Yuku and Kiowa. From 1970-72 she was on the board of the Papua New Guinea National Museum, along with fellow board member Michael Somare, later Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. From the late 1970s she worked for the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage NZ, since 2019) as Northern Regional Archaeologist. When the Historic Places Trust was incorporated into the newly formed Department of Conservation (DOC) in 1990, she became a DOC scientist. After her retirement from DOC in 1994 she returned to her New Guinea research projects.  Research  Bulmer‚Äôs contribution to New Guinea archaeology was commemorated in a special volume of Archaeology in Oceania in 2016. This volume includes a bibliography of Sue Bulmer's publications, compiled by Sue‚Äôs daughter Alice Bulmer, spanning both Sue's New Guinea work and her New Zealand work. Bulmer‚Äôs wide-ranging research interests included indigenous agriculture and domestic animals. Some of her later publications were about the New Guinea Singing Dog. Bulmer was active in the World Archaeology Congress, serving as Treasurer.  Community activism  In the mid-1980s Bulmer founded the Friends of Maungawhau, a community organization advocating for the care and management of Maungawhau, an extinct volcanic cone and historic pa site in the Auckland inner city suburb of Mt Eden. The 2014 book Maungawhau: A Short History of Volunteer Action is dedicated to Sue Bulmer. In 2005 she received a Living Legend award from Auckland Mayor Dick Hubbard in recognition of her community service.  Personal life  Bulmer married the social anthropologist and ethnobiologist Ralph Bulmer in 1959. She and Ralph had three children. They divorced in 1979. In 1985 she married psychiatrist Terence (Terry) O‚ÄôMeara, who was a friend from her high school days in Pasadena. The marriage lasted until his death in 2010.  Sweat in the Sun, Mate  As a young woman Bulmer was a keen folksinger, having learned to play guitar while she was a student at the University of Hawaii. She contributed her musical skills to campfire music on summer digs run by the Auckland University Archaeological Society in 1957-60. In 1967 an LP recording, Sweat in the Sun Mate, was produced to commemorate the music sessions. Sue sang on several tracks, including her original composition, \\"Hi Jolly\\", a humorous ballad about a notorious fossicker who was always one step ahead of the archaeologists. In 2018 the University of Auckland Archaeological Society made a commemorative CD re-issue of Sweat in the Sun, Mate.

Headed by Rienthong Nanna, an ultra-royalist former major general, medical doctor, and special advisor to the Prime Minister, it was founded during the 2013‚Äì2014 Thai political crisis, on the side of the People's Democratic Reform Committee, and as of July 2019 had 300,000 likes on its Facebook page. The RCO is organized along professional military-style lines and engages in mob activism. Its stated aim is to 'eradicate' Thailand's ‚Äúsocial rubbish‚Äù and to ‚Äúeradicate l√®se-majest√© offenders completely.‚Äù The RCO seeks out potential cases of l√®se majest√© and reports them to the authorities. In addition, it perpetrates systematic mobbing, seeking to disclose a victim‚Äôs private address (doxing) and then inciting pro-royalists to verbally abuse the victim at their home or work. The RCO has adopted civic volunteerism and publicizes state-organized mass events, such as royal bicycle rallies, through social media.  Origins  The RCO came into operations in April 2014, one month before the 2014 military coup, allegedly on the orders of then Privy Councilor Lt. Gen. Surayud Chulanont, who headed one of the military governments following the 2006 coup. Rienthong was gradually introduced to the public as a supposedly apolitical disaffected citizen (wutb√ºrger). Rienthong claimed that he was working to establish a ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs army to protect the monarchy‚Äùand that the RCO was protected by the army, which it promptly denied. The RCO adopted various fascist era-style slogans, including ‚ÄúWhen you first sweep the floor, the dust will be blown all over the place ‚Äì but later the floor will look cleaner‚Äù. The RCO has received funding from the Thai military.  Founder  Rienthong Nanna, who still uses his military title (major general), was a former operations director of the Army Medical Department and is director of his own private hospital, Mongkutwattana Hospital, in central Bangkok, from where he oversees the RCO. Rienthong has announced a policy to vet the social media accounts of suppliers to his hospital for loyalty to the monarchy before buying their services and also to vet the social media accounts of his patients, vowing not to treat those who may appear to be disloyal to the monarchy, despite the hospital being part of the Thai public health system. In January 2019, a case was filed to revoke Rienthong‚Äôs medical license on the grounds of \\"discrimination, verbal abuses, and posting inappropriate statements on Facebook\\". In July 2020, he was appointed special advisor to the Prime Minister with a brief of reducing the socioeconomic impacts of Covid-19.  Tactics  The RCO engages in doxing, the practice of investigating and making public online identities, then reports these to the authorities. Tactics have also included intimidation, by posting photos of the October 1976 Thammasat University massacre, and posting nude or otherwise offensive photos to victims' Facebook pages, followed by allegations that the page owner had in this way committed cybercimes. The RCO has also mobbed victims house and places of work. One of the early targets of the RCO was Kamol Duangphasuk, who was subsequently assassinated. The RCO also targets victims in person overseas at their home addresses and victims' families, with one victim‚Äôs parents being \\"forced to file a l√®se-majest√© case against their own daughter\\".:30  Main campaigns = 2015 campaign  After the 2014 Thai military coup, there was a resurgence in state-sponsored online crackdowns and vigilante activity targeting anti-regime protesters, including by the RCO. In January 2015, the RCO targeted the United Nations High Commission for Refugees after it assisted an activist accused of l√®se majest√© to flee to New Zealand. In late September, 2015, the RCO targeted Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. In October 2015, the RCO targeted the US Embassy in Bangkok, delivering a statement to President Obama, asking him to repatriate l√®se majest√© who had fled overseas, including to the United Kingdom. Later the same month, the RCO directly targeted Facebook and Youtube for carrying content it deemed as causing l√®se-majest√©. In late 2015 Rienthong temporarily withdrew from the RCO.  2016 campaign  In 2016, the RCO was active in seeking out Thais who did not dress in mourning wear following the death of Thai king Bhumibol Adulyadej.  2020 campaign  In July 2020, the RCO became a protagonist in the 2020 Thai protests, targeting the student protesters. It launched its ‚ÄúExtinguish the Future Project‚Äù, which aims ‚Äúto create a list of individuals which companies, government agencies, and educational institutions must ban from being employed, enrolling for study or receiving scholarships.‚Äù RCO supporters were ordered to infiltrate the protesters, discover their identities, and then engage in a mass campaign of publicly discrediting them. The campaign provoked a massive reaction on Thai social media, including from Thai stars like Intira Jaroenpura, and even from some conservatives. During the protests, Rienthong fired one of his doctors for signing a petition requesting authorities to not use violence against demonstrators.

Boase uses a range of hermeneutical approaches in her work but is particularly known for her use of trauma theory as an hermeneutical lens to interpret the Bible. She also publishes in the areas of Hebrew Bible, the Book of Lamentations, the Book of Jeremiah, Biblical Hermeneutics, Bakhtin and the Bible, and Ecological Hermeneutics.  Biography  Boase studied Applied Science (Speech and Hearing) at the Western Australia Institute of Technology, now known as Curtin University. Following graduation, she worked as a speech therapist. She is a member of the Uniting Church of Australia, and at the age of 25 she was serving as an Elder in the church. She was commissioned as a lay preacher in 1994. She completed a Bachelor of Divinity (Honours) at Murdoch University in Perth. Studying part time while raising two children, she completed her doctoral studies at Murdoch University in 2003. Boase worked as a lecturer at the University of Notre Dame Australia in Freemantle from 2004 to 2008. She later worked at Uniting College for Leadership and Theology, in South Australia, where she was Lecturer of New Testament and co-director of Biblical Studies. Boase also taught at Adelaide College of Divinity, and Flinders University from 2009‚Äì2019. She became Head of the Theology Department at Flinders University and Academic Dean of the Adelaide College of Divinity. In February 2020, Boase began work as the inaugural Dean for the School of Graduate Research at the University of Divinity, in Melbourne.  Career and research  Boase's first book explored the relationship between the Book of Lamentations, and prophetic literature in the Hebrew Bible. A revision of her PhD thesis, The Fulfillment of Doom? The Dialogic Interaction between the Book of Lamentation and the Pre-Exilic/Early Exilic Prophetic Literature, was published in 2006 by T&T; Clark, volume 437 in The Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies series. The book utilizes Mikhail Bahktin's literary theory as an interpretive lens. According to one reviewer, \\"Boase's study has opened Lamentations in new ways and in doing so has demonstrated the usefulness of new methodological approaches.\\" A second reviewer noted that \\"Boase's revised dissertation (2003, directed by Sue Boorer), is important for scholars of Lamentations, prophecy, and the interactions between them. Boase is one of the leading scholars at the intersection of trauma theory and biblical hermeneutics. She co-edited, with Christopher G. Frechette, Bible through the Lens of Trauma, which was published by SBL Press in 2016, number 86 in Semeia Studies. Described as a ‚Äúlandmark collection of essays on the use of trauma as a hermeneutical lens in biblical studies‚Äù, this work explores how insights from the disciplines of psychology, sociology, and literary and cultural studies inform biblical trauma hermeneutics. Boase has also written about ecological hermeneutics, and contributed to Ecological Aspects of War: Engagements with Biblical Texts, edited by Anne Elvey and Keith Dyer. Boase has served as co-chair of the Biblical Literature and the Hermeneutics of Trauma section for the Society of Biblical Literature. She is a member of the Fellowship of Biblical Studies. She is on the editorial board of the Journal of Biblical Literature and is the general editor of the Trauma Readings Series published by Sheffield Phoenix Press.

Creation of the society  On 11 June 1856, sixteen painters, inspired by the Royal Watercolour Society created in 1804, met in Brussels to found a similar society. Jean-Baptiste Madou was its first president. The number of its members was initially limited to twenty, but it is then increased to thirty and later to forty.

She is an associate professor at the Universit√© de Montr√©al Faculty of Law and at the Department of Philosophy and Applied Ethics at the Universit√© de Sherbrooke. Giroux is also coordinator for the Centre de recherche en √©thique (\\"Ethics Research Center\\") and a Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics. She is the author of the book Contre l'exploitation animale (\\"Against Animal Exploitation\\") and the co-author, with Renan Larue, of the book Le V√©ganisme (\\"Veganism\\") in the PUF editorial collection \\"Que sais-je?\\" (\\"What do I know?) and has a forthcoming book in the same collection, L'antisp√©cisme (\\"Antispeciesism\\"). Giroux is regularly invited to speak to the media on issues relating to animal ethics.  Biography  After obtaining her law degree from the Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1997, Giroux became a member of the Bar of Quebec in 2001. Out of interest in issues surrounding animal rights, she began a master's degree in law at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, with a thesis on a project to reform the cruelty to animals offenses of the Criminal Code of Canada. She then undertook doctoral studies in philosophy at the Universit√© de Montr√©al and devoted her doctoral thesis, which was supervised by Christine Tappolet, to the extension of the most fundamental human rights to all sentient beings; the thesis, the first in Quebec in animal ethics, was published in book form by √âditions L'√Çge d'Homme in 2017.  Philosophy  Giroux's philosophy is antispeciesist, in that she argues against discriminating against sentient beings because they lack human species membership. She asserts that cognitive capacity, or lack thereof, for antispeciesists has no moral relevance, stating \\"[y]ou can't use these characteristics to place more or less value on individuals; the proof is that we do not grant more fundamental rights to the most intelligent human beings.\\" Giroux is opposed to welfarism and considers herself to be an abolitionist when it comes to animal rights. She opposes Alasdair Cochrane's position on the right to freedom of non-human animals, for whom animals have only an interest in being free when the absence of freedom is the cause of suffering for them. Conversely, Giroux maintains that the interest in being free from all sentient agents (human or nonhuman) is of the same nature. This is at least the case, according to her, as soon as one abandons the concept of positive freedom (being the ultimate master of one's will and actions) in favor of that of negative freedom (not being subjected to external constraints) or of libertarian freedom (not to be subjected to domination). And this interest to be free, she argues, must be protected by the individual right to freedom for all sentient beings, whether they belong to humanity or not.  Awards  In 2018, Giroux received the 1st Prize for the Research Professionals Excellence award from the Fonds de recherche du Qu√©bec ‚Äì Soci√©t√© et culture (FRQSC).

His works as a medallist include the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts' C. F. Hansen Medal and Thorvaldsen Medal. Early life and education Christensen was born on 17 January 1806 in Copenhagen, the son of merchant and later innkeeper John Christensen (d. c. 1819) and Maria Kirstine Birch. He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and was at the same time in 1819‚Äì23 articled to the sculptor Nicolai Dajon. He won the Academy's small and large silver medals in 1824, the small gold medal in 1825 and finally the large gold medal in 1827. Career Christen Christensen by Caroline Behrend Christensen was already as a student commissioned to create a number of sculptural works for the Royal Danish Theatre and Christianshorg Palace. Instigated by the Academy's praeses, Prince Christian Frederick, he then decided to continue his education as a medallist. He won a prize for a medal Christian Frederik Hansen and was in addition to the prize money granted an extra remuneration as well as a travel stipend. He then went on a four-year journey abroad in 1831‚Äì34 of which he spent three of the years in Rome. He then made his way back to Denmark by way of Paris and Berlin to study medals on the way. In 1835, he was made an associate member (agreeret) of the Academy and received as the subject of his admissions work a medal commemorating the homecoming of Bertel Thorvaldsen's works. The medal in silver would in the future be awarded to artists for exceptional contributions to the annual Charlottenborg exhibitions. Christensen was based on the model for the medal admitted as member of the Academy in 1838, but his work with the stamps was hit by a number of accidents and it had therefore not yet been completed when the Exhibition Medal was awarded for the first time to Martinus R√∏rbye in 1839. In 1842, it was finally possible to present Thorvladsen with the first medal in gold. In 1844, Christensen was made a professor at the Academy's model school. In 1843, he was made a foreign member of the Art Academy in Berlin. In 1845, he was made a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. Works Copperplate engraving by Erling Eckersberg of Christensen's Thorvaldsen Medal, 1850 Christensen has created a total of 21 medals. These include kometmedaljen (1832) and medals commemorating Frederik VI's recovery and death (1839), the reformation anniversary (1836), the royal couple's silver wedding (front side, 1840), Crown Prince Frederick's wedding (front side, 1841), the 100-year anniversary of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences (1842), Albert Thaer (1833), A. W. Hauch (1838) and Michael Nielsen (1844). His work as a sculptor includes a considerable number of portrait busts and reliefs. Personal life Christensen was married to Oline Louise Bugge (22 January 1805 ‚Äì 9 March 1878), a daughter of master joiner Ole B. (1765‚Äì1815) and Gertrud Kirschbaum (1770‚Äì1813), on 8 August 1835. He was created a Knight in the Order of the Dannebrog in 1843. Depictions Wilhelm Bendz: A sculptor working from live model studies, 1827 Christensen is seen in Wilhelm Bendz's 1827 genre painting A sculptor working from live model studies (Danish National Gallery). He is also seen in Bendz' painting of Finchs kaffehus (1832. Thorvaldsens Museum). He has also been the subject of portrait paintings by Constantin Hansen (1831, Hirschsprung Collection) and J. V. Gertner (1836, Danish National Gallery). Christensen has also been the subject of portrait drawings by H. Eddelin (1830, Royal Danish Library), H. E. Freund (c. 1830), W.

The game was released in Japan for the PC Engine on July 12, 1991. Plot A female pilot is tasked with completing a VR training exercise and mastering the use of a prototype tank called the CS-05 Metal Stoker. However, during the course of the game, she discovers that she was actually fighting a real battle rather than performing in a simulation. Gameplay The first level of the game. The player assumes the role of a female pilot (presented only in several cut-scenes) controlling a prototype CS-05 tank. The tank can move and shoot in any direction, it's also possible to strafe as the tank's firing position can be locked at any time by pressing the second action button. The action is presented in a top-down perspective and takes place across 7 large fields full of enemies and obstacles, with each level being composed of several sub- stages. Most of the levels feature free-directional scrolling areas allowing the players to seek out items and enemies however they wish. Progressing through a stage requires the fulfillment of a necessary condition (usually the destruction of a group of enemies or a mini-boss), an arrow and a Go! sign appear when the conditions are met. Scattered across the stages the players can find extra lives, energy refills and power pods which expand the tank's arsenal. There are five types of weapons available: a rapid firing machine gun, a double barreled laser beam, mines, homing missiles and a force field that damages anything that runs into it. Each weapon can be powered-up by collecting the same power pod twice and can also unleash a special attack (activated by pressing Select).ASM magazine, issue 11/91, Tronic Verlag, November 1991 Development Metal Stoker was created by Japanese video game developer Sankindo, who had previously worked on games like Cross Wiber and Time Cruise. Japanese film director Hiroyuki Nasu, famous for his award winning film adaptation of the manga Bee Bop High School, was in charge of the game's direction and graphic design. The game‚Äôs soundtrack was composed by Hiroto Saitou, who would later work on the PS3 adventure game Folklore (2007), and Nozomu Takahashi who, following the release of Metal Stoker, became a production manager for Studio Ghibli. Reception ASM felt that Metal Stoker was well-made from a technical standpoint, commending its graphics, music and smooth scrolling. They also praised the game's difficulty curve arguing that its slowly increasing level of difficulty makes the game suitable for both beginners and experienced players. In their retrospective review, Hardcore Gaming 101 argued that Metal Stoker features elements that \\"help it stand out among the PC Engine‚Äôs other overhead shooters today\\". They praised the graphics and soundtrack and highlighted the variety in the game's level design and scenery, noticing that \\"this variety is where the game consistently shines. (...) There will be a number of specific powerful foes you will usually need to destroy to progress, and every one of these areas (...) has a different look and enemies unique to them to keep things interesting\\".

By virtue of her marriage, she became the sister-in-law of the Hungarian Queen Barbara of Celje. Her marriage was troubled by disagreements with her housband, and in 1422 or 1423 she was found killed in her bed.Fugger Germadnik, Rolanda (2006), K zvezdam in nazaj: Ob 550-letnici smrti poslednjega grofa celjskega, Celje: Pokrajinski muzej Celje.

P. 15 The unusually large dowry can be explained as part of a settlement between Stephen, his brother Ivan (John), and Hermann of Celje on the division of Stephen's lands after his death. When Stephen's died in 1390, Elizabeth came under the tutelage of her uncle Ivan V of Frankopan, while her mother was forced into exile to the Windic March, a stronghold of the Celje dynasty.≈†ercer, Marija (2011), \\"≈Ωene Frankopanke\\", In Modru≈°ki zbornik, Vol. 4-5 No. 4-5, 2011. Pp. 24 The negotiations around Elizabeth's marriage thus became protracted, as it was clear that her uncle was trying to lower the promised sum, and keep more of his late brother's inheritance for himself. Finally, the initial sum of money was cut in half, but Elizabeth was to receive the estate of Steniƒçnjak in Slavonia, with the strategically important castle of Skrad, instead.Klaiƒá, Nada (1991). Zadnji knezi Celjski v de≈æelah Sv. Krone.

Troublesome marriage and death  Elizabeth and Frederick had two sons, Ulrich II of Celje and Frederick III; the latter would die as a child, while the former would remain his grandfather's sole heir.Grdina, Igor (1994). Celjski knezi v Evropi. Celje: Fit-Media, p. 250 The marriage seems to have been an unhappy one, since the spouses lived separately from at least 1414 onward.Klaiƒá, Nada (1991).

Pp. 26 The situation deteriorated to the extent that Elizabeth father-in-law Hermann intervened in an attempt to reconcile the spouses. In 1422 (or 1423, according to other sources), Elizabeth and Frederick met at the family castle in Krapina, in the Slavonian County of Zagorje.Klaiƒá, Nada (1991). Zadnji knezi Celjski v de≈æelah Sv.

Pp. 134  Aftermath  Soon after Elizabeth's death, the rumor that she was killed by her husband spread in Slavonia and beyond, as attested by the anonymous chronist at the court of Celje.Dvorakova, Daniela (2019), Barbara Celjska. ƒårna kraljica, Celje: Mohorjeva dru≈æba. Pp. 134-5 Frederick is said to have fled to Buda, where his sister Queen Barbara lived. The chronist Eberhard Windeck who claimed to have witnessed the fallout between the spouses, wrote that Elizabeth had been stabbed in her bed during the night, and that the evening before the murder she had expressed her fears to her entourage: \\"My lords and friends, what benefit will this reconciliation [with Frederick] bring? I know very well that tomorrow morning, you shall find me dead beside my husband\\".Dvorakova, Daniela (2019), Barbara Celjska. ƒårna kraljica, Celje: Mohorjeva dru≈æba. P. 135 Historian Nada Klaiƒá expressed skepticism regarding the veracity of these reports.Klaiƒá, Nada (1991). Zadnji knezi Celjski v de≈æelah Sv. Krone. Ljubljana-Celje: Zalo≈æba Prese, pp. 55-56 Elizabeth's death caused a rift in the already precarious alliance between the Houses of Celje and Frankopan who were competing for influence in Croatia and Slavonia.Dvorakova, Daniela (2019), Barbara Celjska. ƒårna kraljica, Celje: Mohorjeva dru≈æba. P. 135 Elizabeth's kinsman Ivan VI Frankopan challenged Frederick to a duel.Dvorakova, Daniela (2019), Barbara Celjska. ƒårna kraljica, Celje: Mohorjeva dru≈æba. P. 135 After the intervention of Frederick's brother- in-law Sigismund of Luxembourg, the dispute was to be settled by the Danish king Eric of Pomerania who enjoyed the trust of both parties.Dvorakova, Daniela (2019), Barbara Celjska. ƒårna kraljica, Celje: Mohorjeva dru≈æba. P. 139 It seems that Eric ruled in Frederick's favor, since he returned to his estates soon afterwards. There, he married Veronika of Desenice, a woman of much lower social standing. He did this without his father's nor the king's consent. This caused Hermann's wrath, leading to Frederick's imprisonment, and Veronika's assassination by the hands of the Celje patriarch.Dvorakova, Daniela (2019), Barbara Celjska. ƒårna kraljica, Celje: Mohorjeva dru≈æba. Pp. 136-37  Cultural legacy  Elizabeth's fate is the subject of the poem Elizabeth of Frankopan (Frangep√°n Erzs√©bet, 1836) by the Hungarian Romantic author Sandor Kisfaludy. She is also a side character in the play Veronika of Desenice (Veronika Deseni≈°ka), published in 1924 by the Slovenian author Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç. In ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç's drama, Elizabeth and Veronika are presented as victims of Frederick's treachery, and the former's death as suicide.

He was also a member of the Puerto Rico men's national basketball team.https://www.bsnpr.com/jugadores/jugador.asp?id=1157&e;= BSN career Quinones debuted with the Criollos during 1976. That season, he played 32 games, scoring 503 points, with 304 rebounds and 26 assists for averages of 15.7, 10.6 and 0.8 respectively. He became a steady scorer during the late 70's, raising his per game points average to 23.6 by the 1978 season. He was also an adequate rebounder, pulling between 7.0 and 8.6 rebounds per game during this era. In 1978, Quinones debuted with his country's men's national basketball team at the age of 22. After his scoring average dipped slightly, from 21.5 points per game in 1979 to 19.9 points per game in 1980, Quinones began, in 1981, a string of nine consecutive years in which he topped the 20 points per game average, at 24.0 in 1981, 22.3 in 1982, 27.1 in 1983, 24.1 in 1984, 23.8 in 1985, 23.4 in 1986 and 1987, 20.3 in 1988 and 22.2 in 1989.http://www.worldhoopstats.com/stats/bsn-pr/jose-willie-quinonez- figueroa.html He became a star in the league at a time when he competed with other famous BSN players such as Quijote Morales, Piculin Ortiz and Ruben Rodriguez. Between 1984 and 1991, Quinones also became a threat from the three point shots line, shooting 50 percent in 1984, 33 percent in 1985 and 1986, 41 percent in 1987, 32 percent in 1989, 45 percent in 1990 and 35 percent in 1991. Despite his efforts and being teamed for a good portion of that time with point guard Willito Melendez, however, Quinones could not help the Criollos' luck much, as they only made the playoffs sporadically and were hurt by a trade of Melendez to the Polluelos de Aibonito before the 1986 season. The Criollos, who had made the BSN playoffs in 1985, fell to 12-21 in 1986, 7-23 in 1987, 9-24 in 1988 and 10-20 in 1989. Quinones was reluctant to be traded from the Criollos; he was, however, traded to Coamo after the 1991 season. In Coamo, he played one season, scoring 229 points, along with 83 rebounds and 23 assists in 27 games. He then played for the Gigantes de Carolina in 1993 and the then BSN leading championships winning team Vaqueros de Bayamon in 1994 before being traded back to the Criollos de Caguas that same season.

During the time of the Disaster of Yongjia, he led the refugees from his hometown to Yanzhou in 312 to escape the chaos in the north. They later fled to the south as Later Zhao were close to conquering the province. Chi Jian became one of the Eastern Jin dynasty most important leading figures along the likes of Wen Jiao and Tao Kan as he defended the dynasty from the major rebellions of Wang Dun and Su Jun.  Early career  Chi Jian was from Gaoping County (È´òÂπ≥Á∏£; northwest of present-day Weishan County, Shandong) and was very poor in his youth. His great-grandfather was Chi L√º, a rival of the Han dynasty scholar Kong Rong and a minister of Cao Cao. Chi Jian was determined to better his livelihood, so he began reading the scriptures and whenever he farmed, he would chant what he had learnt.(ÈÉóÈëíÔºåÂ≠óÈÅìÂæΩÔºåÈ´òÂπ≥ÈáëÈÑâ‰∫∫ÔºåÊº¢Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´ÊÖÆ‰πãÁéÑÂ≠´‰πü„ÄÇÂ∞ëÂ≠§Ë≤ßÔºåÂçöË¶ΩÁ∂ìÁ±çÔºåË∫¨ËÄïÈö¥ÁïùÔºåÂêüË©†‰∏çÂÄ¶„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 67 Eventually, he landed an office serving under the Prince of Zhao, Sima Lun. However, he disliked the prince's growing imperial ambition and soon resigned. When Sima Lun usurped the throne in 301, Chi Jian refused to return to his service despite the lofty titles he was handing out. The same year, Sima Lun would be killed, and Chi Jian returned to the government to serve Liu Shi (ÂäâÂØî). Prince of Donghai and the emperor's regent, Sima Yue, appreciated Chi Jian's talents and wanted him as his Registrar but he refused. He also turned down an offer from Sima Yue's powerful general Gou Xi, who wanted him as Assistant Officer of the Household. Chi Jian did not wish to join any of them as he knew about the rift between the two men and that war could break out at any moment. Because of this, he decided to retire from the government.(Ë∂ôÁéãÂÄ´ËæüÁÇ∫ÊéæÔºåÁü•ÂÄ´Êúâ‰∏çËá£‰πãË∑°ÔºåÁ®±ÁñæÂéªËÅ∑„ÄÇÂèäÂÄ´ÁØ°ÔºåÂÖ∂Èª®ÁöÜËá≥Â§ßÂÆòÔºåËÄåÈëíÈñâÈñÄËá™ÂÆàÔºå‰∏çÊüìÈÄÜÁØÄ„ÄÇÊÉ†Â∏ùÂèçÊ≠£ÔºåÂèÉÂè∏Á©∫Ëªç‰∫ãÔºåÁ¥ØÈÅ∑Â§™Â≠ê‰∏≠Ëàç‰∫∫„ÄÅ‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé„ÄÇÊù±Êµ∑ÁéãË∂äËæüÁÇ∫‰∏ªÁ∞øÔºåËàâË≥¢ËâØÔºå‰∏çË°å„ÄÇÂæÅÊù±Â§ßÂ∞áËªçËãüÊôûÊ™ÑÁÇ∫Âæû‰∫ã‰∏≠ÈÉé„ÄÇÊôûËàáË∂äÊñπ‰ª•ÂäõÁà≠ÔºåÈëí‰∏çÊáâÂÖ∂Âè¨„ÄÇÂæûÂÖÑÊó≠ÔºåÊôû‰πãÂà•ÈßïÔºåÊÅêÁ¶çÂèäÂ∑±ÔºåÂã∏‰πãËµ¥Âè¨ÔºåÈëíÁµÇ‰∏çÂõûÔºåÊôû‰∫¶‰∏ç‰πãÈÄº‰πü„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 67  Disaster of Yongjia and as Inspector of Yanzhou  In 311, the barbarian forces of Han Zhao took over Luoyang and captured the emperor.

Chen Wu wanted to employ Chi Jian and make him their leader but Chi managed to escaped. After Chen Wu was defeated, Chi Jian decided to return to his hometown.

He grew ill from this and died the following year, leaving the throne to his son Emperor Ming of Jin. Emperor Ming wanted someone to counter Wang Dun from the outside, so he made Chi Jian as Inspector of Yanzhou and Commander of military affairs north of the Yangzi. However, Wang Dun suspected this and instead petitioned to have made Prefect of the Masters of Writing instead. Later that year, Emperor Ming summoned Chi Jian to the capital. On the way, Chi Jian visited Wang Dun's base, where they discussed about the old Western Jin dynasty in the north. Wang Dun criticised the minister Yue Guang for his lack of talent while praising his counterpart Man Fen (ÊªøÂ•Æ). Chi Jian defended Yue Guang, saying that he had been a loyal man who tried to protect the Crown Prince Sima Yu while Man Fen betrayed him to Sima Lun. Wang Dun responded to him that Man Fen only did so under pressure, and Chi Jian replied that a real man remains true to himself in both life and death. Wang Dun was offended by his implied insult, and apprehended Chi Jian in his house for some time. He eventually released him to continue his way to Jiankang, despite his advisors' urge to kill him.

He tells him that the loyalists should occupy strategic locations around the area and fortify them while scorching the fields. That way, when Su Jun arrives, it would be difficult for him to attack and there would be no rations for his army. Chi Jian led the eastern army over to Daye (Â§ßÊ•≠, in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu), Qu'a (Êõ≤ÈòøÁ∏£; present-day Danyang, Jiangsu), and Chengting (Â∫±‰∫≠, in present-day Wujin County, Jiangsu) where they set up barricades to weaken Su Jun's assaults.(ÈÉóÈëíÂú®Âª£ÈôµÔºåÂüéÂ≠§Á≥ßÂ∞ëÔºåÈÄºËøëËÉ°ÂØáÔºå‰∫∫ÁÑ°Âõ∫Âøó„ÄÇÂæóË©îÊõ∏ÔºåÂçΩÊµÅÊ∂ïË™ìË°ÜÔºåÂÖ•Ëµ¥ÂúãÈõ£ÔºåÂ∞áÂ£´Áà≠Â•Æ„ÄÇÈÅ£Â∞áËªçÂ§è‰æØÈï∑Á≠âÈñìË°åË¨ÇÊ∫´Â∂†Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊàñËÅûË≥äÊ¨≤ÊåæÂ§©Â≠êÊù±ÂÖ•ÊúÉÁ®ΩÔºåÁï∂ÂÖàÁ´ãÁáüÂ£òÔºåÂ±ØÊìöË¶ÅÂÆ≥ÔºåÊó£Èò≤ÂÖ∂Ë∂äÈÄ∏ÔºåÂèàÊñ∑Ë≥äÁ≥ßÈÅãÔºåÁÑ∂ÂæåÊ∏ÖÈáéÂ†ÖÂ£Å‰ª•ÂæÖË≥ä„ÄÇË≥äÊîªÂüé‰∏çÊãîÔºåÈáéÁÑ°ÊâÄÊé†ÔºåÊù±ÈÅìÊó£Êñ∑ÔºåÁ≥ßÈÅãËá™ÁµïÔºåÂøÖËá™ÊΩ∞Áü£„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ∂†Ê∑±‰ª•Áà≤ÁÑ∂„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 94 Surely enough, Su Jun arrived at Daye, where he besieged the commander Guo Mo.

The Bayswater Brook discharges into the wetlands, which in turn discharges into the Swan River. In 2015, it underwent a rehabilitation project in order to improve the water quality and attract more wildlife. History Prior to the 1950s, the site of the Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary was a seasonally wet depression. In the 1950s, it was drained. Between 1972 and 1981, the surrounding area was used for a landfill, and the site became a wetland. Due to nutrients and pollutants from runoff, the wetlands were severely degraded and experiencing frequent algal blooms. In 2015, the wetlands underwent a $3 million rehabilitation project, jointly funded by the City of Bayswater and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. The project was designed so that water coming from the Bayswater Brook is cleaned and stripped of nutrients by the wetlands before being discharged into the Swan River. First, the incoming water flows through a gross pollutant trap, removing any rubbish, sediment or other large materials. The water then passes through alternating areas of shallow and deep water, which removes nitrogen and other nutrients, before flowing out of the wetland. The flow of water is controlled by a series of weirs and outlets, and in total, the process takes 48 hours from when the water enters the wetland to when the water exits. The project is projected to stop 1.35 tonnes of nitrogen, 200 kg of phosphorus and 40 tonnes of sediment/rubbish from entering the Swan River each year. The project also included the creation of a publicly accessible area in the middle of the wetland. Prior to the rehabilitation project, the wetlands were artificially supplied with ground water to ensure that the wetland did not dry up. After the completion of the project, it received several awards, including from the Australian Engineering Excellence Awards, the WA Premier's Awards and the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects. In 2016, a housing development was approved by the Western Australian Planning Commission next to the wetlands, overruling the City of Bayswater and triggering controversy. In 2017, the state government bought the land for $3.5 million, ending the development. In 2018, the Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary was rezoned from Urban to Parks and Recreation, ensuring that it would not be developed. Name The wetlands were named after Eric Singleton, who was a local advocate for the wetlands. He was a bird enthusiast and helped save the wetlands from development in the 1970s. Flora and Fauna 104 bird species have been recorded at the Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary. They include: *Biziura lobata (Musk Duck) *Malacorhynchus membranaceus (Pink-eared duck) *Oxyura australis (Blue-billed duck) *Anas gracilis (Grey teal) *Poliocephalus poliocephalus (Hoary-headed grebe) *Elseyornis melanops (Black-fronted Dotterel) 170,000 native plants of 26 different species were planted in the Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary during the rehabilitation project. They include: *Schoenoplectus validus (River club rush) *Baumea articulata (Jointed twig rush) *Baumea juncea (Bare Twig Rush) References Category:Bayswater, Western Australia Category:Swan River (Western Australia) Category:Wetlands of Western Australia Category:Swan Coastal Plain ","title":"Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary"},{"id":"65147782","title":"Yongquan station"},{"id":"65147800","text":"Anthony T.

It is a right tributary of the Mbomou River not far to the north of where the Mbomou joins the Uele River to form the Ubangi River. Environment The Mbari River is the main drainage axis of the Mbomou plateau. It is about long, running in a NE-SW direction through a wide alluvial plain. It drains a catchment area of . The plateau has an elevation of , slightly inclined to the south, on the Asande rise between the Lake Chad depression to the north and the Congo Basin to the south. A study published in 2002 found signs that forest plants were replacing savanna vegetation in the Mbari valley, in part due to sufficient annual rainfall, reduced frequency of bush fires and migration of rural people away from the region due to the economic crisis in Central Africa. African wild dogs have been documented in the south of the CAR in the Chinko/Mbari drainage basin in 2013. History The Bandia clan separated from the Abaza clan in the early 17th century. They controlled a large area between the Uele River and the Mbomou River. In the last quarter of the 18th century one of their leaders, Ndounga, founded what became the Bangassou kingdom over the Nzakara people on the Mbari river. His brother Kassanga founded what became the Rafai kingdom on the Chinko River. These kingdoms prospered during the 19th century by participating in the growing slave trade, and thus avoiding raids by slave traders. In the 1880s the chief Bangassou, whom the Belgians called Sultan Bangassou, began to obtain rifles from agents of the Congo Free State, and used these to expand his power. In January he moved his headquarters to where the Mbari enters the Bangassou. The Belgian Alphonse van G√®le founded the Yakoma post on the Ubangi River on 31 May 1890. Bangassou visited him there on 14 June 1890 and signed a treaty placing his Nzakara kingdom under the protection of the Congo Free State in order to obtain trade goods, weapons and military support from the Europeans. He sold huge quantities of ivory to agents of the Congo Free State. In 1894 the Belgian L√©on Hanolet ascended the Bari River while Th√©odore Nilis and Charles de la Kethulle ascended the Chinko River, another tributary of the Bomu.

Unraced as a two-year-old she showed promising form as a three-year-old when she won three races including the Listed Hoppings Stakes. She reached her peak in the first half of the 2017 season when she won the Rothesay Stakes before recording her biggest victory in the Group 1 Pretty Polly Stakes. She raced in five countries, namely England, Ireland, France, Canada and the United States. Background Nezwaah is a bay mare with white socks on her front and back left legs bred in the United Kingdom by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She entered the ownership of Sheikh Mohammed's brother Ahmed Al Maktoum and was sent into training with Roger Varian at Newmarket, Suffolk. She was from the seventh crop of foals sired by Dubawi, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Ghaiyyath, Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Old Persian, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Nezwaah's dam Ferdoos showed good racing form in a brief track career, winning three of her five starts including the Listed Pinnacle Stakes. She was descended from the American broodmare Gay Hostess (foaled 1957) making her a relative of Caracolero, Real Quiet, Majestic Prince and Secreto. Racing career=2016: three-year-old season On her raceourse debut Nezwaah started the 8/11 for a maiden race over one mile on the Polytrack surface at Chelmsford City Racecourse on 6 January 2016 in which she was ridden by Jack Mitchell and won by one and a half lengths from Rahyah after taking the lead inside the final furlong. On 1 February at Wolverhampton Racecourse, with Mitchell again in the saddle, the filly started favourite for a handicap over eight and a half furlongs on Tapeta and overcame a slow start to win \\"readily\\" by three and a half lengths. Nezwaah was stepped up in class and distance for her debut on turf and sustained her first defeat as she came home third behind We Are Ninety and Beautiful Moring in the Listed Fillies' Trial Stakes over ten furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 14 May. Harry Bentley took the ride when Nezwaah returned to the synthetic track and started the 3/1 favourite for the Listed Hoppings Stakes at Newcastle Racecourse on 24 June when she was matched against older opponents for the first time. After being restrained in the early stages she went to the front approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by three lengths from the four-year-old More Mischief. Andrea Atzeni, who had partnered the Nezwaah at Newbury, rode the filly in all of her subsequent races. She was sent to France in August and finished last of the five runners behind La Cressonniere in the Group 2 Prix de la Nonette at Deauville Racecourse, beaten just over eight lengths by the winner. In the following month she ran second to the Musidora Stakes winner So Mi Dar in the John Musker Fillies' Stakes at Yarmouth Racecourse with Arabian Queen in third. For her final run of the year Nezwaah was sent to Canada to contest the Grade I E. P. Taylor Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in October and although she never looked likely to win she kept on well in the closing stages to finish seventh, only two lengths behind the winner Al's Gal. 2017: four- year-old season Nezwaah was scheduled to begin her second campaign in the Dahlia Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 7 May but was withdrawn from the race after breaking out of the starting stalls in what Roger Varian described as \\"a freak occurrence\\". Seventeen days later at Ayr Racecourse the filly started the 1/2 favourite for the Rothesay Stakes in which she faced four opponents including the 2016 winner Maleficent Queen. After tracking the leaders she switched right to obtain a clear run approaching the final furlong, quickly went to the front and pulled clear to win by three and three quarter lengths. After the race Atzeni said \\"She was the class filly in the race. She settled nicely, which was great, and she picked up well. She's good-minded and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun with her this year\\". On 2 July Nezwaah was sent to Ireland to contest the Group 1 Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh and started the 13/2 fourth choice in the betting. Journey started favourite, while the other nine runners included Zhukova (Man o' War Stakes), Smart Call (Cape Metropolitan Stakes), Intricately (Moyglare Stud Stakes), Creggs Pipes (Lanwades Stud Stakes) and Turret Rocks (May Hill Stakes). Nezwaah was held up by Atzeni in the early stages as Creggs Pipes set the pace, but began to make strong progress in the last quarter mile and after taking the lead a furlong out she accelerated away from her rivals and won by more than three lengths from Rain Goddess. Atzeni commented: \\"She was very impressive and travelled beautifully. She was a little bit slow into her stride... but she picked up really well. I got quite a smooth run and just had to wait to get a gap. Two days ago we didn't know if she was going to run or not because of the weather, but Roger felt the ground was going to be fine for her and she's proved him right.\\" For her next appearance Nezwaah was stepped up in distance for the Yorkshire Oaks over one and a half miles at York Racecourse and came home fourth behind Enable, Coronet and Queen's Trust (Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf). In October she made a second attempt to win the E. P. Taylor Stakes and started favourite but finished fifth behind Blonde Me, beaten more than nine lengths by the winner after fading in the closing stages.

It was founded in 2010 and currently operates under the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society. The program trains high school and university students nationally in ultra- royalist ideology via workshops. Its two main objectives are indoctrinating Thai youth with ultra-royalist values and creating a youth-based nationwide network dedicated to detecting and reporting l√®se-majest√© violations through online surveillance.  History  The Cyber Scouts have been described as \\"reminiscent of the anticommunist, right-wing paramilitary Village Scouts of the 1970s\\" in that both programs are state-backed. The program was launched in December 2010 by the conservative Abhisit Vejjajiva administration, under the Thai Ministry of Justice and the Ministry for Information and Communication Technology. It was shut down in 2011 during the Yingluck Shinawatra administration, but it was reactivated by the military regime following the 2014 coup. As of 2016, 112 schools were involved, with over 120,000 members.  Objectives  According to a 2010 Ministry of Justice training document, the Cyber Scouts originally had five objectives: 1\\\\. To create a Cyber Scout volunteer network... that observes... [online] behavior that is deemed a threat to national security and to defend and protect the royal institution. 2\\\\. To collect the work of the Cyber Scout volunteers. 3\\\\. To set up a network of Cyber Scout volunteers to contact. 4\\\\. To promote the moral and ethics with the help of the volunteers, to ensure the correct behavior, build reconciliation and awareness towards the use of information with regard to morality and safety of individuals in society. 5\\\\. To promote and support to various sectors of society to careful and responsible usage of information technology. In the 2014 reboot, the objectives were \\"to jointly observe threats and monitor informations that are dangerous to the [monarchy] institution [and] national security, (...) to handle online information appropriately, as well as to incite to youth [with that knowledge] so that they will use technology the right way\\".  Tactics  Participants are encouraged to register on a website and are trained in one-day workshops. They receive ideological instructions on the history and importance of the Thai monarchy and are trained in how to use Facebook; they are incentivized through a points-based system. The Cyber Scouts' tactics includes befriending potential suspects on Facebook and initiating conversations on sensitive topics. They then report alleged violations of l√®se-majest√©.

Early life  Marja Ludwika Ziff was born on 2 December 1918 in Vienna, Austria, and grew up in the Polish city of Lvov. Her parents were of Ukrainian descent; her father was director of a bank, and her mother was a research chemist at Lvov University.  Education  In 1938 Ziff applied to study electrical engineering at the University of Edinburgh. She was accepted and moved to Scotland, surprising the professor who had offered her a place, as he had believed her application was from a Polish man. She became the first woman to study electrical engineering there. Ziff joined the Women's Engineering Society on her arrival in the UK in 1939. As the situation worsened in Europe, her family refused to join her. Following the invasion of Poland by Russia and Germany, her parents and grandparents died in the concentration camps, only her sister surviving. Ziff never felt able to return to Poland. In 1941 Marja Ziff graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in Electrical Engineering (Communications).  Career  In 1942, Ziff became a technical assistant at Johnson and Phillips Ltd. The company made cabling and navigation items for aircraft, and Ziff worked on technical problems of their distribution systems. Her job was varied, including working as a research assistant for new airplane guidance systems, to supervising the repair of overhead power cables shot down by drunken soldiers or repairing electrical exchanges damaged by bombings. She was one of the assistants to Jules Thorn (1899 ‚Äì 1980) the founder of Thorn Electrical Industries, one of the United Kingdom's largest electrical businesses. She lived in Blackheath, London during the latter part of the Second World War, volunteering as an air raid warden in the evenings.

In 1947, they made their home in Sydenham, joined by her younger sister, who had survived the war, and her mother-in-law. The couple had two sons, born in 1947 and 1951. She took his surname, and was often called Maria rather than Marja from this period onwards. In 1947 Maria Watkins was appointed a lecturer at South East London Technical College. In 1959 she became a lecturer at Northampton College of Advanced Technology, now the City University, and was later promoted to Senior Lecturer, working there until 1985. She was a member of Council and Senate of City University for three years and a member of Council and the Qualification board of the Institute of Electrical Engineering from 1976 to 1979. Watkins was also a visiting professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Boston, USA from 1973‚Äì2010, spending a term teaching there in 1975. She was an advocate for international higher education programmes and founded a number of programmes for visiting students from the USA. She undertook research in medical electronics and published at least 13 papers on these subjects. In 1981 she attended the International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists (ICWES) in Bombay, combining it with travel around India and Nepal. She also attended the 1991 ICWES in Coventry.  Memberships  Watkins was a Liveryman and senior steward of the Worshipful Company of Scientific Instrument Makers, and became a Freeman of the City of London. She was elected a Life Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and a Fellow and active member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. She was a long-term member of the Women's Engineering Society and took an active part in the London Branch. She played a key part in WES's submission to the Finniston Enquiry, heading up the education sections of the submission. She was a driving force in its work encouraging schoolgirls to consider engineering as a career and acted as WES's careers officer for some years. Watkins was elected WES President in 1980‚Äì81. In 1981, she gave the annual Verena Holmes lecture entitled Chips for the Disabled which examined how engineering could help support people living with disabilities. In 1984 she donated the Watkins Medal to WES to be awarded to the best female engineering graduate of the year.

It is the fifth of the Ramage novels, following on from Governor Ramage R.N.. Plot After the loss of the Triton brig, Ramage has been promised a fresh command in exchange for not embarrassing the Navy by taking legal action against Admiral Goddard for perjury, but no ship is presently available. Instead he is directed to investigate a mystery: Post Office packet vessels are being captured in increasing numbers, damaging communications between the Admiralty and foreign stations. Ramage buys passage on the Lady Arabella, a packet bound for England, along with his ship-owner friend Sidney Yorke, and is able to have some of his own ship‚Äôs company transferred to the packet. He finds that the packet‚Äôs owner and crew alike have little interest in avoiding capture and less in fighting off French privateers, and despite his best efforts the Arabella is indeed captured. Ramage is able to persuade their captor, Captain Kerguelen, to take the packet to Lisbon, a neutral port. There he sends a report to London, suggesting that the packet be ransomed and also enlisting Yorke‚Äôs assistance in case the Government is not forthcoming and they must buy back the ship with their own money. In fact, the Marchesa di Volterra soon arrives with the news that the Government will pay, and Ramage sails for England to make his report. But when the packetsmen mutiny and take the Marchesa di Volterra hostage, only the unexpected intervention of one of the mutineers is able to rescue her. Ramage‚Äôs report explains that Post Office packetsmen have been deliberately surrendering their vessels in pursuit of insurance swindles, as they have been investing in ‚Äúventures‚Äù (mildly-illegal private freight) and finding it profitable to make fraudulent claims for their supposed losses. The Arabella 's owner had an additional incentive: his ship‚Äôs stern was rotten, and he hoped to replace her with a new ship with the compensation for the loss of his vessel. Initially Ramage‚Äôs report is rejected by the Admiralty, until they read his final report with news of the mutiny. Steps are then taken both to punish the mutineers and to clamp down on \\"ventures\\", removing the temptation to surrender packets.
