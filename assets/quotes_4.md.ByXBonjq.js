Gugino was seriously injured, sustaining a brain injury, and was still unable to walk nearly two weeks later. He was hospitalized for nearly four weeks. Two Buffalo police officers were charged with felony assault in connection with the incident; they pleaded not guilty. Governor Andrew Cuomo and Senator Chuck Schumer condemned police conduct in the incident. President Donald Trump spread false and unfounded conspiracy theories about Gugino in his response to the incident on Twitter. Martin Gugino Martin Gugino (), born October 15, 1944, is an American peace activist associated with the Catholic Worker Movement. He worked with the Western New York Peace Center after his retirement, and was also interested in other political issues like Guant√°namo Bay and climate change. He is a native of Buffalo but worked later in Cleveland as a computer technician. He resides in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo. Incident During the George Floyd protests in New York state, the Mayor of Buffalo, Byron Brown, instituted a daily curfew in the city from 8:00p.m. to 5:00a.m. Not long after the curfew began on June 4, Buffalo Police Department officers and New York State Police officers swept through Niagara Square, where a protest was winding down. The officers were equipped with batons, helmets, and body armor. As they advanced to clear the area in a line, they were approached by Gugino. The encounter lasted six seconds and was caught on camera. Gugino, who was holding a helmet and a phone, approached officers Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski. Gugino appears to talk to the officers while gesticulating. Initially, McCabe hesitates. Some officers yell \\"Move\\" and \\"Push him back! Push him back!\\" McCabe pushed Gugino with his baton, while Torgalski used his right hand to push Gugino. A third officer, John Losi, also pushed McCabe, possibly amplifying the force of McCabe's push on Gugino. After being pushed, Gugino stumbled backwards and fell, hitting the back of his head on the pavement. After falling, Gugino remained motionless on the pavement, bleeding from the head. McCabe attempted to check on Gugino, but Losi stopped him from doing so, persuading McCabe to keep moving. More than a dozen Buffalo officers walked past Gugino. Two New York State Police medics aided Gugino. Aftermath Gugino was taken to a hospital in serious condition where he was treated for a concussion and laceration. He was initially treated in the intensive care unit; as of June 9, he was transferred to a regular hospital unit and was reported to be in \\"fair\\" condition. On June 15, Gugino's lawyer said Gugino had a fractured skull and was unable to walk. After nearly four weeks, on June 30, he was released from the hospital. According to his lawyer, Gugino would continue rehabilitation, and at that point he could \\"walk with a little help\\".  Response =Public response The incident was filmed by a member of the WBFO news team. WBFO uploaded the video of the incident to Twitter at 9:13 p.m. on June 4. The footage became a viral video, accumulating over 70 million views internationally. The incident prompted public outrage. The New York Civil Liberties Union described the incident as \\"casual cruelty\\", and called for Buffalo officials to \\"seriously address the police violence during this week's protest and the culture of impunity that led to this incident\\". Some Facebook posts claimed without evidence that the incident was staged; these posts were labelled as false by both Facebook and Politifact. Initial reactions by local and state officials Governor Andrew Cuomo and Senator Chuck Schumer condemned the incident via social media. Erie County District Attorney John J. Flynn said the officers \\"crossed a line\\". Cuomo asked why the officers' actions were necessary, described their behavior as \\"just fundamentally offensive and frightening\\", and said the city of Buffalo should consider firing them and carrying out a criminal investigation. In a statement that Gugino's lawyer passed on to CNN on June 15, Gugino said he appreciated the concern, but \\"There are plenty of other things to think about besides me.\\" After viewing video of the incident, Brown said he was \\"deeply disturbed\\" by it. He also said the incident was \\"disheartening\\", because in the previous days, protests were \\"peaceful\\", while he, the police, and the community were conducting meetings. On June 10, Brown announced impending changes to Buffalo police protocol, including implementing \\"appearance tickets\\" for non-violent protesters rather having them face arrest and creating a \\"public protection unit\\" to replace the emergency response team, with an emphasis on being better-suited to handle large-scale protests. He also said the police union was \\"in the wrong\\". Buffalo Bills cornerback Josh Norman and New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis attended this press conference as part of a nation-wide tour to help improve awareness to social justice issues, with Davis praising Brown's plans for change. Initially, media outlets incorrectly reported that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown called Gugino an \\"agitator\\" and a \\"major instigator\\"; Brown was actually referring to another protester, not Gugino. Some media outlets issued corrections on their websites. Buffalo police and their union On June 4, 8:50 p.m., the Buffalo police department stated that \\"during [a] skirmish involving protestors, one person was injured when he tripped & fell\\"; according to The Washington Post, a video of the incident showed that this claim was false. The Buffalo police department later said that officers who were not directly involved in the incident had given the description of Gugino's supposedly having \\"tripped\\". By June 4, 11:05 p.m., the two officers who had pushed Gugino were suspended without pay, with the Buffalo police chief ordering for an investigation of the incident. The Buffalo police union, the Buffalo Police Benevolent Association, was angered by the suspensions of the two officers, and it retaliated on June5 by withdrawing its legal fees support for any other Buffalo officers for incidents related to the protests. The police union's president claimed that the suspended officers \\"were simply following orders\\" and \\"simply doing their job\\" while also saying the victim \\"did slip\\". All 57 police officers from the Buffalo Police Department emergency response team resigned from the team, although they did not resign from the department. According to the police union's president, the mass resignations were a show of solidarity with the two suspended officers. However, his account has been contradicted by two of the resigned officers, who stated they resigned because of a lack of legal coverage. One of these officers said \\"many\\" of the 57 resigned officers did not resign to support the two suspended officers. Criminal charges against officers On June 6, officers Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski were charged with second-degree assault, a felony. In a virtual arraignment that day, they pleaded not guilty, and were released that day without bail while awaiting a felony hearing,Meryl Kornfield, Two Buffalo police officers charged with assault for allegedly shoving 75-year-old protester, Washington Post (June 6, 2020). which is set for September 14, 2020. President Trump's response President Donald Trump spread unfounded conspiracy theories regarding the incident, without evidence, on Twitter. There is no evidence that Gugino was an \\"antifa\\" member, that the incident was a setup, that Gugino had fallen \\"harder than he was pushed\\", or that he was attempting to \\"scan\\" police devices. Mobile phone technology cannot \\"black out\\" police equipment in the manner Trump described. Governor Cuomo sharply criticized the president during his daily news briefing, saying if Trump \\"ever feels a moment of decency, he should apologize for that tweet. Because it is wholly unacceptable.\\" When asked to comment on Trump's tweet, Gugino responded via text: \\"Black Lives Matter\\". Gugino's lawyer described Trump's tweet as \\"dark, dangerous and untrue\\". The source to which Trump referred, the One America News Network, is a conservative-centric news channel. The journalist behind OANN's story, Kristian Rouz, also works for Sputnik News, a Russian news agency frequently described as a propaganda outlet. In his work for OANN, Rouz has spread conspiracy theories and displayed favorable stances towards the Russian government. Rouz himself did not provide any evidence, only referring to a report by the Conservative Treehouse, a right-wing blog. The blog post, written by someone going by the pseudonym \\"Sundance\\", claimed without evidence that Gugino is a \\"professional agitator and Antifa provocateur\\". It is not known who runs the blog. On June 13, protesters in San Diego gathered outside OANN headquarters where CEO and founder Robert Herring Sr. asked the crowd to prove the story was false.

She co-founded the Bagdam Caf√©e in Toulouse. This cafe is credited with moving the focus of French lesbian culture south. It closed after ten years but its virtual self continues today.  Life  Julien was born in Rabat in Morocco in 1945. Her family were from Beauce. Her brother, who was eleven years older than her, was a non- commissioned officer during the Algerian war. She boarded at the Dreux college and Chartres high school. She discovered she was attracted to women and she punished twice for misconduct. She met Brigette Boucheron in Poitiers. In about 1987 she was one of four partners who formed a successful consulting company for publishers. In 1988 she and Brigitte Boucheron opened the Bagdam Caf√©e in Toulouse. This cafe is credited with moving the focus of French lesbian culture south, although Julien acknowledged that Toulouse had embraced the women's movement. She and Boucheron had been activists about ten years before but they had given up campaigning as it held no pleasure for them. Their cafe creation was targeted at pleasure as well as politics. This strictly women only cafe was part of a larger movement where lesbians were making themselves visible in society. Julien saw the cafe as a way of establishing a \\"new order\\". The cafe only allowed women inside but it did not specify their sexual orientation. Nevertheless the cafe was the focus for lesbian culture in the area of France known as the midi pyrenee attracting 8,000 visits during its existence. In 1995 alone it had dozens of events from seminars to films and it collected money for lesbian based legal battles. In 1997 the cafe had 400 women members. The Bagdam Caf√©e closed on 1 January 1999 but its name continued in the Bagdam Espace Lesbien. This was more than a web presence, although that was part of it. The organisation published books, organised an annual festival named \\"Lesbian Spring\\", created other events as well as contesting legal events and organising protests. Nicknames that Toulouse has gathered include the \\"Pink City\\" and \\"Lesbopolis.\\" Julienne has created films and her first short film \\"Yes, I am single!\\" won a prize in Rome. Her film Time Bomb was filmed in Toulouse because it is known as the lesbian city. The central characters of the film are a lesbian couple and she was able to find 100 extras from the lesbian community to make up crowd scenes. In 2020 the Lesbian Spring Festival was scheduled. Julien was featured in the press noting that this was the first time that the town hall had publicised the event.

She studied at the Bromley School of Art between 1940 and 1944 and then at the Royal College of Art in London for a further two years. After graduating she taught at the Harrow School of Art for two years and then at the Kingston School of Art until 1950. After a career break, Borlase returned to art in 1967, creating landscapes of Venice and, later, of Carperby in north Yorkshire where the family had a cottage from 1981. She was commissioned for six paintings by St Luke's Hospital in Bradford. As well as painting Borlase took up print making after taking a course at Morley College in 1977 and in the 1990s began experimentating with computer graphics and also with decorating furnature. Borlase was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy in London and in group shows. She had a solo show at the David Thompson Gallery in 1979 and exhibited on a regular basis at the Broughton House Gallery in Cambridge from 1989. Later she regularly showed new work with the Zillah Bell Gallery in Thirsk. While a student at the Royal College of Art, Borlase met, and later married, the artist Frederick Brill, (1920‚Äì1984), who became the principal of the Chelsea Art School.

It was first published in 1970 by Atheneum, New York.  Plot summary  Peter Ringkoping has caused a stir within his family. Owner of a second hand bookstore, the ageing author has slowly receded from relationships with his relatives, preferring instead the company of the ghost-like figures of dead authors, who have composed the books that he sells on to his customers. A constant source of worry for his long-suffering wife, Alice, Peter‚Äôs whimsical nature becomes a cause for concern to his sons also, with his announcement that he intends to bequeath ‚ÄòShangri-La‚Äô, ‚Äòa sizeable tract of land‚ÄôBrown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 163. . OCLC 255278233. on Tinmouth Mountain, to an old friend, Hans Strasser. The warden of a community for people with intellectual and emotional disabilities, Strasser hopes to make use of the land to further care for those in his care. Worried that their father has either lost his mind or that he might be a victim of fraud, and frustrated at the prospect of losing part of their inheritance, Peter‚Äôs family protest the arrangement. Unmoved by their opposition, the elderly storekeeper decides to make the journey to Strasser‚Äôs community before signing the deed papers. Frustrated by his stubbornness, Peter‚Äôs sons, Nels and Tommy decide to accompany him, bringing along with them Tommy‚Äôs own son, Tip. At nineteen- years-old, Tip is still struggling with the problems of adolescence, and his search for his own identity has reached a crisis point, in his inability to divulge his love for a girl, Libba Vann. Throughout the journey, Tip writes a long letter to her that he will never send, in which he pours out his fears and hopes, and his general sense of disorientation. His father, Tommy, will also go on his own journey, as he begins to shed the immaturity that he has carried with him into middle-age, grappling with, and finally accepting, the inevitability of his own death, and accepting the realisation that he has to gainfully shoulder his responsibilities. At the very centre of the group‚Äôs fraught journey, however, is the internal struggle of Nels, the eldest of Peter‚Äôs sons. A successful man, Nels has risen to become the headmaster of the Putnam preparatory school for boys. Rigidly obsessed with the importance of regulations and systems, Nels struggles to decide the fate of one of the boys, who has been caught taking advantage of some prescription drugs. Facing pressure from several members of staff, all of whom advise leniency, the situation is made even more complex by the news that the boy has committed suicide. Like Tommy, Nels is engaged in a struggle with the reality of his own mortality, and the tragedy of the death of one of his students brings him out of his neurotic obsession over the health of his heart and into deeper reflections. The group‚Äôs physical journey ends upon their arrival at Strasser‚Äôs community. As the ageing Austrian takes them on a tour around the village he keeps watch over, he imparts a great deal of wisdom to each of the characters, inquiring after their lives and struggles, and speaking of the simple innocence of many of those that live in the community. Their internal pilgrimages, though greatly advanced by their journey together, are only just beginning, as is the restoration of their respective relationships with one another.  Characters  * Peter Ringkoping: the elderly owner of a second hand bookstore, located on a sleepy mountainside in Vermont. In Now and Then Buechner writes that Peter ‚Äòsees the ghosts of dead writers whose books he sells, sees glimpses of a shimmering reality within reality, and in the process, loses touch with his family‚Äô (p.81).Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 81. . Critic Dale Brown writes that Peter ‚Äòsearches for meaning behind the appearances of things‚Äô, and is ‚Äòa believer in the possibility of mystical visions‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 162-3. . OCLC 255278233. * Nels Ringkoping: the eldest of Peter‚Äôs children, Nels is a bachelor, and the headmaster of a boys‚Äô preparatory school. His stubbornness and rigidity are compounded by his ever- present fear of having a heart attack, and his subsequent obsession over his own health. Buechner characterises Nels as the ‚Äòcowardly lion‚Äô of The Wizard of Oz.Buechner, Frederick (1970). The Alphabet of Grace. New York: Walker and Company. p. 106\\\\. . * Tommy Ringkoping: the clownish younger brother, Tommy battles with the sense of his own lost potential, and, in similarity with Nels, with the fearful realisation of his own mortality. These preoccupations lead Tommy to live a shallow life, heavily punctuated by practical jokes and puns, which he plays on those around him, including his wife and son. Buechner describes him as the ‚ÄòScarecrow who lacks a brain‚Äô. * Tip Ringkoping: the nineteen-year-old son of Tommy, Tip is characterised by Buechner as ‚Äòthe child who wants to go home but does not know where home is‚Äô.Buechner, Frederick (1970). The Alphabet of Grace. New York: Walker and Company. p. 106\\\\. . Struggling in the throes of late adolescence, Tip is beset by worries and lost in the search for his own identity. Unable to reach out to the girl he loves, and unable to understand his own motivations and place in the world, Tip observes the adults around him for a clue as to how one might move through existence; Dale Brown writes: ‚ÄòTip is straining to figure out what the older folks are thinking, trying to see into himself, bewildered and aware mostly of absence and misunderstanding for more of the novel‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 166. . OCLC 255278233. * Hans Strasser: Strasser is the aging warden of a community populated by people with intellectual and emotional disabilities. His wisdom, a unique perspective upon life brought about through his service to those that live in his village, becomes a source of direction and clarification for the other characters, who are all grappling with the meaning of their own existences. He is, in the words of Buechner, ‚Äòthe Wizard‚Äô, and ‚Äòit is in their relationship to him‚Äô that all of the characters ‚Äòmove at least a step closer to what is missing in themselves‚Äô.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 60. .  Themes  Buechner reflects on the themes that run through The Entrance to Porlock in his autobiographical work, Now and Then (1983). Concerning the title he chose for the novel, he writes that it is a 'reference to the visitor from Porlock who woke Coleridge out of the visionary trance of Kubla Khan.' He goes on to suggest that the central theme of the novel is 'the tension between everyday reality and the reality of dreams, of imagination'.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 81. . Buechner further reveals that the plot is ‚Äòloosely based on The Wizard of Oz, with ‚Äòan old man‚Ä¶in search of a heart‚Äô who ‚Äòloses touch with his family‚Äô: > One son, a pathetic failure and compulsive joker, is the Scarecrow in search > of a brain. Another son, the bullying and hypochondriacal dean of a school > like Exeter who fantasizes continually about receiving the farewell visits > of friends as he lies dying in a hospital, is the Cowardly Lion in search of > courage. And there is a grandson ‚Äì confused, introverted, adolescent ‚Äì who, > like Dorothy, is in search of home, if only a home inside himself. The > Wizard is an Austrian who runs a community for the mentally and emotionally > disturbed, and it is in their relationship to him that they all move at > least a step closer to finding what is missing in themselves.Buechner, > Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: > HarperCollins. p. 81. . With its explorations into the inner lives of each of its characters, the novel is emblematic of the dream-like quality that would become one of the hallmarks of the Buechnerian style. Subtly psychological, The Entrance to Porlock is concerned with writing itself, and with the creation of character, as much as the characters‚Äô own discoveries of the truth about themselves. Suicide also returns as a theme central to the novel, as do developing theological preoccupations. In addition to the ‚Äòsearch for identity‚ÄôBrown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 162. . OCLC 255278233. Dale Brown writes that ‚ÄòBuechner weaves into The Entrance to Porlock themes related to his growing theological vocabulary ‚Äì loss of innocence, the attainment of full humanity, and the presence of grace‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 168. . OCLC 255278233. Additionally, he notes that the novel is a continuation of ‚Äòthe big idea that runs like a steady current through his career ‚Äì the possibility of joy in the midst of puzzling reality.‚ÄôBrown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 154. . OCLC 255278233.  Composition  The Entrance to Porlock was the first novel composed by Buechner while in full residence at his family home in Vermont. Having left his teaching post at Exeter, the author began his fifth novel in the midst of several difficulties. In Now and Then, he writes that the process of writing was paralysing: 'I was not just a man writing a book, but a man watching a man writing a book and at the same time continually asking himself whether it was a book worth writing.' The writing process was also affected by broader national events: 'To make matters still worse,' he continues, 'that was the year when both Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were murdered, and I remember wondering if there was anything the world needed much less to have added to its pain than another book.'Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 79-80. . It was during the process of writing The Entrance to Porlock that Buechner was invited by Charles P. Price to give the William Belden Noble Lectures at Harvard. In Now and Then Buechner writes, > If Harvard had invited me to come pick up gum wrappers with a pointed stick, > I suppose I would have been flattered, and though I'd never heard of the > Noble Lectures, the men who had given them in earlier years were a group to > conjure with ‚Äì Teddy Roosevelt, for some reason that was never made clear to > me, had been the first, but from then on they had been people like H. > Richard Niebuhr and George Buttrick, and even Paul Tillich had accepted the > assignment but died before the time came round. Since I was hardly a > theologian myself, let alone in anything remotely resembling the league of > the others as I wrote Price, what could I possibly lecture about if I > decided to risk lecturing at all? Perhaps something in the area of ‚Äúreligion > and letters,\\" he wrote back, and it was the word letters that did > it.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San > Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 85-86. . Buechner delivered the Noble Lectures in the Memorial Church of Harvard University during the winter of 1969. These lectures were published in the same year as The Entrance to Porlock with the title The Alphabet of Grace (1970).  Critical reception  Buechner‚Äôs fifth novel was generally well received by critics and literary academics. Writing in the Christian Science Monitor, Diana Loercher roundly praised The Entrance to Porlock: > There appears every now and again a lyrical, dreamlike novel that is more > poem than prose, more parable than story. Such novels incapacitate > conventional critical faculties; we do not understand and evaluate them > rationally but rather are immersed, lulled, and transported, as in listening > to music, into a shadowy world where feelings are evoked and nothing is > explained. The Entrance to Porlock is that kind of novel. One is not sure > after reading it whether one has read or imagined it. The contradictory > sense of time contributes to this blurred impression. The entire novel takes > place within 24 hours, but the movement in the characters' minds back and > forth in time and the spiritual distance they travel makes the actual time > span seem immeasurable. In her 1988 study, Frederick Buechner: novelist of the lost and found, Marjorie Casebier McCoy claims that the novel ‚Äòdisplay[s] the virtuoso talent‚Äô of Buechner‚Äôs earlier work. McCoy is especially appreciative of the intertextuality of The Entrance to Porlock, noting that its ‚Äòartful retelling of The Wizard of Oz‚Äô is ‚Äòrelated with compelling warmth and engaging fantasy‚Äô. Though quick to assert that the novel is ‚Äònot a copy of The Wizard of Oz‚Äô, but rather ‚Äòa powerful story in its own right‚Äô,Casebier-McCoy, Marjorie (1988). Frederick Buechner: novelist of the lost and found. New York: Harpercollins. p. 68\\\\. . the critic admires the author‚Äôs use of its themes: ‚Äòin Buechner‚Äôs hands‚Äô, she writes, ‚ÄòThe Wizard of Oz becomes a metaphor for the whole of human life‚Äô.Casebier-McCoy, Marjorie (1988). Frederick Buechner: novelist of the lost and found. New York: Harpercollins. p. 34\\\\. . Amos N. Wilder, the Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard Divinity School, was similarly laudatory, writing that in the novel ‚ÄòBuechner again shows his unique talent for making wonders real and the real wonderful.‚ÄôWilder, Amos N. Review of The Entrance to Porlock, by Frederick Buechner, New York: Atheneum, 1970. (See inside flap for review). In his review of The Entrance to Porlock, published in Southwest Review, Rudolph Nelson notices that the novel ‚Äòincluded no mention whatever of explicitly religious ideas or experiences‚Äô.Rudolph L. Nelson, ‚ÄòThe Doors of Perception: mystical experience in Buechner‚Äôs fiction‚Äô, Southwest Review, Summer 1983, p.270, quoted in Brown, p.155 Despite this, he concludes that ‚Äòthe concerns are still no less ultimate, however nonreligious the language‚Äô. Critic Dale Brown concurs with this view, suggesting that it ‚Äòis another way of exploring the possibilities of grace, the truth of fairy tale‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 171. . OCLC 255278233. Brown continues: ‚Äòwith his fifth novel, Buechner nonetheless reiterates his belief that reality, though puzzling and difficult, is fraught with meaning‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 172. . OCLC 255278233. Concerning the novel‚Äôs theological content, critic James Woelfel writes in Theology Today: 'In Porlock as in the earlier novels, Buechner paints on a small canvas, exploring the personal hungerings for meaning and love and the complex and fragile relationships among a small group of people bound together by ties of family and friendship.‚ÄôJames Woelfel, ‚ÄòFrederick Buechner: the novelist as theologian‚Äô, Theology Today, 40 (October, 1983), pp.273-91, p.285, quoted in Brown, p.171  References  Category:1970 American novels Category:American Christian novels ","title":"The Entrance to Porlock"},{"id":"64194953","text":"Major-General Sir Steuart Welwood Hare, (September 1867 ‚Äì October 1952) was a British Army officer.

Along with Martin D'Arcy, he was one of England‚Äôs foremost Catholics of the first half of the 20th century, and was a correspondent of figures including Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, and Ronald Knox. Background and education Cyril Martindale was born on the 25th May 1879 in Bayswater, London to Arthur Martindale and Marion McKenzie. As a boy at Harrow School, he converted to Roman Catholicism from the Church of England. He entered the Society of Jesus on the 7th September 1897, beginning his novitiate at Manresa House in Roehampton before transferring to Aix-en-Provence, France due to ill health (a recurring theme throughout his career). After his novitiate he began Philosophy studies at St Mary‚Äôs Hall, Stonyhurst and later moved on to Pope‚Äôs Hall (later Campion Hall) Oxford where he won multiple academic prizes, among them the Gaisford Prize (Greek verse) and the Chancellor‚Äôs Prize (Latin verse). Career and legacy After spending his regency teaching for three years at Stonyhurst and Roehampton, Martindale undertook his theological studies at St Beuno‚Äôs but was moved at the end of his second year to Ore Place, Hastings (home of the exiled French Jesuits), being there ordained in 1911. Following his ordination Martindale returned to Oxford University for a position in the sub-faculty of Litterae Humaniores. According to Evelyn Waugh, he \\"dazzled and stimulated the most various undergraduates by his restless zeal, incisive diction, and by his modernity...[he] was loaded with academic distinctions, but he held aloof from High Tables.\\"Waugh 1959, p. 278. He was likewise notable for his contributions as a champion of the Faith in debates in the Oxford Union.Waugh 1959, p. 296. In 1926, he was appointed by the Jesuit Provincial to organise the English Province‚Äôs celebrations for the bi- centenary of Saints Aloysius and Stanislaus‚Äô canonisations. In 1927, he departed Oxford to take a position at Farm Street Church, but continued a busy career of travel and writing. In 1928 he made a trip to Australia and New Zealand to participate in the International Eucharistic Congress at Sydney, in the course of which he was involved car accident thereafter suffering from persistent headaches throughout his life. During the inter-war period and after, he was a member of the committee supervising Ronald Knox's translation of the Bible from the Latin Vulgate.Waugh 1959, p. 375-378. Martindale was in Denmark at the outbreak of the Second World War,Waugh 1959, p. 380. and was held as a German detainee in Copenhagen until its end, during which he ‚Äúhad the happiness of receiving a certain number of people into the Church.‚Äù In the years following the Second World War, Martindale made two visits to Portugal, during which he conducted extensive research into the Miracle of F√°tima, and published The Message of Fatima in 1950.

The battery originated as a Missouri State Guard unit active in late 1861, and was officially transferred to the Confederate States Army on January 28, 1862. The battery provided artillery support at the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862, and was lightly engaged at the Battle of Iuka in September. In October 1862, the battery was lightly engaged at the Second Battle of Corinth and saw action at the Battle of Davis Bridge, where it lost at least one cannon. The 3rd Light Battery saw action at the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, 1863, and had its cannons captured at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge the next day. After participating in the Siege of Vicksburg, the battery was captured on July 4, 1863 and was paroled and exchanged. The battery was then consolidated with the Jackson Missouri Battery; the 3rd Light Battery designation was continued. In early 1864, the battery received replacement cannons and was assigned to the defense of Mobile Bay. The 3rd Light Battery saw action at the Battle of Spanish Fort in March and April 1865. When the Confederate Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana surrendered on May 4, 1865, the battery was again captured; the men of the battery were paroled on May 10, ending their military service. Organization Beginning on October 6, 1861, men of the Missouri State Guard were recruited to join an artillery battery that was being formed near Osceola, Missouri. Many of the men who joined the battery originated from the St. Louis, Missouri area, leading to the battery's informal name of the St. Louis Artillery. The battery was equipped with three 6-pounder smoothbore cannons and joined the 7th Division of the Missouri State Guard on November 1, at Cassville, Missouri. The battery, commanded by Captain Emmett MacDonald, officially transferred from the Missouri State Guard to the Confederate States Army on January 28, 1862, while stationed in Springfield, Missouri. Service history=1862Pea Ridge and First Corinth= Battle of Pea Ridge At the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8, 1862, the battery was assigned to the command of Brigadier General Daniel M. Frost, along with Guibor's Missouri Battery and several units of the Missouri State Guard as part of the Confederate Army of the West. On the first day at Pea Ridge, the battery, along with Wade's Missouri Battery, Guibor's Battery, Clark's Missouri Battery, and a battery commanded by Lieutenant Charles W. Higgins, participated in an artillery duel with the 1st Iowa Battery. Later that day, the battery, as well as Clark's Battery and Higgin's Battery, provided artillery support for a charge made by elements of the Missouri State Guard. The fire from the batteries was described by a Union soldier as a \\"most terrific cannonading\\", but the infantry charge failed. When a Union counterattack broke the Confederate line on March 8, the 3rd Light Battery provided covering fire for the Confederate retreat before falling back as well. The battery's flag was almost left on the field, but MacDonald retrieved it before Union soldiers could capture it. After barely avoiding pursuing Union troops, the battery escaped with the rest of the Army of the West. At Pea Ridge, the battery suffered at least two casualties and fired around seven hundred rounds of ammunition. After Pea Ridge, the battery was assigned another cannon, a 6-pounder captured from Union forces during the battle. After Pea Ridge, the battery was transferred across the Mississippi River to Memphis, Tennessee, and later moved to Corinth, Mississippi. A muster was conducted at the latter location on May 5; the battery's strength at that time was 100 men. As part of Colonel Louis H√©bert's brigade, the battery was engaged during early stages of the Siege of Corinth, and saw action at the Battle of Farmington on May 9. After the evacuation of Corinth, the battery was assigned to various points in northern Mississippi. MacDonald was assigned to the Trans-Mississippi Department to lead cavalry; an election held by the battery elevated William Dawson to battery command on September 10. =Iuka and Second Corinth= At the Battle of Iuka on September 19, the battery was assigned to H√©bert's brigade of Brigadier General Lewis Henry Little's division, which was part of Major General Sterling Price's Army of the West. The battery came under enemy fire at Iuka, suffering one casualty, although it did not have the opportunity to fire its cannons. At the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3 and 4, the battery was in the brigade of Colonel W. Bruce Colbert; H√©bert had been elevated to division command to replace Little, who had been killed at Iuka. A portion of the battery saw light duty at Corinth. On October 5, the battery was engaged at the Battle of Davis Bridge, fending off a Union pursuit as the Confederates retreated from Corinth. The 3rd Missouri Light Battery was positioned in the middle of the Confederate line and attracted heavy Union artillery fire. The battery fired in response, but eventually ran out of ammunition. When a Union infantry charge broke the Confederate line, the battery was unable to withdraw some of their pieces, losing either three or one cannon to capture. After Davis Bridge, the battery was transferred to Holly Springs, Mississippi and then Grenada, Mississippi. 1863 At the Battle of Grand Gulf on April 29, 1863, the battery was stationed at a point away from Fort Wade on the Big Black River. At the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, the battery was in the brigade of Brigadier General Martin E. Green. After fighting at Champion Hill, the battery lost its cannons at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge on May 17; after which it entered the defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi. The battery was present during the Siege of Vicksburg and was captured when the Confederate garrison surrendered on July 4. The 64 surviving men of the battery were paroled and exchanged and reported to Demopolis, Alabama. On October 3, the 3rd Missouri Light Battery was consolidated with the Jackson Missouri Battery and assigned to Brigadier General John C. Moore's brigade. The combined battery was generally treated as a continuation of the 3rd Light Battery. At the Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25, the battery was available, but did not see action; replacement cannons for those lost at Big Black River Bridge had not yet arrived. After Missionary Ridge, the battery was stationed at Meridian, Mississippi and then Mobile, Alabama. 18641865 20-pounder Parrott rifle, similar to those used by the 3rd Missouri Light Battery In February 1864, the battery received replacement cannons in the form of four 20-pounder Parrott rifles. For much of the rest of 1864, the battery guarded a portion of Mobile Bay, at one point firing at a Union Navy gunboat. Captain Dawson died of illness on March 26; Captain Schuyler Lowe, former commander of the Jackson Missouri Battery, replaced Dawson. In March and April 1865, the battery fought at the Battle of Spanish Fort. During the Mobile Campaign, the 3rd Light Battery fired an estimated 700 shots. After the Confederate forces left Mobile, the battery was sent to Meridian, Mississippi, where it remained until Lieutenant General Richard Taylor surrendered the Confederate Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana on May 4, 1865. The men of the battery were paroled on May 10.

The \\"Flemish baker of sugar\\" was paid another ¬£180 for confections and sweet meats for banquets at this time.

The English ambassador Robert Bowes described a particular Scottish form of banqueting to William Cecil, as the details given of a banquet mentioned in a previous letter had puzzled Queen Elizabeth.

Bousie became a favourite of Anna of Denmark, and in April 1592 she asked the council of Edinburgh to make him a burgess and guild brother. This was controversial because Bousie did not meet the town's strict criteria, so the council representatives James Nicoll, Thomas Aikenhead, Clement Cor, George Heriot elder, and George Heriot younger rode to Dalkeith Palace to speak to her about the request.

In January 1594, the town allowed another Flemish craftsman, a clock and watch maker, probably Adrian Bowdowingis, a friend of the painter Adrian Vanson, the right to work in his craft and have a shop, despite not being a burgess or free man of an Edinburgh craft, because he was contracted to regulate the town's clock.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh: 1589-1603 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 107. Bousie worked at the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle in August 1594.

He was paid ¬£184 Scots and his \\"boys\\", his workers, were given ten shillings. Carrying Bousie's glass dishes and other equipment to the Banqueting House cost twelve shillings.

The film comprises observational footage of, and interviews and discussions with, people at night around the notorious Harlem street corner of 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in New York City. Its subjects are predominantly African American, experiencing poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, physical infirmities, and harassment from the police. Production Field Niggas was filmed during the summer of 2014, shot using a handheld camera and available lighting. Khalik Allah served as director, cinematographer, and editor. He recorded the sound of his conversations with people separately to filming them, so the sound is not synchronised with the images. The film also includes surveillance footage of the strangulation of Eric Garner as well as the overdubbed sound of field hollers by a 1950s chain gang. The film's title is derived from \\"Message to the Grass Roots\\", a public speech delivered by human rights activist Malcolm X in 1963, \\"extolling the spirit of rebellion among outdoor slaves.\\" Release and reception Allah released the film for free on YouTube and Vimeo in 2015 for a short time, before removing it at the request of True/False Film Festival so it could be shown there.

In two naval encounters, Korean Admiral Yi Sun-sin's fleet managed to destroy roughly 100 Japanese ships and halted Japanese naval operations along the southern coast. Overview News of the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Hansando reached Busan within hours and two Japanese commanders, Kuki Yoshitaka and Kato Yoshiaki, immediately set sail with 42 ships for the port of Angolpo, where they hoped to face the Korean fleet close to shore. Yi Sun-sin received news of their movements on 16 August and he advanced towards Angolpo to confront them. This time the Japanese were unwilling to follow the Koreans into open water and stayed onshore. They would not take the bait. In response, the Korean fleet moved forwards and bombarded the anchored Japanese fleet for hours until they retreated inland. Later, the Japanese returned and escaped on small boats. Both Kuki Yoshitaka and Kato Yoshiaki survived the battle. Aftermath Won Gyun was left behind to mop up Japanese soldiers marooned on a small isle, but fled after receiving a false report of a large Japanese fleet approaching. The Japanese managed to drift to shore using rafts made from the wreckage of their ships. On 23 August, Hideyoshi Toyotomi ordered naval commander Todo Takatora to reinforce operations in Korea and halted naval operations at Busan. The battles of Hansan Island and Angolpo forced Hideyoshi to give a direct order to his naval commanders to cease all unnecessary naval operations and limit activity to the immediate area around Pusan Harbor. He told his commanders that he would come to Korea personally to lead the naval forces himself, but Hideyoshi was never able to carry through on this as his health was deteriorating rapidly. This meant that all the fighting would be in Korea, not China, and that Pyongyang would be the furthest northwestern advance of the Japanese armies (to be sure, Kat≈ç Kiyomasa's second contingent's brief march into Manchuria was Japan's northernmost advance, however, Manchuria was not a part of Imperial China in the 16th century). While Hideyoshi was unlikely to be able to invade China and conquer a large part of it, the battles of Hansan Island and Angolpo checked his supply routes and hindered his movements in Korea. Hideyoshi's larger war plans, supported in much written documentation, was nearly identical to Imperial Japan's blueprint for conquest in the 20th century.

The work was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1757 - a second autograph version is now in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts in Nantes, the artist's hometown. Art historians argue that both versions are examples of genre painting, inspired by Dutch art. Provenance Previously owned by JBL Boyer de Fonscolombe, in the mid-19th century it was purchased by Ksawery Branicki, who around 1900 took it to Poland, where it was housed at Rose Branicka's home on Nowy ≈öwiat in Warsaw and in Wilan√≥w. In 1926, when the Branicki estate was divided between three heirs, the painting passed to Branickich Reyowej of the Branicki family, who took it to Przec≈Çaw. During World War II, the picture was hidden near Krakow. When the family decided to leave Poland before the Russian invasion, its artworks were moved as part of the 'Sapie≈ºy≈Ñski store' to the Metropolitan Curia's stores in Krakow. In 1952 the state confiscated the works in the 'Sapie≈ºy≈Ñski store' and in 1954 the work was placed in its present home. In 1990, 1997 and 2003, three different heirs of the painting's pre-war owners took legal steps to recover it. Two court hearings were held, one ordering the work to be returned and the second reversing that decision.

An offshoot of the National Liberation Committee (CLN), it was charged with organising resistance and partisan activities throughout Tuscany. It was opposed to the forces of Nazi Germany as well as Nazi Germany's puppet state local regime, the Italian Social Republic, in Tuscany following the German invasion and military occupation of Italy between September 1943 and April 1945. The CTLN became an umbrella organisation for the five main anti-fascist partisan groups operating within Tuscany.  Beginnings  The CTLN formed in October 1943 following the Nazi occupation of Tuscany the previous month. Five anti-fascist groups united under the banner of the CTLN. The largest of these groups was the Italian Communist Party (PCI) followed by the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). CTLN also incorporated Partito d'Azione (PDA), the Christian Democracy (DC), and the Italian Liberal Party (PLI). The group initially met clandestinely in Florence in an artisan workshop in San Frediano and in the offices of local socialist, Natale Dall'Oppio whilst Tuscany remained under occupation. The actions of the CTLN centered around stockpiling weapons, providing food for the local populace, and sabotaging enemy equipment and transport. CTLN activity also focused on passive resistance. This manifested itself in the form of encouraging the populace to slow down work, non-participation in Fascist activities, and distribution of anti-Fascist propaganda. Though not without political differences, the CTLN was able to establish a dense network of committees at provincial, town, and neighborhood levels. Since the fall of Florence in 1943 there was sporadic insurrectionist violence by the CTLN against the occupiers. However, one of the most important forms of resistance was the continued use of the clandestine Radio Cora operated by members of the PDA. Through this, the CTLN was able to feed intelligence reports to the Allied forces as well as direct supply drops into the city from Allied air forces.  Battle of Florence  As the Allied forces headed towards Florence in August 1944, the CTLN began to prepare a general uprising in order to further undermine the fighting capacity of the retreating Axis armies. on 4 August 1944 a general insurrection was announced and the CTLN fought to remove the last pockets of German resistance. At 4am on 5 August 1944 the 6th South African Armoured Division crossed the Ponte Vecchio into Florence and joined up with CTLN resistance fighters. They were closely followed by the New Zealand MƒÅori Battalion and the British 6th Armoured Division. On 11 August 1944, the CTLN issued a city wide proclamation stating: \\"The TUSCAN COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL LIBERATION took over from today, 11 August 7 am, all the powers of provisional government that belong to him as the only representative body of the Tuscan people and by delegation of the democratic government of free Italy. CTLN forces have occupied the city since this morning and, siding in his defense, fight against the Germans, the fascists and the snipers. All citizens must contribute with all their strength to the liberation of the city, give all the moral and material help to our courageous patriots. The most serious suffering of the population is about to end with our victory.We salute the victorious allied armies and prepare to welcome them with the fraternity we feel for all the comrades in arms who fight for the same cause.Let us gain the right to be a free people by fighting and falling for freedom.\\" German forces utilised snipers during the Battle of Florence to target CNLT fighters in an attempt to demoralise them. The city of Florence was finally liberated on 16 August 1944 and effective control of the city was handed over to the Allies by the CNLT. Pockets of fighting continued in the city until 1 September 1944, when the last remnants of the Fascist occupiers were driven from Florence. CNLT forces suffered approximately 600 casualties liberating Florence, with 205 dead and over 400 injured.  Post liberation  The Allied forces found Florence in the hands of an almost fully functioning government in the form of the CNLT. Following the removal of the Fascist forces from Tuscany, the CNLT worked to provide material assistance to the population, assist in the reconstruction process, collaborate with the first town councils established by the CLN, provide help in maintaining public order, and participate in the removal of the remnants of Fascism from the local administrations. Yet the role of the CNLT in post-occupation Tuscany was unclear. Some within the organisation began to lobby for the right of provincial committees to appoint the prefects, and of communal committees to appoint communal councils, police chiefs, and other local officials. In November 1944 a delegation of the CNLT , headed by the leader of the PDA, traveled to Rome to demand clarification of their position. The CNLT delegation met with Prime Minister Ivanoe Bonomi, who concluded that as the Italian government was back in control of most of Italy, the purpose of the CNLT and CLN had been completed and were therefore no longer required by the nation. By early May 1945, the Allies had effective control over the whole of Italy. In exchange for 1000 lira and a merit certificate, partisans were encouraged to hand their weapons in and the end of parades in which they were publicly thanked for their efforts.By June 1945 the power of the CNLT had been reduced drastically. The CNLT was dissolved on 26 June 1946 following the 1946 Italian general election.  Symbolism  Throughout the duration of its life, the CNLT adopted the symbol of a Pegasus emblazoned on top of the flag of Italy. The Pegasus had long been associated with Tuscany, and with the Pegasus' connotations of peace and the triumph of good over evil, made it an obvious symbol for adoption by the CNLT.  Legacy  The current flag of Tuscany features a Pegasus in recognition of the CNLT. Numerous monuments, sculptures, and memorials have been built throughout Tuscany in recognition of the efforts and sacrifices made by the CNLT. Tuscany celebrates 'Liberation Day' on 25 April every year to celebrate and remember the lives lost in the fight to free the region.

Apartment is Wayne's 4th book. The story is set in 1996, and follows the relationship of two young men living in an apartment together while enrolled in Columbia University's M.F.A. writing program. The novel explores themes of masculinity, class, privilege, and loneliness. The unnamed narrator is a New York University graduate, who is living in his great aunt's two-bedroom rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan, after she has moved to New Jersey. The narrator meets Billy, a working class young man from a small town in Illinois, who is living in a basement storage room. The narrator offers Billy to live with him in the apartment rent-free, and in exchange Billy will clean the apartment and cook for the two of them. While the narrator's education exceeds his talent, the reverse is true for Billy, a fact recognized by both themselves and their classmates. While at first the relationship between the narrator and Billy is warm and symbiotic, midway through the book an accident quickly divides them, and finally an act of sabotage ends their relationship. Apartment is a New York Times Editors' Choice, longlisted for the 2020 Simpson/Joyce Carol Oates Literary Prize, and one of Vogue.com‚Äôs \\"Best Books of 2020 So Far\\". Plot=1996 The novel opens in August 1996 in New York City, where the narrator is enrolled in the Columbia University's prestigious Master of Fine Arts Writing program, and lives in a two-bedroom in Stuyvesant Town on the east side in Manhattan. The apartment is especially desirable because it's rent- stabilized, whereas most rents in Manhattan are exceedingly high. The narrator is however subletting illegally in the apartment, since the lease is under his great aunt's name, who has since moved to New Jersey. During a writing workshop, the professor and other students criticize the narrator's writing, but one student, Billy Campbell, defends him. The narrator later meets Billy at a bar, and learns he is from a poor family, working as a bartender to make ends meet, and living in a storage room basement. The narrator offers his spare room at the apartment to Billy in exchange for Billy cooking a few nights a week. In addition, Billy agrees to clean the apartment once a week. With minor disagreements, the narrator and Billy's relationship is warm at first. The narrator greatly admires Billy's writing talent, charisma, handsomeness, and success with women. In December, the narrator and Billy take ecstasy with 2 women. The narrator accidentally touches Billy in a sexual manner, and Billy abruptly leaves. After this experience, Billy becomes cold and distant toward the narrator. 1997 During the next semester, another professor praises Billy's work while criticizing the narrator's. That night at the apartment, Billy hints that the narrator's writing is more \\"accountant- like\\" than \\"artist\\". The MFA students receive a letter that a $7000 stipend is available for a rising second-year student, and applications need to submit a writing sample to apply. The narrator learns Billy plans to apply, and will presumably be able to move out of their shared apartment if he wins. Billy begins to spend more time with other friends, and less with the narrator. The resentment between the two becomes more apparent. After feeling economically used by Billy, the narrator asks Billy to clean the bathroom. At a Super Bowl party, Billy mocks the narrator for never having a \\"real job\\" in front of several people. That night the narrator returns to the apartment, and dumps Billy's file cabinet and computer into the East River to prevent Billy from winning the stipend. To cover his tracks, the narrator tries to make the situation look like a burglary. Billy returns to apartment shocked to find his computer and file cabinet missing, and convinces the reluctant narrator to file a claim through his great aunt's renter's insurance. The insurance company requires the police to be contacted in order to process the claim. The two agree that Billy will talk to the police alone. After the semester concludes, the narrator receives a letter from his landlord ordering him to vacate the apartment since he is in violation of the lease for illegal subletting. Billy states that he admitted to the police he was living there illegally after being accused of falsely reporting an insurance claim. Billy tells the narrator he knows he staged the burglary to sabotage him, and that he plans to move out to live with two other classmates. While the narrator is not charged criminally, the insurance company finds out and penalizes him thousands of dollars. As a result, the narrator's father stops paying his tuition. The narrator decides to drop out of school, move into another apartment with 3 other roommates, and work as a freelance copy editor. After The narrator is eventually is hired on full-time. Believing he will never be an author, he declines to reenroll at Columbia. He is later promoted to copy chief of the magazine, but lives a life of solitude. Billy becomes a midlist author and a professor at an Idaho university. He lives with his wife and children.  Characters = Major  *Narrator: An unnamed young, upper-middle-class man, graduate of New York University who is pursuing an MFA degree at Columbia University. His novel, The Copy Chief, is about a copy editor who spends his days doing monotonous work, but secretly possesses a great talent for writing. While he is well-educated and financially comfortable, he lacks writing talent and is socially awkward. *Billy Campbell: Like the narrator, Billy is also a young man pursuing an MFA degree at Columbia. Unlike the narrator, Billy doesn't have a 4-year degree and is struggling financially. Born into a working-class family in a small, impoverished town in Illinois, Billy's father left when he was very young. To make ends meet, Billy frequently works at a bar called The Eagle's Nest. His novel, No Man's Land is about an underemployed man living in the Rust Belt. Also unlike the narrator, Billy's writing receives considerable praise from his classmates and professors. Politically, Billy is more conservative than the narrator. Lastly, Billy is charismatic, whereas the narrator is socially awkward.  Minor  *Narrator's great aunt: the lease holder of the rent- stabilized apartment where the narrator stays. She has moved to New Jersey, but she has agreed to let the narrator illegally occupy the apartment. In 12 months, she will legally transfer the lease to him and the narrator can legally reside there. *Sylvia Hellman: a professor at Columbia University. She is leader of the fiction workshop class of which Billy and the Narrator are enrolled in the first semester. She is well-respected by the students and advises them \\"[not to] play it safe and hold back [but rather] experiment [and] open yourself up to brutally honest feedback\\". She criticizes the narrator's writing as \\"facile and predictable\\". *David Lankford: a college friend of the narrator who now works for a publishing house. He gets the narrator and Billy onto the guest list of a literary magazine party. Later, the narrator sends Billy's novel to him, who impressed, forwards it to a book agent. *Robert Stockton: a professor at Columbia university. A Vietnam veteran and former high school football player, he has had modest success as a writer. Both the narrator and Billy are enrolled in his class in the second semester. Like Sylvia and other students, he criticizes the narrator's writing and praises Billy's. *Jim: An older man the narrator and Billy meet in the bar. He had only 1 mildly successful play run off-Broadway in 1965. Having long ago abandoned playwriting, he got a job in life insurance, married, had children, and divorced. He now describes himself as a \\"nowhere man\\". *Claire and Naomi: Both visiting New York from London, the narrator and Billy meets them in a bar. Claire is aspiring author. While at first Billy is unconfident in himself, they later go dancing, go back to the apartment, and Billy ends up sleeping with Naomi. Billy on the other hand has an awkward experience with Claire. *Matt: a classmate of the narrator and Billy. A leader in the graduate student union. As the novel progresses, Billy becomes closer friends with Matt and Adam and more distant from the narrator. *Adam: a classmate of the narrator and Billy. He publishes his novel The Hiker in the prestigious Atlantic Monthly. This contrasts with the narrator whose novel is published in a no-name periodically that the university doesn't even carry. *Oliver: A former classmate of the narrator when he was enrolled at NYU. Oliver and the narrator had several friends in common, but the narrator has lost touch with all of them. *Jessica and Marie: Jessica, a bridesmaid of Billy's cousin, and Marie, her friend, take ecstasy with the narrator and Billy. After turning down the lights and caressing each other, the narrator inadvertently touches Billy instead of Marie, after which Billy abruptly leaves. *Narrator's father: A chemical engineer, he hesitantly finances the narrator's education. He lives with his other family and is emotionally distant from the narrator. *Narrator's mother: Described by Billy as \\"nice\\" and the narrator as \\"meddling\\", she and the narrator's father divorce during the narrator's childhood. Other than financial support, she takes on all parental duties. *Steve: the copy chief of the men's magazine where the narrator freelances. Eventually the narrator is hired on full-time. Years later, Steve leaves for another magazine, and the narrator assumes his job. *Police Officer (Unnamed): After the narrator gets a fraudulent insurance claim filed, the unnamed police officer investigates the \\"break in\\" and questions Billy while the narrator is not present. After accusing Billy of insurance fraud, Billy confesses that he is subletting illegally and convinces the officer not to file charges. However, the officer does inform insurance company of the fraud and the land lord of the illegal subletting. Themes=Class and privilege The narrator notes that the university's \\"extortionate tuition and dearth of fellowship stipends saw to [half the class had obvious socioeconomic advantages]\\". In an interview the author states, \\"it‚Äôs a lot easier to spend eight years writing a first novel or take an unpaid internship when you know that you have an upper-middle-class parachute you can open in an emergency. The irony in Apartment is that the narrator is not only ashamed of his upper- middle-class provenance, but thinks it‚Äôs an artistic detriment, since he has nothing worth writing about, whereas he fetishizes Billy‚Äôs Midwestern working- class authenticity.\\" After mocking the narrator for never having to hold a manual labor job, the narrator observes: \\"How easily he could mock me for my privileges, but I doubted he had ever considered the copious ones he enjoyed, which society didn't catalog as overly...and he was never made to feel guilty for these natural advantages and resources he'd done nothing to earn\\" Fear of failure \\"If masculinity is one theme, the other is fear of failure\\", wrote J. Oliver Conroy in a review. \\"Apartment is about young writers grappling with the possibility that they‚Äôll never make it at all. [But while] Wonder Boys is funny and life-affirming ‚Äî Apartment is dark and deeply sad\\" Loneliness Both the narrator and Billy are only children, and both are raised without fathers present. The narrator notes that after his parent's divorce, \\"I had never longed for a sibling as much as that moment...I just wanted another person to shoulder the pain with me, to go through exactly what I'd have to go through\\". In Billy's novel, No Man's Land, the narrator is divorced, and both his father and son are deceased, a fact that most of the writing workshop class misses during discussion. After a chance meeting with Oliver in the East Village, the narrator realizes that his former friends grown distant from him. One of the narrator's former friends, Peter, is getting married, and the narrator is not only uninvited to the wedding, but didn't even know Peter had a girlfriend. After the narrator confesses his crime to Billy, and Billy asks him why he did it, the narrator responds, \\"I didn't want you to leave me\\". The narrator regrets that Billy is likely the last person he would ever be close to. Years later in 2016, the narrator notes that his own life has become more and more solitary, but solitude \\"isn't so bad once you come to expect it\\". In a bar the narrator and Billy meet Jim, a much older, divorced former playwright whose given up on his dreams, and describes himself as a \\"nobody man\\": \\"I'm out of my time's joint...doesn't have a point of view. No one cares what I have to say anymore\\". Billy assures Jim, \\"You're not a nowhere man. You're still here\\". Twenty years later in 2016, the narrator's final words in the novel are \\"Still here\\". Male bonding Some reviewers have opined that the principal characters aren't friends. Anthony Domestico writes, \\"The narrator thinks he‚Äôs a benevolent friend to Billy; he‚Äôs just as much a vampiric consumer, drinking in his writerly gifts and blue-collar bona fides.\\" Stefan Beck writes, \\"Contra most of the critical response to Apartment, the book absolutely is not 'about male friendship.' It is about a parasitic symbiosis: one party using the other to meet emotional needs, one to meet material needs; one party idealizing the other, one privately loathing the other. To mistake this for friendship is to tell on oneself.\\" Political During an interview, the author states ‚Äú[the 1990s were] the last time I could plausibly bring together a coastal liberal ‚Äî in the form of the narrator ‚Äî and a Heartland economic conservative like Billy and have them be friends...it was the last time that the polarization of the country was not so vast as to permit a connection between these two guys\\". Billy's political differences with the narrator are highlighted during the novel. During the election night of the 1996 US presidential election, Billy surprises the narrator by saying he voted for Bob Dole. Later, he dismisses the idea of sex reassignment surgery and is \\"visibly perturbed by the gay scene on Christopher Street.\\"  Development  The idea for the novel came in February 2017 when the author suddenly realized he never wrote about Stuyvesant Town, a place he lived off and on for 14 years. The author decided choose the 1990s as the setting because he wanted to examine the friendship between 2 men, and wanted to choose a time before the Internet changed social interaction and reduced \\"the intensity of bonds\\". In addition, \\"that was probably the last time that someone from a flyover state (part of conservative America) could plausibly be in an MFA program at Columbia, the last time two guys from the two Americas might be friends in this context. And it was a time when masculinity was very much in flux.\\".

The first series, published between 1895 and 1903, was edited by Commander Charles Napier Robinson. Originally published fortnightly and priced at 6d, its publication was later increased to weekly.

Early Career Frank Emery Nix was borm in Tibshelf, Derbyshire and at the age of 14 became a coal miner at Williamthorpe Colliery. While working down the mine Nix attended Mansfield Technical College and obtained an Overman‚Äôs Certfificate. Having spent time at Tibshelf Botton pit he moved Pilsley Colliery in 1939 becoming a Pit Deputy.http://www.vconline.org.uk/frank-e-nix-em/4589396408 Citation Nix was awarded the Edward Medal for his action after an accident underground: \\"On the 18th April at 4.30 a.m. a \\"Bump\\" occurred at the coal face on which Mr. Ernest Vickers and a workmate were cutting coal with a compressed air machine, as a result of which the flamper over the bars from the left side end of the machine was broken for a distance of 35 yards, the roof lowering about 8 inches. The bar over Mr. Vickers lowered under the weight of the flamper and pinned his head against the edge of the conveyor pans. Mr. Vickers shouted and signalled by knocking on the pans, and his workmate stopped the machine, and, as he was unable to pass the machine to go to Mr. Vickers' assistance, shouted to Mr. Nix and then went round the roadways about 2,500 yards with another man to give what help he could. Mr. Nix had three men with him behind the machine, two of whom slid down the pans and placed a prop in order to take the weight off Mr. Vickers' head. Mr. Nix followed them down but, seeing that nearly all the props within ten yards of the accident were broken, sent them back and himself went along to where Mr. Vickers was trapped. With the aid of the third man Mr. Nix worked his way down the face side, resetting broken props as necessary. By this time the roof had lowered to about 15 inches from the floor, and this was consequently a most difficult job. The setting of about 12 props brought Mr. Nix to a position about three yards from Mr. Vickers, but owing to the fall of earth he was unable to see him. He went back to the machine to ascertain the position and then returned and began to clear away the earth with the assistance of one of the men. After Mr. Vickers was exposed, it became obvious that the only way to liberate him without a further fall was to lighten the bar, and this he did by breaking the flamper with a hammer, working most carefully for fear of a further fall which would have involved not only Mr. Vickers and himself but two of the other men as well. When the bar was sufficiently uncovered, Mr. Nix sawed off the end and liberated Mr. Vickers, who fortunately was suffering only from severe shock and bruises. The whole operation took about two hours during which Mr. Nix was working in a height of about 15 inches under a broken and detached roof, the confined space offering little chance if a further fall had occurred.\\" Nix was awarded the Edward Medal for his bravery. His award was announced in the London Gazette on 21 November 1944. Later life Nix continued to work at Pilsley Colliery until it closed in 1957. He then worked as a Deputy with the National Coal Board, at various pits until his retirement in 1979. He died on 8 August 1996 in Chesterfield.

The Geographic Names Information System ID for Serene Lakes is 254806.  History  Serene Lakes was discovered during the mid-1800s, when the First Transcontinental Railroad was being constructed. The lakes were located along several routes during the California Gold Rush, including the historic California Trail, and the first settler, Fitz William Redding Jr, arrived in 1866. Before the widespread adoption of refrigeration, Serene Lakes served as a source of ice for the city of San Francisco, earning the lakes the name \\"Ice Lakes\\". When author Mark Twain visited the lakes, he named them Lake Dulzura and Lake Serena, which was combined to form \\"Serene Lakes\\".  Recreation  Summer activities at Serene Lakes include fishing, windsurfing, sailing, and paddle-boating. Swimming and watersports are permitted in Lake Dulzura, in order to protect the drinking water derived from Lake Serena. Lake Dulzura contains a public beach, dock, and beach volleyball courts. The lakes are surrounded by several hiking trails, including Castle Pass, Summit Station Trail, and Hoelter Hall Trail. Many of the trails span the mountains around the lake, some leading to mountaintops, such as Lola's Lookout. Winter activities include cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.

She worked for the Institute of Race Relations and became editor of the Race Today journal in 1986. Hassan was also a member of the Black Unity and Freedom Party and the British Black Panthers. She is co-editor of a collection of writings from Race Today published in 2019.  Career  Hassan was a member of the Race Today Collective from its beginning, and eventually became editor of its journal, Race Today, in 1986. She was deputy editor of the journal from 1973, with Darcus Howe as editor. She was a frequent writer for the journal, examining topics ranging from the Black Power movement in the USA to the lives of black women in the UK. During the 1980s she worked alongside Olive Morris running Race Today's \\"Basement Sessions\\" at Railton Road, where art, culture and politics were discussed. The Race Today Collective was led and organised by a number of women, including Hassan, whose influence on its direction needs further recognition (according to Robin Bunce and Paul Field, biographers of her husband). Women involved in the organisation included Alethea Jones- Lecointe, Barbara Beese and Mala Dhondy. In 1984 Hassan organised for the wives of striking coal miners to come to London to tell their stories to the journal. Hassan also campaigned for Arts Council England to recognise the Notting Hill Carnival as an art form. Following the New Cross Fire in January 1981, in which 13 young Black people died, Hassan was co-organiser of the 20,000-person Black People's Day of Action march through London that took place on 2 March and is now described as \\"a turning point in black British identity\\". Hassan became involved in the Black Power movement in the late 1960s. She worked for the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) from 1970, as Information Officer. During her time there she helped to overthrow the IRR's paternalistic organisation, moving it from a conservative to a more radical political stance. This change in the IRR came about through a membership vote, in which Hassan had been instrumental in recruiting more members who sympathised with the proposed new direction of the organisation. She was a member of the Black Unity and Freedom Party before she became involved in the collective. A 2013 exhibition about the British Black Panthers at the Photofusion Gallery in Brixton featured an interview with Hassan Howe. Alongside other former Panthers, she acted as a script advisor for John Ridley's 2017 television series Guerrilla, which examines the movement. In 2019, Hassan Howe co-edited Here to Stay, Here to Fight, a collection of writings from Race Today, published by Pluto Press, which aimed to introduce new audiences to Britain's black radical politics.  Personal life  Leila Ramadhan Hassan was born on 13 June 1948 in Zanzibar; her family were Muslim and she grew up as a devout member of the faith. Hassan was married to the civil rights activist Darcus Howe, who was her predecessor as editor of Race Today.

During her third grade of school, Nolen competed in a school science competition, where she studied the patterns of fish. After winning first place, Nolen told her grandmother that she either wanted to become a brain surgeon or an astronaut. She attended Los Osos high school where she served as class president all four years. Nolen attended Loyola Marymount University where she studied health and human sciences. At LMU she served as the student body president and was involved in voter registration programs. As part of her undergraduate research, Nolen created a diabetes management programme for women at a domestic violence shelter. She was the first member of her family to earn a bachelor's degree in science. Nolen was made a Fulbright scholar in 2017, and moved to A Coru√±a where she worked in public health. Her research involved understanding how Spanish people understood obesity. On her return, Nolen joined the AmeriCorps programme as a health coach at the Heartland Innovation Centre in Chicago. Here she led initiatives to improve clinic accessibility and improve awareness of health programmes. She started her medical degree at Harvard Medical School in 2019. That year, Nolen became the first Black woman to be elected class president of the Harvard Medical School. Under her guidance, the medical school took part in more outreach programmes and recognised the work of non- academic members of the community. She is an activist for racial equality, and has spoken about the healthcare inequality experienced by Black people in the United States. In 2020 Nolen was selected by The Root as one of their Young Futurists.

Its salts are called peroxymonophosphates. It is one of two known peroxyphosphoric acids, along with peroxydiphosphoric acid.  History  Both peroxyphosphoric acids were first synthesized and characterized in 1910 by Julius Schmidlin and Paul Massini via the reaction between phosphorus pentoxide and highly-concentrated aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide. However, this reaction proceeds very vigorously and is difficult to control. Aside from phosphorus pentoxide, syntheses from metaphosphoric acid and diphosphoric acid were also reported. : P2O5 + 2H2O2 + H2O -> 2H3PO5 : H4P4O12 + 4H2O2 -> 4H3PO5 : H4P2O7 + H2O2 -> H3PO5 + H3PO4 A less vigorous method of preparing peroxyphosphoric acid by introducing the inert solvent acetonitrile was described by Gerrit Toennies in 1937. This method was shown to be unsuitable in diethyl ether or isoamyl alcohol.  Preparation  The most widely used method of preparation is the hydrolysis of potassium of lithium peroxydiphosphate in a strong acid such as perchloric acid. The peroxydiphosphate salts can be obtained by electrolysis of their respective phosphate salts. :P2O8^4- + H2O ->[\\\\atop\\\\ce{HClO_4}] {H3PO5} + H3PO4 It can be obtained from the reaction between phosphorus pentoxide and highly-concentrated hydrogen peroxide within an inert solvent like acetonitrile or carbon tetrachloride. : P4O10 + 4H2O2 + 2H2O -> 4H3PO5 It is also obtained as a mixture with peroxydiphosphoric acid when phosphoric acid is treated with fluorine. The compound is not commercially available and must be prepared as needed.  Properties  The structure of H3PO5, displaying the intramolecular hydrogen bond Peroxymonophosphoric acid is a colorless, viscous liquid. It is stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond. The compound is a triprotic acid with acid dissociation constants pKa1 = 1.1, pKa2 = 5.5 and pKa3 = 12.8. In aqueous solutions it slowly undergoes hydrolysis to hydrogen peroxide and phosphoric acid. : H3PO5 + H2O -> H3PO4 + H2O2 With excess water, the hydrolysis can be considered pseudo-first order. The half-life for this decomposition is dependent on the pH and temperature, being about 31 hours at 35 ¬∞C and 2.5 hours at 61 ¬∞C. A solution in acetonitrile also slowly degrades, losing 30% of active oxygen after 26 days of storage at 5 ¬∞C. Relatively stable salts can be obtained by neutralization with bases, for example with potassium hydroxide to give the hygroscopic potassium dihydrogenperoxymonophosphate KH2PO5.  Uses  Peroxymonophosphoric acid is used in organic synthesis as an electrophilic reagent for the oxidation of alkenes, alkynes, aromatic compounds and amines. Due to the strongly acidic nature, only relatively acid-stable epoxides can be prepared from alkenes, for example trans-stilbene oxide from trans-stilbene. Less stable epoxides are cleaved or react further; cyclohexene, styrene or Œ±-methylstyrene yield no isolable epoxides. In the cases of styrene and Œ±-methylstyrene, acid-catalyzed alkyl migrations lead instead to the main products phenylacetic acid and 2-phenylpropionic acid, respectively. 400x400px The oxidation of diphenylacetylene at room temperature yields benzil, presumably through an oxirene intermediate. 400x400px Peroxymonophosphoric acid is an effective reagent for the hydroxylation of aromatic rings. The conversion of mesitylene to mesitol can be achieved at room temperature in less than four hours. 329x329px The compound can be used as an effective oxidizing agent for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Substituted acetophenones can be converted to the corresponding phenyl acetates at 30 ¬∞C in high yields. The rate is about 100 times higher in comparison to using peroxybenzoic acid. 367x367px Tertiary aromatic amines like dimethylaniline are oxidized to the corresponding amine oxide. 280x280px Oxidation of THF with peroxymonophosphoric acid gives Œ≥-butyrolactone.

It is situated southwest of Barlow Pass along the Mountain Loop Highway near the Monte Cristo area. It is set on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The nearest higher neighbor is Sperry Peak, to the northwest. Precipitation runoff from the south side of the mountain drains into the Sultan River, and the north side drains into headwaters of the Stillaguamish River. July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing this mountain. Climate Morning Star Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is east-northeast of Morning Star Peak, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The film starred Sydney Booth with Herbert Prior, James Gordon, Charles Ogle, and Laura Sawyer in supporting roles. Plot This film is described in 1911 trade publications as \\"a powerful historical drama\\" of the famous battle off the coast of Spain, at Cape Trafalgar, on October 21, 1805. The motion picture's opening scenes, according to plot descriptions in those publications, portrayed Lord Nelson (Sydney Booth) at the Board of Admiralty in London in the weeks prior to the conflict. There he reveals his \\"wonderful plan of attack\\" against the French fleet, which was supported by warships of its Spanish ally.\\"'The Battle of Trafalgar' (Sept. 22)\\", The Moving Picture World (New York, N.Y.), September 16, 1911, p. 822.

After discussing the daring plan, Nelson and his fellow officers raise their drinking glasses and toast King George III and to Britain's success in defeating the naval forces of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. The photoplay then shifted to scenes at sea aboard , Nelson's flagship. It is the day before the battle and officers are writing letters, perhaps their final messages, to their families and sweethearts. Lieutenant Prescott (Herbert Prior) is shown writing his fianc√©e (Laura Sawyer), who appears as a vision with \\"beautiful scenic and photographic effect\\". Advancing to the next day, the film depicted Nelson making a final entry in his personal diary and later on Victory bidding farewell to Captain Hardy (James Gordon) and other officers once the long line of enemy vessels is sighted on the horizon. Next, \\"splendidly portrayed\\" in the film, signal flags are hoisted aloft to relay the admiral's own simple but inspiring message to his crews across the British fleet: \\"England expects that every man will do his duty\\". Scenes then transitioned to the flagship's decks being cleared for action, followed by footage showing the battle itself with \\"the firing of the guns\\", \\"ships caught on fire\\", and close-up views of the battered Victory. While the battle is raging, Nelson and Hardy are openly and calmly walking on the quarter deck giving commands. Suddenly, Nelson drops to his knees, struck down by a musket ball shot by a sniper aboard the adjacent French warship 'Redoubtable'. Mortally wounded, Lord Nelson is quickly carried below decks to the ship's cockpit. There in the film's final scenes, described as replete with \\"grandeur\\" and \\"pathos\\", the heroic admiral dies, but not until Hardy brings him news of the British fleet's overwhelming defeat of Napoleon's Franco-Spanish fleet.

Later footage from other silent productions that include portrayals of the Battle of Trafalgar should not be confused with this 1911 Edison release. Two of those subsequent releases are much longer, far more elaborate British films. One, titled Nelson; The Story of England's Immortal Naval Hero, is a 1918 two-hour biopic starring Donald Calthrop.

It is one of the most important sources for the halakhic rulings of the scholars of Germany and France, and it is one of the defining halakhic works of the Ashkenazi tosafists. The work consists of supplemental notes (Haggahot) to the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides, with the objective of implanting contemporary Sephardic thought to Germany and France, while juxtaposing it to contemporary Ashkenazi halakhic costumes.  Publication  The work may originally have been written on the margins of the Mishneh Torah, as it appears in early manuscripts. However, the first publication was in the 1509 Constantinople edition of the Mishneh Torah. The work was later published again in 1524 in Venice. There are differences between the editions of 1509 and 1524, some of which are material. The wording of the glosses in the Venice edition (from which the later editions were printed) is more original and the author generally speaks in the first person, while the wording of the 1509 edition shows signs of being a later version. Additionally certain passages appear in the Constantinople version which are absent from the Venice version, and vice versa. The Constantinople edition contains additions that may have been added by the editor.  Contents  The work is divided into two sections, the first section consists of notes attached to the Mishneh Torah itself. The second, called Teshovot Maimuniyyot is appended at the end of each book and contains Responsum by German and French scholars relevant to the topics dealt with in the body of the work. Eight out of the fourteen books of the Mishneh Torah contain supplemental notes. The book which are not included in the work are: Hafla'ah, Zemanim, Avodah, Korbanot, and Taharah.

Described as the \\"food of kings\\" and \\"supreme judge of all sweets\\", by the 13th-century lauzinaj had entered medieval European cuisine from the Andalusian influence, returning Crusaders and Latin translations of cookery books. History References about the confection abound in Arabic literature. It is mentioned by the 10th-century poet Al-Ma'muni, and Sahnun, a qadi who advises one of his students that the reward for long hours of studying law is the prospect of earning enough wealth to eat pistachio filled lauzinaj Two versions of the dish are known from medieval texts: #Lauzinaj mugharraq or \\"drenched lauzinaj\\", some scholars believe this dish is earlier version of the Ottoman dish baklava (though Charles Perry has written that \\"it was not much like baklava\\"). It was made by filling thin pastry dough with a mixture of ground almond (and sometimes other nuts like pistachio or walnut), rosewater, and sometimes luxury flavorings like mastic, ambergris, or musk. #Lauzinaj yabis was made with ground almonds cooked in boiling honey or sugar until reaching a taffy like consistency. The raw version, closer to marzipan in consistency, was made by blending the almonds with sugar and flavoring with camphor, musk and rosewater. The finished confection was molded into animal or other shapes, or cut into squares and triangles. Preparation One historic recipe is given in the 10th-century that describes how to make lauzinaj by blending crushed sugar and almonds with rosewater, and rolling it in thin dough, similar to sanbusaj (samosa) dough, but ideally even thinner. The poet Ibn al- Rumi compared the dough to grasshopper wings. The finished pastry would be drenched in rosewater-flavored simple syrup and garnished with crushed pistachio.

She arrived in Britain in 1964 to work as an extra on the film A High Wind in Jamaica (1965). In the next few years she wrote for The Sunday Times, Queen and Cosmopolitan. Hannah was appointed in 1968 as a reporter on Thames Television's Today, then presented by Eamonn Andrews. In the role, she interviewed prime minister Harold Wilson and actor Michael Caine.

Blake-Hannah then worked for the local news programme broadcast by ATV in Birmingham. She was unable to find a hotel which would allow her to stay, and had to commute from London each day until she found a room at the YWCA. She was deliberately kept away from the studio on a day when Enoch Powell was being interviewed. Following this, she worked as researcher on the BBC's documentary series Man Alive. Return to Jamaica Chris Blackwell and Perry Henzell offered her a job in 1972 as public relations officer The Harder They Come, the first Jamaican feature film. She returned home to Jamaica permanently. Here Blake-Hannah had a successful career as a film-maker and has also been an independent senator in the Parliament of Jamaica.

The unit was sometimes known as \\"Manning's Battery\\" after its commanding officer, Capt. Charles H. Manning. It was one of the Massachusetts regiments organized in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call on May 2, 1861 for volunteer troops to serve a term of three-years. The core of the unit was a peace-time militia company known as the Salem Light Artillery. The battery trained at Camp Chase in Lowell, Massachusetts. It was assigned to the Department of the Gulf under Major General Benjamin F. Butler and departed Boston by steamship on November 20. For the first several months of their service, the battery performed garrison duty at Ship Island off the Mississippi coast, which served as the staging point for Butler's expedition. After proceeding on to Baton Rouge in May 1862, the battery took part in operations in the vicinity of that city, being heavily engaged in the Battle of Baton Rouge on August 5, 1862. In 1863, the battery participated in the Siege of Port Hudson, Louisiana and the Second Bayou Teche Campaign. In December 1863, nearly all the men of the 4th Massachusetts Light Artillery opted to reenlist (although the close of their term was still roughly a year off) in exchange for a month's furlough. This furlough was taken in March 1864 during which the unit returned to Massachusetts. When the 4th Battery returned to New Orleans in April, they were drilled for several months as infantry, then re-supplied again as light artillery. During September and October 1864, the battery was based in Morganza, Louisiana and took part in several expeditions in that region. For two months at the end of 1864, the unit was based in Memphis, Tennessee. They returned to New Orleans in January 1865 and at the close of the war were involved in the Mobile Campaign in Alabama, taking part in the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakeley. After the Confederate surrender, the battery was deployed to Buffalo Bayou outside of Houston, Texas where they performed various details over the summer of 1865. On October 1, the unit started the return journey to Massachusetts. After reaching Boston harbor on November 4, the unit was mustered out at Gallop's Island on November 11, 1865.

It was formed in January 1942 as the 110th Separate Cavalry Division and reformed as the 110th Cavalry Division on 30 September 1942. Formed as a Kalmyk national division, its personnel were drawn from the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The division arrived on the frontlines on 14 May 1942, covering the retreat of Soviet troops across river Don during the 1942 German strategic summer offensive (Case Blue). After suffering heavy casualties, it broke down into separate units while continuing to fight in the Battle of the Caucasus. It was disbanded on 27 January 1943, after the Soviet Union began to dissolve national divisions. Unsubstantiated rumors surrounding its alleged misconduct during the war contributed to the decision to deport Kalmyks to Siberia. Formation During the early stages of the German invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, the latter suffered massive casualties. Over one hundred Soviet divisions were disbanded due to losses in manpower. The Soviet State Defense Committee initiated the formation of hundreds of new divisions which were quickly sent to the front lines. Losses of materiel among the tank divisions and mechanized corps, meant that horsed cavalry divisions remained the only tool available for the execution of deep operations and raids. On 13 November 1941, following the suggestion of General Inspector of the Cavalry Oka Gorodovikov, the Soviets began forming 20 national cavalry divisions and 15 national rifle brigades. The new units drew upon the peoples of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union (ASSRs), in Northern Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals and the Lower Volga Region. Unlike typical cavalry divisions, national cavalry divisions were equipped and sustained using the funds of the respective republics and their formation was overseen by the local communist party committees. Most officers were appointed from among the native nationality, in order to prevent the development of a language barrier. On 20 November 1941, Deputy Defense Narkom Efim Shadenko ordered the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to form the 110th and 111th Separate Cavalry Divisions by January 1942. Most Kalmyks had only recently transitioned to sedentism, severely limiting the number of settlements that could host the new divisions. The 3,498-man-strong 110th Separate S.M. Budyonny Cavalry Division was to be formed in the Sadovoe, Tundutovo and Malye Derbety villages. Men were drafted from Serpinsky, Ketchenerovsky, Maloderbetsky, Ustinsky, Privolzhsky, Ulan-Holsky and Lagansky Uluses (Districts), located in the north and east of the republic. Since the command staff had departed the republic for the front lines, the first temporary commander of the division was appointed by the local political authorities. Former head of the Kalmyk ASSR Selhozbank (Agricultural Bank), Lieutenant Michael Onguldushev assumed command. In January 1942, command was transferred to Colonel Vasily Panin. Mobilization and training lagged behind schedule since over 16,000 Kalmyks were employed in various engineering projects around the Caucasus. On 23 February, the 110th Separate Cavalry Division received its military banner and its soldiers took the military oath. On the same day its size was expanded to 4,494 men, while soldiers were assigned to their respective units within it. On 4 March, the Soviet High Command disbanded 20 cavalry divisions after deeming cavalry to be less effective than expected. The 111th Separate Cavalry Division was disbanded on 12 March, its best cadres and equipment being transferred to the 110th Separate Cavalry Division. The latter dispatched 1,000 of its least trained recruits to reserve units. At 20 April, the 110th was judged to be fully equipped, now numbering 4,579 men and 4,825 horses. The 273rd, 292nd and 311th Cavalry Regiments forming its core. Operations=Defense of the Don thumb300pxThe German advance from 7 May to 18 November 1942. On 14 May 1942, the 110th Separate Cavalry Division was deployed to Zimovniki, Rostov Oblast. On 26 May 1942, after marching for the 110th Separate Cavalry Division reached the Don river village of Kuteynovskaya. After joining the 17th Cavalry Corps, the division continued its training. In June, the Germans reached the banks of the Don. The German Army Groups A and B were tasked with encircling and annihilating the Soviet troops crossing the river, capturing the Caucasus and seizing the city of Stalingrad in what came to be known as Case Blue, the 1942 German strategic summer offensive. This would deny the Soviet Union its strategic oil and gas reserves and block the Persian Corridor of the Allied Lend-Lease programme. The Soviet North Caucasian Front responded by sending forward the 51st Army (which included the 110th Separate Cavalry Division) to the left bank of the Don. On 5 June, the 110th was assigned a section of the front ranging from the Bagayevskaya to Semikarakorsk, while the 115th Cavalry Division protected a stretch from Konstantinovka to Semikarakorsk on its northern flank. On 13 July, the Soviet High Command ordered all units remaining west of the Don to cross the river and concentrate at Stalingrad. The two divisions facilitated the retreat of those units, by providing anti- aircraft cover and collecting abandoned equipment. Between 16 and 27 July, 110th Separate Cavalry Division shot down five German aircraft using Maxim guns and rifle fire. The 115th Cavalry Division came under a massed tank attack and was heavily bombed, retreating from its positions. On 18 July, the 110th withdrew to the Sal river, establishing its headquarters at Batlaevka. The same day its positions became the target of heavy aerial bombing and artillery fire, while its advanced guard exchanged fire with the enemy, losing five killed and seven wounded. On 20 July, it lost 50 killed and dozens wounded to aerial bombardments and strafing. On 21 July, the 273rd Cavalry Regiment ambushed a unit of motorcyclists and two armored cars in a vineyard in the outskirts of the Puchliakovskaya village. The Germans retreated after suffering casualties and launched a second attack which was beaten off. On the night of 21 July, the 311th Cavalry Regiment's Reconnaissance Platoon was attacked by elements of the Motorized Infantry Division Gro√üdeutschland at Kerchik, losing half of its troops killed. On the morning of 22 July, the II. and III. Grenadier Battalions of the Gro√üdeutschland Division established a bridgehead on the southern bank of the Don at Puchliakovskaya and Melichovskaya which were abandoned by Soviet troops. Augmented by a tank company the I. Grenadier Battalion advanced on Razdorskaya village. The village and the nearby pontoon crossing was defended by the 3rd NKVD Battalion, the 1st Militsiya Battalion, two 45 mm guns and two anti-tank riflemen teams of the 273rd Cavalry Regiment. Anti-tank rifleman Sergeant Erdny Delikov opened fire at , destroying two tanks and one truck. The Germans received air support after firing flares, and the ensuing bombardment knocked out one of the 45 mm guns and both of the anti-tank rifles, mortally injuring Delikov. The delaying action at Razdorskaya enabled all retreating Soviet units in the vicinity to safely withdraw over the Don. On 31 March 1943, Delikov was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, the first Kalmyk to receive the honor. By the end of the day, two out of the three river crossings located in the 110th Separate Cavalry Division's area of responsibility had fallen into enemy hands. The Bagaevskaya crossing remained intact, allowing the staff of the 37th Army, the 3rd Rifle Corps, 5th and 15th Tank Brigades and other smaller units to evade encirclement. On 22 July, the 110th was placed under the operational control of the 37th Army. On 23 July, Gro√üdeutschland's motorcycle battalion, supported by three tanks, three armored cars, eight armored personnel carriers (APCs) and two heavy artillery pieces launched an assault on Bagaevskaya. The 292nd Cavalry Regiment repelled the first attack with the aid of an artillery and mortar barrage. The Germans lost a tank, four APCs and two armored cars. At 15:30, the Germans attacked again after a series of airstrikes, but were thrown back to their starting positions. On 24 July, the Germans conducted another unsuccessful attack on Bagaevskaya, losing five APCs, two tanks and two artillery pieces. The 292nd Cavalry Regiment blew up the Bagaevskaya bridge at 12:00 a.m. Having lost 150 men killed and wounded and over 200 horses, the 292nd withdrew to the Susat- Karpovka line. On 25 July, the III Panzer Corps broke through Soviet defenses south of Konstantinovskaya, putting the 110th Separate Cavalry Division in danger of encirclement. On the night of 25/26 July, it began augmenting its fortifications at Karpovka. The following morning, the Germans struck Karpovka and Azhinov, although the 110th Separate Cavalry Division stubbornly resisted enemy attempts to advance. Hundreds of its soldiers were killed, including Divisional Commissar Sergei Zayarny and Division Chief of Staff Alexei Raab. The divisional headquarters building was destroyed, burying with it the divisional and the regimental flags, which were recovered under intense enemy fire. The division conducted an organized retreat over the Manych river during the night. During the two weeks of fighting on the Don, the 110th Separate Cavalry Division lost approximately 1,000 men killed or missing in action and 700 wounded. According to Russian historian Vladimir Ubushaev, it managed to destroy up to four battalions of motorized infantry, 30 tanks, 55 armored cars, 45 mortars, 20 artillery pieces, 40 machine guns. In total, the 110th Separate Cavalry Division's delaying actions on the Don enabled over 425,000 men, 215 tanks, 1,300 artillery pieces, over 8,000 tractors and cars, 22,000 horses and other equipment to be safely transported to the Soviet rear. Battle of the Caucasus Monument to Erdni Delikov in Razdorskaya village Between 27 and 29 July, the 110th fought a series of defensive battles around Tuzlukov, Krasniy and Veseliy in the vicinity of the Manych. Having suffered heavy casualties it withdrew under the orders of the 37th Army commander. Unable to build an adequate distance from German motorized troops to regroup and suffering losses as a result of German air supremacy it made a fighting retreat to Mozdok. The unit broke into numerous columns in order to minimize casualties; the bulk of its forces marched through Bashanta and Voroshilovsk. It clashed with enemy troops at Salsk, Sandata, Sablino and north-east of Voroshilovsk. In the middle of August, a part of the division took up defense positions at Boznesenskaya outside Mozdok, while a smaller group retreated to Maykop and Astrakhan. In the Northern Caucasus elements of the 110th merged into the 4th Guards Cavalry Corps, while in Astrakhan they came under the control of the 28th Army. The core of the division, stationed at Boznesenskaya, became an independent unit within the Northern Army Group of the Transcaucasian Front. By the beginning of September, the division had lost over 3,000 men killed and wounded, as well as 80% of its horses. On 5 September, the Military Committee of the Northern Army Group ordered the 110th's commander Colonel Vladimir Homutnikov to protect the newly built Kizlyar‚ÄìAstrakhan railway. The division thus came under the control of the 44th Army. The division's sector of responsibility extended from the Cherniy Runok to the Zenzeli station in their native Kalmyk ASSR. The Germans attempted to disrupt the railway's operation by attacking the Ulan Hol station with a motorized infantry battalion and 10 tanks. A counterattack by the 292nd Cavalry Regiment cost the Germans 100 men killed, two tanks and three trucks. The 110th later marched to Aga-Batyr north-east of Mozdok, where it helped the 36th Cavalry Division avoid encirclement. After 15 days of continuous fighting, the division liberated Terekli-Mekteb, Achikulak, Aga-Batyr, Tarskiy, Michailovskiy, Poltavskiy and Sovkhoz \\"Mozdokskiy\\". On 16 September, the division was reinforced by a group of Kalmyk cadets from the Novocherkassk Cavalry School. On 30 September, the 110th Separate Cavalry Division was officially disbanded. It was simultaneously reformed as the 110th Cavalry Division, drawing personnel from the Ordzhonikidze Krai and the unoccupied Uluses of the Kalmyk ASSR. The reformation dragged on as all available motor transport and horses in the Kalmyk ASSR had already been requisitioned. By the middle of November, the division's strength reached 2,719 men, only 30% of whom were Kalmyks. On 12 December, the division was incorporated into the 4th Guards Cavalry Corps, taking part in the fighting around Terekli-Mekteb. On 1 January 1943, the Northern Army Group of the Transcaucasian Front launched a counter-offensive. On 4 January, the 110th breached enemy lines at Achikulak. On 10 January, the division annihilated the defenders of the Orlovskaya and Praskovey fortified positions, capturing Budyonnovsk. Continuing its push, it covered the right flank of the 4th Guards Cavalry Corps. In the process, the division seized dozens of villages in the Ordzhonikidze Krai, Dagestan ASSR and Rostov Oblast, as well as the Zapadniy and Yashaltinskiy Uluses. In late January 1943, the Soviet Union began reorganizing its divisions. Recruitment based on ethnicity was deemed to be too logistically complex and many national divisions were disbanded. On 27 January, the 110th Cavalry Division was disbanded and its personnel were split between various units within the 4th Guards Cavalry Corps. Accusations of collaboration As early as the division's withdrawal from the Don, rumors began to spread that its personnel had turned to banditry, fled in the face of the enemy or outright defected. In November 1942, Kalmyk ASSR Communist Party First Secretary P. Lavrentiev sent Shadenko a series of letters accusing the staff of the 51st Army of spreading baseless and malicious rumors about the division. The rumors had an immediate effect on the treatment of ethnic Kalmyks by the Soviet military. Individual commanders within the 51st and 28th Armies attempted to deport Kalmyk civilians from a zone around the frontlines. Ethnic Kalmyks were likewise blamed for not evacuating their cattle in time and defecting into the collaborationist Kalmykian Cavalry Corps. The latter was formed in Germany during the spring of 1943 from Kalmyk men taken by the Germans as forced laborers and defectors among prisoners of war. Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov later cited reports about the alleged disintegration of the 110th Cavalry Division coming from the 37th and 51st Armies during a session of the State Defense Committee. Those reports are believed to have served as the catalyst behind the 27 December 1943 decision to deport Kalmyks to Siberia. Former soldiers of the 110th Cavalry Division were among the Kalmyks recalled from active service and deported to Siberia. Many of whom died in special settlements. A report issued by NKVD officer A. Leontiev accused the division of turning to banditry en masse and spreading defeatist rumors in their native republic. While there are records of a limited number of defections among the 110th Cavalry Division, both modern and Soviet historiography consider the accusations leveled against the division a myth. Commanders The division was commanded by the following commanders: * Colonel Vasily Panin (January 1942 18 August 1942) * Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Lisitsin (18 August 27 August 1942) * Colonel Vladimir Homutnikov (28 August 18 September 1942) * Colonel Ivan Terentiev (18 September 29 September 1942) * Colonel Vladimir Homutnikov (30 September 1942 28 January 1943) Composition The division included the following units: * 273rd Cavalry Regiment * 292nd Cavalry Regiment * 311th Cavalry Regiment * 110th Separate Horse-Artillery Divizion * 99th Separate Artillery Park * 81st Separate Communications Half-Squadron * 110th Separate Chemical Protection Squadron * Separate Anti-Aircraft Battery * 94th Medical-Sanitary Squadron * 82nd Supply Train * 374th Veterinary Hospital * Editorial and Printing House * Military Prosecutor's Office * Military Tribunal * Special Department * Separate Rifle Platoon OO * 1925th Field Post Office * 1028th Field Cash Office of the State Bank FootnotesReferences   * Category:Military units and formations established in 1942 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1943 Category:Cavalry divisions of the Soviet Union in World War II ","title":"110th Cavalry Division (Soviet Union)"},{"id":"64196701","text":"Luz Mar√≠a Rom√°n Garc√≠a (born 22 August 1969) is a Peruvian former footballer who played as a midfielder.

Highlighting the issue of malnutrition among children during the first two years of life and permanence of the damage thus done, she led key interventions initiated at the state level under the integrated child development services which include addition of meaningful food models along with intensified health & nutrition education. The following schemes were run by her department during her tenure as principal secretary: * Introduction of acceptable fortified Take Home Ration (THR) for the children of 7 months to 3 years * Supervised feeding of malnourished children - identification of malnourished child is based on measurement of weight for age as well as weight for height along with medical check-up of malnourished children. * Introduction of one wholesome meal in the afternoon in place of THR for pregnant and lactating mothers. In addition to full meal, eggs, milk and extra oil are also provided. Regular weight monitoring and supervised administration of IFA are ensured for pregnant women. This effort also helped in increasing fetal weight and hence better outcome at birth. * Capacity building on skilled IYCF counseling through counseling courses. * In place of one Nutrition and Health Day (NHD) in a month, two NHDs are being conducted. One is exclusively for growth monitoring of children and pregnant women and the other is for other health services Sawhney also pushed for India wide adoption of certain key recommendations which yielded good results in the State, such as organising two NHDs and having convergence at the grass roots level and further emphasised on the institutionalisation of the convergence actions at the grassroots level during her tenure.

It begins in the south on New Cross Road and ends in the north on Evelyn Street (A200). Near its \\"geographic center\\" (which is more in the north), Deptford High Street is interrupted by the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and Southeastern lines.  History  The previously called Butt Lane got its current name in 1825.Barker's chapel, Butt Lane, Deptford (englisch; Artikel vom 26. M√§rz 2009) When the social researcher Charles Booth visited the street in July 1899, it was considered the \\"Oxford Street of the South East of London\\". However, this comparison offered itself more with the section of the road south of the railroad tracks, in which there are various shops and restaurants and in which a flea market takes place three times a week, than the quieter northern section. Until the 1960s, the area was mainly populated by the white working class.Joseph Bullman, Neil Hegarty, Brian Hill: The Secret History of Our Streets ‚Äì A Story of London, BBC Books, London 2013, S. 75ff. At the end of the 19th / beginning of the 20th century, Deptford High Street was also shaped by German business people for decades. Booth has identified at least eight stores run by Germans, including a bakery, a butcher and a confectionery shop. With the outbreak of the First World War, an anti-German mood became apparent in England, which also affected Deptford High Street. In October 1914, several German businesses were attacked, looted and set on fire and their owners were driven out. In the case of baker Goebel, not only was the bakery on the ground floor looted, but also his apartment above. An anti-German mob entered and threw everything that fell into his hands out of the window onto the street; including a piano, bed, bedding, tables, chairs, porcelain and clocks.Joseph Bullman, Neil Hegarty, Brian Hill: The Secret History of Our Streets ‚Äì A Story of London, S. 115f Towards the end of the 20th century, the street changed once again as a result of migration, which can be seen, among other things, from the fact that today there are only two pubs on Deptford High Street while it used to be twelve. In two former pubs there are now African restaurants, one pub has been converted into a nail salon, and another one is now taking care of problem youth.Joseph Bullman, Neil Hegarty, Brian Hill: The Secret History of Our Streets ‚Äì A Story of London, S. 135 References Category:Streets in the London Borough of Lewisham Category:Deptford ","title":"Deptford High Street"},{"id":"64196939","text":"Miguel de los Reyes Rosas Silva (born January 6, 1958) is a Peruvian lawyer and public administrator.

She was a co-founder of the women only Bagdam Cafee in Toulouse which opened in 1988. The cafe closed in 1999 but the name lives on with annual events as a focus for lesbian culture.  Life  She was born in 1947. Her family were traders and as she gree up she read George Sand. She was academic but her exploits with a Catholic teacher's daughter got her expelled. Nevertheless she went on to study literature, art history and musicology at universities in Nantes and Poitiers. She met Jacqueline Julien. In 1988 she and Jacqueline Julien opened the Bagdam Cafee in Toulouse. This open cafe is credited with moving the focus of French lesbian culture south. She and Julien had been active about ten years before but they had given up as it held no pleasure for them. Their creation was targeted at pleasure rather than politics, but this women only cafe was also part of a larger movement where lesbians were making themselves visible in society. Julien, at least, saw the cafe as a way of establishing a \\"new order\\". The cafe was the focus for lesbian culture in the midi pyrenee attracting 8,000 visits during its existence. In 1995 alone it had dozens of events from seminars to films and its supporters collected money for lesbian based legal battles. The Bagdam Cafee closed on 1 January 1999 but its name continued in the Bagdam Espace Lesbien. This was more than a web presence, although that was part of it. The organisation published books, organised an annual festival named \\"Lesbian Spring\\", created other events as well as contesting legal events and organising protests.

Autogamy depression can be defined as the \\"lowered viability of autogamous progeny relative to geitonogamous progeny‚Äù. Viability has also been evaluated in terms of percent fruit set or seed set rather than reproductive fitness of the progeny. The experimental design for observing the occurrence of autogamy depression is called an \\"autogamy depression test\\" which has been described by researchers as analogous to a test for inbreeding depression. The ability for fitness of autogamous progeny to differ from geitonogamous progeny comes from the understanding that plants can accumulate heritable mutational variation through both mitotic division and meiotic division. Because plants have indeterminate growth, the apical meristems that contribute to the development of the reproductive structures of a plant have the potential to undergo continual mitosis resulting in the accumulation of somatic mutations (acquired mutations). It has been demonstrated through research that long lived plants can have higher per generation mutation rate (based on occurrences of more mitotic cell divisions compared to short lived plants). Any deleterious mutations that appear during mitotic growth are filtered out through cell lineage selection, in which deleterious mutations that are subject to developmental selection during mitotic growth are replaced by vigorous cell lineages, however, somatic mutations that are not expressed will not be subject to selection during growth of the plant and will accumulate in the apical meristem.  Phenotypic effects of somatic mutations  There is evidence of the phenotypic effects of somatic mutations in increased Chlorophyll mutants of some long-lived plants. Chlorophyll mutants are inherently easy to observe because of the phenotypic affects of the chlorophyll mutations. Because of the highly conserved nature of photosynthetic processes, these chlorophyll mutation rates can be generalized to most angiosperms. Somatic mutations accumulating during vegetative growth have also been found to affect the fitness of seedlings in the next generation.  Expectations of autogamy depression test  Individual crowns are treated as, \\"independent mitotic mutation-accumulation lines\\" and so the appearance of deleterious somatic mutations in the autogamous crosses will be heterozygous or homozygous at the same locus (~25% homozygous) and the appearance of deleterious somatic mutations in the geitonogamous crosses will be heterozygous. The autogamy depression can be calculated through the simple equation AD = 1-(wa/wg), where AD is the Autogamy Depression, wa is the fitness of the autogamous progeny and wg is the fitness of the geitonogamous progeny. When the fitnesses are equal the AD is 0. The difference can be calculated by the equation, D = wg-wa.

It started as a closed Facebook group and aims to provide a community for black women gamers.  History  Black Girl Gamers was founded by Jay-Ann Lopez, a British author and blogger, in 2015. Lopez had enjoyed playing video games since she was young, but struggled to find other black women who were interested in gaming, and faced sexist and racist comments playing video games online. Aiming to create a space and community for black women to support each other while gaming, Lopez created a Facebook group called Black Girl Gamers. The Facebook group has a strict process for joining, including a questionnaire and a requirement for the member to have profile pictures of their face. Over time, the community grew in size, hosted panels at PAX East and the Victoria and Albert Museum, and started running in-person events. Lopez received the MCV Women in Games Campaigner of the Year award in 2019. By 2020 the community had more than 6,000 members, with 20,000 followers on Twitter and 10,000 followers on Twitch. In June 2020 the community organised a Wellness Week to raise funds for Color of Change and The Bail Project, and an online gaming summit in partnership with Twitch. In mid 2020, the world's rising interest in police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement led to a surge in Twitch viewers, which led to mixed reactions from the community, who tweeted \\"As much as we‚Äôre grateful to receive new support, BGG is not a proxy for doing the work regarding police brutality.\\"  Activities  Members of the Black Girl Gamers community support and play games with each other, communicating through forums such as a Facebook group. In addition, Lopez hopes that the community will improve connections between gamers and the video game industry while highlighting issues important to them.

Her book Elderhood: Redefining Aging, Transforming Medicine, Reimagining Life was a finalist for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. Early life and education Aronson was born in San Francisco to father Samuel Aronson and mother Mary Ann Goldman Aronson. She considers her family to be ‚Äúsecular but decidedly Jewish in sensibility,‚Äù and of German and French Jewish ancestry. Growing up, she had no intention of pursuing a medical degree; instead, she hoped to become an author or basketball player. With no intention of ever becoming a doctor, Aronson refused to enroll in colleges that had math or science requirements. This led her to enroll in Brown University's history and anthropology program for her Bachelor of Arts degree. After receiving her undergraduate degree, Aronson attended Harvard Medical School for her medical degree and earned her Master of Fine Arts (MFA) from Warren Wilson College. Career In late 2006, Aronson accepted a position as an academic physician in the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) health sciences campus. In her early years at the school, she received their Medical Education Research Fellowship and their 2011 Cooke Award for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. From 2010 until 2016, she was a member of UCSF's Academy of Medical Educators. During this time, she was also awarded an Arnold P. Gold Foundation Professorship for her project Fostering Humanism through Critical Reflection and Narrative Advocacy. Her research developed into her first novel titled A History of the Present Illness, a collection of fictional stories that explore the nature of medicine and humanity. When asked why she chose to write a fictional story, Aronson replied \\"By using fiction, I could take 20 years of experience and tell a story in the way I felt was most effective and draw from a whole array of real patients and people.\\" Following the success of her first novel, Aronson was encouraged by her editor to write a non-fictional account of medicine and aging. As a result, she wrote her second book titled Elderhood: Redefining Aging, Transforming Medicine, Reimagining Life which included her own personal experiences in the medical field and confronting her parents aging. Aronson was named a 2019 Influencer in Aging and 2019‚Äì2020 Humanism in Aging Leadership Award winner. In 2020, Aronson's book was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.

He was installed as bishop of Jerusalem in opposition Juvenal in 451 or 452, but was forced into exile by the emperor Marcian in 453. Information about his life comes mainly from the works of John Rufus. These include a biography of Peter the Iberian and a narration of Theodosius' exile and death, the Narratio de obitu Theodosii Hierosolymitani. The latter is a short text known only from the Syriac version in two manuscripts. Rufus describes Theodosius as a confessor and martyr. A complementary anti-Chalcedonian Syriac account is found in Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor. A Chalcedonian version of events is given in Cyril of Scythopolis' biography of Euthymius the Great. When Juvenal returned to Jerusalem from Chalcedon in 451, many monks and clergy tried to persuade him to recant his acceptance of the council's canons. When he refused, they elected Theodosius as bishop in opposition and Juvenal fled. Theodosius consecrated many anti- Chalcedonian bishops, including Peter the Iberian in the diocese of Maiuma. When Juvenal returned with imperial troops in August 453, there were briefly two active bishops in the city. Theodosius, however, accepted a sentence of exile and did not fight. The bishops he consecrated, except for Peter, were deposed. Theodosius first went to Egypt or perhaps Sinai. He then went to Antioch, perhaps to secure the support of Symeon Stylites, but was arrested at the city gates. On the orders of Marcian, he was brought to Constantinople. When he refused Marcian's entreaties to accept Chalcedon, he was imprisoned in the monastery of Saint Dios. When the abbot of that house was unable to win him over, he moved him to a narrow unheated cell for the winter. Theodosius fell seriously ill. When Leo the Thracian succeeded Marcian, he turned Theodosius over to the custody of the anti-Chalcedonian monks of Sykai. The deposed bishop died only a few days later. His body was taken to Cyprus to prevent the Chalcedonians from stealing it to claim he had changed his mind. It was buried in an anti-Chalcedonian monastery. The Narratio records that Theodosius' companion, Abban Romanus, was recalled to Palestine after his death. In the Coptic Orthodox Church, Theodosius was remembered as a champion of orthodoxy against Chalcedonism. Two works are attributed to him, but both are late Coptic forgeries. The first, In Honor of Victor, is a biography of the martyr Victor Stratelates. It is a poorly written text describing the virtues of Victor and the miracles he performed at Jerusalem. It is preserved in a codex from the White Monastery. The second, The Miracles of Saint George, is a homily on the miracles of Saint George, mostly surrounding the construction of his shrine in Jaffa.

Gerry Van Tronder has argued that this document fitted into an attempt to maintain the image that Beijing was a \\"powerful but essentially benevolent leader in Asia\\", following the 1959 Tibetan Uprising. Contemporary Nepali, Chinese and Indian commentators have stressed the importance of the treaty in determining Nepal's relationship with China in the past and present.  Historical background  Immediately after India's Independence in 1947, Prime Ministers (Padma Rana and Mohan Rama) and Kings (Tribuhvan) of Nepal maintained a \\"special relationship\\" with India compared to China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Premier Zhou Enlai had recognised the closeness of India's and Nepal's relationship, apparently trying to reach a settlement over border issues in a meeting between the three nations. India and Nepal's comparatively \\"special\\" relationship was formalised in the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which signalled a relative distancing of relations with Beijing. Perhaps prompted by this, the Chinese Communist Party backed a failed 1952 coup attempt by the Communist Party of Nepal to overthrow the ruling Rana faction. During the period from 1950 to 1955, India was \\"instrumental in blocking the direct establishment of relations between Nepal and China\\" (all communications first passing through New Delhi) and wanted to have \\"reached an understanding with China on Tibet and other Himalayan states\\" before Nepal \\"favoured any positive action with China\\". Nonetheless, there was a period of gradually increasing democracy in Nepal that set the stage for a softening of attitudes towards Beijing, culminating in Nepal and China agreeing to re-establish diplomatic relations at the 1955 Bandung Conference along the ‚ÄúFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence‚Äù. The resumption of more friendly relations was authenticated by three agreements signed between the countries in 1956, among them the \\"Agreement on Maintaining Friendly Relations between the People‚Äôs Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal\\", which terminated the 1856 Treaty of Thapathali and recognised Tibet as an \\"autonomous region of China\\", as well as two economic agreements on the conditions for trade between Nepal and Tibet and financial aid for Nepal. This signalled the beginning of Nepal's new Monarch Mahendra, forging his own foreign policy with China without constant oversight or permission from India. This was further demonstrated through a 1957 proclamation from Chinese Premier Zhou that Nepal needed to broaden their economic interests to ensure their independence, following his visit to the country in the same year.  Border Treaty March 1960  Koirala visiting the Imperial Palace in 1960 The immediate run-up to the signing of the treaty between the governments of Nepal and China was recently elected Nepalese prime minister B.P. Koirala's visit to China in March 1960. An official communique from the Chinese side reveals that he was first \\"received\\" by Mao Tse-tung and Liu Shao chi, before later beginning negotiations with Premier Zhou, Chen Yi, Pan Tzu-li and others on the Chinese side, with Ganesh Man Singh, Surya Prasad Upadhyaya and others on the Nepalese side. Eventually, the two countries signed the \\"Agreement Between the Government of the People's Republic of China and His Majesty's Government of Nepal on the Question of the Boundary Between the Two Countries\\". This was actually the key agreement between the two sides that officially delineated the borders of the two countries in the Himalayas, as well as ceding Tibet to Chinese control. Without this, it is highly unlikely that China would have agreed to the terms of the later Treaty of \\"peace and friendship\\" in April. This treaty, like the earlier one of 1956, was completed according to the \\"Five Principles\\". Again, like 1956, another \\"Agreement Between the Government of the People's Republic of China and His Majesty's Government of Nepal on Economic Aid\\" was then passed upon the completion of the territorial proposal. The conditions of this were: \\"within a period of three years, a free grant of aid of a total value of 100,000,000 (one hundred million) Indian Rupees, without any political conditions attached. This aid does not include the remaining 40,000,000 (forty million) Indian Rupees, provided under the Agreement between China and Nepal on Economic Aid of 1956, which has not yet been used by His Majesty's Government of Nepal.\\" Diplomatically, they also approved the creation of their respective embassies in Peking and Kathmandu after this time. Premier Chou En-lai then \\"agreed that they would discuss and sign the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two countries during Premier Chou En-lai‚Äôs visit in Nepal\\". Although Singh said that \\"the Indo-Nepalese treaty obliged Nepal to consult with New Delhi before concluding a treaty with China\\" (presumably under Article II) but \\"they did not do so\\",  Text of the treaty  The text of the treaty was as follows: The Chairman of the People's Republic of China and His Majesty the King of Nepal, desiring to maintain and further develop peace and friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal. Convinced that the strengthening of good-neighborly relations and friendly co- operation between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal is in accordance with the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries and conducive to the consolidation of peace in Asia and the world, have decided for this purpose to conclude the present Treaty in accordance with the Five Principles of peaceful co-existence jointly affirmed by the two countries, and have appointed as their respective Plenipotentiaries: The Chairman of the People's Republic of China: Premier Chou En-lai of the State Council, His Majesty the King of Nepal: Prime Minister Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala. THE above-mentioned Plenipotentiaries, having examined each other's credentials and found them in good and due form, have agreed upon the following: Article I The Contracting Parties recognize and respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other. Article II The Contracting Parties will maintain and develop peaceful and friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal. They undertake to settle all disputes between them by mean of peaceful negotiation. Article III The Contracting Parties agree to develop and further strengthen the economic and cultural ties between the two countries in a spirit of friendship and co-operation, in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit and of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Article IV Any difference or dispute arising out of the interpretation or application of the present Treaty shall be settled by negotiation through normal diplomatic channel. Article V This present Treaty is subject to ratification and the instruments of ratification will be exchanged in Peking as soon as possible. The present Treaty will come into force immediately on the exchange of the instruments of ratification and will remain in force for a period of ten years. Unless either of the Contracting Parties gives to the other notice in writing to terminate the Treaty at least one year before the expiration of this period, it will remain in force without any specified time limit, subject to the right of either of the Contracting Parties to terminate it by giving to the other in writing a year's notice of its intention to do so.

Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of Nepal.  Mustang Incident June 1960  However, hopes of a successful treaty were feared to be short-founded following an \\"incident\\" that occurred in the demilitarised zone of the Kore Pass of the Mustang border region on June 28, 1960. This consisted of Chinese troops opening fire on an unarmed group of Nepali border patrol officers, killing one of them and capturing between 15-17 others. In fact, the creation of the demilitarised zone had been accomplished specifically to diminish tensions at the border, with both sides agreeing to withdraw for 20 miles on either side after the March 1960 Border Treaty. Nevertheless, Chinese forces had overlooked this pledge to pursue Tibetan rebels within the area, with the Chinese Foreign Ministry explaining that the Nepalese police had been mistaken for these combatants. Eventually, China did apologise, pay a 50,000 Rupee indemnity and release the Nepali police but they disagreed with Nepal as to where the event had occurred, that it happened on Nepali territory and that they needed consent from Nepal to operate in the demilitarised zone. The later Sino-Nepali Joint Frontier Border Commission found that both the place where Nepal said the event had happened and the alternative Chinese spot were in Nepal's side of the border. Although this and resentment over the unilateral 1960 Chinese Mount Everest expedition prompted a wide array of cross-party opposition to China's actions (apart from the Nepali Communist Party), eventually Koirala agreed to enter into further discussions on the border question.  Sino-Nepal Border Treaty 1961 On 5 October 1961, another border treaty between China and Nepal was signed by Liu Shao-chi and Mahendra that superseded the previous one from March 21, 1960. Although the text of this treaty only specifically mentions the March 21, 1960, Treaty rather than the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, it attributes the \\"over-all settlement of the boundary question\\" to \\"friendly consultations\\" such as the 28th April 1960 Treaty. The cumulative effect of these treaties has been argued by Elleman and others to have detrimentally affected Nepal and China's relationship with India, with many changes from the 1961 Treaty particularly objectionable and vigorously opposed.  Significance during Sino-Indian War of 1962  Although Article I and Article II of the treaty only applied to direct relations between Nepal and China, it is unclear in exactly what ways they might have applied to Nepal during the Sino-Indian War, with Nepal remaining neutral throughout the war and deliberately offered little or no help to either side. On the other hand, some Indian troops were stationed in \\"Nepal's northern part\\", which was a reflection of Nepal's 1950 Treaty with India. Further assistance towards India was adversely affected by the imprisonment of (supposedly pro-Indian) Koirala in December 1960 by King Mahendra, confirmed in 1961 by the announcement of a project to build 104 km road from Kathmandu to Kodari, which Indian PM Nehru then stating that \\"India's national security would be adversely affected by the road\\".  Significance during the modern era  Sanju believes that the Treaty represented Nepal's importance as a buffer state to India from China and was the first affirmation of China's military strategy for Nepal, in that it was seen as a fundamental part of \\"China's inner security ring\\" and \\"cannot be spared to any regional or global power\\". Recently, Nepalese journalists and military personnel have stressed the significance of the Treaty in proving a history of successful co-operation between the two nations. Both Chinese and Indian sources have stressed the importance of this agreement in allowing for later co-operation, such as Nepal supporting the PRC's membership of the UN in 1971 and Nepal's agreement to join the Belt and Road Initiative in 2017.

Biography Born Antonio Cimino on 3 October 1873 in Capri, Italy, he took the name Serafino as a member of the Order of Friars Minor and was ordained a priest in 1898. He taught at the Ateneo Antoniano in Rome. For two years he did pastoral work among Italian immigrants in New York. From 1915 to 1921 he served as Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor. He was led the Custody of the Holy Land from 1915 to 1918. In that capacity he visited Constantinople and obtained security guarantees for the Custody. As superior general, he visited the Franciscan provinces in Europe and was the first general to visit the Americas as well. On 18 December 1924, Pope Pius XI appointed him titular archbishop of Cyrrhus and Apostolic Delegate to Mexico. He received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Gaetano de Lai on 11 January 1925. He reached Mexico on 1 April and departed for the United States for health treatment on 15 May. Several weeks later he sought a visa to re- enter Mexico.

He took over the positions from Carl Bass, who resigned in February 2017. Before the promotion, he had served in various other roles for the company since joining in 1997. He holds degrees from California State University, Northridge and Stanford University.  Early life and education  Anagnost grew up in Van Nuys, California and initially dropped out of high school. After issues with legal and educational authorities, his family helped him enroll in a new high school and he went on to graduate. Afterwards, Anagnost went on to earn a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from California State University, Northridge (CSUN) in 1987. His mother, sister, and brother also graduated from CSUN. During his bachelor's degree, Anagnost completed an internship at Lockheed Martin. He later obtained an MS in Engineering Science and a PhD in Aeronautical Engineering and Computer Science from Stanford University.  Career  Following graduation from his bachelor's, Anagnost initially worked as a composites structure engineer and propulsion installation engineer at Lockheed Martin, where he had previously interned. He left the position to pursue his further education at Stanford, leading to a position at the NASA Ames Research Center as a National Research Council post-doctoral fellow. Finding the aeronautics business 'too slow', he joined the Exa Corporation in Boston in 1992, before joining Autodesk as a product manager in 1997. Early on in his career at Autodesk, he led development of the company‚Äôs manufacturing products and increased the revenue of Autodesk Inventor five-fold to more than $500 million. Working his way up through the company over the years, he achieved the position of Chief Marketing Officer and SVP of the Business Strategy & Marketing. In these roles, he was credited with Autodesk's transition to software as a service, as well as the adoption of cloud computing. Following the resignation of Carl Bass, Anagnost was appointed as interim-CEO together with Amar Hanspal, the Chief Product Officer. Following a four month search, Anagnost was permanently appointed as President and CEO of the company. In this role, Anagnost has pushed for a refocus of the company on software for construction, leading to the demise of some other company ventures and a workforce slash which saw 1,200 employees lose their job at the company. As part of the new focus, Autodesk acquired construction tech start-ups PlanGrid for $875 million, the company's biggest ever acquisition, and BuildingConnected for $275 million in 2018. Additionally, since becoming CEO, the company's share price has nearly tripled and Autodesk has reached a market value of $41.1B, entering the Forbes Global 2000 and Fortune 500.  Personal life and philanthropy  Growing up, Anagnost's dream job was to work on space ships for NASA. He enjoys reading science fiction novels, with The Fountains of Paradise being one of his favorite works, and is a fan of both the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises. In 2018, Anagnost was one of the judges in the Annual Engineering Showcase at his alma mater CSUN and hosted a talk at the university. The following year he was rewarded with the 2019 Distinguished Alumni Award from CSUN. That same year, Anagnost and his wife donated $300,000 to the university to establish the Teresa Sendra-Anagnost Memorial Scholarship Endowment in honor of his mother, who passed away in 2011 after suffering complications from cardiac surgery. The endowment supports outstanding students in the university's College of Engineering and Computer Science through funding of their education. Autodesk also donated $1 million to CSUN in 2020 to support the founding and construction of a Center for Integrated Design and Advanced Manufacturing at the university.

It is found in North America, where it grows on the lower trunks of conifers, particularly Douglas- fir. Taxonomy Hypogymnia occidentalis was described as a new species by Lawrence Pike in 1982. The type of the species is based on a collection made in Big Canyon, Wallowa County (Oregon), which was found by botanist Edmund Perry Sheldon in 1896. The specimen was labeled as \\"enteromorpha\\", but as the authors explain, that name had been \\"applied indiscriminately to vitally every nonseridiate Hypogymnia species in North America at some time.\\" It is commonly known as \\"lattice tube lichen\\". Description The thallus of Hypogymnia occidentalis, usually tightly pressed to its substrate, is made of small lobes (typically less than 3 wide). Although sorelia is lacking from the thallus surface, there are small, rounded lobules extending from the sides of the lobes. The lichen contains atranorin and physodic acid. Hypogymnia rugosa is somewhat similar in appearance to H. occidentalis, but the former has broader lobes, does not have side lobules, and contains hypoprotocetraric acid. Habitat and distribution Hypogymnia occidentalis is a common species in the Cascade Mountains and the northern Rocky Mountain area of the United States and Canada; its northern range extend to Alaska. It often grows on the lower trunks of conifers, particularly Douglas-fir, and is found at elevations ranging from sea level up to .

Mayor of Laredo When Flores was first married, she and her husband agreed that they could work in any field they wanted, except for politics. By the time she ran for mayor, however, both independently thought it was a good idea. As others, all men, began to announce their candidacies for mayor, she thought several were of questionable character. Flores spoke with then- Governor Ann Richards at the 1997 National Conference of La Raza about a potential run. Richards gave Flores advice and then her endorsement. Eight others would eventually throw their hats into the ring. She won her first term in a special runoff election in early 1998, winning 55.39% of the voted. She won a full four year term in the May 1998 election. Flores was the first Mexican-American and Tejana female mayor of a major American city along the United States' border with Mexico.

Following the adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, Laredo became one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the country. She is a Democrat. Personal life Flores has a younger sister, Edna Garcia. Her father, Eloy Garcia Sr., was a local official in Laredo who used his connections to help Flores become mayor. On election night, he wrote an ambulance to the victory party and died a week after she was sworn into office. In the 9th grade, she punched a classmate in the nose after he bemoaned Flores' victory in the election for class president. Flores dropped out of high school two credits shy of graduation. She later completed her diploma. Flores met her husband, Antonio \\"Tony\\" Flores, after a local newspaper ran a photograph of her when she was 15 and he was 18. The couple married when she was 17 and he was 20. They had two children before her 20th birthday. Early in their marriage, when Flores first went to work outside the house, Tony was upset and refused to speak to her. Her 19 year old son, Tony Jr., was killed in 1986 by a drunk driver. Following his death, she joined Mothers Against Drunk Driving and spoke to students as part of Texas War on Drugs, a program run by Ross Perot. She is a grandmother.

She and four similar ferries, Lady Chelmsford (1910), Lady Denman (1912), Lady Edeline (1913), and Lady Scott (1914), were a new series of \\"Lady-class\\", designed by renowned naval architect, Walter Reeks. Lady Ferguson and her four sisters survived the 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and were converted to diesel power that decade. They also survived the 1951 NSW State Government takeover of the ailing ferry fleet. Lady Ferguson was sold out of Sydney ferry service in 1975 to be used as a relief vessel in Hobart following the collapse of the Tasman Bridge. On arrival, she was found to be in such poor condition that she was not used. She was broken up in 1977. Continuing a Balmain Ferry Co convention of naming their ferries after the wives of Governors-General of Australia and Governors of NSW, Lady Ferguson was named after Helen Hermione, wife of Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar the sixth Governor-General of Australia. This naming nomenclature was again used by the State Government harbour ferry operator with the introduction of 6 new \\"Lady-class ferries\\" in the 1960s and 1970s. Design and construction In common with most Sydney Harbour ferries at the time, Lady Ferguson and her four sisters were wooden double-ended screw steamers. The five ferries had only a single propeller at one end that pushed the vessels in one direction and pulled them in the other. The configuration contrasted with the double-ended vessels of Sydney Ferries Limited (the K-class ferries) which had a continuous propeller shaft and a screw at each end. This feature was introduced by the ferry's designer, Walter Reeks, on a previous Balmain company ferry, Lady Rawson of 1906. A single propeller and one shaft simplified the internal arrangements and put less stress on the timber hulls compared to shafts running a propeller at either end. Apart from some unusual handling characteristics, the single-propeller configuration was a success and Reeks unsuccessfully tried to patent it. Lady Ferguson was built in 1914 by David Drake Limited of Balmain. Lady Denman and Lady Scott were built by J Dent of Jervis Bay, Lady Chelmsford was built by Brisbane Waters shipbuilder Rock Davis, and Lady Edeline by G A Washington of Annandale. With construction of a Sydney Harbour Bridge seeming likely, she and her four sisters were designed for a maximum of fifteen years of life. Instead, she would go on operating on the harbour until 1979 with her four sisters having similarly long or even longer careers. Because they were to have a limited life-span, they were lightly built and almost austere in her fittings, such as roofs of galvanised iron. They were relatively small and had a veed shape and shallow draft to navigate the muddy and silted upper reaches of their upstream runs.Ferries of Sydney Her original engines were 24 hp (nominal) compound steam engines by McKie and Baxter which pushed her to 11 knots. Service history At Fig Tree wharf c 1915 From 1900, the Balmain New Ferry Company began a period of expansion to keep up and compete with the tram network expanding into what is now referred to as Sydney's Inner West. Older ferries were sold off including several series of \\"Lady-class\\" class ferries were introduced. Lady Ferguson was the last of five in the Balmain company's final series of \\"Lady-class\\" ferries, the others being Ladies Chelmsford (1910), Denman (1912), Edeline (1913), and Scott (1914). This series was introduced to replace the single-ended ferries on the Lane Cove River service. They also worked on the run from Balmain to Erskine Street wharf (at site of current Barangaroo). Lady Ferguson, and the rest of the Balmain fleet, were bought by Sydney Ferries Limited as part of its take over of the Balmain company on 1 March 1918. The five operated the Lane Cove River services to Fig Tree until 12 November 1931 when weekday services were suspended. They ran weekend services to Fig Tree on weekends until 2 September 1945. Lane Cove River services were discontinued altogether on 10 November 1950, after which the five saw them work the Parramatta River and across other routes. Sydney Ferries ran a service to Balmain until it was taken over in 1939 by Nicholson Brothers Harbour Transport Company with their own ferries. The five \\"Lady class\\" ferries were run on other routes across the Harbour. In 1932, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened, and Sydney Ferries Ltd's annual patronage dropped from 40 million to about 15 million. As part of economy measures, almost older and/or larger steamers were put up for sale, and the five \\"Lady- class\\" ferries were converted to diesel power in the 1930s with Lady Chelmsford first. Their tall black smoke stacks were replaced with short funnels. Facing uncertain post-Bridge times, Sydney Ferries Ltd sought a refreshed look for their ferries, covering the original livery of varnished timber and white trim with yellow and green paint and red trim. In 1937, Lady Ferguson re-entered service with a six-cylinder 65 hp Henty & Gardner diesel that pushed her to 9 knots. The five \\"Lady\\" ferries continued to run the Hunters Hill and Balmain services. The post-Bridge drop in demand for the ferry fleet was somewhat mitigated as many could not afford their own transport in the Great Depression of the 1930s and rationing of fuel during World War 2 made the coal required for the steam ferries relatively cheap.Kirawa on ferriesofsydney.com At Valentia Street Wharf (now Woolwich Wharf) as a diesel vessel, 1970 However, the post World War II years saw the drop in demand pick up pace. In 1951, with annual patronage down to 9 million, the NSW State Government took over Sydney Ferries Limited and its remaining fleet and assets. The Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company, which ran the Manly service, was paid to run the services. The services and fleet were quickly rationalised with most of the larger remaining timber K-class steamers being decommissioned, however, the five relatively small and economical \\"Lady- class\\" ferries were retained. Throughout the remainder of the 1950s and into the 1960s, they became the back-bone of Sydney Harbour's non-Manly ferry fleet, along with Karginal and Karrabee the smallest of the K-class ferries. Their routes were expanded to all inner-harbour (ie, non-Manly) services including Taronga Park Zoo, Milsons Point, Cremorne and Hunters Hill. The five sister ferries (except Lady Scott) were re-engined again in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Lady Ferguson received a 4-cylinder 300 bhp Crossley Brothers diesel that pushed her to 10 knots. In the 1960s the Board updated all their ferries' 1930s green and gold livery to a more muted cream and khaki scheme. Demise Behind Kosciusko boarded up ready for the trip to Hobart, 1975 Lady Ferguson acted as a relief vessel from 1963. In the 1970s, the fleet were painted in the Public Transport Commission's blue and white scheme, except for Lady Ferguson who was the last ferry to wear the green and cream. By the 1970s, her condition was deteriorating and she was set aside for disposal in 1974. She was towed to Hobart with Kosciusko in 1975 to assist following the collapse of the Tasman Bridge, however, upon arrival she was found to be in too poor condition to be used. She was broken up in 1977 in Hobart. Lady Chelmsford, the first built of the five, was sold in 1969 and rebuilt as a show boat in Adelaide. She was sold to Melbourne interests in 1985 where she was used as a cruise boat. She sank at her moorings in 2008 and was broken up in 2011. Lady Scott was sold out of ferry service in 1969 and used as a cruise ferry. A 1972 fire destroyed her superstructure and she was rebuilt as the John Cadman and undertook a successful career as a cruise boat before being sold in 2000s and falling into disrepair and broken up in 1914. Lady Denman was pulled from ferry service in 1979 following the introduction that year of the new Lady Street. She is now on permanent land display at Huskisson on the New South Wales south coast. Lady Edeline was the longest serving as a Sydney ferry being decommissioned in 1984 with the remaining wooden K-class ferries following the Karrabee's sinking earlier that year. She was laid up on the Parramatta River and sank into the mud in 1988. Of the original five, only Lady Denman is extant.

It has the dual function to manage both current records and historical archives. The general historical archives are openly accessible to the general public up to 1975. Along with the ICRC Library, the archives are widely considered to be the greatest repository for records on International Humanitarian Law (IHL). They have been dubbed by some researchers as \\"the storehouses of sorrow\\", since they preserve the memory of many millions of victims of armed conflicts as > \\"a legacy for mankind\\".  History = Early Period  Rue du Puits-St-Pierre 4 The ICRC - or rather its predecessor - was founded in February 1863 at the \\"Ancient Casino\\" in the Rue de L'Ev√™che 3 of Geneva's Old Town by five men: businessman-turned- activist Henry Dunant, who had laid out the basic ideas in his much-acclaimed book A Memory of Solferino; lawyer and philanthropist Gustave Moynier; the medical doctors Louis Appia and Th√©odor Maunoir; and the General Guillaume Henri Dufour. Bourbaki army in Lausanne 1871 taken care of by volunteers from the Swiss Red Cross section of the Canton of Vaud At the same moment, its archives came into being: > \\"Dunant, as secretary, signed off the minutes of the first meeting of the > International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, the precursor of the > ICRC. Still unaware of what would follow but hopeful that Dunant‚Äôs vision > would bear fruit, the young Committee preserved this document and the ones > that followed in order to account for their decisions and actions.\\" Ancien fonds, up to the red folders The actual address of the newly-founded Red Cross - and thus probably of its fledgling archives - became Dunant's private residence, the third floor of his family's \\"Maison Diodati\\" in the Old Town at Rue du Puits-Saint-Pierre 4. It remained there for the first few years. However, as Dunant's colonial businesses in Algeria collapsed, he declared bankruptcy in 1867 and was pushed out of the ICRC by its president Moynier in the following year. It may be assumed that Dunant's ICRC-related records were transferred to Moynier's splendid city residence in Rue de l'Ath√©n√©e No. 8 at first. Rue de l'Ath√©n√©e 3 In the first half of the 1870s, the ICRC moved into an apartment of a building at Rue de l'Ath√©n√©e No. 3, just across the street from Moynier's private residence. While it was a very representative address, the office spaces were still rather modest with just three rooms. Likewise, the archives and the library moved into the new Bureau. During those early years, the archives collected information from various conflicts, especially the 1864 Second Schleswig War between the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire on the one hand side, and the Kingdom of Denmark on the other, followed by the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71). Subsequently, the ICRC archives took over the archival holdings of the Basel Agency with some twelve linear meters of records about prisoners of wars (PoW) from the latter war and of the Trieste Agency with one linear meter of files on PoW from the Great Eastern Crisis in the Balkans between the Russian and Ottoman Empires and their respective allies (1875-1878). A main focus was the collection of information about the implementation of IHL, particularly with regard to the First Geneva Convention of 1864. However, the primary task of the archives was to record diplomatic correspondence in order to account for the institution's humanitarian mandate. In the following decades the archives kept on documenting the evolution of the Red Cross movement. However, those oldest holdings covering more than half a century - the Ancien Fonds - still only amounted to rather modest eight linear meters.  World War I  IPWA volunteers in front of the mus√©e Rath Shortly after the beginning of the First World War in 1914, the ICRC under its president Gustave Ador decided to establish the International Prisoners-of-War Agency (IPWA). Its main task was to trace PoW and to re-establish communications with their respective families. Already at the end of the same year, it had a staff of some 1,200 volunteers who worked in the Mus√©e Rath of Geneva. Many of them were girls, women, and students. Ren√©e-Marguerite Cramer, first ever female Committee member, director in the Sections of the Entente Their mandate was based on resolution VI of the 9th conference of Washington in 1912 and hence limited to military personnel. However, the committee member and medical doctor Fr√©d√©ric Ferri√®re founded a civilian section against the advice of other committee members. It soon became commonly associated with the ICRC and significantly contributed to its positive image, thus also to its first Nobel Peace Prize in 1917 (The ousted Dunant had received the first one in 1901 as an individual). √âtienne Clouzot at the mus√©e Rath, where he also published an IPWA news bulletin One of its early activists was the French writer Romain Rolland, who volunteered in the sub-division for missing civilians until July 1915. When he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for 1915, he donated half of the prize money to the Agency. His friend, the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, provided a lively description of the commitment: > \\"A rough stool, a small table of unpolished deal, the turmoil of > typewriters, the bustle of human beings questioning, calling one to another, > hastening to and fro - such was Romain Rolland's battlefield in this > campaign against the afflictions of the war. Here, while other authors and > intellectuals were doing their utmost to foster mutual hatred, he endeavored > to promote reconciliation, to alleviate the torment of a fraction among the > countless sufferers by such consolation as the circumstances rendered > possible. He neither desired, nor occupied a leading position in the work of > the Red Cross; but, like so many other nameless assistants, he devoted > himself to the daily task of promoting the interchange of news. His deeds > were inconspicuous, and are therefore all the more memorable. [..] Ecce > homo! Ecce poeta!\\" √âtienne Clouzot (1881‚Äì1944) - an archivist palaeographer, who was also a columnist for the liberal daily newspaper Journal de Gen√®ve (which had published an anonymous essay by Dunant about Solferino and thus played a role in the founding of the ICRC, illustrating the networking connections of Geneva's patrician family dynasties) - became the director of one of the Entente sections and designed the classification system for the millions of index cards.  Between the World Wars  Promenade du Pin At the end of 1918, the ICRC - along with its archives and library - moved to its new headquarters at the Promenade du Pin at the edge of the Old Town. In the following year, Clouzot (see above) rose to be head of the ICRC Secretariat in 1919, and therefore took over the responsibility for the running of the archives and the library. > \\"In the 1920s, after a brief period in which many different methods of > records management were used, the Secretariat arranged its archives in two > main groups, one for legal, diplomatic and administrative matters, the other > for operations, under the auspices of the Committee's Delegation Commission > (Commission des Missions).\\" A group of men with an ICRC delegate during the Greco-Turkish War The IPWA stopped operating in 1924, but the ICRC archives kept on collecting information from various armed conflicts which in many cases may be considered a continuation of WWI. Amongst them were: * the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), and after a relatively quite decade * the Chaco War (1932‚Äì1935), * the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935-1936), * the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), * and the Second Sino-Japanese War (starting in 1937). Villa Moynier Only in 1930 did the ICRC start to keep and store personal files on its staff, a practise which illustrated > \\"the new tasks in the realm of coordinating humanitarian action that began > to fall to the ICRC.\\" In 1932/33, the ICRC moved its headquarters away from the Old Town to the \\"Villa Moynier\\". It had been built in 1848 for the banker Barth√©lemy Paccard and was then owned by his son-in-law Gustave Moynier (1826-1910), who was the first president of the ICRC and stayed in that office for a record-term of 47 years until his death. Situated in the middle of the large Parc Moynier on the shores of Lake Geneva, the Villa had housed the League of Nations in 1926. It was also during those two decades between the two world wars that the ICRC developed > \\"notions of historical memory and preserving memory for the sake of all > humanity in relation to the archives\\".  World War II  An IBM Watson machine, which could sort 24.000 index cards per hour The Agency archives at Plainpalais The IWPA was re-opened two weeks after the beginning of the Second World War as the Central Agency for Prisoners of War, now based on the mandate from the 1929 Geneva Convention. Once again, √âtienne Clouzot played a prominent role: > \\"in 1939, fuelled by his experience in the International Prisoners of War > Agency, he helped organize the Central Prisoners of War Agency, becoming a > member of its Technical Directorate\\" Fritz Bilfinger's telegram from Hiroshima to Marcel Junod in Tokyo Another key person became Suzanne Ferri√®re, who had assisted her uncle Fr√©d√©ric at the IPWA during WWI and now instituted a new family messaging system. Already in October 1939, IBM \\"provided the Agency free of charge with both staff and Watson machines. The latter, thanks to a perforated card system, made it possible to sort and classify information at high speed.\\" Faced with a gigantic growth of personal and institutional data which was handled by some 3,000 staff, the ICRC in 1942 introduced its first filing system. Altogether, the number of index cards rose to about 45 million and the number of transmitted messages to some 120 million, reflecting the new dimensions of human suffering. The ICRC's efforts were awarded in 1944 with its second Nobel Peace Prize after 1917. One of the last - and most important - documents from the WWII period was issued on 29 August 1945, only days before the end of the war, by Fritz Bilfinger, an ICRC delegate who reached the apocalyptic ruins of Hiroshima just some three weeks after the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped the atomic bomb \\"Little Boy\\" on the Japanese city. His telegram, kept in the archives, recorded a chilling warning of the horrors of the Atomic Age: > ‚Äúconditions appalling stop city wiped out, eighty percent all hospitals > destroyed or seriously damaged; inspected two emergency hospitals, > conditions beyond description full stop effect of bomb mysteriously serious > stop many victims, apparently recovering, suddenly suffer fatal relapse due > to decomposition of white blood cells and other internal injuries, now dying > in great numbers stop estimated still over one hundred thousand wounded in > emergency hospitals located surroundings, sadly lacking bandaging materials, > medicines stop.‚Äù  Decolonisation and \\"Cold War\\"  Jean Pictet in 1937 In 1946/47 the ICRC moved its headquarters from the Villa Moynier to the former Carlton Hotel, built in 1876. The neoclassical building on a hill above the Palace of Nations was provided to the organisation by the Canton of Geneva through a long-term lease. At the same time, the IHL expert Jean Pictet (1914-2002) - who hailed from a Geneva family owning Pictet & Cie bank and played a key role in drafting the 1949 Geneva Conventions for the protection of victims of war - created the Archives Division: > \\"A general comprehensive filing plan was then adopted in 1950 ‚Äì the so- > called 'Pictet Plan', in reference to its creator, Jean Pictet, who was then > director of the Division of General Affairs, which included the archives. > The filing plan comprised both thematic and geographic referential > numbering. It applied to the whole institution until 1972 and to the > Archives Division until 1997.\\" Che Guevera on behalf of Fidel Castro to the ICRC asking for recognition of the revolutionary movement Meanwhile, the ICRC archives grew with the increase of conflicts during decolonisation and the so-called Cold War, which was a \\"hot war\\" in many places. They included: * the French Indochina War (1946‚Äì1954); * the 1948 Palestinian Exodus; * the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953); * the Suez Crisis and the Hungarian Revolution (1956); * the Algerian War of Independence (1954‚Äì1962); * the Congo Crisis (1960‚Äì1965); * the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) * the North Yemen Civil War (1962‚Äì1970); In 1963, the ICRC received its third Nobel Peace Prize after 1917 and 1944, making it the recipient of the most awards up to now. Already three years ago, the Central PoW Agency had acquired a permanent status within the ICRC as the Central Tracing Agency. Thus it was prepared to expand its acitivites in more conflicts that broke out in subsquent years, particularly in: * the Vietnam War (1964-1975); * the Six-Day War of 1967; * the Nigeria-Biafra War (1967‚Äì1970); * the Greek junta (1967-1974); * the coup d'√©tat against President Salvador Allende in Chile (1973); * the 1973 Yom Kippur War; * the 1974 Cyprus conflict; * the end of the Portuguese colonial empire in the wars of independence in Mozambique and Angola (1975); and * the Cambodian genocide (1975-1979) and Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War (1978-1989) Until 1973, public access to records of the archives was generally barred, though the ICRC directorate could consider individual requests. It was 110 years after its inception that the ICRC Assembly as the governing body of the organisation formalised this case-by-case practise as a first step of opening up: > \\"The system of ad hoc derogations allowing access to select archival > materials was however denounced by researchers as being incoherent, partial > and subjective. Furthermore, by the late 1970s and 1980s, the social mood > began channelling growing criticism towards the ICRC‚Äôs perceived role and > stance during the Second World War, specifically regarding the Nazi genocide > and concentration camps. Voices were raised across society calling for > accountability for the perceived lack of action by the ICRC, and for > transparency in relation to its past. The institution‚Äôs reputation was being > challenged from several angles. If prior to this the ICRC had managed its > image by mostly keeping its archives out of the public arena, it seemed that > maintaining its reputation depended on bringing them to the fore, albeit > with due respect for confidentiality. In terms of public image, transparency > was becoming a stronger tool than secrecy.\\" In 1979, the ICRC created a precedent when it granted unlimited access to Jean-Claude Favez, professor at the University of Geneva, for his study about the role of the ICRC in the Holocaust. He only published his book in 1988, but it was groundbreaking both for Switzerland in general and the ICRC in particular. Just in the previous year, the former top-diplomat Cornelio Sommaruga had become the new ICRC President. He has been widely credited for leading the opening of the archives, which in 1984 had moved into a newly constructed seven-storey administrative office block next to the historical \\"Le Carlton\\" headquarters, symbolising the transition into a modern archival culture. Yet, despite Sommaruga's efforts the ICRC governing body took its time. Hence, it was only at the very end of the Cold War - in May 1990 - that the ICRC Assembly finally confirmed the mandate of the Archives Division to comply with the \\"principles of modern archiving\\" and open up. However, researchers still had to sign an agreement not to publish their findings without the assent of the ICRC. Texts had to be submitted and were subejct to having material deleted.  Post-Cold War  It took almost another six years - until January 1996 - that the ICRC Assembly officially adopted the right of the general public for access to the archives and defined a policy of transparency. Protective embargo periods were ruled to be fifty years for general archives and 100 years for personal files. \\"It is worth noting that some within the ICRC had proposed even longer protection periods.\\" Subsequently, the files of the general archives from 1863 to 1950 were opened to the public in full, altogether almost 500 linear metres of records. Serge and Beate Klarsfeld The first researcher to enjoy the opening was the British human rights journalist Caroline Moorehead, who was writing an official chronicle of the ICRC history: Dunant's Dream. She was soon followed by the French historian and nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld with his association of the\\" Sons and Daughters of Jews Deported from France\\". Already two years later he published a collection of documents from the archives about the internment and deportation of French Jews during WWII. In 1997, the archives adopted a new filing plan - B AI (Services g√©n√©raux ‚Äì Archives institutionnelles) - which included computerized documents. In 2004, the archives released a second set of general archives containing the files from 1951 to 1965, again some 500 linear metres. In the same year, the ICRC Assembly reduced the protection period for general files from fifty to forty years, and the embargo on personal files from one hundred to sixty years. On 19 June 2007, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) added the IWPA archives to the Memory of the World Register > \\"to prevent collective amnesia, promote the conservation of archive and > library collections throughout the world and ensure that they are > disseminated as widely as possible.\\" In 2008/9, a rotunda was constructed at the HQ administrative building which houses the archives, providing a new reception area for visiting researchers as well. In 2010, the Public Archives were merged with the ICRC Library and the ICRC Photos archives under the umbrella of the ICRC Information Management service in order to cope with the growing complexity of big data and at the same time the fragmentation of information due to the rapid evolution of digital technologies. In the same year, the ICRC formally adopted an electronic filing system, called B RF (Services g√©n√©raux ‚Äì Archives g√©n√©rales des unit√©s, Reference Files). Subsequently, tailormade automation processes, including more recently the use of artificial intelligence (ai), have been explored to adequately preserve the institutional memory. As part of this modernisation process, the archives expanded in 2011 into the new ICRC logistics hub in Satigny, near Geneva Airport. Construction was partly financed by the Swiss government, and the land was provided by the canton of Geneva. The main archives and library services to the public have stayed at the HQ though. In 2015, the archives released its third batch from the general files on the armed conflicts up to 1975 (see above), including information on Nelson Mandela's detention. In 2017, the ICRC once again revised the access rules to its public archives: protection periods were increased by ten years in order to ensure confidentiality as the ICRC standard operating principle and data privacy protection, especially with regard to protracted conflicts. This means that the embargo on general files is back to fifty years as between 1996 and 2004, while individual files stay closed for seventy years. According to these new rules of access, > \\"the next section of the ICRC general archives, covering the period from > 1976 to 1985, will be opened to the public in 2035.\\"  Collections and Holdings  The public and audiovisual archives are divided into five sections: # The general public archives contain documents, mostly in French language, which cover the history of the ICRC since its foundation in 1863 until 1975; # The Tracing Agency archives, which feature data about individuals, are technically open to the public until the 1950s. However, they are not open to general consultation as people have to go through the ICRC's tracing archivists. The only exception are all individual records relating to some two million prisoners of WWI- especially records of capture, of transfers between camps and of deaths in detention - which were made accessible online. The index cards primarily deal with the Western, Romanian and Serbian Fronts. Consultation of files on PoW and civilian internees during the Spanish Civil War or the Second World War requires specific skills. Hence, anyone can request information on an individual but the archives accept only a limited amount of requests per year because of limited resources. The tracing archives' files about people caught up in more recent conflicts are closed to the public, but the person visited in detention or their family can obtain information upon request. # The photo library and archives contain more than 800,000 images from the ICRC's global activities since the 1860s. About 125,000 of them have been made available to the public in digital format. # The film archives contain, as of early 2020, around 5,000 titles with some 1,000 hours of footage covering the ICRC's humanitarian work in conflicts around the world from 1921 to the present day, in a range of formats (video, 35 mm and 16 mm film). # The audio archives hold more than 10,000 digitized sound files with thousand of hours of content, starting in the second half of the 1940s. The public archives at the HQ The archives also hold private collections of documents that were deposited by former members of the Committee and delegates. As of early 2020, the ICRC archives held approximately: * 9 million digital documents, * 19 linear kilometers of shelf space for paper records, * 34 terrabytes of audiovisual electronic media, and * 41 million index cards about individual persons from the two World Wars. About 1.500 researchers on average consult the archives and library collections - both public and closed ones - every year. For 2019, the archives counted around 1.4 million page views on its websites. In the course of the same year, its staff handled about 11,000 requests, both external and internal ones.

Like other ginsenosides, it is found in the plant genus Panax (ginseng), and has a variety of potential health effects including anticarcinogenic, immunomodulatory, anti‚Äêinflammatory, antiallergic, antiatherosclerotic, antihypertensive, and antidiabetic effects as well as antistress activity and effects on the central nervous system.  Pharmacological effects  A 1998 study by Seoul National University reported that GRb1 and GRg3 (ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg3) significantly attenuated glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting the overproduction of nitric oxide synthase among some other findings regarding their neuroprotective properties. In 2002, the Laboratory for Cancer Research in Rutgers University showed that GRb1 and GRg1 have neuroprotective effect for spinal cord neurons, while ginsenoside Re did not exhibit any activity. GRb1 and GRg1 are proposed to represent potentially effective therapeutic agents for spinal cord injuries. The protection that GRg1 (ginsenoside Rg1) and GRb1 offer against Alzheimer‚Äôs disease symptoms in mice was first published by researchers in 2015. The GRg1 affected three metabolic pathways: the metabolism of lecithin, amino acids and sphingolipids, while GRb1 treatment affected lecithin and amino acid metabolism. It was reported in 2017 that GRb1 improved cardiac function and remodelling in heart failure in mice. The treatment of H-ginsenoside Rb1 potentially attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis.  Proposed biosynthesis  The proposed biosynthesis of ginsenoside Rb1 in left The biosynthesis of GRb1 in Panax ginseng starts from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), which is converted to squalene with squalene synthase (SQS), then to 2,3-oxidosqualene with squalene epoxidase (SE). The 2,3-oxidasqualene is then converted to dammarenediol-II by cyclization, with dammarenediol-II synthase (DS) as the catalyst. The dammarenediol-II is converted to protopanaxadiol and then to ginsenoside Rd. Finally, GRb1 is synthesized from ginsenoside Rd, catalysed by UDPG:ginsenoside Rd glucosyltransferase (UGRdGT), a biosynthetic enzyme of GRb1 first discovered in 2005.

Biography Ismail hailed from the Buuhoodle Region. He completed his primary education in Xadadhan. He went to Cumar Samatar High School in Galkayo. He then went on to become a high school teacher in that same high school he had attended. Ismail's educations did not end there, he completed his undergraduate degree at Lafoole University majoring in biology. He was then awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Oxford University where he studied Environment and Agriculture. Upon completing his studies, he chose to return to his motherland and was appointed Director of the Somali Range Agency. In 1998, Ismail migrated to Hamilton, New Zealand and worked for many years in his community. He was the President of the Waikato Refugee Forum as well as serving as President of the Muslim Association. He held these titles for over 10 years respectively. In New Zealand, for his contribution to community and refugee resettlement work here, Ismail received a Hamilton Civic Award in 2009. Ismail was instrumental in setting up Hamilton's first Islamic early childcare centre - a centre that had a policy to also employ non-Muslim teachers and invites enrollments from families across all faiths. Ismail was also known as someone who championed the cause of Muslim girls learning to embrace New Zealand's outdoor pursuits from kayaking to abseiling and tramping. He played a pivotal role in convincing and supporting families to encourage girls to take up these activities with confidence. Ismail passionately championed many causes, but his biggest cause was always humanity. One of Ismail's many legacies was the impact he had on the integration, guidance and education of young Muslim former refugees and immigrants in Waikato. In the light of the recent anti- racism rallies around the world and in New Zealand, Farouk says: \\"Ismail would be very pleased it‚Äôs not only Africans or people of colour marching but everyone. Justice transcends borders and cultures ... I know that‚Äôs what he would say ... look at all these people coming together.\\" At the time he was president of the Waikato Muslim Association, there were nearly 40 different nationalities of Muslims at the Hamilton masjid. \\"You had to compromise, negotiate, bring them together. Ismail was a man of wisdom and had a natural power to negotiate.\\" Ismail negotiated with all the challenges that came his way as a refugee arriving in New Zealand. For 20 years he devoted his energy towards uplifting other refugees and immigrants here. It's as though his life came full circle, with him returning to help rebuild his country of birth and doing what he loved best ‚Äì making a difference. Mustafa Farouk says what his friend's life \\"exemplified is it's about looking after everybody ... it's about tenacity, about going against all odds to do something for someone where you don't get paid, where you don't even get 'thank you'. \\"Ismail exemplified service. That's what I hope everybody will take from Ismail‚Äôs legacy.\\" After living in New Zealand for many years, he and his family moved to Brisbane, Australia where he had lived for 4 years before returning to his homeland. He was serving as Puntland's Minister of Agriculture, the Environment, and Climate Change at the time of his death in May 2020 from COVID-19.  Death  Ismail was among a group of Ministers who were providing aid in Qardho to families who had lost their homes and livelihoods in the deadly and severe floods. This is where he contracted COVID-19. Somalia as a whole has been heavily impacted during the pandemic. He was transferred to a hospital in Mogadishu for treatment, where he remained hospitalized for several weeks. Ismail Gamadiid's death from COVID-19 at a Mogadishu hospital was confirmed on May 25, 2020. The Government of Puntland issued a statement stating, \\"We have lost the minister of environment and agriculture Ismail Gamadiid may his soul rest in peace,\\" while President of Puntland Said Abdullahi Dani sent condolences to Gamadiid's family. In a statement, President Dani praised Gamadiid, \\"He had done a wonderful job. It's sad that we have lost him at the time the state needed him most. We send our condolences as a government to his family and friends across Somalia.\\" References Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Date of birth unknown Category:2020 deaths Category:Government ministers of Puntland Category:Puntland politicians Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Somalia ","title":"Ismail Gamadiid"},{"id":"64198337","text":"The Gold-Laden Sheep and The Sacred Mountain () is a Nepalese mystery drama film directed by Ridham Janve.

She specializes in painting, but also incorporates multiple multidisciplinary media such as installation art, video art and performance art. Part of her work focuses on human anatomy, the different non-physical layers of the human being, humanism and respect for living beings. Her artworks can be found in the permanent collections of the Hanwei International Arts Center, Beijing, and Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, San Jos√©.  Biography and artistic career = Early life and education  Man Yu was born in Kowloon City, Hong Kong, on February 19th 1978. She is the daughter of Pik Luen Li Kan and Tak Fu Fung Ng, who fought in World War II. The family immigrated to Costa Rica, which Man Yu's father selected because of its lack of army. Man Yu grew up in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, and attended primary school at the Catholic Active School. She has spoken about her childhood experiences of bullying and how this inspired her to explore self-expression through art and writing. Man Yu later enrolled in Veritas University to study advertising design. However, she discontinued studies in 1999 when she became pregnant at the age of 21. After experiencing a number of life stressors, Man Yu returned to the practice of art. She studied under Nelly Eyo, an Argentine artist, exploring painting, pastel, and the human figure. She also was a student of for several years, learning about oil painting in his workshop. Women of the Orient  By 2005, Man Yu had completed her first collection of works, titled Women of the Orient, with 10 large-format works in pastel that referred to the symbolism, color, and mysticism of Asian culture, and specifically exemplification of Asian women. In addition to approach the aesthetic from figurativism, concepts such as motherhood, nostalgia, marriage and women in general are addressed too. The series combines Japanese geishas and Chinese operas with Man Yu's explicit purpose of reflecting that despite the insistence of the Japanese and Chinese people to differentiate themselves and not be confused together, the essence of femininity in their traditions and allegorical aesthetics are similar and projected to the West where they are received with the same cultural perception. This collection was exhibited for the first time in 2016 as a solo exhibition in the 1887 Gallery of the National Center for Culture in Costa Rica. This was Man Yu's first exhibition experience and she opened the exhibition as a Chinese festival with food and lion dancing. The pieces in the collection were also exhibited at the Confucius Institute in Costa Rica.  Traje Humano (Human Suit)  Inspired by a childhood painting, Man Yu decided to start a new series of works, Traje Humano (Human Suit). The multimedia series includes 28 works painted between 2013 and 2019 (added to her original 1987 painting from childhood), two installations, and several multidisciplinary artistic collaborations that involved video, performance, fashion design, videomapping and happenings with 33 other artists from various disciplines. Her collaborators included video artists, dancers, musicians, and fashion designers. Costa Rica's Minister of Culture Sylvie Dur√°n and the President of the Republic Carlos Alvarado declared the exhibition to be of national cultural interest. The exhibit appeared at the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, the Municipal Museum of Cartago, the Arts Center of the Technological Institute of Costa Rica, the Cultural Center of Spain, the Beijing World Art Museum, and the Women's Museum of Costa Rica. The last work of the Human Suit circuit, executed on August 30, 2019, earned considerable media attention. The performance/happening I'm Not This Suit involved around 100 naked people, as commentary on the stigmas and social conditioning of the burdens (\\"trajines\\" in spanish) that each person lives with in their human suits. The performance was the first massive public artistic nude in the Central American region. According to the Latin American art magazine Hypermedia Magazine, the Traje Humano project caught the attention of the Costa Rican and Central American art scene, not only because it was the first time that so many artists joined to expand the work of a single living artist and for making of the first massive nude public in the region, but also because it set a precedent in the cultural management of the region by also involving for the first time a wide portfolio of public, private and independent collaborators who supported a project of social and humanistic public exhibition with art.  Awards and recognition  Man Yu was part of the team that won the award for best short film at the 2019 European International Film Festival, for No. 77873B. Her work was declared by the Costa Rican government to be of national cultural interest. She represented Costa Rica at the Beijing International Art Biennale of 2017 and the Latin American Art Festival in Beijing in 2019. In 2019, she was selected to represent Costa Rica in a series of official China Post commemorative envelopes.

Its origins go back, as in other Latin American countries, to the colonialism of the 16th century, specifically during the formation of the Spanish Empire and the processes of extermination, slavery or miscegenation of the natives of the area.  Types of racism in Chile= Racism against indigenous peoples  With a significant racist mentality, the conquest of the territories of Bolivia and Peru in the 19th century was justified. Chileans saw themselves as representatives of the superior white race, conquering the lower race. Between the second half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century, what was called the Selk'nam genocide took place, where European, Argentine and Chilean settlers exterminated the Selk'nam or Ona people, an Amerindian people who inhabited the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, in the extreme south of the country. This genocide had both economic and racist reasons in between. This attitude was maintained in the Pinochet-led dictatorship, which remained in power until 1990, an example of that is that the Chilean admiral Jos√© Toribio Merino described the Bolivians as \\"metamorphic representatives of the camel\\". Despite the significant dismissal of the local population, Chileans still have widespread neglect of the indigenous population, particularly the Mapuche, who have been distinguished by considerable opposition.  Racism against blacks  Due to the early ban of slavery after Chile's independence and the previous few black slaves during the Spanish rule, Chile had almost no black population. Since the end of the military dictatorship, the first immigrants arrived, but few where from African ancestry, being most of them from neighbour countries like Peru. In 2014, for the first time a bigger group of black migrants arrived in Chile and created a diaspora mainly from Haiti. Neo-Nazi movements chasing blacks in the country were recorded in the 90's and early 00's, but they targeted mainly LGBT, homeless and punks due to the lack of black people at the time.  Anti-semitism  The first case of large- scale incitement of anti-Semitic hysteria in Chile was the idea of the \\"Andinia Plan\\" formed in the 19th century in parallel with the beginning of the migration of Jews from the Russian Empire to the American continents: fears arose between the Chilean population about the desire of the Jews to steal the lands of Patagonia to form their own state in them. According to the Anti-Defamation League, cases of desecration of Jewish cemeteries and insults, or the call for retaliation against Jews, graffiti in synagogues are widespread in Chile.

Her novel Sounds Like Titanic: A Memoir was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Autobiography in 2019. She is also an Associate professor of English at Northern Kentucky University. Growing up in West Virginia, Hindman played the violin throughout elementary, middle, and high school. She was encouraged to apply to Columbia University for Middle Eastern studies although her parents were unable to afford full tuition. By her senior year, she was in desperate need of money to pay her tuition and applied as a professional violinist in The Composer‚Äôs Ensemble. She spent four years pretending to play the violin while a soundtrack drowned out her music until she became addicted to cocaine and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. After getting psychological help, she was hired as an admissions secretary at Columbia and earned her MFA in creative nonfiction writing. Hindman accepted a position as an Associate professor of English at Northern Kentucky University where she then published her novel Sounds Like Titanic: A Memoir. Her memoir was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Autobiography in 2019. Early life Hindman was born and raised in West Virginia to a doctor and social worker. Although she aspired to play the violin at the age of five, her parents were unable to provide her with one due to the lack of teachers available. Her parents eventually bought her one for her eighth birthday and drove several hours across Virginia for her lessons. She continued to play the violin throughout her school years and performed at school assemblies. Education During her high school years, her boyfriend at the time convinced her to study at a college in the Northeast. Although her parents were unable to afford full tuition, she moved to New York and attended Columbia University. Hindman later revealed that her boyfriend was abusive in an essay titled Advanced Placement, which received a Reader‚Äôs Choice Award. Originally enrolled in their music program, she switched to Middle Eastern studies which landed her on a study-abroad program in Egypt during 9/11. By her senior year, she needed money to pay her tuition after already donated her eggs and trying ‚Äúall sorts of terrible jobs.\\" She applied for a job as a professional violinist at The Composer‚Äôs Ensemble and was surprised when they hired her. Unknowingly to her at the time, her job required her to perform at shopping malls, craft fairs, and local PBS stations across the country for eight hours. However, instead of playing in front of a live microphone, her boss played the soundtrack of a different violinist. Although she said it felt degrading, the job paid well and she needed the money. She was also forced to sell CDs to earn bonuses and slowly became addicted to amphetamines and cocaine in order to stay awake and work more hours. During this time, Hindman was also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder based in an existential terror. After touring with The Composer‚Äôs Ensemble across America for their God Bless America tour, Hindman moved back home and lived in her parent's basement. She described feeling physically intact but losing her grip on reality. Due to her anxiety disorder, she was too afraid to go outside and began seeing a psychiatrist. Following six months of treatment, she was hired at Columbia as an admissions secretary, which allowed her to enroll in its writing course for free. As the job also secured her with free health care, she began to recover from her anxiety disorder and began drafting her memoir Sounds Like Titanic in 2005. During her second year in the writing program, she applied for teaching fellowships and began to work towards becoming a professor. Career Hindman earned her PhD in English from the University of North Texas in 2013 and based her dissertation on her experiences in The Composer‚Äôs Ensemble. Her dissertation earned her the Toulouse Dissertation Fellowship and a position as an assistant professor of English at New Mexico Highlands University. She eventually joined the faculty in the Department of English at Northern Kentucky University in 2014 as an assistant professor. She was eventually promoted to Associate professor of English in 2019 and received the Northern Kentucky University's Excellence in Research Award. That same year, she published her debut novel Sounds Like Titanic: A Memoir which focused on her experience in The Composer‚Äôs Ensemble. It was named a finalist for the 2019 National Book Critics Circle Award in Autobiography and named a one of Amazon's Best Books of 2019.

Personal life Hickey was born in Wellington, the son of a prominent local journalist and editor, M. C. Hickey. He became a businessman in Wellington. His wife Amy (nee Eversleigh) died on 27 May 1909 after a short illness; they had been married only 11 months. He died after an illness in June 1919. Their daughter survived them. Cricket career Hickey was a slow leg-spin bowler who was prominent in Wellington club cricket for the Phoenix and East clubs in the years before the First World War. His success for East held back the early career of his club teammate, fellow leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett. His best first-class bowling figures were 4 for 50 and 3 for 36 in Wellington's victory over Canterbury in 1909-10. In a two-day non-first-class match between Wellington and Nelson in Wellington in December 1902, Hickey, bowling unchanged throughout the first innings, took 9 for 27, puzzling the Nelson batsmen with his slow leg-breaks. His batting was seldom productive, but he did score 35 to give Wellington a chance of victory in the Plunket Shield match against Auckland in 1910-11.

The special was produced by Rankin/Bass Productions, a former division of Tomorrow Entertainment, using their \\"Animagic\\" stop-motion puppetry technique in Japan, along with some live-action footage shot in Denmark. Traditional animation (possibly by Osamu Tezuka's Mushi Production with Steve Nakagawa's involvement) and special effects were also featured. The special, a musical adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fable The Emperor's New Clothes, starred Danny Kaye as the voice of the narrator and main character, Marmaduke. Kaye was strongly associated with the author, having previously played the title role in the 1952 film Hans Christian Andersen, and also provided his voice for Seymour S. Sassafras in Rankin/Bass' 1971 Easter television special, Here Comes Peter Cottontail. The cast also included Australian actor Cyril Ritchard, Imogene Coca, Allen Swift and Bob McFadden. Kaye sang five original songs written by Maury Laws and Jules Bass: \\"Come Along with Me\\", \\"Clothes Make the Man\\" with Swift, \\"The Tailor's Song\\", \\"Creation\\", and \\"All You Need Is Money to Be Rich\\" with Coca, while Ritchard sang \\"I See What I Want to See\\". Presented under the banner of The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye, the special was a pilot for a series of specials. Cartoonist Jack Davis, who designed characters for the special, also had concept drawings for further specials, which can be glimpsed in the making-of documentary on the 30th anniversary DVD release by Sony Wonder and Classic Media in 2002. No further specials were produced. Plot Danny Kaye tells a group of Danish children the story of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\", from the point of view of Marmaduke, a smooth-talking, yet kindly trickster. Marmaduke and his sidekick Mufti hear that a million gold pieces will be awarded to the tailor who makes the best clothes for the emperor. Marmaduke meets the emperor's daughter, Princess Jane, who tells him about the wicked jester, Jasper. Jasper flatters the vain emperor with luxurious clothing, and is taking control of the empire. Jasper pays the tailors starvation wages, and gets rich himself. Marmaduke vows to stop Jasper, but the emperor has them thrown into the Boulevard of Rogues to work. Marmaduke is patching up an old suit for the emperor. An orphan boy named Busky joins them. They finish the suit, and escape the boulevard, crossing a dangerous moat. Marmaduke tells the emperor that he and Mufti have brought a beautiful suit for him. The emperor sees the ragged suit and orders them to leave. Marmaduke says he has enchanted cloth, invisible to anyone who is stupid or unfit to hold office. He pretends to show the emperor, who cannot admit that he cannot see it. Jasper plans to trick Jane into marriage. Marmaduke, Mufti and Busky pretend to work on the suit that isn't there, as the emperor tries to educate himself so that he's smart enough to see the cloth. Jasper threatens to have his henchman Ivan fire the cannon at the Boulevard of Rogues. He threatens to take the prize money. Marmaduke and his friends concoct a plan. Mufti makes fake coins from brass statues brought by Jane. Marmaduke presents the new suit to the emperor, who gives them the prize money in leather sacks. They hide the fake coins in Ivan's cannon, but Jasper orders them to stop. Real gold coins end up in the cannon. Later, the emperor shows off his new \\"suit.\\" The council gasps at the naked emperor, but Jasper gestures for all to applaud. Jasper tries to arrange a wedding with Jane, but Busky interrupts the procession by laughing and telling the emperor he is naked. The council agrees that the emperor is naked. Furious, the emperor banishes Jasper for allowing Marmaduke to trick him. Busky gives the emperor a note explaining that Jane and Marmaduke are going to marry. Realizing that she loves Marmaduke, the emperor leads a parade through town to the Boulevard of Rogues, and attends the wedding naked. Jasper furiously orders Ivan to fire the cannon into the crowd. The cannon shoots out the golden coins, providing riches to the poor folks of the Boulevard. Mufti mourns the loss of the prize money but Marmaduke is happy as he kisses Jane. Production Danny Kaye recorded the soundtrack for Rankin/Bass in New York City, filmed the live- action segments in Aarhus, and visited the \\"Animagic\\" studio in Tokyo to see the production of the stop-motion animation. When Kaye toured their studio with Arthur Rankin, Jr., the Japanese animators asked him for \\"a sample of the Danny Kaye style.\\" Later, he explained, \\"They wanted to see how I moved my hands, my mouth. Did I wiggle my ears when I sang? How did I walk? How did I walk when I wore a cape, and so on. The technicians painstakingly captured every nuance, every gesture to animate the figures. They're really marvelous.\\" Cast * Danny Kaye: Himself (in the live-action scenes), Marmaduke * Cyril Ritchard: Emperor Klockenlocher * Imogene Coca: Princess Jane Klockenlocher * Allen Swift: Mufti, Ivan * Bob McFadden: Jasper * Gary Shapiro: Busky Crew * Producers/Directors: Arthur Rankin, Jr., Jules Bass * Writer: Romeo Muller * Music and Lyrics: Maury Laws, Jules Bass * Associate Producer: Herbert Bonis * Character Designers: Paul Coker, Jr., Ichiro Komuro * Continuity Designers: Don Duga, Steve Nakagawa * Editorial Supervisor: Irwin Goldress * Sound and Effects Engineers: Jim Harris, John Boyd * Animagic Supervisor: Akikazu Kono * Music Composer, Arranger and Conductor: Maury Laws References Category:1972 television specials Category:Films scored by Maury Laws Category:Rankin/Bass Productions television specials Category:Stop-motion animated television shows Category:Television shows written by Romeo Muller Category:Television programs directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. Category:Television programs directed by Jules Bass Category:Films set in Denmark Category:Films with live action and animation ","title":"The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye"},{"id":"64198843","text":"Goshen is a rural locality in the local government area of Break O'Day in the North-east region of Tasmania.

They were most commonly reported on the battlefields and, during moments of crisis, when citizens were most eager to believe that the gods of their polis were coming to assist them. An alleged visitation or manifestation of a god was known as an epiphaneia (·º° ·ºêœÄŒπœÜŒ¨ŒΩŒµŒπŒ±). Sometimes the gods who appeared were prominent deities, but more often, they were minor figures, whose shrines were linked to the location of a particular event or battle.J. McDonald, ‚ÄòEpiphanies, Military‚Äô in I. Spence, D. Kelly and P. Londey (edd.) Conflict in Ancient Greece and Rome: the Definitive Political, Social and Military Encyclopedia, vol. 1 Santa Barbara, 2016, pp. 262-3. The gods did not always reveal themselves to mortals, but could indicate their presence through physical signs or unusual phenomena.M. P. Nilsson, A History of Greek Religion (translated by F. J. Fielden), Oxford, M. P. 1925, pp. 160-1; R. Parker, On Greek Religion, Ithaca, 2011, pp. 10-11. They could also appear to individuals, particularly in dreams, such as the reported visit by the ‚ÄòMother of the Gods‚Äô to Themistokles who warned of an attempt on his life and, in return for this information, demanded that his daughter be sworn into her service.Plutarch, Themistokles, 30.1-3. Statue of Pheidippides who claimed to have spoken to the god Pan Epiphanies tend to have been reported more frequently at times of extreme danger, such as the Persian Wars. For example, at the Battle of Marathon in 490 it was said that Pan, Theseus, and another hero, fought against the Persians.Herodotos, 8.109.3; Pausanias, 1.15.4, 1.28.4, 1.32.4. See R. Parker, Athenian Religion: a History, Oxford, 1996, pp. 163-4. It was also widely believed that the runner, Pheidippides, on the eve of the battle of Marathon, met with Pan on Mount Parthenion, where the god promised to support the Athenians. After their unexpected victory, the grateful Athenians introduced Pan‚Äôs cult into their city.Herodotos, 6.105.1-106.1; Pausanias, 1.28.4,. See R. Garland, Introducing New Gods: the Politics of Athenian Religion, Ithaca, 1992 47-63. At the Battle of Salamis, visions of the sons of Aias were reported. Themistokles said that the Greek victory over the Persian fleet at Salamis was aided by gods and heroes.Herodotos, 8.64.1-2; Pausanias, 1.36.1. See R. Parker, Athenian Religion: a History, Oxford, 1996, pp. 153-5. It was also reported at Salamis that a supernatural cloud appeared from which could be heard the chants of initiates of the Eleusinian Mysteries and it was said that a serpent representing a local hero swam in the waters assisting the Greek fleet. Herodotos, 8.65, 9.65; Plutarch, Themistokles, 15.1. See W. Burkett, Greek Religion (translated by John Raffan), Oxford, 1985. p. 207. Accounts of attacks on Delphi, the most sacred Panhellenic sanctuary, also attracted reports of battlefield epiphanies. Herodotos says that when Xerxes‚Äô forces attacked the sanctuary in 480, two giant heroes were seen repelling the Persians. Two hundred years later, an inscription at Delphi claimed that Apollo himself had defended his sanctuary against an attack by the Gauls.Herodotos 8.37-38. See V. Penazos and M. Sarla, Delphi, Athens, 1996, pp. 23-5. Illustration from 1838 by M. A. Barth depicting the return of Peisistratos to Athens, accompanied by a woman disguised as Athena, as described by Herodotos At the Battle of Aigospotamoi in 405, the Dioskouroi, were said to have taken the form of stars floating on either side of the ship of the Spartan general, Lysandros.D. H. Kelly, Xenophon‚Äôs Hellenika: a Commentary (ed. J. McDonald), Amsterdam, 2019, pp. 250-1, concerning Plutarch, Lysandros, 12.1. At Argos in 272 an unidentified woman was said to have thrown the tile that struck and killed King Pyrrhos. The Argives later said that this was an epiphany of Demeter.J.

Londey (edd.), Conflict in Ancient Greece and Rome: the Definitive Political, Social and Military Encyclopedia, vol. 1 Santa Barbara, 2016, pp. 262-3. Not all epiphanies were believed. Dionysios of Halikarnassos said that many accounts of epiphanies were ridiculed.Dionysius of Halikarnassos, 2.68.2. There were also cases of fraudulent stories being exposed. Herodotos complained of a ruse by Peisistratos, who dressed a tall woman up to impersonate the goddess Athena and then had her drive him in a chariot into the city so that he could win the support of the Athenians.Herodotos, 1.60.

It was one of the military outposts created during the Second Seminole War to assist Colonel Zachary Taylor's troops to confront and capture Seminole Indians and their allies in the central part of the Florida Territory in the Lake Okeechobee region. The Seminole Indians and their allies were resisting forced removal to federal territory west of the Mississippi River as directed by the Indian Removal Act.Roberts, Robert B.

Brief History On December 2, 1837, Colonel Zachary Taylor ordered the construction of Fort Gardiner during his Second Seminole War campaign as he marched his troops into the Lake Okeechobee region. Colonel Taylor determined that another fortification was required further south, so on December 21, 1837 he ordered another fortification constructed to support his plans. This particular fortification was named Fort Basinger after Lieutenant William E. Basinger who was killed during the battle of Dade's Massacre. Colonel Taylor assigned Captain Monroe of the 4th Artillery in command of Fort Basinger and stationed one company of troops and approximately 85 sick men and some Indians at the fortification. Captain Monroe was also charged with finishing the construction of the blockhouses and stockades around Fort Basinger. The remaining troops marched south from Fort Basinger and on December 25, 1837, they engaged in the Battle of Lake Okeechobee. Colonel Taylor‚Äôs detachment suffered 26 killed and 112 wounded and had to retreat back to Fort Basinger. After a short stay at Fort Basinger Colonel Taylor‚Äôs detachment made their way to Fort Gardiner where they set up a makeshift hospital.

He entered the United States Military Academy on July 1, 1826. While at the Academy his roommate was Joseph E. Johnston and he was Cadet Sergeant-Major under Cadet Adjutant Robert E. Lee. He graduated second in his class on July 1, 1830 without a single demerit. He was promoted to Second Lieutenant, 2nd Artillery on July 1, 1830. In 1831, he served at the garrison at Fort Moultrie, and at the Augusta Arsenal. He returned to the United States Military Academy as an Assistant Instructor of Infantry Tactic from November 24, 1831 to December 19, 1833. From 1834 to 1835, he served at the garrison at Fort Jackson, Louisiana and at Covington, Louisiana. In 1835, he was transferred to Tampa Bay to prepare for defenses against the uprising Seminole Indians and their allies. On December 23, 1835, Brevet Major Francis Langhorne Dade led a detachment of eight officers, including Lt. Basinger, and 100 troops from Tampa to Fort King. On December 28, 1835 this detachment was ambushed by a group of Seminole Indians led by Chief Micanopy and Chief John Jumper and their allies. Lt.

The act converted most sentences from an \\"indeterminate\\" sentence length at the discretion of the parole board to a \\"determinate\\" sentence length specified by the state legislature. The act was one of the largest drivers in a 9x increase in California's prison population in the two decades after the act passed. Origins California created its first **parole** system in 1893 as a mechanism to relieve prison overcrowding by granting early release. In a 1914 California Supreme Court case, _Roberts v. Duffy_ , the court declared: \\"the purpose of the legislature in creating a parole system [...] is to permit the liberation of a prisoner on parole at the earliest period when permitted by law and when on a consideration of the merits of each individual case, parole ought, in the judgment of the board, to be granted.\\" California adopted **indeterminate sentencing** in 1917, as part of a national trend towards indeterminate sentences meant to incentivize rehabilitation. In an indeterminate sentencing framework, for most crimes the sentence is a range, for example \\"5 years to life\\". Under that sentence, after 5 years, or perhaps less time with good behavior, the incarcerated person is reviewed by a parole board periodically until they are found suitable for release. Per the California Supreme Court in 1918: \\"It is generally recognized by the courts and by modern penologists that the purpose of the indeterminate sentence law, like other modern laws in relation to the administration of the criminal law, is to mitigate the punishment which would otherwise be imposed upon the offender. These laws place emphasis upon the reformation of the offender. They seek to make the punishment fit the criminal rather than the crime. They endeavor to put before the prisoner great incentive to well-doing. [...] [T]he purpose is to strengthen his will to do right and lessen his temptation to do wrong.\\" The practical effects of indeterminate sentences evolved over the next several decades. The Prison Reorganization Act of 1944 established the California Adult Authority, which among other responsibilities functioned as the California parole board, with expanded power to review parole candidates using \\"psychiatric and other diagnostic aids\\" and to release prisoners. The Adult Authority became the in-practice sentencing agency for prisoners, because courts could only sentence \\"for the term prescribed by law\\", and the Adult Authority had broad discretion over when a prisoner was actually released. Because it had nearly all control over releases, the Adult Authority became a focal point for the press whenever someone released to parole committed a high-profile crime. This feedback loop resulted in the Adult Authority shifting to delaying parole until a prisoner was thought to be \\"ready to go home\\" ‚Äî a different standard from the original goal that parole be granted as early as possible, to continue rehabilitation in the community. A series of lawsuits and subsequent legislation in the 1970s laid the groundwork for a move away from indeterminate sentences. _Morrissey v. Brewer_ required that parole only be revoked in accordance with due process, which invited scrutiny of all discretionary decisions in the prison system. California Supreme Court cases _In re Lynch_ and _In re Foss_ challenged the constitutionality of broad and variable indeterminate sentences under the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The **Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976** was part of a national trend towards determinate sentences during the 1970s, in an effort to provider greater sentencing equity. It had bi-partisan support, with liberal politicians and organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California and the Prisoners' Union supporting the act because it theoretically provided greater sentencing accountability and procedural fairness, especially in regards to race, ethnic, and educational background. Conservative politicians and law enforcement agencies supported the legislation because it reduced the Adult Authority's ability to release prisoners early, and because they thought it would result in longer prison terms. Legislation Senate Bill 42, aka the Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976, was written by state senator John Nejedly and signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown. It went into effect on July 1st, 1977. Purpose In a reversal from California's historical legislative belief that a primary purpose of prison is rehabilitation, the act amended the penal code to assert that \\"the purpose of imprisonment for crime is punishment\\": > The Legislature finds and declares that the purpose of imprisonment for > crime is punishment. This purpose is best served by terms proportionate to > the seriousness of the offense with provision for uniformity in the > sentences of offenders committing the same offense under similar > circumstances. The Legislature further finds and declares that the > elimination of disparity and the provision of uniformity of sentences can > best be achieved by determinate sentences fixed by statute in proportion to > the seriousness of the offense as determined by the Legislature to be > imposed by the court with specified discretion. Sentencing Policy Instead of leaving prison terms to the discretion of the Adult Authority, the act specified that the legislature must define lower, middle, and upper prison terms for most offenses. For example, robbery under indeterminate sentencing might have a term of \\"5 years to life\\". Under determinate sentencing, the lower, middle, and upper prison terms might be 5, 6, and 7 years respectively. Some offenses, like first-degree murder, continued to have an indeterminate life sentence. Sentencing Under the determinate sentencing law, if a judge chose a prison sentence as punishment for a given offense (as opposed to probation), the defendant would be sentenced to the middle prison term unless aggravating or mitigating circumstances justified sentencing to the upper or lower term. The judge had to state the reasons for the sentencing decision. The base term would then be extended by enhancements for specific details of the crime, for example the use of a firearm, great loss of property, or great bodily injury, as well as the defendant's prior criminal history. Parole Under the initial legislation, parole for most prisoners on a determinate sentence was limited to one year, with parole violations resulting in a return to prison limited to an additional six months in prison. Parole was reframed as an additive period of carceral supervision rather than a continuation of a prison sentence. Parole release as a mechanism to reduce the prison population in times of overcrowding was essentially eliminated as part of the legislation. \\"Good time credits\\" As part of creating greater sentence predictability, the legislation formalized good time credits that would reduce a prison time by up to 1/3rd automatically unless taken away for misconduct or non-participation. Other structural changes The Adult Authority and the Women's Board of Terms and Paroles were replaced with a Community Release Board appointed by the governor. The Community Release Board was responsible for reviewing sentencing decisions for equity, hearing appeals to denial of \\"good time\\" credits, determining if parole should be revoked, and for applying the law retroactively. The Judicial Council of California, the policymaking body of the California courts, was instructed to formulate sentencing guidance, for example when to grant probation, criteria for enhancements, and criteria for selecting upper or lower terms. The Judicial Council was also tasked with reviewing and publishing data on determinate sentences. Prosecutorial discretion increased with the adoption of determinate sentences, as which charges and enhancements a prosecutor decided to pursue had a great effect on the sentence length. This in turn gave prosecutors greater leverage in plea bargains. The general effect of these structural changes was to remove discretion from the parole board and increase the power of the legislature, the judiciary, and prosecutors. Immediate amendments to determinate sentencing Determinate sentencing was substantially amended within two years of being enacted. In 1977, Assembly Bill 476, the \\"Boatwright Bill\\", expanded the set of enhancements and created the stacking of enhancements in some cases. In 1978, Senate Bill 709 increased the middle and upper terms for \\"violent\\" felonies. Also in 1978, Senate Bill 1057, the \\"Public Protection Bill\\", increased the parole supervision period for people serving a determinate sentence to three years, and increased the parole supervision period for people serving a life sentence to five years. As these time periods were often comparable to or longer than the original prison sentence, the parole agency thus gained significant power over someone's state supervision experience, and the potential time that someone on parole could spent back in prison on parole violations was greatly increased. Impact=Anticipated effects While the legislation had bi-partisan support, some criminologists predicted that the goal of more equitable sentencing would be undermined by the enhancement system and increased prosecutorial discretion. Researchers also predicted that sentence lengths would go up over time, because legislators could now respond to public pressure to look \\"tough on crime\\" with revisions to the sentencing terms available for particular crimes. Per one state senator interviewed regarding the legislation: > Public attitudes have gotten tougher over the last five years I have been in > the Senate and the legislature that has responded to the get-tough view. The > people are tired of violent crime and want the legislature to \\"do something\\" > about it. The legislature doesn't know what to do to solve the crime problem > and is frustrated with unsuccessful efforts at rehabilitation. The only > thing we can do immediately is raise penalties. Some tough bills get votes > now [that] they would not have gotten several years ago. Per a New York Times article printed on the date the law took effect, \\"A new state sentencing law took effect today with no one quite sure whether it would, as intended, make the criminal justice system here more equitable and more of a deterrent, or whether it would merely confuse those issues.\\" The article went on to summarize the zeitgeist captured by the law: \\"The Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976, as amended in recent weeks, represents an increasing belief among liberals as well as conservatives that rehabilitation in prison rarely works and is difficult, if not impossible, to judge. Similar legislation to eliminate or curb the power of parole boards is being debated in other states and in the United States Senate.\\" Prison population growth Prison commitments per 100,000 people in California immediately rose from 32.4 in 1977 to 39.2 in 1978, which at the time was the highest rate in the history of the California Department of Corrections. The combination of increasingly long prison sentences and the elimination of parole as an early release mechanism to manage prison populations resulted in an explosion in the prison population over the next two decades. At the end of 1977, 17,338 people were in California prisons. By the end of 1997, 155,276 were in California prisons, a nearly 9x increase. Graph showing the California prison population over time (1925 - 2019) 20 out of the 35 currently operating state prisons were built in response to overcrowding during this window. The California Department of Corrections budget ballooned accordingly, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the state budget: the $346 million budget in 1977 grew to a $4.4 billion budget by 1997. Despite the capacity increase, the rapid population growth resulted in significant prison overcrowding that culminated in a series of lawsuits the put the state's prison medical care system into receivership and put the state under a court order to reduce prison overcrowding. See Prisons in California#Prison population and overcrowding for further details. As Judge Steven Z. Perren, a Superior Court Judge for Ventura County, stated during a 1990 hearing on determinate sentencing: \\"The judges are receiving a mixed message. They're to be more discriminating on who should be sent to prison, yet more laws are passed requiring mandatory incarceration.\\" Recidivism Under the guidance that prison was purely for punishment, the switch to determinate sentences came with decreased spending on rehabilitation. People serving time under a determinate sentence no longer had to demonstrate remorse and accountability to a parole board to be found suitable for parole, and had fewer incentives to participate in or benefit from rehabilitative programming. In 1978, 28% of people on parole returned to prison within 3 years. In 1988, 87% of people on parole returned to prison within 3 years. In the 1990 hearing on determinate sentencing, T.L. Clannon, M.D., Superintendent at the California Medical Facility, discussed his opinion piece \\"Rehabilitation Was Working; Determinate Sentencing Results in a Greater Recidivism Rate and Leads to More Victims of Crimes.\\" In that same hearing, Judge Steven Z. Perren shared: \\"You got to deal with the drug problem in a realistic way and sending them to prison is not dealing with it in a realistic way. I mean that's the truth of it. You've got to do something else, than lock a drug abuser up.\\" Response The California prison system underwent a number of Major court cases and policy changes in the decades after the implementation of the Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976, in response to rapid prison population growth and significant prison overcrowding. California Governor Jerry Brown, who signed the act into law during his 1975‚Äì1983 period as governor, was re-elected to the California governorship from 2011-2019. During this second tenure, he sought to reduce the prison population and end court oversight of the California prison system, saying \\"The incentive power of the indeterminate sentence is crucial and something I really didn‚Äôt pay attention to back in 1977\\" and \\"Sentencing should not be the play toy of ambitious politics [...] It ought to be the judgment of serious minded individuals who are not running for office but have in mind public safety and have in mind the changes men and women can make over time.\\" Governor Brown sponsored 2016 California Proposition 57, which was approved by 65% of California voters and allowed the parole board to release people convicted of \\"non-violent\\" crimes once they served the full sentence for their primary offense. It also required the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to develop uniform parole credits for good behavior and rehabilitative achievements, to incentivize rehabilitation.

It was created under Prime Minister Stephen Harper to highlight the commitment of the federal government to P3 infrastructure. PPP Canada managed the ‚ÄúP3 Canada fund‚Äù where provinces, territories, and municipalities could apply for funding from the federal government. PPP Canada served as Canada's centralized PPP Unit from its creation in 2009 until it was dissolved in 2018 under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Six of the ten Canadian provinces created similar PPP Units, and PPP Canada was meant to serve the same role for provinces that did not have their own P3 Unit. These agencies were created in response to criticisms of P3 projects in the 1990s and early 2000s, that were characterized by an overtly political selection process, lack of rigorous assessment of their effectiveness, and lack of public sector expertise to manage them. As such, PPP Canada staffed with professionals linked to private sector law, consultancy, business management, accountancy and finance firms. They were also given the responsibility to make value-for money assessments of P3 projects. Public-private partnership Regina Wastewater Treatment Plant PPP Canada's definition of Public-private partnership was \\"a long-term performance-based approach to procuring public infrastructure where the private sector assumes a major share of the risks in terms of financing and construction and ensuring effective performance of the infrastructure, from design and planning, to long-term maintenance\\". PPP Canada explicitly outlined when P3s were the \\"right alternative\\" for certain projects. Their arguments for recommending P3s were that funding project with the private sector's higher cost of capital was justified through calculations of risk, expectations, efficiency, innovation and value for money analysis. In Ontario, a 2012 review of 28 projects showed that the costs were on average 16% lower for traditional publicly procured projects than for PPPs. Criticism PPP Canada had been criticized for structuring its assessment methodologies with a bias in favour of PPP. Because promoting PPPs was part of their mandate, and they were staffed with people with a vested interest in the implementation of P3s, there was an apparent conflict of interest with their project assessments . Dissolution In 2018, the Government of Canada dissolved PPP Canada. Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Amarjeet Sohi justified this decision by claiming that it had achieved its mandate of making P3s common practice across Canada, and was no longer needed.

He is known for Spanish landscapes and views from Italian gardens. Life He was the second son of John Vivian, a solicitor of the excise, and barrister, the second son of Matthew Vivian of Penelewey, near Truro. He was educated at Eton College, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1817 (but did not graduate). Vivian made early travels to Vienna and the Balkans in 1818, and Albania in 1819 (when he met Ali Pasha of Io√°nnina (1740-1822)). During a journey of 1824 to the Near East he encountered Lord Byron. In 1828, on the death of his father, he inherited Claverton Manor. He joined the Travellers Club in 1828 or 1829. He made further journeys, to Spain and Portugal, in 1831 and 1837. The Fine Arts Commission in 1846, by John Partridge Vivian was a Commissioner for the plans to rebuild the Houses of Parliament in 1835, and became a member of the Society of Dilettanti in 1837.W. J. Rorabaugh, Politics and the Architectural Competition for the Houses of Parliament, 1834‚Äì1837, Victorian Studies Vol. 17, No. 2 (Dec., 1973), pp. 155‚Äì175, at pp. 164‚Äì167. Published by: Indiana University Press In the period before his marriage, he visited Germany, Scandinavia and Russia. He studied monumental art in Munich. He sat on the Fine Arts Commission from 1841 to 1863, the whole period of its existence. The Commission arose from an initial proposal and Select Committee of Benjamin Hawes, to couple the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament with a national promotion of the fine arts. Vivian had shown that committee arabesques from the Palazzo del Te. In a group of 22 dominated by noblemen, patrons and politicians, Vivian represented connoisseurs and collectors, with Samuel Rogers and Thomas Wyse. After contracting malaria in the Campagna in 1846, Vivian never again enjoyed perfect health. He died on 5 January 1873, at 11 Grosvenor Square, London and was buried in Brompton Cemetery. His library was put up for sale in 1875. Works Vivian published illustrated books, mostly based on his own drawings. * Some Illustrations of the Architecture of Claverton and of the Duke's House, Bradford, etc. (1837). The plates were lithographs by Vivian, mostly from architectural drawings by Charles James Richardson (but Richardson was only 14 years old when the Old Manor was destroyed and George Vivian is likely to have made the drawings). Richardson's Observations on the architecture of England during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James I of the same year is a related work having plates in common, dedicated to Vivian, and published by John Weale.

James Duffield Harding was a friend of George Vivian and is considered to have influenced the latter's style. Vivian wrote articles on architecture for the Quarterly Review.R. J. B. Walker, The Palace of Westminster after the Fire of 1834, The Volume of the Walpole Society Vol. 44 (1972‚Äì1974), pp. 94‚Äì122, at p. 103. Published by: The Walpole Society John Britton commented favourably in 1840 on his anonymous pamphlet The Prospects of Art in the Future Parliament House from 1835, which presaged the Fine Arts Commission. Claverton Manor and the Vivians John Vivian, father of George, purchased Claverton Manor in 1816; he brought in Jeffry Wyatt before 1820 for a new design. Wyatt persuaded John Vivian to rebuild Claverton Manor. John Vivian John Vivian John Vivian (1756‚Äì1828), from a Cornish background, matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford in 1779, at age 22, graduating M.A. in 1784. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1785, the same year becoming solicitor to the Excise at Bristol, and later being made a bencher of the Middle Temple. (A correction to Bibliotheca Cornubiensis differentiates the Excise solicitor John Vivian from John Vivian of the Inner Temple; but that distinction is contradicted by the website of the American Museum and Gardens, located in Claverton Manor.) He married Marianne Edwards in 1792, and had a son John Edwards Vivian (born 1795/6) who was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1815. She was the daughter and heiress of Samuel Edwards of Cotham Lodge, in Gloucestershire near Bristol, who died in 1815. The Alumni Oxonienses record for George Vivian gives, for 1817, his father's residence as \\"Colham, Gloucestershire\\". This presumably means \\"Cotham\\". Marianne Vivian died in Portland Place, London in 1826, and John died there in 1828, aged 73. The two houses at Claverton The new Manor of 1816 at Claverton, now a museum, in 2010 The new Manor commissioned by John Vivian was on a fresh site, some away from the old house, which was demolished, and in a neo-classical style, built from Bath stone. George Vivian, in contrast, undertook to preserve what he could of the old house, completed in 1625. The old Manor at Claverton, 1811 copy of drawing The old Manor became a noted example of Jacobean architecture, documented in some of its details by Richardson's 1837 book on the period. The architect Alexander Roos came to know Vivian by the early 1840s. George Vivian as collector Vivian added a gallery in the south wing of Claverton Manor, to display his art collection. He was a significant collector, owning in particular The Introduction of the Cult of Cybele at Rome by Andrea Mantegna, now in the National Gallery, London. He acquired it from the Venetian dealer Antonio Sanquirico. Under the original title Triumph of Scipio, it was exhibited several times. A supposed portrait of Michelangelo by Andrea del Sarto was later exhibited by his son, around 1880, as by Sebastiano del Piombo, based on an attribution by Bernard Berenson. It went to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1899, was attributed there to Baccio Bandinelli, and is now taken to be a self-portrait of his. Later history In 1855 Vivian let Claverton Manor to James Wilson. The house was sold in 1869, to Isaac Carr, agent. It was bought in 1874 by Henry Duncan Skrine (1815‚Äì1901). This was full circle in family terms, Ralph Allen having bought it in 1758 from William Skrine, and Allen's great- nephew Allen Tucker having sold it to John Vivian. Family Vivian married in 1842 Elizabeth Anne Grey, eldest daughter of Ralph William Grey (died 1822) of Backworth House, and sister of Ralph William Grey (1819‚Äì1869) the Member of Parliament. The Greys of Backworth, in the Tynemouth area, owned coal rights, and were bought out by Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland. The Grey family also lived in Weymouth Street off Portland Place in London, in 1809. George and Elizabeth Anne Vivian lived in Italy from 1844 to 1846, and their only son Ralph, who became an army officer, was born there. Their daughter Minna Frances married in 1888 the Revd Vivian Eccles Skrine. Their other daughter, Alice Jane, died unmarried in 1921. Charles George Vivian, son of Vivian's younger brother the Revd Charles Pasley Vivian who died in 1841, entered Rugby School in 1847 as Vivian's ward.

It was based on the 1936 documentary of the same name, and used the first stanza of a poem by W. H. Auden that was written for the film. Further verses in the style of Auden were written to accompany the footage, read out by actor Tom Courtenay. The advert showcased the newly created business sectors of British Rail (including InterCity, Network South East, Provincial, Railfreight and Parcels) and was the last advert to promote the network as a whole before privatisation in 1997. It was directed by Hugh Hudson and featured music by Greek composer Vangelis.  Documentary  The advert was inspired by the GPO Film Unit's 24-minute film Night Mail, which documents the journey of the nightly \\"Postal Special\\" travelling from London to Scotland. This film was directed and produced by Harry Watt and Basil Wright, and ended with a specially commissioned poem by W. H. Auden. The documentary was critically acclaimed at the time, and a sequel was created for its 50th anniversary in 1986.  Production  The advert was filmed in September 1988, and featured aerial shots of famous structures including the Forth Tyne and Saltash bridges, that ‚Äì although impressive ‚Äì made it very expensive to produce. High Speed Train crosses the Royal Albert Bridge The opening shot is of a Travelling Post Office, as Tom Courtenay begins to recite Auden's poem: Courtenay then breaks from the original verse as the video goes on to detail British Rail's freight operations: The narration then stops as a montage of aerial shots set to Vangelis' score is shown. The voiceover then restarts with a commentary of commuter trains, including the newly introduced Class 442 Wessex Electrics: Class 442 Wessex Electric The advert then ends with a shot of disembarking passengers, and a title card with the slogan \\"Britain's Railway\\".  Release  The advert premiered in the UK at 9pm on Christmas Day 1988. It became apparent that the 2¬Ω minute running time (as well as being expensive to air) limited the amount of showings it could receive, so an abridged 90 second version was later released.

Background McQuirter grew up in Washington D.C. and graduated from Sidwell Friends School in 1984. She received her B.A. from Amherst College in 1988 and her Masters in Public Health Nutrition (MPH) from New York University in 2003. Career McQuirter was introduced to vegetarianism by her 7th-grade teachers at Sidwell Friends School. When McQuirter was a sophomore at Amherst College in 1986, the Black Student Union brought global human rights activist and Civil Rights Movement legend Dick Gregory to campus to talk about the state of Black America. Instead, he talked about the plate of Black America ‚Äî the health, politics, economics, and culture of what Black people ate, and why they should become vegetarians. McQuirter couldn' t get what Gregory said out of her mind, so she began reading about vegetarianism. McQuirter went to Howard University and discovered a large Black vegan and vegetarian community in Washington D.C. By the time she returned to Amherst for her senior year, she was a committed vegetarian. She was still eating cheese, so she was not yet a vegan, but was able to finally let go of cheese during her senior year. During her senior year in college, McQuirter co-founded We Feed Our People in 1988 with her sister, Marya McQuirter, and friend Water McGill, to feed unhoused residents living in front of the Martin Luther King, Jr, Memorial Library in downtown Washington, DC. McQuirter began her career as a museum director at the Mary McLeod Bethune National Historic Site in Washington, DC, from 1990‚Äì1996. While there, she served as an honorary delegate to the United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in 1996, in recognition of Mary McLeod Bethune's role as a co-founder of the United Nations. McQuirter served as a public policy liaison for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine from 1999 to 2000, where she was a strategist for the successful lawsuit against the USDA proving racial and food industry bias in the formation of U.S. Dietary Guidelines. McQuirter co-founded the Black Vegetarian Society of New York in 2002, while in graduate school at New York University.After returning to DC, McQuirter directed the first federally funded vegan nutrition program in the U.S., the Vegetarian Society of DC Eat Smart Program, from 2004 to 2009. McQuirter also created the first vegan cooking and lecture series at Whole Foods stores in the Washington, DC, area, titled from Soul Food to Whole Food during that time. According to the New York Times, her 2010 book, By Any Greens Necessary was a key book that contributed to the rise of veganism among African-Americans between the time of its release and 2017 (when the article was published). In addition, McQuirter created the first-of-its-kind African American Vegan Starter Guide in 2016 with Farm Sanctuary. Vegetarian Times magazine named her a \\"New Food Hero\\" in 2017, changing the way Americans eat for the better. She wrote her second book, Ageless Vegan, with her mother, Mary McQuirter in 2018, to celebrate their 30 years of being vegan. In 2019, she was inducted into the U.S. Animal Rights Hall of Fame, and PBS named her a \\"Woman Thought Leader.\\" Bibliography * * ReferencesExternal links * *Official Website: 10,000 Black Vegan Women * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:African-American writers Category:African-American women writers Category:American women writers Category:American cookbook writers Category:American food writers Category:American women podcasters Category:American podcasters Category:Amherst College alumni Category:Chefs of vegan cuisine Category:New York University alumni Category:People from Washington, D.C.

By the early 80's, after decades of ongoing research, Tracey and Webb had accumulated a significant corpus of scientific evidence in support of the theory that Australian tropical rainforests had evolved in Gondwana over 100 million years ago and were not, as previously believed, relatively recent arrivals from South East Asia.

The story follows a Shandong family that is terrorised by the title character‚Äîa malevolent fox spirit‚Äîwho wishes to betroth the patriarch's son. Pu modelled the antagonist after a female latrine spirit worshipped in ancient Chinese folk religion. Plot In Yidu, Shandong, the Yue () family is tormented by an evil fox spirit. One day, the fox metamorphosises into a pleasant-looking lady and the family's patriarch, Yujiu (), attempts to broker peace by proposing that she join the family as his daughter. She rejects this but agrees to be his sister, who is henceforth referred to as Great Aunt Hu (). Nevertheless, she continues to provoke others, especially Yue's daughter-in-law. Hu announces that she will only desist if his son divorces his current wife and marries her instead, to which Yue's daughter-in-law angrily rebukes her. While trying to coerce him into following her proposal, the fox spirit strikes Yue's son in the head, killing him. Yue enlists the help of exorcist Li Chengyao (), who gathers the family's livestock and identifies a chicken amongst them as the Zigu () spirit. The family admits to inviting the Zigu into their household three years ago; Li entraps the chicken in a wine bottle, while Yue burns the mannequin used to invoke the spirit. However, instead of killing the spirit, Li adds it to his home collection of fox spirits; it is alleged that Li systematically releases them into other households in order that he is hired to exorcise them. Publication history Originally titled \\"Hu Dagu\\" (ËÉ°Â§ßÂßë), the story was first published in Pu Songling's anthology of close to five hundred short stories, Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio or Liaozhai Zhiyi. The story has been translated into English, including in the third volume of Sidney L. Sondergard's Strange Tales from Liaozhai (2008) as \\"Elder Sister Hu\\". Sources The \\"Hu\\" () in \\"Hu Dagu\\" is homophonous with the Chinese word for \\"fox\\" (). According to traditional Anhui and northern Jiangsu lore, fox spirits manifested themselves as three sisters, referred to as Dagu (; eldest aunt), Ergu (; second aunt), and Sangu (; third aunt). Similarly, in Beijing, fox spirits were believed to appear as a group of three aunts collectively known as Sangu (; three aunts) or Xiangulaotai (; divine grannies). The Yanshan conglu or Complete Records of Yanshan (), published in 1602, includes a brief account of \\"destructive haunting\\" amidst its collection of fox tales. The fox spirit in Pu's story is identified as the Zigu (; literally \\"Purple Maiden\\"), first described during the Six Dynasties as a concubine named He Mei () who was abused by her husband's wife and died in the latrine; according to Xu Dishan, the name \\"Zigu\\" itself was borrowed from Taoist fox spirit nomenclature during the Six Dynasties. In rural north China, female villagers would \\"invite\\" the Zigu as part of New Year festivities, by praying to a mannequin of her in the latrine. By the Ming dynasty, the Zigu had become three sisters who commandeered the \\"celestial equivalent of a toilet bowl\\" and the supposed birthplace of all living things, the hunyuan jindou (). Themes and motifs Xiaofei Kang writes that the story \\"exemplifies the contrast between the two types of fox\\", namely the malevolent fox spirit terrorising Yue Yujiu's family and the benevolent one living in their neighbour Zhang's house. Because fox spirits in general also represent financial opportunity, Yue does not immediately attempt to drive the fox away but tries to negotiate with her instead. Kang suggests that Yue \\"sought to take the fox's powers under his own control and make her serve the family's interests\\" by offering her a place in the family as either his daughter or his sister. However, the fox spirit demands \\"a permanent place\\" in the household as Yue's daughter-in- law, echoing the commonly-held notion during Pu Songling's time that \\"shrewish wives and unruly daughters-in-law\\" were an \\"unsettling factor in Chinese family life\\", with some even resorting to witchcraft to manipulate their husbands and \\"undermine old family ties\\". The fox and the daughter-in-law are ultimately presented as \\"interchangeable yet mutually exclusive entities, representing and reversing order and disorder\\", and Yue encounters as much difficulty in communicating with his daughter-in-law as he does negotiating with the fox spirit. As the fox spirit herself insinuates, the root cause of the problem is Yue's daughter-in-law who invited her into the household three years ago. According to Kang, \\"Hu Dagu\\" also details \\"how religious professionals intervened in family life with their exorcistic power\\"‚Äîit is a spirit medium, Li Chengyao, who is able to exorcise the fox spirit and seize control of its supernatural abilities. Moreover, the exorcism of the fox spirit links the evil to a commonplace \\"symbol of female subversion and menace\\" and leads to the \\"ritual exposure of a symbolic scapegoat\\" which has a cathartic effect on Yue and his family, even if the potentially problematic daughter-in-law were not to be directly dealt with. Sidney Sondergard comments that Pu is highlighting \\"the consequences of unwitting veneration\\", as evidenced by Li Chengyao's criticism of the Yue family's \\"virtual obeisance\\" to the fox spirit. She compares \\"Hu Dagu\\" with other Strange Tales entries as \\"Peng Haiqiu\\" and \\"Xiaoxie\\" to show how Pu \\"tends to be much more versatile in his presentation of spirits and deities\\" while \\"(challenging) intellectual complacency\\".

In Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, he won several major tournaments and was ranked between 3rd and 6th best player in the world throughout the game's competitive history. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, he was ranked 7th and 9th best for the first and second halves of 2019, respectively. Dabuz primarily used Olimar in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. In Super for Wii U, he switched to Rosalina and Luma as his primary character, with Olimar as his secondary. In Ultimate, he used both Olimar and Rosalina as primaries, and Palutena as a secondary. Career=Super Smash Bros. Brawl Dabuz began competing in Smash with Super Smash Bros. Brawl. His parents were initially reluctant to let him leave Long Island to compete, and Dabuz would occasionally lie to them about where he would be in order to attend tournaments. However, after winning $3,000 at an event held by Major League Gaming in 2009, he was able to convince his family that competing in Smash was a valid pursuit. Despite this, his ability to travel for competitions was severely limited. In January 2012 he finished tied for 13th at Apex 2012, a major tournament held at Rutgers University in New Jersey. He tied for 7th at Apex the following year. In June 2012 he traveled to Canada and won Impulse 2012. Dabuz used Olimar as his primary character in Brawl. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U Super Smash Bros. for Wii U released in November 2014, and Dabuz immediately began having strong showings in tournaments. He took second at APEX 2015 in February, third in Community Effort Orlando 2015 in June, and 5th at Evo 2015 in July. In August he signed with esports organization Vanquish Gaming, as their first Smash player. He would go on to take 2nd at Paragon Los Angeles 2015 in September, then 3rd at The Big House 5 in October. He continued placing highly in 2016, taking 2nd at Genesis 3 in January, and tying for 9th at Pound 2016 in April. In the inaugural Panda Global Rankings, which ranked players based on their tournament results from Smash for Wii Us inception through May 2016, Dabuz was ranked 3rd, behind only Gonzalo \\"ZeRo\\" Barrios and Nairoby \\"Nairo\\" Quezada. In addition to the mathematical ranking, Panda Global polled 48 panelists, most of which were top players, to produce a companion \\"X-Factor\\" ranking. This ranking had Dabuz second, with Nairo third. In June 2016, Dabuz won his first major Smash tournament when he took the title at Apex 2016. Later that month, he and fellow Smash player Jason \\"ANTi\\" Bates signed with esports organization Dream Team. During his time with Dream Team, Dabuz won another tournament, WTFox 2, placed third at CEO 2016, tied for 7th at Evo 2016, and took 2nd at Super Smash Con 2016. In August allegations surfaced that Dream Team was not paying their Smash players, and shortly afterwards both Dabuz and ANTi departed the organization. Dream Team later released a statement denying that they had not paid the duo, and claiming that both had mutually parted ways with the organization after receiving more lucrative offers following their performances at CEO 2016. Dream Team also claimed that hey had picked up the players in anticipation of a Nintendo- and Twitch-sponsored tournament circuit which never materialized, and that it made little sense to field a Smash roster without that circuit. In early October, Dabuz signed with multi-esport organization Renegades, and finished out the year taking 5th at The Big House 5 and 9th at 2GGT: ZeRo Saga. In the second edition of the Panda Global Rankings, covering the latter half of 2016, Dabuz was ranked 4th, with Elliot \\"Ally\\" Carroza-Oyarce joining ZeRo and Nairo above Dabuz in the rankings. Dabuz had a slow start to 2017, tying for 13th place at 2GGC: Genesis Saga, the first major tournament of the year. He then tied for 7th at Genesis 4 at the end of January. He took 4th at Frostbite 2017 in February and 2nd at a minor tournament, PAX Arena, which was held at PAX East 2017 in early March. At the end of March, Dabuz won his first premier-tier Smash tournament, 2GGC: Civil War, which had the greatest concentration of top players of any Super Smash Bros. for Wii U tournament held to date. He took 4th at CEO Dreamland in April, then tied for 9th at CEO 2017 in June. Dabuz retained his 4th best position in the Panda Global Rankings for the first half of 2017. Dabuz started the second half of 2017 off strong by winning 2GGC: ARMS Saga and tying for 7th at Evo 2017 and DreamHack Atlanta 2017, all in July. However, August proved more difficult, as he also had a disappointing showing at Super Smash Con 2017, finishing 33rd, and subsequently withdrew from Shine 2017, which was held at the end of the month. He took 4th at DreamHack Montreal in October, then tied for 9th at GameTyrant Expo 2017 and won The Big House 7, both in early October. Days after his Big House 7 win, he announced that he had departed Renegades. He finished out the year placing 5th at 2GGC: MKLeo Saga and 4th at the 2GG Championship. While he two major tournaments, Dabuz also attended only eight of the fourteen major tournaments in the second half of the year, and fell to 6th place in the Panda Global Rankings. Dabuz had a resurgence in early 2018, winning five tournaments in three months; PAX Arena at PAX South 2018 in January, Frostbite 2018 and XenoSaga XIII in February,11:50 and Midwest Mayhem 11 and Overclocked II in March.10:0012:55 Of these, Frostbite 2018 was the only event considered a major in the Panda Global Rankings. He tied for 5th at a number of other major tournaments over the first half of the year; Genesis 5 in January, Get On My Level 2018 and MomoCon 2018 in May, and Smash 'N' Splash 4 in June. In mid-June, he announced that he had signed with Gravity Gaming on a short-term deal, which would allow him to attend the last Smash for Wii U tournaments held before the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate at the end of the year. He went on to finish 3rd at 2GG: Hyrule Saga in late June, 5th at CEO 2018 in July, and won Smash Sounds and Low Tier City 6 later the same month.30:40 In August he tied for 9th at EVO 2018 and Shine 2018, but also finished tied for 33rd at Super Smash Con 2018. He finished 2nd at DreamHack Atlanta 2018 in November, the last Smash for Wii U tournament he contested in 2018. Dabuz rose back to 3rd in the final Panda Global Rankings for Smash for Wii U, which covered much of 2018, behind Leonardo \\"MkLeo\\" L√≥pez P√©rez and Gavin \\"Tweek\\" Dempsey. In a separate ranking, the Panda Global Rankings 100, which listed the Top 100 Wii U players from the game's release through the release of Ultimate, Dabuz was ranked the 4th best player of all time behind ZeRo, Nairo, and MkLeo. In August 2019, well after the release of Smash Ultimate, Dabuz won the Smash for Wii U tournament at Super Smash Con 2019. Throughout Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Dabuz used Rosalina and Luna as his primary character. As early as the first Panda Global Ranking in mid-2016, he was already considered the uncontested best player in the world with that character. By the end of 2016, Dabuz had begun using his main character from Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Olimar, as a frequent secondary. He would continue to utilize this duo throughout Smash for Wii Us competitive run. In a 2017 interview, Dabuz stated that the primary reason that he began using Olimar again was that the character fared well against Diddy Kong - considered one of the strongest characters early in the game's history - while it was an extremely difficult matchup for Rosalina. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Dabuz at 2GG Kongo Saga in 2019 Super Smash Bros. Ultimate released at the end of 2018, and while Dabuz remained an elite competitor in the new game, he failed to reach the same heights in Ultimate as he did in Smash for Wii U. In the first half of 2019, the highest finish he achieved in a major tournament was 4th, at both Genesis 6 in February and CEO 2019 in June. He took 5th in two other major events, Smash N' Splash 5 and Pound 2019, and tied for 9th in MomoCon 2019, 2GG: Prime Saga, and Get On My Level 2019. His lowest showing at a major tournament was tied for 17th at Frostbite 2019, held in February. He also won a minor tournament, Thunder Smash, in May, winning $20,000. The first half of the year also saw him change sponsors. He announced his departure from Gravity at the end of February, and joined Team Liquid in early March. In the inaugural Panda Global Rankings Ultimate, Dabuz was ranked 7th, lower than his ranking at any point in Smash for Wii U competition. July 2019 proved Dabuz's best month in Ultimate to date. He finished 2nd at Albion 4, held in London, then finished 2nd at Low Tier City 7, held in Texas a week later. He rounded out the month with 3rd-place finishes at Defend the North 2019 and Thunder Smash 2. In the six largest tournaments held during the second half of 2019, Dabuz took 2nd at The Big House 9, 5th at Shine 2019, tied for 9th in three other tournaments including Evo 2019, and tied for 49th at Super Smash Con 2019. He fell to 9th place in the Panda Global Rankings Ultimate for the latter half of the year. Dabuz started 2020 by taking 2nd at Lets Make Big Moves, held in New York in early January. He tied for 5th at Glitch 8, then 9th at Genesis 7, both held later that month. In late February he took 5th at Frostbite 2020. Frostbite was Dabuz's last event before Panda Global Rankings suspended the 2020 competitive season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, most of the tournaments scheduled for the first half of 2020 were cancelled or moved online. Ultimates online service suffers from noticeable input delay and lag, and many top players had poorer than normal performances in online tournaments, however Dabuz had several strong showings. At the end of April, Dabuz took 2nd at Pound Online. Weeks later, he took 3rd out of 8,192 participants at the Hungrybox-organized The Box tournament. In June, he won the East Coast competition at Fights for Rights, a pair of tournaments held to raise funds for charities involved in the George Floyd protests. Owing to changes to Rosalina that made her less effective in Ultimate than she was in Smash for Wii U, Dabuz initially returned to using Captain Olimar as his primary character, with Rosalina and Palutena as secondary characters. However, patch 3.1, released at the end of May 2019, singled out Olimar and Pichu, two of the smallest characters in the game, making them easier to hit. It also reduced the power of some of Olimar's attacks. Dabuz responded on Twitter that while one of Olimar's moves \\"got destroyed for no good reason\\" and the character was no longer elite, he knew the adjustments he needed to make and that he felt the character was still competitive. By the end of 2019, Dabuz was using both Rosalina and Olimar as co-main characters. Playstyle Dabuz utilizes a defensive playstyle; Rosalina and Olimar - the two characters he uses most - both have mechanics that allow Dabuz to pressure his opponent from a safe distance, then quickly move in and attack when that pressure leads his opponent to make a mistake. Writing for the Panda Global Rankings in 2017, Adam Braham called his style \\"one of the most aggressively defensive play styles of any Smash Wii U player\\". Dabuz calls his style \\"passive aggressive\\". He is also known for his extensive research and note-taking. He studies both character matchups and player matchups and consults his notes during tournaments. At CEO 2016, he asked for and was granted a pause in the match so he could review his notes using a laptop he brought on stage. Personal life Dabuz was born in Nesconset, on Long Island, New York. He graduated from Stony Brook University in 2017. He is of Jewish heritage.

It provided a pension allowance for blind persons aged between 50 and 70 (after which they became eligible for the old age pension), directed local authorities to make provision for the welfare of blind people and regulated charities in the sector. The act was passed in response to pressure from the National League of the Blind (NLB) who claimed many of their members were living in poverty. The NLB carried out a series of strikes and protests including the 5‚Äì25 April 1920 blind march. The Blind Persons Act was first debated on 26 April and received Royal Assent on 16 August. The pensions provisions were superseded and repealed by the Old Age Pensions Act 1936 and the remainder of the act by the National Assistance Act 1948, it remains in force in Ireland. The act was the first disability-specific legislation to be passed anywhere in the world.  Background  David Lloyd George In the early 20th century many blind people in the United Kingdom were reliant on employment by charities in workshops. This was low paid and some charities imposed strict measures, such as controlling whether their employees could marry. The National League of the Blind (NLB) was founded in 1889 by Ben Purse to campaign for the rights of visually impaired persons. This carried out a strike of its members in 1912 to raise awareness of their living conditions. However, there was little improvement and by 1918 the NLB estimated that 20,000 out of the 35,000 blind people in the country were living in poverty. Three times it managed to introduce legislation in parliament to address the matter but it was not passed. In 1918 the NLB held a large public meeting at Trafalgar Square and in 1919 disrupted a session in the House of Commons. When this failed to draw a response from the government it organised the 1920 blind march, a 20-day protest march on London from across the country. This drew public attention and, after NLB leaders met with the prime minister David Lloyd George, led directly to the Blind Persons Act 1920.  The act  The act required local authorities to \\"promote the welfare of blind persons\\" and reduced the pension age for blind men from 70 to 50. The NLB feared that the act would simply allow local authorities to sub-contract their responsibilities to the charities that they opposed. The act also ordered that blind children be permitted to take the same exams sat by sighted children and regulated the operation of charities for blind persons. The estimated cost of increasing the pension provision was ¬£175,000 per year, to be met by central government, and the capital expenditure incurred by local authorities to provide new workshops, hostels and homes was estimated at ¬£250,000. The act was first read on 26 April 1920 and received Royal Assent on 16 August. The local authorities were granted 12 months to comply with the act. The act was the first disability-specific legislation anywhere in the world. Impact The NLB passed a motion of dissatisfaction in the government's response to the march. The Royal London Society for Blind People expected that the act would not be eagerly applied by the local authorities who did not wish to increase the burden on their ratepayers. Some officials in the Treasury expressed concern that the act would lead to accusations that the pension provided was not sufficient and that there would be subsequent requests from other disabled people to also have specific legislation. The treasury thought that any such schemes should come under the Poor Law, administered by local authorities. Between 1921 and 1939 the number of people eligible for pensions under the act rose from 7,800 to 27,500 with a total annual cost of ¬£695,000. As it was passed before the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922 it was retained on the statute books in that country and part of it remains in force. In the United Kingdom section 1 of the act, applying to pensions, was repealed by the Old Age Pensions Act 1936, which duplicated its provisions. The remaining sections were repealed by the National Assistance Act 1948. Amendments and new legislation developed provision for blind, and other disabled people, throughout the 20th century. This culminated in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, Disability Discrimination Act 2005 and the Equality Act 2010 which implemented some of the measures the NLB had first proposed in 1899.

It has been attributed to the architect, Sir Robert Taylor. Named after Captain Comarque, a Hugenot refugee who owned the estate in the early 18th century, the house is in the Queen Anne style. The author Arnold Bennett lived at Comarques between 1913 and 1921. There is a tradition that Clement Attlee lived at the house as a child, but Historic England does not support this claim. Comarques is a Grade II* listed building. History Captain Comarque was a French Hugenot refugee who, along a number of others, settled in Thorpe- le-Soken in the early 18th century. Historic England confirms that he was resident in the area in 1717 but that he did not build the house. Pevsner notes the attribution to Sir Robert Taylor, an architect who worked mainly in London and the South-East of England. The building carries a brick datestone for 1755, with the name W. Whatey, who was probably the main building contractor for the house. Local tradition suggests that the house was the childhood home of Clement Attlee, later prime minister, having been bought by his father, Henry, in the late 19th century, and this tradition is repeated in some sources. However, Historic England notes that Attlee's official biographer does not support the claim and suggests that Henry Attlee, a solicitor, was involved in the sale of the estate rather than its purchase. In 1913, Comarques was bought by Arnold Bennett, then one of England's most successful novelists, from his considerable literary earnings.Swinnerton, Frank. \\"Bennett, (Enoch) Arnold (1867‚Äì1931)\\", Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 1949. Retrieved 1 June 2020 Soon after the purchase, Bennett wrote to an American correspondent; \\"we now possess an early Queen Anne house near the Essex coast and in February are going to install ourselves there definitely for everlasting\\". During his tenure, which lasted until his separation from his wife in 1921, Bennett amassed a considerable art collection, which was displayed at the house. The estate was later owned by Albert Fairfax, 12th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. In 2010 the house was on the market. Architecture and description The house is of two storeys, with attics, in Flemish-bond red brick. One brick carries the date 1755. The style is Queen Anne. There are extensions from the 19th and 20th centuries. The house has seven bays and Pevsner notes the distinctive window style, which has been called Chinese Chippendale, and which is the main grounds for the attribution to Taylor.

Hendon is an Electrical Engineer and Computer Scientist and an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University in New York City. Hendon is a pioneer in medical imaging. She develops biomedical optics technologies, using optical coherence tomography and near infrared spectroscopy systems, that enable physicians to perform guided interventional procedures and allow for structure-function dissection of human tissues and organs. Her advances in imaging technologies have led to improved diagnostic abilities and treatments for cardiac arrhythmias as well as breast cancer and preterm birth. She has been recognized for her development of optical imaging catheters for cardiac wall imaging by Forbes 30 under 30, the MIT Technology Review‚Äôs 35 Innovators Under 35, and by President Obama with the Presidential Early Career Awards in 2017.  Early life and education  Hendon (born Christine Fleming), wanted to pursue a career as a teacher during her childhood. In high school, she enjoyed math and science, and participated in the Institute for Climate and Planets program, hosted by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space studies. This program inspired her to pursue a career in science. In 2000, Hendon pursued her undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and became immediately involved in undergraduate research. Hendon graduated with her Bachelors of Science in 2004. Hendon then pursued her Master‚Äôs of Science and her PhD training at Case Western Reserve University in Biomedical Engineering. She completed her M.S. in 2007, and her Ph.D. in 2010. During her PhD, Hendon worked under the mentorship of Andrew M. Rollins where she began using and optimizing Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) techniques to create volumetric images of human tissues and organs for use in treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. She developed an automated algorithm for fiber orientation in the plane parallel to the wall surface of cardiac tissue in order to properly characterize early structural changes in the myocardium due to disease and injury to guide treatment. Her work showed that OCT can help to visualize real time ablation (RFA) therapy to guide physicians treatment progression and thus improve the outcomes of RFA therapy. Following her Ph.D., Hendon moved back to Massachusetts and pursued her Postdoctoral research fellowship at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in the Biomedical Optics Wellman Center for Photomedicine. During this time, Hendon optimized the depth resolved spectral analysis of OCT. She completed her postdoctoral fellowship in 2012.  Career and research  In 2012, Hendon was recruited to Columbia University as an Assistant Professor in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in the Department of Electrical Engineering. In 2018, Hendon was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. Hendon is the Principal Investigator of the Structure-Function Imaging Laboratory. Her lab focuses on developing novel biomedical technologies for guided imaging of biological tissues and improved diagnosis and treatment of cancer and cardiac arrhythmias. Her work integrates real-time processing algorithms to extract physiological information from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging data. Hendon is also a member of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), The International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE and The Optical Society (OSA).  OCT guided atrial fibrillation treatment  Hendon helped to improve and guide ablation treatment of atrial fibrillation using a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) guided catheter implantation. Her results showed improved results of radio-frequency ablation therapy. Hendon then used her knowledge and expertise in OCT to characterize the structure-function relationship of heart tissue. She showed that she was able to image, with high resolution, elastic fibers, Purkinje fibers, and collagen fiber bundles, as well as observe tissue pathology. Since the composition of atrial tissue impacts disease pathology, diagnosis, and recovery, Hendon and her team developed an automated method to classify tissue composition of the atria using a relevance vector machine model. The classification accuracy was over 80% showing its utility in classifying tissue composition and guiding diagnosis and treatment. With Hendon‚Äôs technology, physicians that previously treated cardiac arrhythmias essentially blind to the tissue changes, can now observe tissue changes and improvements in realtime to enhance treatment accuracy and recovery.  OCT for breast cancer  Hendon began adapting her OCT algorithms for use in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The imaging technique has been nicknamed ‚Äúoptical ultrasound‚Äù and, using ultra- high resolution OCT, she was able to improve the characterization and diagnosis of breast cancer.  OCT imaging and preterm birth  Hendon then became interested in exploring the structure-function relationship of the cervix and how characterizing this relationship could provide insight into causes of preterm birth and possible prevention strategies. Hendon first found that collagen fiber dispersion and directionality had an impact on cervical remodelling and thus propensity for preterm birth. Since this remodelling results in shortening of the cervix, which is thought to result in preterm birth, Hendon sought to further understand the structural properties that underlie shortening and elucidate approaches to prevent preterm birth. By assessing the collagen fiber orientation through her material modelling framework, Hendon was able to determine the basis for cervical deformation using OCT and biomechanically explore the causes of preterm birth at the level of tissue microstructure.

She serves as the quality manager of the group, in charge of printing money in the Royal Mint of Spain in parts 1 and 2 and overseeing the melting of gold in the Bank of Spain in parts 3 and 4. She is widely considered to be one of the show's most popular characters. Biography Before getting recruited by the Professor, Nairobi was an expert counterfeiter and forger, which she learned at an early age due to poverty. She had a son named Axel, of whom she lost custody after serving time in prison for drug trafficking and counterfeiting. She has become known for her energetic, charismatic, and motivational persona throughout the show. A born leader, she leads the hostages and her team with joy, passion, and enthusiasm as she uses her popular catchphrase \\"chikipum chikipum chikipum\\" (imitating a drum beat) to motivate them to work. In a team of hotheads and big egos, Nairobi is level-headed, focused only on accomplishing the job and maintaining peace within the group, and staying alive. She is well liked by the team and even the hostages; Mr. Torres, a hostage assigned to help her print the money in parts 1 and 2, praises her as the best boss he has ever had. With her maternal instincts, she was able to sympathize with some of the hostages, such as motivating Alison Parker to stand up to her bullies and say the famous line \\"Soy la puta ama\\" (\\"I am the fucking boss\\"). Throughout the show, Nairobi has shown disgust over the excessive patriarchy on the team, questioning the leadership of Berlin and Palermo's offensive actions. In part 2, when she overthrows Berlin's leadership and temporarily takes control at the Royal Mint, she proudly declares \\"Empieza el matriarcado\\" (\\"Let the matriarchy begin\\"), a now iconic line for her character. In part three, in order to sow chaos on the team, inspector Alicia Sierra takes Nairobi's son and uses him to lure her out. Nairobi peeks out through the window to see her son and was shot by a sniper in the chest. Nairobi barely survives the opening of part 4, when the police deny the team a surgeon to help her. With the help of a Pakistani surgeon via video call, Tokyo and the rest of the team successfully operate on Nairobi, removing the bullet and extracting part of her lung. Soon after, the head of security of the Bank of Spain, an ex-mercenary named Gandia, escapes with the help of Palermo, who had been shunned by his own team of robbers. Nairobi, still recovering from her gunshot and surgery, is taken hostage and tortured by Gandia. After several failed attempts at killing Nairobi, Gandia waits until a truce is called between the robbers and the police, at which point he kills her by shooting her point blank to the head. Her body is placed in a makeshift coffin with the label \\"Nairobi, La Puta Ama\\" and carried outside by the governor's bodyguards. In the season finale of part 4, after the Professor and the team bring Lisbon back into the Bank of Spain, they all chant \\"For Nairobi!\\" in her honor. Development In an interview, Alba Flores revealed that Nairobi did not exist in the original script. Show creator √Ålex Pina was writing the script and realized that the team only had one female character in Tokyo, so he called Flores, with whom he had previously worked on the series Locked Up and offered to create a role for her if she enjoyed the scripts of the first two episodes. Reception Nairobi's quirky yet level-headed bossy character quickly became one of the favorites of the show. After the character's death in part 4, fans mourned another fan favorite being killed. Some grieved saying that Nairobi did not deserve a brutal death, especially since her character was so full of dreams and promises. A behind-the-scene video of Flores tearfully saying goodbye to her character and castmates was included in the 2020 documentary Money Heist: The Phenomenon. For her work as Nairobi, Flores won a Best Actress Award in Premios Iris (ATv), as well as three Best Actress nominations on Spanish Actor's Union Awards and two Best Supporting Actress Nominations for Feroz Awards.

The poems are: \\"El Desdichado\\", \\"Myrtho\\", \\"Horus\\", \\"Anteros\\", \\"Delphica\\", \\"Artemis\\", \\"Christ at Gethsemane\\" (I‚ÄìV) and \\"Golden Verses\\". They were published in the book Les Filles du feu in January 1854. Background Photograph of Nerval by Nadar The writer G√©rard de Nerval (1808‚Äì1855) had mental health problems and his doctor √âmile Blanche had recommended him to continue writing as a form of therapy. The poems of The Chimeras may express his struggle with a particularly difficult period; Nerval spent time in psychiatric hospitals in 1840‚Äì1841, 1851, 1853 and 1854. In 1853 he temporarily lost the ability to speak and write, and his identity. His illness made him identify with figures from myths and legends, and in the interplay with these characters in his poems he attempted to create a self. Regarding the obscurity of his Chimera poems, Nerval wrote that they \\"would lose their charm by being explained, if that thing was possible\\". Poems \\"El Desdichado\\" The first-person narrator introduces himself as the Prince of Aquitaine and claims to have crossed the Acheron‚Äìone of the rivers of the Greek underworld‚Äìtwice. \\"Myrtho\\" The poem praises Myrtho, the personification of the myrtle, a plant that was sacred to Venus. In the plays of Plautus it is associated with female sexual desire. \\"Horus\\" The story of Kneph, Isis and Osiris from Egyptian mythology is used to convey a message about spiritual growth. The poem suggests a parallel to Vulcan, Venus and Mars from Roman mythology. \\"Anteros\\" (). Anteros, the brother of Eros and god of unrequited love, addresses the philosopher Iamblichus about the nature of torment and rage. He claims ancestry from Antaeus, identifies Satan with Baal or Dagon and denounces Jehovah. \\"Delphica\\" (). Inspired by Nerval's Italian journey and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's poem \\"Kennst du das Land\\", the poem expresses its author's belief that paganism will resurge in an enlightened form which will subsume the Christian ethos. \\"Artemis\\" (). Evokes the goddess Artemis through a deck of Tarot cards, identifying her with the queen. \\"Christ in the Olive Grove\\" () (I‚ÄìV). Five sonnets about Jesus on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, adapted from the New Testament's Matt. 24‚Äì26, Mark 13‚Äì14, Luke 19, 21 and John 8, 13. The portrayal, which focuses on the return of spirit to the world after the death of God, is inspired by Jean Paul's reading of the gospels in the novel Siebenk√§s (1796‚Äì97) and Germaine de Sta√´l's reading of Jean Paul in On Germany (1813). \\"Golden Verses\\" (). The poem is inspired by Pythagoreanism and the idea of a universal soul, as interpreted by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Delisle de Sales in the book De la philosophie de la nature (1777). Some French editions have an Autres Chim√®res section containing nine additional sonnets, namely \\"La T√™te de l'Arm√©e\\", \\"A Madame Ida Dumas\\", \\"A Madame Aguado\\", \\"A H√©l√®ne de Mecklenburg\\", \\"A Madame Sand\\", an alternate version of \\"Myrto\\", \\"A Louise d'Or. Reine\\", \\"A J Colonna\\" and \\"√ârythr√©a\\".http://promeneur- libre.raindrop.jp/litterature/pdf_fr/NERVAL__Autres_Chimeres.pdf Publication and translations The eight poems were published in their final form in January 1854, when they were included at the end of Nerval's short story collection Les Filles du feu. Several of them had appeared before in the magazine L'Artiste. \\"Le Christ aux Oliviers\\" was published there on 31 March 1844, \\"Vers dor√©s\\" (as \\"Pens√©e antique\\", \\"ancient thought\\") on 16 March 1845 and \\"Delfica\\" (as \\"Vers dor√©e\\") on 28 December 1845. \\"El Desdichado\\" was published in Le Mousquetaire on 10 December 1853. In 1957, Geoffrey Wagner published Selected Writings of Gerard de Nerval (Grove Press, New York), the last section of which was a selection of Nerval's poetry which included the Chimera poems, though not \\"Le Christ aux Oliviers\\". In 1958, Brian Hill translated the complete series along with a number of other Nerval poems under the title Fortune's Fool, 35 poems (R. Hart-Davis, London). Also in 1958, Anchor Books published An Anthology of French Poetry from Nerval to Val√©ry in English Translation, which contains Chimera poems translated by Richmond Lattimore (\\"El Desdichado\\" and \\"Delphica\\"), Joseph Bennett (\\"Myrtho\\"), Barbara Howes (\\"Horus\\", \\"Anteros\\" and \\"Artemis\\") and Daisy Aldan (\\"Golden Verses\\"). Andrew Hoyem interpreted the eight poems as Chimeras: Transfigurations of \\"les Chim√®res\\" by G√©rard de Nerval, published in 1966. Another English translation by an American, the poet Robert Duncan, had been published in 1965 in the magazine Open Space; Duncan's colleague Robin Blaser reacted negatively to this version, calling it \\"irresponsible\\" and a \\"perversion\\", and published his own translation in 1967 in the journal Audit. The Northern Irish poet Derek Mahon has made a free interpretation and adaptation of the poems, published in 1982 as The Chimeras. Later translations include one by Peter Jay published in 1984 with essays by Richard Holmes and Jay, one by William Stone published in a bilingual edition in 1999, and one by Henry Weinfield published in 2005 with monotypes by the artist Douglas Kinsey. Legacy The twelve sonnets of The Chimeras are Nerval's most famous poems. With their focus on the beauty of words, and lasting resistance to critical interpretation, they can be seen as precursors to symbolism and the poetry of St√©phane Mallarm√©.

Life Domenico Maria Corsi was born in Florence in 1633 to an important Florentine family: his father, Giovanni of Jacopo marquis of Caiazzo, was senator and ambassador of Florence to the Duchy of Milan, and his mother was the marquis Lucrezia Salviati. Domenico Maria studied with support from his uncle Lorenzo Corsi. He graduated in utroque iure in Pisa. On 12 April 1657 he joined the Accademia della Crusca, entering the Accedemy of Florence in 1659.

Within a few months after his death, one of his murals was also acquired by Heritage Malta for the country's national art collection.  Education  Portelli started attending the School of Art in Valletta when he was 13 years old. There, along with fellow artist Antoine Camilleri, he studied under the Caruana Dingli brothers, Edward and Robert, and Karmenu Mangion. He distinguished himself at the School of Art in 1947, earning a scholarship to study at Leicester College in England.  Career  The foremost work from he early career is an autobiographical work he started in 1944, immediately following the death of his father. After he completed his formal studies, in 1951 he co-founded the Modern Art Circle in Malta. With this group he made his first public appearance at the Malta Society of Art's Palazzo de la Salle in 1952. The Modern Art Circle was later rebranded as the Modern Art Group and Atelier 56. In 1957 he was one of six modern artists from Malta selected to exhibit at the first ever Malta pavillion at the Venice Biennale in 1958. His painting Resurrezione signed and dated 1957 was exhibited prominently in Venice and appeared on an official postcard issued by organizers. Throughout the 1960s Portelli created a number of murals for the nascent tourism industry.

Set at the end of the Ming dynasty, the story follows the enigmatic title character who assists an army commander in training his troops. Plot While preparing to cross the south end of the Yangtze, Yuling () native and army commander Liu Zhisheng () encounters a lightly-dressed man whose belly is exposed. The stranger introduces himself as Cai Weiweng () and offers to train Liu's troops. Cai also demonstrates his ability to slot an inordinate amount of weapons into his navel. By-and-by, mysterious deaths befall men whose actions are disagreeable to Cai; the troops tire of Cai's disciplinarian ways and petition for his removal. Liu approves of Cai's assassination; the soldiers attempt to behead him while he is asleep, but Cai's head immediately reattaches to his body. Next, they slice open his belly, only to be met with an onslaught of halberds and arrows. Upon being notified of this, Liu rushes into Cai's tent but he is nowhere to be found. Publication history Originally titled \\"Cai Weiweng\\" (), the story was first published in Pu Songling's anthology of close to five hundred short stories, Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio or Liaozhai Zhiyi. It was translated into English by Sidney L. Sondergard and included in the fourth volume of Strange Tales from Liaozhai published in 2010. Themes and analysis Several commentators have argued that the story promotes anti-Qing sentiment. Zhu Jidun writes that the titular character symbolises the Southern Ming dynasty. Comparing it with other Strange Tales entries like \\"Household Monsters\\" and \\"General She\\", Wang Xiaojia remarks that Pu adopts a particularly wistful attitude towards the collapse of the Ming dynasty in \\"Cai Weiweng\\". The story also alludes to the gathering of over ten thousand rebels by Changshan Ming loyalist Liu Konghe () in support of the Hongguang Emperor.

As well as guiding ships, it was also used as a water tower. The lighthouse is 22 m (72 ft) high and has a focal height of 41 m (135 ft). The light has a range of 17 nautical miles. Benghazi lighthouse The lighthouse sustained some damage during World War II, but was much more severely damaged in the recent Libyan civil war. Some of the Islamist opponents of the military commander Khalifa Hafter took shelter in the lighthouse, and later used it to bury about 200 of their dead. Airstrikes hit the upper chamber and took out the lantern which fell but was not destroyed. In 2014, a 5-meter diameter clock in the colors of the national flag was inserted into the sea-facing side of the lighthouse, a donation from businessman Abubakr Sheikh, in spite of opposition from the architectural community. Renovation A renovation project announced in 2019 aims restore the lighthouse to its original state, and is projected to take 13 to 17 months.

About 70% of Iranian students are members of this social network.

Reactions  Simultaneously with the unveiling of the Software, many students and teachers criticized the software.They claimed that the software had low quality and could not compensate for the training for students. In the view of some, its inefficiency is due to the fact that some students live in deprived areas and lack facilities such as computers, laptops, smartphones, and even high-speed or regular Internet.

The son of The Reverend Robert Warburton, he was born at Huddersfield in May 1919. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School, before going up to Brasenose College, Oxford in 1938. While studying at Oxford, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Gloucestershire at Oxford in 1939. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed for 4 runs in the Oxford first- innings by Tom Goddard, while in their second innings he was dismissed without scoring by the same bowler. With his right-arm fast bowling, he bowled a total of eight overs without taking a wicket. Due to the slow nature of the wickets at the start of the cricket season, he was not afforded further opportunities and this was to be Warburton's only first-class appearance for Oxford. The start of the Second World War in September 1939 meant that just two weeks after returning to Oxford after the summer term, Warburton found himself in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, initially holding the rank of sergeant before being commissioned as a flying officer. He was promoted to flying officer in September 1940. After completing his training he helped to train Polish pilots of the Polish Air Force. On 4 February 1941, Warburton was flying a Wellington bomber from No. 18 Operational Training Unit on a training mission with a mixture of Polish and British aircrew. While flying over Crewe, the bomber was hit by friendly fire from a Home Guard anti aircraft unit near the Rolls-Royce factory and subsequently collided with a barrage balloon, crashing and killing all on board. He was buried at West Knoyle in Wiltshire, near to the family home at Mere.

Wallachia during its history lost several portions of its territory, either to the Ottomans or the Habsburgs. However, this land would be later essentially recovered in its entirety. Moldavia, on the other hand, suffered great territorial losses. In 1775, the Habsburgs invaded Bukovina and annexed it, and in 1812, the Russian Empire took control of Bessarabia. Both territories were later exposed to powerful colonization policies. The principalities declared unification in 1859 as the Principality of Romania. This new state sought independence from the Ottoman Empire's vassalage, and in 1878, it fought a war against it alongside Russia. However, the latter would annex Southern Bessarabia, which was recovered decades before. Romania received Northern Dobruja as compensation, and would wage a war for the southern part against Bulgaria in 1913. The now kingdom of Romania had great territorial ambitions which, once they were promised by the Entente, dragged Romania to World War I in 1916. Initially, it suffered a defeat leading to the loss of its Carpathian mountain passes and Dobruja in 1918. During this period, the union of Bessarabia with Romania was achieved. As the Central Powers weakened and pressure from the Entente (especially from France) increased, Romania reentered the war the same year. The Entente turned out to be the winner and Romania regained its lost territories after its initial defeat, as well as Bukovina and Transylvania. During this period, the country reached its maximum territorial extension, being known as Greater Romania. However, Romania's neighbors were not satisfied with the new borders. Romania relied on regional alliances and protection from France and the United Kingdom at the west. However, soon Nazi Germany defeated France, causing great concern in the country. Since it was already apparent that the West could no longer protect Romania, the Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertza region in 1940 after an ultimatum that Romania was forced to accept. The king, Carol II, was alarmed and sought the help of Germany to protect Romania's territory, but it forced the country to cede Northern Transylvania to Hungary and Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria. The king lost all his popularity, causing Ion Antonescu's rise to power. He officially joined Axis and demanded territories from Yugoslavia after its invasion, specifically Banat and the Timok Valley. This, however, never happened. In 1941, the Axis invaded the Soviet Union, allowing the recovery by Romania of its lost territories plus Transnistria, which was placed under civilian administration. Nevertheless, this operation failed, and after the overthrow of Antonescu, Romania changed sides in 1944 and fought against the Axis, thus losing Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina once again to the Soviet Union. This made possible the recovery of Northern Transylvania by the country. A communist government with Soviet backing was fully installed in the country in 1947. The Soviet Union had occupied several Romanian islands in the Danube Delta and the Black Sea, being this a territorial change which was made official in 1948. One of these islands was the Snake Island, which caused a dispute over the maritime borders between the now democratic Romania and Ukraine in 2009 in which Romania gained 80% of the disputed zone. Nowadays, nationalists and other Romanian groups seek the territorial expansion of their country, especially through Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Background The Principality of Moldavia at its greatest peak, including Pokuttya The Principality of Romania appeared in 1859 after the unification of the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia. However, these countries were founded in the 14th century, and their borders changed repeatedly throughout history. Wallachia, which had obtained Dobruja during the reign of Mircea the Elder, lost the territory to the Ottomans at the end of it (around 1418). In the same period, the Ottomans annexed two ports north of the Danube, Giurgiu and Turnu MƒÉgurele. In the middle of the 16th century, Wallachia also lost the city of BrƒÉila. During the year 1600, Michael the Brave, ruler of Wallachia, unified the three Romanian principalities (Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania), although this union would be dismembered shortly after. The Austro-Turkish War that ended in 1718 was won by the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy, which, among other lands, annexed Oltenia (the western part of Wallachia). However, the Treaty of Belgrade of 1739 again yielded Oltenia to Wallachia. In 1826, as a result of the Akkerman Convention, Wallachia reclaimed the three ports north of the Danube, drawing the Ottoman-Wallachian border across the Danube again. On the other hand, there is the principality of Moldavia. It emerged as a state after the defeat of the Tatars by the King of Hungary, Louis I. The area remained under Hungarian influence and was formally established as a Hungarian fiefdom in 1347 under Drago»ô. He was succeeded by Sas, who would be defeated by Bogdan I finishing the Hungarian suzerainty over Moldavia and starting its independence. It is argued, however, that for most (or all) of his reign and on its aftermath, Moldavia remained a Hungarian vassal (or Hungarian-Polish during the union of both from 1370 to 1382). The first Moldavian territorial change would take place a few years later. In 1388, W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço wanted money to wage a war against the Teutonic Order, so he asked Petru II of Moldavia for a loan (4,000 rubles). Pokuttya was used as a pledge, and it was ceded to it. This loan was probably never paid. The territory would become a place of dispute between Poland and Moldavia for the next two centuries, and was finally lost by the latter one in 1531 after the Battle of Obertyn. Meanwhile, it lost the ports of Kiliya and Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in 1484 to the Ottomans, followed by the annexation of the entire Moldavian coast (Budjak) by them in 1538. In 1711, due to the strategic importance of the town of Khotyn and the area around it, the Ottomans annexed it from Moldavia, settled it with Lipka Tatars and made it a sanjak (a province). Bukovina would later be invaded and annexed by the Habsburgs in 1775, undertaking a strong process of Ukrainization. Moldavia's last major territorial loss took place in 1812. The Ottomans and the Russian Empire would wage a war between 1806 and 1812, which ended with the Treaty of Bucharest that ceded to the latter Bessarabia, the eastern part of the principality. This region, just like Bukovina, suffered severe Russian colonization. Nevertheless, following the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, Moldavia recovered Southern Bessarabia in 1856. After the devastation of the Kingdom of Hungary at Ottoman hands and its subsequent partition, Transylvania also became its own nearly independent state which included not only the geographic region of Transylvania, but also parts of Banat and the \\"Western Parts\\" (Bereg, Cri»ôana, Maramure»ô, parts of Szolnok, Ung and others; sometimes collectively known as Partium). However, the principality was not leaded by Romanians and it was conquered by the Habsburgs in 1699. History=Formation and independence administrative divisions in 1864 In 1859, the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia declared unification under a hereditary prince, in this case, Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Carol I was later elected as prince in 1866 after a referendum was approved. This new state was still an Ottoman vassal, and was not fully independent. Therefore, as \\"reluctant\\" allies, both Romania and Russia fought a war against the Ottoman Empire, which was defeated. However, in the aftermath, Russia attempted to retrieve Southern Bessarabia from Romania, which was repeatedly rejected. After a series of negotiations, Russia promised to respect Romania's territorial integrity with a treaty in 1877. This was broken just a year later, when Russian represented Romania in the Treaty of San Stefano of 1878, took Northern Dobruja and the Snake Island and offered it to Romania in exchange for Southern Bessarabia. This treaty was later revised by the Western powers in the Congress of Berlin, ending in the loss of Southern Bessarabia anyway. Thus, in 1878, Romania lost the territory but gained independence from the Ottomans and Northern Dobruja (including the Danube Delta). During the negotiations, the Danubian island of Ada Kaleh was not discussed. Hungarian journalist Emil Lengyel declared \\"the island belonged to Turkey, but the peacemakers forgot about it at the Berlin Congress in 1878\\". According to the articles of this congress, the Danube had to be a neutral zone. Therefore, Austria-Hungary interpreted the island as being no man's land. Members of the Hungarian Parliament called for annexation of the island and contacted the Ottoman Empire to find out if they had their consent to do this, nevertheless the annexation was carried out in 1913. The island remained with Austro-Hungarian troops but also a Turkish civil administrator, a vague situation that would last for several decades. In 1881, the Kingdom of Romania was proclaimed. The First Balkan War at the beginning of the 20th century presented an imbalance of the power in the region, as Austria-Hungary supported a powerful Bulgarian state and a weak and devastated Serbia. Romania did not support this, and after unfruitful negotiations, Romania joined the Second Balkan War in 1913 against Bulgaria. Ending in its victory, Romania gained Southern Dobruja, including Silistra, which was promised in 1878. World War I Treaty of Bucharest of 1918 When World War I began in 1914, Romania initially maintained a policy of neutrality. However, after secret negotiations with the Triple Entente, the Treaty of Bucharest of 1916 was signed. This treaty promised Romania the regions of Transylvania, Bukovina, Banat and other Hungarian territories along the Tisza River (Cri»ôana). Prime Minister Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, in charge of the Romanian foreign policy after Carol I's death in 1914, was highly suspicious of whether the Entente would deliver on its promises due to the event of Southern Bessarabia decades earlier. Therefore, he insisted on various clauses and conditions in the treaty to ensure that it would be fulfilled. In August 1916, Romania entered the war and invaded Transylvania, but an attack by the Central Powers from the south ruined its actions. The Romanian army was courageous and enthusiastic, but it was poorly equipped and inexperienced. In December, the Central Powers had already occupied Wallachia and Dobruja. This raised doubts for the Entente as to whether Romanian claims had to be accomplished, and they did not invite Romania to participate in following conferences about the war. This changed after a visit to Moscow from BrƒÉtianu complaining about this and in which he convinced the Entente of the importance of Romania in the region. Eventually, the Russian army collapsed and Russia would be forced to abandon the war. Romania, although it had managed to repudiate an offensive towards Moldavia, was left alone on the Eastern Front and was now worried about the threat of the Russian revolutionary forces. Thus, it signed the Armistice of Foc»ôani with the Central Powers on 9 December 1917. Meanwhile, Bessarabia, which had declared itself as the Moldavian Democratic Republic in 15 December, united with Romania on 9 April 1918. This was ratified by King Ferdinand I on 17 April. Eventually Romania would end up signing a formal peace treaty with the Central Powers, the Treaty of Bucharest of 1918, almost three months after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with which Russia left the war. The conditions were harsh: Romania was to cede the Carpathian mountain passes to Austria- Hungary and Dobruja under the administration of the Central Powers (everything below Constan»õa was annexed by Bulgaria). Furthermore, Romania had to lease its oil fields to Germany for 90 years and almost unlimited rights to export grain and other Romanian raw materials. This left the country almost indefensible. As compensation, the Central Powers recognized the union of Bessarabia with Romania. However, Ferdinand I refused to ratify the treaty, which he could easily do due to the changes in the Western Front that distracted Germany. In the autumn of 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, making possible Romanian claims easier to fulfill. The Entente, and especially France, were seeking Romanian assistance to defeat the rest of the enemy troops in southeastern Europe and to cooperate with the pro-Allied Russian troops. The French general Henri Mathias Berthelot, who had left Romania 6 months earlier, was sent to Thessaloniki (Greece) to encourage it to rejoin the war from there. This was accomplished on November 10, when Romania declared war once again. Interwar period Greater Romania and its regions The Romanians of Bukovina declared union with the country on 28 November and those of Transylvania on 1 December. During the Paris Peace Conference, BrƒÉtianu did everything possible to secure Romania's new borders. Transylvania was the most important topic for him, so much so that he sent the Romanian army to Hungary despite the prohibitions from the Supreme Council of the Allied powers. The Romanian offensive was successful and the Hungarian Soviet Republic was disbanded on 1 August 1919. After severe diplomatic pressure, Romania signed the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine with Bulgaria on 27 November (leaving the border the same) and the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye with Austria and treaties regarding ethnic minorities on 9 December 1919. Romania did not receive all of Banat, but two thirds, almost everything else going to Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Treaty of Trianon signed on 4 June 1920 defined the border between Romania and Hungary, the former receiving all of Transylvania and other lands in eastern Hungary (parts of Cri»ôana and Maramure»ô). Romanian diplomats had also claimed the island of Ada Kaleh to protect the port of Or»ôova, and Romania received it after the signing of the treaty. This was confirmed by Turkey in 1923 in the Treaty of Lausanne. Finally, the Supreme Council recognized Bessarabia's union with Romania without detailing too much, since it would leave the issue for negotiations between Romania and Russia. By the end of 1920, the Romanian borders were settled. Romania gained (making a total area of ) and 8,500,000 inhabitants (with a total of 16,250,000). The Romanian national ideal was fullfilled, thus appearing Greater Romania. Further, in 1931, Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga received a concession in the Adriatic port of Sarand√´ from King Zog I of Albania as gratitude for his support in obtaining and recognizing the independence of the Albanian state. Carol II, King of Romania, issued in 1934 a royal decree creating a scientific mission in Albania. The same year, Iorga donated the land to the Romanian state, on the condition that a scientific institute would be established and that a space reserved for him would be left. Albania was invaded in April 1939 by Italy, hampering the Romanian institute's activities. Iorga decided to stop research on it, and he was killed a year later. All this led the Romanian government to abolish the institute. It was later demolished after receiving extensive damage during World War II in 1945. The land, on the other hand, was converted into patrimony of the Albanian state under Enver Hoxha's regime. During the interwar period, Romania's greatest goal was to defend the country's new borders against the Soviet Union and Germany, as well as the revisionist Bulgaria and Hungary. Romanian politicians saw the United Kingdom and especially France as the defenders of peace that made this possible. The country also supported the establishment of the League of Nations and other regional alliances (Balkan Pact and Little Entente) to counter its enemies. However, Romania never managed to improve its relations with Hungary and the Soviet Union. The former insisted on the return of Transylvania, while the latter never accepted the loss of Bessarabia. Romanian leaders trusted the assumed hostility between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that maintained a balance of power. That is why the non-aggression pact signed on 23 August 1939 between the two shocked them, causing great insecurity in the country. In addition, under the secret terms of the pact, Nazi Germany had already recognized the Soviet interest in Bessarabia. World War II Romania after the territorial losses of 1940 World War II began in September 1939, and the German victory on the Western Front and the subsequent defeat of France in June 1940 seriously alarmed Carol II. He was convinced that the allies could no longer defend Romania, so he decided that the only way to keep the country together was by relying on Germany. However, this did not prevent the Soviet ultimatum of 26 June 1940. In it, the cession within 24 hours of Bessarabia was ordered, as well as Northern Bukovina as compensation for the \\"suffering of the Bessarabians under Romanian rule\\". In the ultimatum it was said that Bessarabia was \\"for the most part (ethnically) Ukrainian\\" and that Northern Bukovina was \\"linked to Soviet Ukraine\\". Further, the map of the ultimatum was drawn with a red thick pencil that allowed the Soviet Union to also occupy the Hertza region even if it was not mentioned in the text. Since the Allies had fallen and Germany and Italy were urging him to accept the claims, Carol II accepted the ultimatum. Thus, on 28 June, the Soviet Union occupied the mentioned territories. After this, Carol II desperately tried to integrate with Adolf Hitler's Germany as quickly as possible to avoid claims from Bulgaria and Hungary. On July 4, he brought in a pro-German government that immediately declared Romanian withdrawal from the League of Nations and adhesion to the Axis powers. Carol II also called for Germany to respect Romanian borders and cooperation between the armies of both countries, but Hitler stated that this would only be possible after resolving territorial disputes with its neighbors. The Transylvania dispute was difficult to negotiate, with the Romanian public completely opposed to its cedation. Negotiations with Hungary started on 16 August did not reach an agreement, and Hitler decided to resolve the dispute. He saw it necessary to somewhat satisfy Hungary and not cripple Romania, but also to keep both of them dissatisfied to ensure their cooperation with Germany. In Vienna, Hitler showed his proposal and gave the option to either accept or fight with Axis-backed Hungary. Following a Crown Council on 30 August, the Second Vienna Award was accepted and Hungary was given Northern Transylvania. Further, after negotiations, the Treaty of Craiova that returned Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria was signed on 7 September. Romania lost a third of its territory () and population (6,161,317 inhabitants). Carol II thus lost all his prestige, and upon reflection, he chose General Ion Antonescu to rule the country. He was an authoritarian nationalist with links to the Iron Guard who did not even favor Germany. He demanded the abdication and flight of Carol II from the country, which he did on 7 September. His son Michael I, now King, issued a decree the same day and he made Antonescu leader (ConducƒÉtor) of Romania and gave him full powers. The Italian failure in Greece and worsening German-Soviet relations increased Hitler's trust towards Romania, which formally joined the Axis on 23 November. Antonescu insisted several times on the reversal of the Second Vienna Award, being convinced that the only way to regain the territory would be to cooperate with Germany. The Axis needed to secure all borders before an attack on the Soviet Union. Thus, Yugoslavia was invaded on 6 April 1941. Hitler had already announced how the Yugoslav territories would be partitioned, including the Serbian Banat, which was to become Hungarian. Although Romania was not included in the operation, the Romanian Government was already suspicious of a possible invasion of Yugoslavia and of the possibility that Hungary could annex the Serbian Banat. At that time, tensions between the two countries were high due to the conflict in Northern Translyvania and the massacres carried against the Romanian population by the Hungarians. Antonescu, seeing himself forced to act, announced during a meeting with a German commander on 3 April that a Hungarian occupation of the region would outrage the Romanian public and force him to intervene, causing a possible war between Hungary and Romania. After this, Hungarian troops were prohibited from operating east of the Tisza River (in Banat), and on 12 April, the Serbian Banat was placed under German military administration. This was seen by Hitler as \\"preparation\\" for the Hungarian rule. During a meeting between the Italian foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano and his German counterpart Joachim von Ribbentrop, Ciano declared his wish to give the Serbian Banat (apart from Baƒçka and Baranya) to Hungary. This is probably what triggered the Romanian Government's official claim to the territory sent on 23 April. Romanian officials, national newspapers and the population itself had already demanded this. For them, this request was rightful based on ethnic and historic grounds. Antonescu said that an annexation of the Serbian Banat would increase his popularity and strengthen his position as leader, being after all the territorial losses of 1940 the ones that forced Carol II to flee the country. Antonescu later wrote a memorandum on 11 June and sent it to von Ribbentrop. On it, he reaffirmed the loyalty of Romania and the need to yield not only Banat, but also the Timok Valley, which had a large Romanian population. This memorandum also claimed that \\"the region from Timok to Thessaloniki was Romanian\\". To support this, Antonescu attempted to persuade Hitler by showing him the wish of the Romanians of Banat, Timok and also Transnistria to be incorporated into Romania and the situation of the Aromanians in the Balkans. At the end, the Germans never found a solution that satisfied both Hungary and Romania, and the Serbian Banat remained under military administration until 1944. Romanian territory in May 1942 On 12 June, Hitler revealed to Antonescu his plans to invade the Soviet Union. Antonescu promised him full economic and military participation. The population strongly supported the idea, as it was seen as the opportunity to eliminate the Russian threat once and for all. A few hours before the invasion began, Antonescu and Michael I declared a \\"holy war\\" for the liberation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. The invasion began on 22 June, but Romanian military operations began on 2 July. After several battles, both regions were reintegrated into the Romanian state on 25 July. A meeting between Hitler and Antonescu on 6 August determined that the area between the Dniester and the Southern Bug rivers (Transnistria) would be placed under Romanian civil administration. Further, Romanian troops would occupy the area between the Southern Bug and Dnieper River and a few others would cross the Dnieper and continue the invasion. On 19 August, the Transnistria Governorate was established, which was not formally annexed to Romania unlike Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Many Romanian troops participated in the German offensives in southern Russia and the Caucasus. The defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad convinced Antonescu that a German victory was impossible, and he began to protect the east of Romania, although he continued to support Germany with troops and material. Several Romanian political figures tried to get Romania out of the war, their leader being Iuliu Maniu. He had communicated to the British Government that the Romanian public was not interested in war beyond the Dniester (the border between Bessarabia and Transnistria) and that they only wanted to defend Romanian territorial integrity, including Northern Transylvania. However, in January 1943, the United Kingdom reported that the borders of post-war Romania had to be negotiated with the Soviet Union. In March 1944, Soviet troops entered Romanian territory (Northern Moldavia). Barbu »òtirbey, Maniu's representative, began negotiating with the Allies and the Soviet Union in early 1944 in Cairo. The Soviet representative presented on 12 April the minimum conditions for an armistice. These included a breakdown of relations with Germany and switching to the Allied side to fight against it, the restoration of the 1940 Romanian-Soviet border and the nullification of the Second Vienna Award (thus giving Northern Transylvania back to Romania). After unsuccessful attempts to soften these conditions, Maniu accepted on 10 June 1944. Opposition against the war and Antonescu's dictatorship grew greatly, and on 23 August, while a Soviet offensive continued to take place, King Michael I and others performed a coup that ended in Antonescu's arrest. That same day, he announced that Romania had officially joined the Allies and that the army was being mobilized for the liberation of Northern Transylvania. An official armistice was signed on 13 September. A struggle for power began between the various Romanian political parties, and the communist leaders traveled to Moscow, where they were promised full support for seize power. After strong Soviet pressure, Petru Groza, leader of the communist-allied Ploughmen's Front, took power. Map showing the Romanian territorial changes in the Danube Delta of 1948 On 10 February 1947, the Paris Peace Treaties that confirmed Romanian sovereignty over Northern Transylvania were signed. A new government with Groza again as leader which was predominantly communist was established in December 1946. It began to dominate all aspects of the Romanian economy in early 1947. Its intention was to remove all political opponents such as Maniu, and on 29 October 1947, they were tried. The last step for communist domination over Romania was made on 30 December 1947. King Michael I was forced to abdicate, and afterwards, the Romanian People's Republic was proclaimed. Although the Paris Peace Treaties reaffirmed the border between Romania and the Soviet Union, the latter had occupied in 1944 a group of islands that had not been included in the ultimatum of 1940. The Soviet Union insisted on signing a protocol defining the border between both countries, which was fulfilled on 4 February 1948. According to this protocol, the Soviet Union would annex the Danubian islands of TƒÉtaru Mic, Daleru Mic, Daleru Mare, Maican and Limba, as well as the Snake Island in the Black Sea. On the other side, Romania would keep the Danubian islands of TƒÉtaru Mare, Cernovca and Babina. Postwar period Map showing the claims of Romania and Ukraine and the final decision done by the ICJ After the fall of communism in Romania with the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, Romania tried to regain the small Snake Island. Since it is located on the Black Sea, it has access to the sea's continental shelf rich in petroleum and natural gas resources. The owner of it was now Ukraine, as the Soviet Union had collapsed in 1991. Romania later gave up on the island and in 1997, Ukraine and it signed a good neighborliness and cooperation treaty. It was specified on it that both countries had to define the maritime boundary between them. All rounds of negotiations failed. Therefore, Romania requested the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to solve the dispute, thus starting a case. Romania argued that in the 1997 treaty, both countries agreed to a declaration saying that the island cannot support a permanent population or an economic life on its own, so it should not affect the maritime borders of both countries. Ukraine responded by saying that there is a difference between a declaration and a reservation and that this does not change the legal status of the treaty. The ICJ was therefore under no obligation to take this into account. After examining old treaties between Romania and the Soviet Union, it was determined that Snake Island should have an arc of as delimitation. In addition, the previous Romanian declaration was later applied, and the ICJ determined that Snake Island was not an island, but a rock without the ability to change the maritime borders between the two countries. The ICJ also said that Ukraine's delimitation claim was too close to the Romanian coast for no apparent reason, affecting the security interests of the country. At the end, the ICJ concluded the case on 3 February 2009 by drawing a boundary line that gave 80% of the disputed area to Romania. Aftermath Nowadays, there are several supporters of the idea of expanding the current borders of Romania. Most of them are nationalists, extremists and far-right parties like Greater Romania Party or Noua DreaptƒÉ. These focus specially on the recovery of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina (a restoration of Greater Romania), now in Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. They also oppose strongly territorial claims against Romania, namely Hungarian ones regarding Transylvania.
