OMTP launched the BONDI initiative, which defined new interfaces (Javascript APIs) and a security framework (based on XACML policy description) to enable the access to mobile phone functionality (Application Invocation, Application Settings, Camera, Communications Log, Gallery, Location, Messaging, Persistent Data, Personal Information, Phone Status, User Interaction) from browser and widget engine in a secure way. BONDI supports widget-based applications as well as web-based applications.  History  BONDI was initiated in 2008 by OMTP. The first BONDI widget, based on a preliminary version of the 1.0 specification was shown at MWC 2009 in February 2009. Version 1.0 of the API specification released on June, 2nd, 2009 with a maintenance release (1.01) following on July, 30th, 2009 Version 1.1 of the API was released as stable on February, 11th, 2010. In February 2010, at MWC 2010 the Samsung Wave was released as the first mobile phone to contain the BONDI as a built-in API as part of the bada platform. At MWC 2010, The Wholesale Applications Community (WAC) announced that BONDI would be one of the technologies used.  API  As of release 1.1, the BONDI API defines the following interfaces: * Application Launcher - Access to the installed applications. It also provides access to the native applications such as messaging, telephony and newly installed applications. * Messaging - Send and manage text-, binary and multimedia- messages via Email, SMS, and MMS. * User Interaction - To allow widgets to access functions that integrate with the widget runtime user interface. * File System - Access to the filesystem of a device. * Gallery - Access to media galleries located on the phone. * Device Status - Access to status information, such as battery level or display orientation. * Application Configuration - Access to application specific static storage for preference and other application settings. * Geolocation - Allows the detection of the user's location by abstracting from a range of location methods. * Camera - Access to local camera devices to allow capturing video and photo. * Telephony - Access to information on recent calls (missed, received, and initiated). * PIM - Personal Information Management provides access to contacts, calendars and tasks APIs. See below. * Contact - Access to contacts available in the address books. * Calendar - Access to device calendars. * Task - Access to phone resident task management functions The upcoming 1.5 API will add or change the following APIs: * APDU - Allows the communication between web application and a smart card by using the Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs). * Bluetooth - Access to the bluetooth functionality. * Crypto - Provides cryptographic functions like hashing, signature verification, encrypting and decrypting. * DLNA - Enables discovery of the DLNA devices in the local network and control of the devices. * Server Push - Provides functionality of OMA Push delivery to Web Applications running in the widget context. * Sensor - Access to device sensors, such as accelerometer, altimeter, ambient temperature or tilt sensors. * Telephony - Extension of existing API to enable the handling of incoming and outgoing phone calls.  Policies  To safeguard users from malicious web applications, BONDI defines a policy layer between the API and the device. Policies can be set on a widget provider level (for signed widgets) on a widget level or on an API call-by- call level for web pages. Every widget carries a manifest declaring the APIs to be used by that widget, allowing users to install (or deny installation) based on the function the widget intends to use.

The exhibition was made in collaboration between Swedish artist Karl Tuikkanen and London based Australian artist David Brazier and represents the first physical manifestation of their artistic partnership exploring ideas of communication and collaboration mediated through the internet. Standard Model Installation View, Nordin Gallery, Stockholm, 2009 Process Central to the artists‚Äô process has been mining the public information resource Wikipedia, allowing for the logic of the network to develop the content of the exhibition. Beginning with the Wikipedia page for ‚Äòstandard model‚Äô the artists used the system of selecting and sending Wikipedia links between Stockholm and London to quickly take them to destinations far removed from their points of departure. Reminiscent of surrealist strategies of ‚Äústream of consciousness‚Äù and ‚ÄúExquisite Corpse‚Äù Tuikkanen and Brazier relinquish authorial control, choosing instead to hand it over to the web based dialogue and the content of internet links. In doing so, coherence and rationality is discarded for a logic which follows loose associations, without hierarchy or proof of authenticity. Links Each artist began with the Wikipedia page for ‚Äòstandard model‚Äô. From there the artist would select a link and send it to the other artist who would repeat the process until the final information page was six times removed from the original Wikipedia page for ‚Äòstandard model‚Äô. The information that emerged through this process provided the content for works made and exhibited. This process was repeated 12 times. The chain of links for each work is shown below.

It is a Breakout clone, with some additional elements not normally found in other games in the genre. Gameplay thumb The object of the game is to clear levels by either destroying all bricks or defeating the enemies. There are four zones of eleven levels each.Instruction booklet, p. 16 The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles.Instruction booklet, p. 10 There were also level warps in the form of Konami Man,Instruction booklet, p. 6 who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically one to three enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the gameInstruction booklet, p. 4 (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning. If the player input the password correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from the game. The password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.

Thus, information and education work in Germany adds to Action for World Solidarity's activities as well. History ASW supported the fight against white supremacy in Zimbabwe in 1980The birth of Action for World Solidarity is the Appeal for the Hungry (orig. \\"Aufruf f√ºr die Hungernden\\"), initiated by Lothar Kreyssig in 1957 and signed by well-known personalities of German public life, including Heinrich Albertz, Willy Brandt, Heinz Galinski, Kurt Scharf and Otto Suhr. People were requested to forego a meal once a week and to donate the thereby saved money for starving people in poor countries. Subsequently, Action for the Hungry (orig. \\"Aktionsgemeinschaft f√ºr die Hungernden\\") was founded. The construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 led to a split-up of Action for the Hungry. While being instrumental in founding the non-governmental organization INKOTA (Information, Coordination, Conferences) with help of the evangelic church in East Germany, the non-denominational Action for World Solidarity evolved in West Germany. In 1975, the former board of directors decided to end the implementation of child sponsorships due to the realization that while child sponsorships indeed raise the donation income, local children hardly benefit from them. Sponsorships isolated children and estranged them from their family and village community. Until 1982, the support of children's homes ran out and since then Action for World Solidarity intensively promotes community aid. Already in the early stages, Action for World Solidarity sustained an office in India.\\"History of the CSW\\" CWS. Retrieved 16 February 2018. Since the 70s, more and more Indian partners were put in charge for mentoring the projects in India. This evolution of the AWS India Office resulted in the foundation of the Centre for World Solidarity CWS in 1992, which became an independently acting partner of Action for World Solidarity.\\"Centre for World Solidarity\\" Pacs in India.

Funding Action for World Solidarity is largely financed by private donations. Major projects are supported by third-party funds.

They play an important role in the development of political and social systems. Motives for action may be based on political, religious, moral, or commercial positions. Groups use varied methods to try to achieve their aims, including lobbying, media campaigns, publicity stunts, polls, research, and policy briefings. Some groups are supported or backed by powerful business or political interests and exert considerable influence on the political process, while others have few or no such resources. Some have developed into important social, political institutions or social movements. Some powerful advocacy groups have been accused of manipulating the democratic system for narrow commercial gain and in some instances have been found guilty of corruption, fraud, bribery, and other serious crimes; . Some groups, generally ones with less financial resources, may use direct action and civil disobedience and in some cases are accused of being a threat to the social order or 'domestic extremists'. Research is beginning to explore how advocacy groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action. Overview An advocacy group is a group or an organization which tries to influence the government but does not hold power in the government. History=Beginnings Satirical engraving of Wilkes by William Hogarth. On the table beside Wilkes lies two editions of The North Briton. The early growth of pressure groups was connected to broad economic and political changes in England in the mid-18th century, including political representation, market capitalization, and proletarianization. The first mass social movement catalyzed around the controversial political figure, John Wilkes. As editor of the paper The North Briton, Wilkes vigorously attacked the new administration of Lord Bute and the peace terms that the new government accepted at the 1763 Treaty of Paris at the end of the Seven Years' War. Charged with seditious libel, Wilkes was arrested after the issue of a general warrant, a move that Wilkes denounced as unlawful ‚Äì the Lord Chief Justice eventually ruled in Wilkes favour. As a result of this episode, Wilkes became a figurehead to the growing movement for popular sovereignty among the middle classes ‚Äì people began chanting, \\"Wilkes and Liberty\\" in the streets. After a later period of exile, brought about by further charges of libel and obscenity, Wilkes stood for the Parliamentary seat at Middlesex, where most of his support was located. When Wilkes was imprisoned in the King's Bench Prison on 10 May 1768, a mass movement of support emerged, with large demonstrations in the streets under the slogan \\"No liberty, no King.\\" Stripped of the right to sit in Parliament, Wilkes became an Alderman of London in 1769, and an activist group called the Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights began aggressively promoting his policies.www.historyhome.co.uk This was the first ever sustained social advocacy group;‚Äîit involved public meetings, demonstrations, the distribution of pamphlets on an unprecedented scale and the mass petition march. However, the movement was careful not to cross the line into open rebellion;‚Äîit tried to rectify the faults in governance through appeals to existing legal precedents and was conceived of as an extra-Parliamentary form of agitation to arrive at a consensual and constitutional arrangement. The force and influence of this social advocacy movement on the streets of London compelled the authorities to concede to the movement's demands. Wilkes was returned to Parliament, general warrants were declared as unconstitutional and press freedom was extended to the coverage of Parliamentary debates. Another important advocacy group that emerged in the late 18th century was the British abolitionist movement against slavery. Starting with an organised sugar boycott in 1791, it led the second great petition drive of 1806, which brought about the banning of the slave trade in 1807. In the opinion of Eugene Black (1963), \\"...association made possible the extension of the politically effective public. Modern extra parliamentary political organization is a product of the late eighteenth century [and] the history of the age of reform cannot be written without it. Growth and spread The Great Chartist Meeting on Kennington Common, London in 1848. From 1815, Britain after victory in the Napoleonic Wars entered a period of social upheaval characterised by the growing maturity of the use of social movements and special-interest associations. Chartism was the first mass movement of the growing working- class in the world. It campaigned for political reform between 1838 and 1848 with the People's Charter of 1838 as its manifesto ‚Äì this called for universal suffrage and the implementation of the secret ballot, amongst other things. The term \\"social movements\\" was introduced in 1848 by the German Sociologist Lorenz von Stein in his book Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848) in which he introduced the term \\"social movement\\" into scholarly discussionsTilly, 2004, p. 5. ‚Äì actually depicting in this way political movements fighting for the social rights understood as welfare rights. Martin Luther King Jr. led the American Civil Rights Movement, one of the most famous social movements of the 20th century. The labor movement and socialist movement of the late 19th century are seen as the prototypical social movements, leading to the formation of communist and social democratic parties and organisations. These tendencies were seen in poorer countries as pressure for reform continued, for example in Russia with the Russian Revolution of 1905 and of 1917, resulting in the collapse of the Czarist regime around the end of the First World War. In the post-war period, women's rights, gay rights, peace, civil rights, anti-nuclear and environmental movements emerged, often dubbed the New Social Movements,Westd, David B. \\"New Social Movements.\\" Knowledge Center. Built on the Thematic Theme Framework., 16 July 2004. some of which may be considered \\"general interest groups\\" as opposed to special interest groups. They led, among other things, to the formation of green parties and organisations influenced by the new left. Some find in the end of the 1990s the emergence of a new global social movement, the anti-globalization movement. Some social movement scholars posit that with the rapid pace of globalization, the potential for the emergence of new type of social movement is latent‚Äîthey make the analogy to national movements of the past to describe what has been termed a global citizens movement. Activities Advocacy groups exist in a wide variety of genres based upon their most pronounced activities. * Anti-defamation organizations issue responses or criticisms to real or supposed slights of any sort (including speech or violence) by an individual or group against a specific segment of the population which the organization exists to represent. * Watchdog groups exist to provide oversight and rating of actions or media by various outlets, both government and corporate. They may also index personalities, organizations, products, and activities in databases to provide coverage and rating of the value or viability of such entities to target demographics. * Lobby groups lobby for a change to the law or the maintenance of a particular law and big businesses fund very considerable lobbying influence on legislators, for example in the USA and in the UK where lobbying first developed. Some Lobby groups have considerable financial resources at their disposal. Lobbying is regulated to stop the worst abuses which can develop into corruption. In the United States the Internal Revenue Service makes a clear distinction between lobbying and advocacy. * Lobby groups spend considerable amounts of money on election advertising as well. For example, the 2011 documentary film Hot Coffee contains interviews of former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver E. Diaz, Jr. and evidence the US Chamber of Commerce paid for advertising to unseat him. * Legal defense funds provide funding for the legal defense for, or legal action against, individuals or groups related to their specific interests or target demographic. This is often accompanied by one of the above types of advocacy groups filing an amicus curiae if the cause at stake serves the interests of both the legal defense fund and the other advocacy groups. * Astroturfing groups mask the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants. It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection. Influence In most liberal democracies, advocacy groups tend to use the bureaucracy as the main channel of influence ‚Äì because, in liberal democracies, this is where the decision-making power lies. The aim of advocacy groups here is to attempt to influence a member of the legislature to support their cause by voting a certain way in the legislature. Access to this channel is generally restricted to groups with insider status such as large corporations and trade unions ‚Äì groups with outsider status are unlikely to be able to meet with ministers or other members of the bureaucracy to discuss policy. What must be understood about groups exerting influence in the bureaucracy is; \\"the crucial relationship here [in the bureaucracy] is usually that between the senior bureaucrats and leading business or industrial interests\\". This supports the view that groups with greater financial resources at their disposal will generally be better able to influence the decision-making process of government. The advantages that large businesses have is mainly due to the fact that they are key producers within their countries economy and, therefore, their interests are important to the government as their contributions are important to the economy. According to George Monbiot, the influence of big business has been strengthened by \\"the greater ease with which corporations can relocate production and investment in a global economy\\". This suggests that in the ever modernising world, big business has an increasing role in influencing the bureaucracy and in turn, the decision-making process of government. Advocacy groups can also exert influence through the assembly by lobbying. Groups with greater economic resources at their disposal can employ professional lobbyists to try and exert influence in the assembly. An example of such a group is the environmentalist group Greenpeace; Greenpeace (an organisation with income upward of $50,000,000) use lobbying to gain political support for their campaigns. They raise issues about the environment with the aim of having their issues translated into policy such as the government encouraging alternative energy and recycling. The judicial branch of government can also be used by advocacy groups to exert influence. In states where legislation cannot be challenged by the courts, like the UK, advocacy groups are limited in the amount of influence they have. In states that have codified constitutions, like the US, however, advocacy group influence is much more significant. For example, ‚Äì in 1954 the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) lobbied against the Topeka Board of education, arguing that segregation of education based on race was unconstitutional. As a result of group pressure from the NAACP, the supreme court unanimously ruled that racial segregation in education was indeed unconstitutional and such practices were banned. This is a novel example of how advocacy groups can exert influence in the judicial branch of government. Advocacy groups can also exert influence on political parties. The main way groups do this is through campaign finance. For instance; in the UK, the conservative parties campaigns are often funded by large corporations, as many of the conservative parties campaigns reflect the interests of businesses. For example, George W. Bush's re-election campaign in 2004 was the most expensive in American history and was financed mainly by large corporations and industrial interests that the Bush administration represented in government. Conversely, left-wing parties are often funded by organised labour ‚Äì when the British Labour Party was formed, it was largely funded by trade unions. Often, political parties are actually formed as a result of group pressure, for example, the Labour Party in the UK was formed out of the new trade-union movement which lobbied for the rights of workers. Advocacy groups also exert influence through channels that are separate from the government or the political structure such as the mass media and through public opinion campaigning. Advocacy groups will use methods such as protesting, petitioning and civil disobedience to attempt to exert influence in Liberal Democracies. Groups will generally use two distinct styles when attempting to manipulate the media ‚Äì they will either put across their outsider status and use their inability to access the other channels of influence to gain sympathy or they may put across a more ideological agenda. Traditionally, a prime example of such a group were the trade-unions who were the so-called \\"industrial\\" muscle. Trade-unions would campaign in the forms of industrial action and marches for workers rights, these gained much media attention and sympathy for their cause. In the United States, the Civil Rights Movement gained much of its publicity through civil disobedience; African Americans would simply disobey the racist segregation laws to get the violent, racist reaction from the police and white Americans. This violence and racism was then broadcast all over the world, showing the world just how one sided the race 'war' in America actually was. Advocacy group influence has also manifested itself in supranational bodies that have arisen through globalisation. Groups that already had a global structure such as Greenpeace were better able to adapt to globalisation. Greenpeace, for example, has offices in over 30 countries and has an income of $50 million annually. Groups such as these have secured the nature of their influence by gaining status as nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), many of which oversee the work of the UN and the EU from their permanent offices in America and Europe. Group pressure by supranational industries can be exerted in a number of ways: \\"through direct lobbying by large corporations, national trade bodies and 'peak' associations such as the European Round Table of Industrialists\\". Influential advocacy groups There have been many significant advocacy groups throughout history, some of which could operated with dynamics that could better categorize them as social movements. Here are some notable advocacy groups operating in different parts of the world: *American Civil Liberties Union ACLU, described as a legal nonprofit organization that, according to the organization's website, \\"works in the courts, legislatures, and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to all people in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\\" With its national headquarters in New York, the ACLU has autonomous affiliates in each of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. * American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the American Israel lobby, which is described by The New York Times as the \\"most influential Lobby impacting US relations with Israel.\\" * British Medical Association, which formed at a meeting of 50 doctors in 1832 for the sharing of knowledge; its lobbying led to the Medical Act 1858 and the formation of the General Medical Council which has registered and regulated doctors in the UK to this date. * Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which has advocated for the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons and unilateral nuclear disarmament in the UK since 1957, and whose logo is now an international peace symbol. * Center for Auto Safety, an organization formed in 1970 which aims to give consumers a voice for auto safety and quality in the United States. * Communion and Liberation (Italian: Comunione e Liberazione), it created a lot of conflicts of interest in many private and public companies in Italy since the 1970s and it has been investigated by Italian authorities for many legal issues regarding bribery, corruption and frauds. * Drug Policy Alliance, whose principle goal is to end the American \\"War on Drugs\\". * Electronic Frontier Foundation, an international non-profit digital rights advocacy and legal organization based in the United States. * Energy Lobby, an umbrella term for the representatives of large oil, gas, coal, and electric utilities corporations that attempt to influence governmental policy in the United States. * Financial Services Roundtable, an organization representing the banking lobby. * Greenpeace, an organization formed in 1970 as the Don't Make a Wave Committee to stop nuclear weapons testing in the United States. * The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT civil rights advocacy and lobbying organization seeking to advance the cause of LGBT rights in America. * National Rifle Association (\\"NRA\\"), an organization that formed in New York in 1871 to promote marksmanship. * Oxfam, an organization formed in 1942 in the UK as the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief. * Pennsylvania Abolition Society, which formed in Philadelphia in 1775 with a mission to abolish slavery in the United States. * People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (\\"PETA\\"), an animal rights organization that focuses primarily on the treatment of animals on factory farms, in the clothing trade, in laboratories, and in the entertainment industry. * Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, founded in Manchester in 1889 to campaign against the 'barbarous trade in plumes for women's hats'. * Sierra Club, which formed in 1892 to help protect the Sierra Nevada. * Stop the War Coalition, an organization against the War on Terrorism, which organized a march of between 750,000 and 2,000,000 people in London in 2003. * Suffragettes, which sought to gain voting rights for women through direct action and hunger strikes from 1865‚Äì1928 in the United Kingdom. * The Affiliated Residential Park Residents Association Incorporated (ARPRA), which was established in 1986 to represent residents of residential parks in New South Wales, Australia. * The Puntland Human Rights Association, which advocates for the rights of children, women, and minority groups in Somalia and was founded on December 2006, in the Gardo, Puntland regions of Somalia. * Sunday School movement, which formed circa 1751 to promote universal schooling in the UK. * Tory Party (\\"Tories\\"), which formed in 1678 to fight the British Exclusion Bill and developed into one of the first political parties; now known as the Conservative Party * US Chamber of Commerce, by far the biggest lobby group in the US by expenditures . Adversarial groupings On some controversial issues there are a number of competing advocacy groups, sometimes with very different resources available to them: * Pro-choice vs Pro-life movements (abortion policy in the United States) * SPEAK campaign vs Pro-Test (animal testing in United Kingdom) * The Automobile Association vs Pedestrians' Association (now 'Living Streets') (road safety in the United Kingdom since 1929) * Tobacco Institute vs Action on Smoking and Health (tobacco legislation) * Flying Matters vs Plane Stupid (aviation policy in the United Kingdom since 2007) Benefits and incentives=Free rider problem A general theory is that individuals must be enticed with some type of benefit to join an interest group. However, the free rider problem addresses the difficulty of obtaining members of a particular interest group when the benefits are already reaped without membership. For instance, an interest group dedicated to improving farming standards will fight for the general goal of improving farming for every farmer, even those who are not members of that particular interest group. Thus, there is no real incentive to join an interest group and pay dues if the farmer will receive that benefit anyway. For another example, every individual in the world would benefit from a cleaner environment, but environmental protection interest groups do not receive monetary help from every individual in the world. This poses a problem for interest groups, which require dues from their members and contributions in order to accomplish the groups' agendas. Selective benefits Selective benefits are material, rather than monetary benefits conferred on group members. For instance, an interest group could give members travel discounts, free meals at certain restaurants, or free subscriptions to magazines, newspapers, or journals. Many trade and professional interest groups tend to give these types of benefits to their members. Solidarity incentives A solidary incentive is a reward for participation that is socially derived and created out of the act of association. A selective solidary benefit offered to members or prospective members of an interest group might involve such incentives as \\"socializing congeniality, the sense of group membership and identification, the status resulting from membership, fun, conviviality, the maintenance of social distinctions, and so on. Expressive incentives People who join an interest group because of expressive benefits likely joined to express an ideological or moral value that they believe in, such as free speech, civil rights, economic justice, or political equality. To obtain these types of benefits, members would simply pay dues, and donate their time or money to get a feeling of satisfaction from expressing a political value. Also, it would not matter if the interest group achieved their goal; these members would merely be able to say they helped out in the process of trying to obtain their goals, which is the expressive incentive that they got in the first place. The types of interest groups that rely on expressive benefits or incentives are environmental groups and groups who claim to be lobbying for the public interest. Latent interests Some public policy interests are not recognized or addressed by a group at all. These interests are labeled latent interests. Theoretical perspectives Much work has been undertaken by academics attempting to categorize how advocacy groups operate, particularly in relation to governmental policy creation. The field is dominated by numerous and diverse schools of thought: * Pluralism: This is based upon the understanding that advocacy groups operate in competition with one another and play a key role in the political system. They do this by acting as a counterweight to undue concentrations of power. :However, this pluralist theory (formed primarily by American academics) reflects a more open and fragmented political system similar to that in countries such as the United States. * Neo-pluralism: Under neo-pluralism, a concept of political communities developed that is more similar to the British form of government. This is based on the concept of political communities in that advocacy groups and other such bodies are organised around a government department and its network of client groups. The members of this network co-operate together during the policy making process. * Corporatism or elitism: Some advocacy groups are backed by private businesses which can have a considerable influence on legislature. Social media use A study published in early 2012 suggests that advocacy groups of varying political and ideological orientations operating in the United States are using social media to interact with citizens every day. The study surveyed 53 groups, that were found to be using a variety of social media technologies to achieve organizational and political goals: *Facebook was the social media site of choice with all but one group noting that they use the site to connect with citizens. *Twitter was also popular with all but two groups saying that they use Twitter. *Other social media being used included YouTube, LinkedIn, wikis, Flickr, Jumo, Diigo, Tumblr, Foursquare, Identi.ca, Picasa, and Vimeo. As noted in the study, \\"while some groups raised doubts about social media‚Äôs ability to overcome the limitations of weak ties and generational gaps, an overwhelming majority of groups see social media as essential to contemporary advocacy work and laud its democratizing function.\\" See also * Astroturfing * Campaign finance in the United States * Client politics * Identity politics * Methods used by advocacy groups * Political party * Pressure groups in the United Kingdom * Pressure politics ReferencesFurther reading  Category:Activism * Category:Political terminology Category:Public choice theory ","title":"Advocacy group"},{"id":"26561897","text":"Charles G√©li (born 26 March 1987) Charles G√©li on lequipe.fr is a French Rugby Union player.

By the time of this map, the former stave church had already been replaced with the first cathedral, depicted near the middle. The stave church of Gothenburg (), was Gothenburg's first church building and one of its first buildings constructed since its city plan was drawn up. Completed in 1621 on one of the city's first five blocks, bounded by the streets Kungsgatan, V√§stra Hamngatan, Kyrkogatan and Korsgatan, the stave church stood on the same plot now occupied by Gothenburg Cathedral.

The church steeple was in the middle of the block adjacent to Kungsgatan (near the Kungsgatan entrance, through an iron fence, to today's cathedral square). Narrower than the main building, the bell tower stood along the southwest corner of the stave church. It was capped with a small cupola and pointed spire. The stave church and tower are depicted on the oldest known drawing of the then new city of Gothenburg. The gable-roofed wooden church was about 16 metres long by 12 metres wide. Two extensions were recorded, likely a choir and an entry porch, the latter intended as a place for visitors to leave their weapons before entering the church proper. Never intended as a permanent structure, the site plan called for the wooden church to be offset from the planned location of the eventual cathedral. Superintendent Anders Prytz consecrated the new cathedral on August 10, 1633, and the stave church was disassembled shortly thereafter. The separate bell tower, however, remained in use, even serving as a municipal guard tower for the City guard until 1643, when the cathedral tower was finished in and the old tower was finally demolished.

From 1910 onwards he travelled widely, visiting Europe, North Africa and America. By 1911 his etchings were of sufficiently high quality to earn him an exhibition at the Goupil Gallery in London and his prints were published in both London and Glasgow.

Lawrence, Damascus, October 1918 At the start of World War One McBey's poor eyesight prevented him enlisting as a soldier but in February 1916 he was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant while employed with the Army Printing and Stationery Service, based in Rouen. While on leave there he completed two series of sketches, France at her Furnaces, showing the munition works at Harfleur, and some views of the Somme. After these drawings were shown in London, McBey was appointed an official war artist to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Throughout 1917 and 1918 McBey accompanied the Allied advance in Palestine, from Gaza to Damascus. Working in both watercolours and oils McBey produced some 300 pieces, many of which are now in the Imperial War Museum. As well as portraits of the Allied commanders, McBey painted notable portraits of Emir Faisal, and T. E. Lawrence. McBey spent five days on a reconnaissance mission in the Sinai Desert with an Imperial Camel Corps patrol, consisting of rough- riders from the Australian outback, and witnessed Allenby's entry into Jerusalem in December 1917. Post-war career Although the British government made little use of his work during the war, when he returned to Britain McBey produced a series of etchings based on his drawings of the Camel Corps patrol. The Long Patrol sold well and greatly enhanced his reputation. He made several visits thereafter to the Middle East and North Africa. During the post-war print boom in the 1920s his etchings fetched prices at auction that had only been achieved before by the Old Masters.

The film, which tells about the young generation who lives in the suburbs of Istanbul and come to the center of the city to make a living, follows a rose seller, a taxi driver and a traffic police officer whose lives unknowingly intersect every day on the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul. It \\"wowed the audience in last year's Locarno and London Turkish film festivals, and won Best Film awards at last year's Istanbul International and Golden Cocoon film festivals\\", according to Emrah G√ºler, writing in Turkish Daily News. Production The film, which is based on the real lives of three men, with Fikret Portakal and Umut ƒ∞lker playing themselves, was originally intended to be a documentary film, but after an extensive research period in Istanbul starting in 2006, √ñzge along with director of photography Emre Erkmen got to know the main characters, who are working around the bridge, and decided to write a script based on the protagonists' own stories. The production, which was funded by the Turkish Ministry of Culture, was not granted permission by the Turkish police authorities to feature a real police officer and so Murat Tokg√∂z, the brother of the real policeman upon whom the character is based, joined the production to play the part, with all other police roles are acted by professionals. Producer Fabian Massah and co-producer Sevil Demirci also joined the production at the beginning of shooting, which was done on location in Istanbul, Turkey.

Valukas is an examination into the demise of Lehman Brothers, a formerly dominant global financial institution, that collapsed into bankruptcy during the Financial crisis of 2007-2010. Anton Valukas, chairman of the Chicago law firm Jenner & Block, was appointed by a bankruptcy court in New York in early 2009 to report on the causes of the Lehman bankruptcy. With fellow authors, he produced a 2200 page document detailing their views on the inner workings of Lehman Brothers, and possible avenues for proceedings against culpable directors and shareholders. The Valukas Report was made public following applications to the court on March 11, 2010.Z Lowe, 'Lehman to Judge: Make the Examiner's Report Public' (9.3.2010) The AM Law Daily Outline=Section I Executive Summary Introduction Lehman failed for a variety of reasons and the responsibility for the failure is shared by management, Lehman's high-risk investment bank business model and the failure of government oversight. However, all of these problems were compounded by the actions of the executives. Some were simple errors in business judgement, but others were deliberate balance sheet manipulation. Lehman's business model rewarded excessive risk-taking and high-leverage. Near the end Lehman had $700 billion in assets but only $25 billion (about 3.5%) in equity. Furthermore, most of the assets were long-lived or matured in over a year but liabilities were due in less than a year. Lehman had to borrow and repay billions of dollars through the \\"repo\\" market every day in order to remain in business. This was considered normal for investment banks, but if counterparties lost confidence in Lehman's ability to repay, this market would close to the bank and the business would fail. Lehman's management did not foresee the depths of the sub-prime residential mortgage crisis, nor its broad-reaching effects on other markets. Instead they elected to \\"double-down\\" their bets, expecting to make high profits when the market \\"came back\\". Bear Stearns' March 2008 failure revealed the flaws of both the at-that-time-typical investment bank model as well as the deepening sub-prime crisis. Counterparty confidence in Lehman began to decline and the executives felt they needed to manipulate their financial statements in order to halt further erosion. Lehman focused on the leverage ratio (debt-to-equity) and liquidity as metrics most watched by counterparties and credit rating agencies. In the second quarter of 2008 Lehman tried to cushion reported losses by claiming improved leverage and liquidity. What Lehman failed to report was that they had used an accounting trick (known within Lehman as \\"Repo 105\\") to manage their balance sheet. Normal repo transactions consisted of selling assets with the obligation of repurchase within a few days. Considered a financing event, these \\"sold\\" items stayed on the bank's balance sheet. Repo 105 made use of an accounting rule where, if the assets sold were valued at more than 105% of cash received, the transaction could be called a true sale and the assets removed from Lehman's books. $50 billion of assets were removed from the balance sheet in this way, improving their leverage ratio from 13.9 to 12.1 at the time. Multiple sources from the time note there was no substance to transaction except to remove unwanted assets, a significant violation of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Ernst & Young, Lehman's auditors, were aware of Repo 105 and the non-disclosure of its scope. Regarding liquidity, throughout 2008 Lehman made false claims of having billions of dollars in available cash to repay counterparties when in reality, significant portions of the reported amounts were in fact encumbered or otherwise unavailable for use. September 12, 2008, 2 days after reporting $41 billion in liquidity, true available funds totaled only $2 billion. Lehman filed for bankruptcy on September 15. Summarized Conclusions While the business decisions that brought about the crisis were largely within the realm of acceptable business judgement, the actions to manipulate financial statements do give rise to \\"colorable claims\\", especially against the CEO and CFOs but also against the auditors. In the opinion of the Examiner, \\"colorable\\" is generally meant to mean that sufficient evidence exists to support legal action and possible recovery of losses. Repo 105 was not inherently improper, but its use here violated accounting principles that require all legitimate transactions to have a business purpose. Repo 105 solely existed to manipulate financial information. In a written letter in June 2008, Lehman Senior VP Matthew Lee advised the auditors and Audit Committee that he thought Repo 105 was being used improperly. The auditors failed to advise the Audit Committee about issues raised by this whistle-blower despite specific requests by the Committee. Auditors \\"Ernst & Young\\" failed to investigate the allegations and likely failed to meet professional standards.

Alexander was a descendant of abbots of Abernethy; his great-grandfather Laurence, great-grandson of Gillemichael, Earl of Fife, was the first to style himself Lord (dominus)Laurence de Abernethy was previously noted as the grandfather of Sir Alexander, but this is in error. Alexander's parents were Sir Hugh de Abernethy and his wife Mary of Argyll; Sir Hugh's father was Patrick de Abernethy, who predeceased his father Laurence. Charles J. Leslie, Historical Records of the Family of Leslie (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1869), p. 37, note A. Andrew B. W. MacEwen kindly advised of this correction. His daughter Margaret married John Stewart of Bonkyll, the new Scottish earl of Angus. Alexander swore fealty to Edward I in 1291, presumably on the death of his father, Hugh. Between 1301 and 1303 he was appointed warden of Scotland between the Forth and the Mounth. He joined the expedition in 1303 to Strathearn and in 1304 to Menteith to put down uprisings. He lost the office in King Edward's ordinances of 1305 but supported Balliol's claims over Bruce's. He was ordered to join the expedition of John of Brittany to defend Galloway against Robert Bruce and was absent from King Robert's first parliament in 1309. In June 1308 he was appointed warden of Scotland between the Forth and Orkney together with Edward Hastings; and in July 1310 - warden between the Forth and the mountains. He was also contracted to serve from September in Berwick and Perthshire under the command of Sir John de Segrave. He received Clackmannan in Stirlingshire from Edward II in 1310, was Constable of Dundee at least in mid-1311 and led the unsuccessful defence of the town against Edward Bruce in 1312. In 1314 Abernethy was forfeited and attached to the earldom of Angus, so Alexander went to England and died by the end of 1315. He also held the positions of the Sheriffdoms of Kincardine, Forfar and Perth and joint warden between the Forth and Orkney.

Browne was born in Galway, Ireland to Mary and Joe Browne. The oldest of 3 children, he has a sister Gillian and brother Andrew, who also had a career as a professional rugby player, representing their home province Connacht for 12 seasons. He attended St. Joseph's Patrician College (The Bish), in Galway City. Browne started his rugby career with Galwegians RFC, making his senior debut as an 18 year old during a successful period for the club under former Richmond RFC coach John Kingston and soon signed his first professional contract with his home province Connacht in 2000, making his debut against Bedford Blues in Goldington Road that pre-season. Browne made his international debut for the Irish U-19's versus Italy in Treviso in a team including future senior internationals, Gordon Darcy and Johnny O'Connor, plus Blizzards front man Niall Breslin, scoring the winning try. He received 2 more caps at U-19 level. He won 7 caps at U-21 level, including starting all 5 games at the U-21 World Cup in Sydney, Australia where Ireland finished 5th.  Professional Rugby. = Connacht Rugby  Browne was first introduced to a professional environment when invited to train with the Connacht senior squad by then coach Glenn Ross shortly after his Leaving Cert exams in the summer of 1998. 2 years later he was offered his first professional by Connacht, then under Steph Nel. He would go on to play 63 times for the province over the next 4 seasons, before signing for Northampton Saints for the start of the 04/05 season.  Northampton Saints  Browne signed for The Saints under Wayne Smith but arrived to pre-season training led by Alan Solomons as Smith had returned to New Zealand to begin a long and successful era with The All Blacks as their back coach.

First raised in 1912 as a Militia formation to provide training under the compulsory training scheme, the brigade was later re-raised on 7 May 1940 as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force for service during the World War II. The brigade was initially assigned to the 7th Division, but was later transferred to the 9th Division in early 1941. They subsequently took part in the Siege of Tobruk that year, and then the First and Second Battles of El Alamein in 1942. In early 1943, the brigade was returned to Australia to join the fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific. In late 1943, the brigade took part in the capture of Lae and then the Huon Peninsula campaign. Withdrawn to Australia in early 1944, its final campaign came during the Battle of North Borneo in the final months of the war. It was disbanded in February 1946. History=Pre-war years In 1912, when Australian introduced the compulsory training scheme, a total of 23 Militia brigades, mostly of four battalions, were planned for. These were assigned to six military districts around Australia. At this time, the 20th Brigade formed part of the 4th Military District. The brigade's constituent units had training depots in various locations around South Australia and western New South Wales, including Norwood, Magill, North Adelaide, Prospect, Gawler, Wallaroo, Kadina, Port Pirie, Petersburg and Broken Hill. The brigade's constituent battalions were sequentially numbered: 79th, 80th, 81st and 82nd. These units continued to exist on the Army's order of battle throughout the war years, within Australia, and separate from the deployed First Australian Imperial Force (AIF). In 1921, the AIF was formally disbanded and Australia's part time military force was reorganised. At this time, only 15 infantry brigades were formed, replicating the numerical designations of the formations of the AIF. World War II In May 1940, the 20th Brigade was re-raised as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), opening its headquarters at Ingleburn, New South Wales on the 7th of the month. Consisting of three infantry battalions ‚Äì the 2/13th and 2/17th from New South Wales, and the 2/15th from Queensland ‚Äì the brigade was initially assigned to the 7th Division. The 2/15th moved to Darwin in July, to bolster the town's defences. Meanwhile, the remainder of the brigade concentrated around Bathurst in August, where training was undertaken. In October 1940, the 20th Brigade, less the 2/15th, deployed to the Middle East, where it moved into camp in Palestine. In February 1941, the brigade was transferred to the 9th Division as part of a reorganisation that moved the more combat ready brigades to the 7th Division. The 2/15th Battalion was reunited with the brigade around this time. Sydney, December 1940. The following month, the 9th Division was sent forward into the Western Desert to relieve the 6th Division following their victories at Bardia and Tobruk. The 6th Division was to be sent to Greece where a German invasion was expected, and so the 20th Brigade and took over from the 17th around Marsa Brega in Cyrenaica. A further move was undertaken to Er Regima, where the brigade was tasked with holding approaches around the Benghazi Plain. After German forces landed around Tripoli to reinforce the Italians in North Africa, a large scale withdrawal began as the British and Australian forces were pushed back towards Tobruk, which was subsequently surrounded and placed under siege. During the withdrawal, the 2/15th Battalion's headquarters was surrounded and captured after attempting to fend off an attack by German tanks, while the 2/13th fought a more successful delaying action around Er Regina. Between April and October 1941, the 20th Brigade took part in the defence of the strategic port, helping to hold back the German thrust around the El Adem Road and then holding the line at various points around the perimeter. Finally, they were relieved by the British 14th Infantry Brigade and withdrawn by sea. After its withdrawal from Tobruk, the 20th Brigade concentrated around Hill 69 in Palestine where it was rebuilt and carried out further training. In early 1942, the Australian government sought the return of the 6th and 7th Divisions to Australia to meet the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. Subsequently, the 9th Division was deployed to Syria to carry out occupation duties, replacing the 7th Division. During this time, the 20th Brigade took over from the 18th, with forces spread out in the northern border region between Aleppo, Latakia, Idlib and Afrine, guarding against a potential German invasion through Turkey. After being relieved by the New Zealand 6th Infantry Brigade, the 20th Brigade was freed up for training around Latakia in March. After this, they rotated between Tripoli on the coast and the northern frontier. In June, the 17th Brigade arrived to relieve the 20th, and they began preparations to return to Egypt following a renewed Axis offensive. As the situation became critical for the Allies, the 9th Division was hurriedly deployed to El Alamein in July. They subsequently helped halt the Axis advance during the First Battle of El Alamein, and then occupied defensive positions for the next four months. In September, the 20th Brigade launched a diversionary attack, Operation Bulimba, supported by the 2/8th Field Regiment. This was a prelude to the main Allied offensive that began in October, launching the Second Battle of El Alamein. During the offensive, the 9th Division attacked southwest from the Tel-el-Eisa, with the 20th Brigade being assigned to the division's left. After achieving a break in over the course of several days, the Australians then held off a series of determined counterattacks. Once these had been repelled, the focus of the fighting shifted away from the Australians as British forces were able to launch a break out, which subsequently forced the Germans to withdraw. Australian soldiers and U.S. Army landing craft at Scarlet Beach on 22 September 1943. The 9th Division was subsequently moved back to Palestine in November, occupying Julis camp as preparations were made for the division to return to Australia to join the fighting in the Pacific. This move began in January 1943. A period of leave followed, after which the 20th Brigade was reconstituted at Kairi, Queensland, where training was undertaken to prepare for deployment to New Guinea. Amphibious warfare training was undertaken during this time, as the division was assigned to an operation to capture Lae, which commenced in early September 1943. A preliminary move was made from Cairns to Milne Bay, after which the 20th Brigade landed on the coast east of Lae. Tasked with securing the beachhead and mounting patrols, the brigade played a limited role in the advance on the town, although the 2/17th Battalion was detached to the 26th Brigade during this stage of the operation. Just before the town was secured, the 4th Brigade arrived to relieve the 20th, which began moving east as the 9th Division's reserve element. The capture of Lae was followed up quickly by another operation to secure Finschhafen. Landing at Scarlet Beach, north of the objective, the 20th Brigade formed the division's lead assault element. After overcoming light opposition around the beachhead, the brigade began advancing on Finschhafen, leaving the 2/17th to secure the beachhead. Japanese opposition intensified as they approached the objective, and flanking units around Sattelberg threatened the brigade's rear, forcing Windeyer to deploy forces to guard his flanks and rear. By 2 October, the brigade had secured Finschhafen, having overcome strong resistance crossing the Bumi River, and around Kakakog. After this, reinforcements from the 9th Division arrived and the brigade's headquarters was moved to Heldsbach while elements were deployed at Simbang, Timoro, Kumawa and Jivevaneng. The Japanese launched a strong counterattack on Scarlet Beach in October, during which the 2/17th was isolated around Jivevaneng; the 2/13th was subsequently moved from Katika to fight their way through to the 2/17th, after which the brigade began pushing towards Sattelberg. In November, the 26th Brigade took over the advance, and the 20th went into reserve around Heldsbach, although the 2/15th was detached to the 24th Brigade to push the advance into the Christmas Hills. In December, the 20th Brigade resumed the advance from Masaweng River, moving along the coast as the Australians pushed towards Sio, which they reached in January 1944. alt=A landing ship disembarks troops Relieved by the 8th Brigade at Sio, the brigade was moved back to Finschhafen in February ahead of their withdrawal back to Australia for leave and reorganisation around Ravenshoe. The role of Australian troops in the Pacific had largely been taken over by US troops by this time, leaving the Australian troops with a limited combat role in the last years of the war in the Pacific. As a result, a long period of training followed while they waited for another assignment. This came in the final months of the war, when the 20th Brigade was assigned to the capture of North Borneo. Staging out of Morotai in April 1945, the brigade landed around Brunei Bay on 10 June. While the 24th Brigade landed on Labuan, the 2/17th and 2/15th Battalions from the 20th Brigade landed on the southern side of the bay, around Brooketon and Muara Island; the 2/13th was held back in reserve. There was only limited opposition to begin with and by 13 June Brunei had been captured by the 2/17th. The 2/13th was landed at this point at Lutong, and moved along the coast, pushing the advance towards Kuching. By late June, the brigade's headquarters had been established at Kula Belait, and the brigade had begun regular patrols as civil infrastructure was rebuilt. These continued until the end of the war when occupation duties saw the brigade oversee the surrender of the Japanese forces that remained in Brunei and Sarawak. The brigade remained deployed in this area until late November 1945 when it began concentrating on Labuan. In early December, the first drafts of personnel returned to Australia for demobilisation, while personnel who were ineligible were posted to other units for further service. Throughout December, unit cadres were embarked, and by the end of the month only 11 personnel from the brigade's headquarters remained overseas. They subsequently embarked on the MV Reynella in early January 1946, arriving in Brisbane on 16 January. After moving to Chermside, the remaining personnel undertook administration duties to return stores and equipment and complete necessary documentation prior to disbandment. A final move to Ingleburn took place in early February and the brigade was finally disbanded there on 22 February 1946.

E. B. Du Bois in 1928, is one of his five historical novels. One of Du Bois's favorite works, the novel explores the beauty of people of color around the world. This was part of Du Bois' use of fiction to explore his times in a way not possible in non-fiction history. He expressed fully imagined lives of his characters, using them to explore the richness and beauty of black culture. The novel was not well received when published. It was criticized for its expression of eroticism as well as for what some critics thought was a failed attempt at social realism. Structure The book is divided into four large chapters: \\"The Exile,\\" \\"The Pullman Porter,\\" \\"The Chicago Politician,\\" and \\"The Maharaja of Bwodphur\\". The sections deal with different stages in the protagonist's life, moving from his self-imposed exile in Germany late in life, to his early employment as a porter on the railroads, based in New York, then to his career as a politician in Chicago, and his return to Virginia, the land of his birth. While the sections trace the protagonist's growth as a revolutionary figure, they are not directly connected. Plot The plot follows a character named Matthew Townes, a college student in his junior year at the University of Manhattan studying to be an obstetrician. Early in the novel, Townes is told that not only is he barred from pursuing his career aspirations, he is not allowed to finish his academic studies. His status as an African American disqualifies him in the early 20th century from completing required courses at a white obstetrics hospital, where he would be caring for white female patients. Townes is devastated and goes to Germany in a kind of exile. There he meets Princess Kautilya of Bwodpur, India, daughter of a maharajah. She reassures Towns of the importance of the history of people of color in the world, and of their presence and impact of their beauty worldwide. The Princess takes him from his dreary American world with its strict binary divide by race. She introduces him to a vibrant world of prominent world leaders of color, while acknowledging some with negative influence on the progress of blacks in the United States. Du Bois is believed to be referring to the leader Marcus Garvey in his character Perigua. The relationship between Townes and the princess develops; she bears his child, who by birthright is the Maharajah of Bwodpur. Townes had not thought it possible that an African American man might have such a connection to royalty. Major themes Du Bois explores internationalism and international racial solidarity, as well as corruption and violent radicalism within African-American culture. Dark Princess‚Äôs subtitle, A Romance, points to the narrative‚Äôs double valence. As Mich√®le Mendelssohn argues, \\"it is the story of a love affair, as well as the story of an ideological romance that challenges one of the United States‚Äô most cherished ideas about itself, the notion that it is a land of progress and possibility for all. The love lost between the hero and the U. S. is the spur for the novel‚Äôs political reorientation.\\" Historical contexts Some critics believe that the book was inspired by the 1911 First Universal Races Congress in London, which Du Bois had attended. at In developing the character of Kautilya, Du Bois has been discussed as possibly drawing inspiration from a few historical figures. Scholars have speculated that these may include an unnamed Indian princess at the Universal Races Congress, the Indian independence activist Bhikaji Cama, and the Pan-African Congress organizer Ida Gibbs Hunt, wife of diplomat William Henry Hunt. Late in life, Du Bois described this as his favorite work.

Reid and Luckman then drove the boys at gun and knife point to Kingscliff, New South Wales, where they were beaten, tortured, and sexually assaulted before Aston was ultimately murdered.  Kidnapping and murder  On 3 May 1982, Peter Aston, then 13 years old, decided to hitchhike to his hometown of Melbourne to join his brother. Peter's school friend, Terry Ryan, also thirteen, agreed to keep him company until he reached the Gold Coast, and then planned to go back home. The two caught the train to Beenleigh and there stole around 20 packets of cigarettes and some clothes. They then proceeded to hitchhike south, down the Gold Coast Highway. After a short while they came across a yellow 4WD Daihatsu and its occupants Reid, 34, and Luckman, 17, who offered to give the boys a lift down the coast. Not long on the road, the two boys were threatened at knife and gunpoint by the two men, who then drove the car over the Queensland/New South Wales border, into the beach-side town of Kingscliff, where they forced the two boys out of the car and down a secluded beach track. Reid and Luckman then bound, sexually assaulted and savagely beat the two boys. Ryan was also forced by the two men to bash and assault his friend. Peter Aston was stabbed, tortured and eventually buried alive. By this point, Terry Ryan had reasoned with his attackers and they agreed to drive him home. Ryan later told police, \\"They got everything they had, put it in the car and drove off, and me too, and they drove me back home. While we were driving they told me that they were Satan worshippers and they had to do it [kill Peter Aston] for the sacrifice.\\"  Arrest and trial  Ryan immediately told his mother, who drove him to the police station to report the kidnapping and the murder of his friend. Reid and Luckman attempted to escape in a car they stole from a fellow army private at the Enoggera army base. The two were apprehended on the New England Highway. Further evidence and weapons were found in the pair's Daihatsu, which had been left at the army base, as well as in their living areas on base. Reid and Luckman were formally charged with the murder of Peter Aston, and Reid was also charged with threatening to inflict bodily harm on Terry Ryan. They were refused bail and taken into custody. Reid was taken by police on a tour of the murder scene, where he explained in detail exactly what happened on the night of the murder. Police reported he boasted of his exploits and seemed to be immensely enjoying his \\"15 minutes of fame\\". Reid and Luckman's committal hearing was held at Tweed Heads Court on 4 August. At the time of the hearing there was massive public outrage, media coverage and death threats aimed at the two accused. The case was transferred to the Sydney Supreme Court with a jury of three women and nine men. During the trial on 8 November 1982, both men pleaded \\"not guilty\\", though Reid claimed that his bisexuality and his job as an Ordnance Corps clerk had put him under enough stress to go insane.  Aftermath  Reid and Luckman were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1989, Luckman began taking hormones on the advice of a psychiatrist, as he felt more like a woman than a man. A year later, Luckman changed his name by deed poll to Nicole Louise Pearce and underwent gender reassignment surgery. On 26 October 1999, she was released from the Kirkconnell Correctional Centre, a minimum security male- only facility in inland New South Wales. Since imprisonment, Reid has been kept in protective custody for his own safety. Reid applied for a re- determination of his sentence on 26 November 1998, and was re-sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 24 years, meaning that he would be eligible for parole in 2006. he been refused parole six times.

Umfraville adhered to King Edward II of England both against Scots and barons, and was regularly summoned to the English parliaments as Earl of Angus (although in name only- the title had ceased to have any meaning whatsoever since the outbreak of the 1296 First War of Scottish Independence). He was summoned to the coronation of King Edward II of England in February 1308. He was Joint Lieutenant and Guardian of Scotland from 21 June 1308, and appointed to treat for peace with the Scots on numerous occasions. He fought at the Battle of Bannockburn, and was taken prisoner after the battle by Robert Bruce, but soon released. In 1316 he was commissioned to treat with the Scots for a truce.Burke, J. pp.527‚Äì529 Though formerly in opposition to the Despensers, he sat in judgment on Thomas of Lancaster. King Robert deprived him of his Scottish estates and title, and before 1329 the real earldom had been vested in the House of Stewart, from whom it passed in 1389 to a branch of the Douglases. Robert died in 1325 and was buried at Newminster Abbey, Northumberland, England. Marriages and issue Robert married twice.

In 1898, they were allowed by the company's owner, Charles Herman Metz, to build a light steam buggy at a corner of the plant. This vehicle was finished at the end of the year and named the Waltham Steam. It had a very light , two cylinder, double acting steam engine.

Tinker and Piper exhibited their steam buggy at the Boston Automobile Show in 1898. Two more steam cars followed under the label Tinker & Piper. Meantime, Metz had sold out his company to Charles A. Coffin and H.P. Clough but stayed in the position of a general manager. Coffin was an executive of the General Electric Company (GE). Seeking markets for GE products, he ordered a light electric car to be made by Tinker and Piper. They built it also at the Waltham Manufacturing plant.

One of the first uses of the term \\"Dixieland\\" with reference to music was in the name of the Original Dixieland Jass Band (which shortly thereafter changed the spelling of its name to \\"Original Dixieland Jazz Band\\"). Their 1917 recordings fostered popular awareness of this new style of music. A revival movement for traditional jazz began in the late 1940s, formed in reaction to the orchestrated sounds of the swing era and the perceived chaos of the new bebop sounds (referred to as \\"Chinese music\\" by Louis Armstrong), Led by the Assunto brothers' original Dukes of Dixieland, the movement included elements of the Chicago style that developed during the 1920s, such as the use of a string bass instead of a tuba, and chordal instruments, in addition to the original format of the New Orleans style. That reflected the fact that virtually all of the recorded repertoire of New Orleans musicians was from the period when the format was already evolving beyond the traditional New Orleans format. \\"Dixieland\\" may in that sense be regarded as denoting the jazz revival movement of the late 1930s to the 1950s as much as any particular subgenre of jazz. The essential elements that were accepted as within the style were the traditional front lines consisting of trumpets, trombones, and clarinets, and ensemble improvisation over a two-beat rhythm. History A traditionalist jazz band plays at a party in New Orleans in 2005. Shown here are Chris Clifton, on trumpet; Brian O'Connell, on clarinet; Les Muscutt, on banjo; Chuck Badie, on string bass; and Tom Ebert, on trombone. The Original Dixieland Jass Band, recording its first disc in 1917, was the first instance of jazz music being called \\"Dixieland\\", though at the time, the term referred to the band, not the genre. The band's sound was a combination of African American/New Orleans ragtime and Sicilian music. The music of Sicily was one of the many genres in the New Orleans music scene during the 1910s, alongside sanctified church music, brass band music and blues.https://www.lavocedinewyork.com/en/arts/2018/05/19/jazz-the-sicily-new- orleans-connection-and-the-art-of-encounter-par-excellence/ Much later, the term \\"Dixieland\\" was applied to early jazz by traditional jazz revivalists, starting in the 1940s and 1950s. The name is a reference to the \\"Old South\\", specifically anything south of the Mason-Dixon line. The term encompasses earlier brass band marches, French Quadrilles, biguine, ragtime, and blues with collective, polyphonic improvisation. While instrumentation and size of bands can be very flexible, the \\"standard\\" band consists of a \\"front line\\" of trumpet (or cornet), trombone, and clarinet, with a \\"rhythm section\\" of at least two of the following instruments: guitar or banjo, string bass or tuba, piano, and drums. Louis Armstrong's All-Stars was the band most popularly identified with Dixieland during the 1940s, although Armstrong's own influence during the 1920s was to move the music beyond the traditional New Orleans style. The definitive Dixieland sound is created when one instrument (usually the trumpet) plays the melody or a recognizable paraphrase or variation on it, and the other instruments of the \\"front line\\" improvise around that melody. This creates a more polyphonic sound than the arranged ensemble playing of the big band sound or the straight \\"head\\" melodies of bebop. During the 1930s and 1940s, the earlier group-improvisation style fell out of favor with the majority of younger black players, while some older players of both races continued on in the older style. Though younger musicians developed new forms, many beboppers revered Armstrong and quoted fragments of his recorded music in their own improvisations. The Dixieland revival in the late 1940s and 1950s was led by the Assunto brothers' original Dukes of Dixieland, a band known for its virtuoso improvisation and recording history's first stereo record. The movement brought many semi-retired musicians a measure of fame late in their lives as well as bringing retired musicians back onto the jazz circuit after years of not playing (e.g., Kid Ory and Red Nichols). Many Dixieland groups of the revival era consciously imitated the recordings and bands of decades earlier. Other musicians continued to create innovative performances and new tunes. For example, in the 1950s a style called \\"Progressive Dixieland\\" sought to blend polyphonic improvisation with bebop-style rhythm. Spike Jones & His New Band and Steve Lacy played with such bands. This style is sometimes called \\"Dixie-bop\\". Lacy went on to apply that approach to the music of Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, and Herbie Nichols. Etymology While the term Dixieland is still in wide use, the term's appropriateness is a hotly debated topic in some circles. For some it is the preferred label (especially bands on the USA's West coast and those influenced by the 1940s revival bands), while others would rather use terms like Classic jazz or Traditional jazz. Some of the latter consider Dixieland a derogatory term implying superficial hokum played without passion or deep understanding of the music and because \\"Dixie\\" is a reference to pre-Civil War Southern States. Many black musicians have traditionally rejected the term as a style distinctive from traditional jazz, characterized by the staccatic playing in all-white groups such as The Original Dixieland Jazz Band in contrast to the slower, syncopated back-beat style of playing characterized by musicians like King Oliver or Kid Ory. Dixieland is often today applied to bands playing in a traditional style. Bands such as those of Eddie Condon and Muggsy Spanier were tagged with the Dixieland label, reflecting the grouping of the Chicago and New Orleans styles of traditional jazz under the same label. Main forms=Chicago style \\"Chicago style\\" is often applied to the sound of Chicagoans such as Jimmy McPartland, Eddie Condon, Muggsy Spanier, and Bud Freeman. The rhythm sections of these bands substitute the string bass for the tuba and the guitar for the banjo. Musically, the Chicagoans play in more of a swing-style 4-to-the-bar manner. The New Orleanian preference for an ensemble sound is deemphasized in favor of solos. Chicago-style Dixieland also differs from its southern origin by being faster paced, resembling the hustle-bustle of city life. Chicago-style bands play a wide variety of tunes, including most of those of the more traditional bands plus many of the Great American Songbook selections from the 1930s by George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, and Irving Berlin. Non-Chicagoans such as Pee Wee Russell and Bobby Hackett are often thought of as playing in this style. This modernized style came to be called Nicksieland, after Nick's Greenwich Village night club, where it was popular, though the term was not limited to that club. West Coast revival The \\"West Coast revival\\" is a movement that was begun in the late 1930s by Lu Watters and his Yerba Buena Jazz Band in San Francisco and extended by trombonist Turk Murphy. It started out as a backlash to the Chicago style, which is closer in development towards swing. The repertoire of these bands is based on the music of Joe \\"King\\" Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, and W.C. Handy. Bands playing in the West Coast style use banjo and tuba in the rhythm sections, which play in a two-to-the-bar rhythmic style. Much performed traditional Dixieland tunes include: \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\", \\"Muskrat Ramble\\", \\"Struttin' with Some Barbecue\\", \\"Tiger Rag\\", \\"Dippermouth Blues\\", \\"Milenberg Joys\\", \\"Basin Street Blues\\", \\"Tin Roof Blues\\", \\"At the Jazz Band Ball\\", \\"Panama\\", \\"I Found a New Baby\\", \\"Royal Garden Blues\\" and many others. All of these tunes were widely played by jazz bands of the pre-WWII era, especially Louis Armstrong. They came to be grouped as Dixieland standards beginning in the 1950s. Dutch \\"Old-style jazz\\" Largely occurring at the same time as the \\"New Orleans Traditional\\" revival movement in the United States, traditional jazz music made a comeback in the Low Countries. However, most Dutch jazz bands (such as The Ramblers) had long since evolved into the Swing-era while the few remaining traditional jazz bands (such as the Dutch Swing College Band) did not partake in the broader traditional revival movement, and continued to play ragtime and early jazz, greatly limiting the number of bands aspiring jazz musicians could join or (as they were using instruments unavailable to most Dutch musicians such as double basses and the piano) were forced to improvise, resulting in a new form of jazz ensemble generally referred to \\"Oude Stijl\\" (\\"Old Style\\") jazz in Dutch. Influenced by the instrumentation of the two principal orchestral forms of the wind band in the Netherlands and Belgium, the \\"harmonie\\" and the \\"fanfare\\", traditional Dutch jazz bands do not feature a piano and contain no stringed instruments apart from the banjo. They include multiple trumpets, trombones and saxophones accompanied by a single clarinet, sousaphone and a section of Marching percussion usually including a washboard. The music played by Dutch jazz bands includes both the original New Orleans tunes, as well as the songs of the revival era. In terms of playing style, Dutch jazz bands occupy a position between revivalist and original New Orleans jazz, with more solos than the latter but without abandoning the principle of ensemble playing. With the average band containing up to 15-players, Dutch jazz bands tend to be the largest ensembles to play traditional jazz music. Styles influenced by traditional jazz Musical styles showing influences from traditional jazz include later styles of jazz, rhythm and blues, and early rock and roll. Traditional New Orleans second-line drumming and piano playing are prominent in the music of Fats Domino. The New Orleans drummer Idris Muhammad adapted second-line drumming to modern jazz styles and gained crossover influence on the R&B; style of James Brown. Soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy combined New Orleans style polyphonic improvisation with bebop. Bassist Charles Mingus paid homage to traditional jazz styles with compositions such as Eat Dat Chicken and My Jellyroll Soul. The contemporary New Orleans Brass Band styles, such as the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, The Primate Fiasco, the Hot Tamale Brass Band and the Rebirth Brass Band have combined traditional New Orleans brass band jazz with such influences as contemporary jazz, funk, hip hop, and rap. The M-BASE (Multi-Basic Array of Synchronous Extemporization) improvisational concept used by ensembles including Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen, Greg Osby, Steve Coleman, Graham Haynes, Kevin Eubanks and others is an extension of the polyphonic improvisation of New Orleans jazz.  Revival  The Dixieland revival renewed the audience for musicians who had continued to play in traditional jazz styles and revived the careers of New Orleans musicians who had become lost in the shuffle of musical styles that had occurred over the preceding years. Younger black musicians largely shunned the revival, largely because of a distaste for tailoring their music to what they saw as nostalgia entertainment for white audiences with whom they did not share such nostalgia.Baraka, Amiri (1999). Blues People: Negro Music in White America. Harper Perennial. .Davis, Miles & Troupe, Quincy (1990). Miles: The Autobiography. Simon & Schuster. . The Jim Crow associations of the name \\"Dixieland\\" also did little to attract younger black musicians to the revival. The Dixieland revival music during the 1940s and 1950s gained a broad audience that established traditional jazz as an enduring part of the American cultural landscape, and spawned revival movements in Europe. Well-known jazz standard tunes such as \\"Basin Street Blues\\" and \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\" are known even to non-jazz fans thanks to the enduring popularity of traditional jazz. The Vietnam-era protest song \\"Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag\\" is based on tonal centers and the \\"B\\" refrain from the New Orleans standard \\"Muskrat Ramble\\". Traditional jazz is a major tourist attraction for New Orleans to the present day. It has been an influence on the styles of more modern players such as Charles Mingus and Steve Coleman. New Orleans music combined earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime, and blues with collective, polyphonic improvisation. The \\"standard\\" band consists of a \\"front line\\" of trumpet (or cornet), trombone, and clarinet, with a \\"rhythm section\\" of at least two of the following instruments: guitar or banjo, string bass or tuba, piano, and drums. The Dixieland sound is created when one instrument (usually the trumpet) plays the melody or a variation on it, and the other instruments improvise around that melody. This creates a more polyphonic sound than the heavily arranged big band sound of the 1930s or the straight melodies (with or without harmonizing) of bebop in the 1940s. The \\"West Coast revival,\\" which used banjo and tuba, began in the late 1930s in San Francisco. The Dutch \\"old-style jazz\\" was played with trumpets, trombones and saxophones accompanied by a single clarinet, sousaphone and a section of Marching percussion usually including a washboard.

A woman of late antiquity - Historical reality and literary effect (2004) by Wilhelm Baum examines the sources concerning Maria and her relation to another consort of Khosrau II, Shirin. The historical setting for a marital alliance between the Justinian Dynasty and the Sassanids would be 590. At the time Khosrau was an exiled prince who sought assistance from Maurice to claim the throne against BahrƒÅm Chobin.Baum (2004), p. 24-26 The Shahnameh by Ferdowsi reports Khosrau and Shirin to have married prior to his exile. Sebeos reports Shirin being a native of Khuzestan, while the Chronicle of Edessa reports Shirin to be an Aramean, implying an origin from Asoristan. The Raw≈ºat a·π£-·π£afƒÅ æ by Mƒ´r-KhvƒÅnd has Shirin being originally a servant in a house frequented by Khosrau, and introduced to the future monarch there. They are all later accounts and could be influenced by legends.Baum (2004), p. 24-26 Maria is notably absent from Byzantine sources. She appears instead in accounts by the Chronicle of Edessa, Dionysius Telmaharensis (as preserved in the Chronicle of 1234), Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria, Ferdowsi, the Chronicle of Seert, Michael the Syrian, Bar-Hebraeus and Mƒ´r-KhvƒÅnd. The Chronicle of Seert and Mari ibn Sulaiman are unique in mentioning that Maria was also called \\"Shirin\\" and in equating the two figures. Both also feature her as a daughter of Maurice. However, Theophylact Simocatta, the most detailed historical resource on Maurice, never mentions her.Baum (2004), p. 26-27 Concerning her age, Baum notes the known facts on Maurice's marriage. Maurice and his wife Constantina were married in August 582. If a legitimate child of Maurice, Maria would be less than eight-years-old in 590.Baum (2004), p. 26-27 There are nine children of Maurice and Constantina named in primary sources, six sons (Theodosius, Tiberius, Peter, Paul, Justin, Justinian) and three daughters (Anastasia, Theoctiste, Cleopatra). The Shahnameh features a tale of Maria dying, poisoned by Shirin. Later tales featuring the two as rival queens occur in later texts. In several cases, their struggle is based on trying to elevate different heirs to the throne. Primary sources indicate that Siroe (Kavadh II) was the eldest son of Khosrau and not a son of Shirin. Various accounts have Maria as his mother, with Shirin supporting her own son, Mardanshah.Baum (2004), p. 28 Baum considers Shirin to be a historic figure, Maria being a figure of legend, perhaps originating with a historical Maria from the Byzantine Empire, one who was a member of Khosrau II's harem but neither a queen, nor an imperial princess.Baum (2004), p. 27-28  References  Sources  * Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:7th-century Byzantine people Category:Women of the Byzantine Empire Category:Justinian dynasty Category:Women of the Sasanian Empire Category:Persian queens consort Category:Shahnameh characters Category:6th-century Byzantine women Category:7th-century Byzantine women Category:Wives of Khosrow II Category:Iranian people of Roman descent Category:Maurice (emperor) Category:Sasanian queens ","title":"Maria (daughter of Maurice)"},{"id":"26562713","text":"Robert Raymond (Bob) Woodward (5 June 1923 ‚Äì 21 February 2010) was an Australian architect who gained widespread recognition for his innovative fountain designs. Background and early career Robert Raymond Woodward was born in Wentworthville in Sydney's western suburbs, the son of a public service accountant. Woodward was educated at Granville Technical Granville and Sydney Technical College. He served in the army during World War II working as an armourer. He was initially stationed with the Lachlan Macquarie 54th Regiment in Bathurst, then at Victoria Barracks where he completed an armoury course at East Sydney Technical College. Woodward later explained that being in the army at a young age had taught him to be responsible for the work he was doing and how to give instructions effectively.de Berg, 1972. It also opened up the opportunity to study architecture at the University of Sydney after the war as part of the huge post-war repatriation intake of ex- servicemen. Woodward commenced his architectural degree in 1947 and was impressed by teachers such as Leslie Wilkinson, George Molnar and Lloyd Rees. As a student he worked for Harry \\"Pergola\\" Divola and Peddle Thorp & Walker, while in 1950 he represented Australia in the 440 yard hurdles at New Zealand's British Empire Games. After graduating with honours in 1952 he joined the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and worked briefly for Peddle Thorp & Walker, detailing industrial buildings, but soon headed off for England. He toured Europe with friends from Sydney before settling in Finland where he was privileged to work for a year with Alvar Aalto. He also spent another year in Finland working for the firm of Viljo Revell. Upon his return he went into partnership, forming Woodward, Taranto and Wallace, specialising in commercial and industrial architecture. Woodward considered that architectural education in Finland was impressive in the way that it demanded that its students actually build structures. He considered that \\"architects need to understand materials\\" and was impressed by 'Aalto's multi-disciplinary approach where landscape is involved in the building, and interior design, lighting, furnishings, fabrics... I think Aalto's main contribution, and this is to put it very simplistically ... was that he was able to get the best of Bauhaus as well as organic work... Aalto's principles, as stated by him, are that essentially everything in architecture is related to biology. If you take a leaf from a tree, for example, you can see... design principles which should apply to architecture itself. The first item is cellular structure which Aalto saw as the cells being spatial - not physical elements put together but spaces, and a leaf is made up of a whole multitude of similar cells. They mightn't be the same but they are similar and from one family. The way they are structured together is a flexible combination of those elements - cellular structure, flexible combination and the repetition...'Johnson, 1996, pp189-190 Woodward returned to Sydney in 1954 where he had some job offers from big firms, but instead formed a small partnership with Phil Taranto in Bankstown, they were later joined by Scott Wallace. They worked on small scale sites like a fruit shop in Bankstown, where they rationalized the work spaces, designed light fittings and introduced mirrored walls to increase the impression of light and plenty - innovations which were widely \\"copied and mass produced\\".Johnson, 1996, p193 Landscape architecture In 1959, Woodward submitted a design to a City of Sydney competition to construct a fountain in Kings Cross, mainly as a professional \\"design exercise\\" for himself.Johnson, 1996, p194 The design commemorated the war service of the 9th Division of the Second Australian Imperial Force. He won the competition in the name of his firm Woodward & Taranto and went on to build the El Alamein Memorial Fountain, as it became known, was completed in 1961. Combining his architectural and earlier metalwork training he developed the \\"dandelion\\" inspired fountain which became one of the world's most copied designs. The fountain won the New South Wales Institute of Architects Civic Design Award in 1964. This was an immediate success and led to the gradual reorientation of his career into national and international prominence as a fountain designer. In 1968 the Woodward Taranto Wallace partnership was dissolved and Woodward continued alone as a sole practitioner with a focus on fountain design, joining the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects in 1989. He is responsible for many of the most prominent and admired fountains in Australia. In his oral history interview with Hazel de Berg in 1972, Woodward stated:De Berg, 1972, p7111 Woodward suggested that he didn't restrict himself to fountain design, as he explained to De Berg:De Berg, p7112, 7122-3 Due to the success of this fountain, Woodward was approached for further commissions for fountain designs, significantly altering his career path. In 1979, he created the Canberra Times fountain, commissioned for the newspaper's fiftieth anniversary. Following this, he was commissioned to design a fountain for the High Court of Australia in Canberra, a cascade beside the ceremonial ramp. In 1981, he completed a fountain for G.J. Coles and Coy for the Parliament Reserve in Melbourne. The Darling Harbour Water Feature outside the Sydney Exhibition Centre completed in 1988 was one of Woodward's most important works. It was a beautiful piece of design with its interplay of water, light and surface texture. It is both an irresistibly interactive water element and beautiful spiral sculptural form. Woodward was the recipient of many awards and honours in his lifetime, including the NSW Institute of Architect's Civic Design Award for the El Alamein Fountain in 1964, and in 1991 ACT Chapter RAIA Canberra Medallion, for New Parliament House, the 1991 NSW Chapter Civic Design Merit Award for Darling Harbour, the 1991 RAIA Walter Burley Griffin Award for Darling Harbour, the 1991 RAIA Civic Design Award for Darling Harbour, and the 1992 AILA National Awards in Landscape Architecture Civic Design Project Award. In 1987 he was appointed a Member of Order of Australia for his services to architecture and fountain design.

Region Bayou Navigation in Dixie, engraving of a Louisiana Steamboat, 1863 As a definite geographic location within the United States, \\"Dixie\\" is usually defined as the eleven Southern states that seceded in late 1860 and early 1861 to form the new Confederate States of America. They are (in order of secession): South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Maryland never seceded from the Union, but many of its citizens favored the Confederacy. While many of Maryland's representatives were arrested to prevent secession, both the states of Missouri and Kentucky produced Ordinances of Secession and were formally admitted into the Confederacy. West Virginia was part of Virginia until 1863; counties that chose not to secede from the Union became part of West Virginia. Although Maryland is not included in Dixie today, Maryland is on the Dixie side of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line; if the origin of the term Dixie is accepted as referring to the region south and west of that line, Maryland was in Dixie in 1760. It can also be argued that Maryland was, in 1860, part of Dixie, especially culturally. In this sense, it would remain so into the 1970s, when an influx of people from the Northeast made the state and its culture significantly less Southern (especially Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington, DC).. Similarly, the character of Florida - a state which did duly secede in 1861 and was a member of the Confederacy - was changed in the 20th Century by a great influx of Northerners, in particular New Yorkers. However, the location and boundaries of \\"Dixie\\" have, over time, become increasingly subjective and mercurial.There is such a multitude of threads to the fabric called Dixie that official organizations draw boundaries enclosing anywhere from nine to seventeen states and call the place \\"the South.\\" Today, it is most often associated with those parts of the Southern United States where traditions and legacies of the Confederate era and the antebellum South live most strongly. The concept of \\"Dixie\\" as the location of a certain set of cultural assumptions, mind-sets and traditions (along with those of other regions in North America) was explored in the 1981 book The Nine Nations of North America. In terms of self-identification and appeal, the popularity of the word \\"Dixie\\" has been found to be declining. A 1976 study revealed that in an area of the South covering some (all Mississippi and Alabama, almost all of Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina, and around a half of Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina and Florida) \\"Dixie\\" reached 25% of the popularity of \\"American\\" in names of commercial business entities.John Shelton Reed, \\"The Heart of Dixie: An Essay in Folk Geography\\", [in:] \\"Social Forces\\" 54/4 (1976), pp. 925-939 A 1999 analysis found that between 1976 and 1999 in 19% of US cities sampled there was an increase of relative use of \\"Dixie\\", in 48% of cities sampled there was a decline and there was no change recorded in 32% of cities,Derek H. Alderman, Robert Maxwell Beavers, \\"Heart of Dixie Revisited: an Update on the Geography of Naming in the American South\\", [in:] \\"Southeastern Geographer\\" XXXlX/2 (1999), p. 196 while a 2010 study found that in the course of 40 years the area in question shrank to just , to the territory at the confluence of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.Christopher A. Cooper, H. Gibbs Knotts, \\"Declining Dixie: Regional Identification in the Modern American South\\", [in:] \\"Social Forces\\" 88/3 (2010), pp. 1083-1101 In 1976 at some \\"Dixie\\" reached at least 6% popularity of \\"American\\"; in 2010 the corresponding area was some .Cooper, Gibbs Knotts 2010, p. 1090 Significant scholarship has been devoted to the mythology of Dixie and the South (including Lost Cause mythology) as developed \\"by the many attentions of northern artists to southern mythology, the North's fascination with aristocracy and lost causes, the national appeal of the agrarian myth, and the South's personification of that ideal, to say nothing of the North's persistent use of the South in the manipulation of her own racial mythology.\\" In the 21st century, concerns over glorifying the Confederacy has led to the term being removed from some public references. The term Dixieland in the context of Jazz, though originally derived from \\"Dixie\\" (i.e., implying a Southern origin for this type of music) gained a completely different set of connotations. In particular, many African Americans were involved in this kind of jazz, while few if any of them would embrace the political connotations of \\"Dixie\\".  Origin of the name  Ten-dollar note from Banque des citoyens de la Louisiane, 1860 According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the origin of this nickname remains obscure. The most common theories according to A Dictionary of Americanisms on Historical Principles (1951) by Mitford M. Mathews are: # \\"Dixie\\" is derived from Jeremiah Dixon, a surveyor of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, which defined the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania, separating free and slave states subsequent to the Missouri Compromise.John Mackenzie, \\"A brief history of the Mason-Dixon Line \\", APEC/CANR, University of Delaware; accessed 2017.01.05. Evidence shows that 'Dixon' became 'Dixie' in a children's game played in New York back in the 1840s.A much more promising line of inquiry relates Dixie to the Mason-Dixon line, the demarcation between northern and southern states named after the surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon in the 1770s. Jonathan Lighter, the editor of the Historical Dictionary of American Slang, pieced together evidence that connects the Mason-Dixon line to Dixie via an unexpected intermediary: a children‚Äôs game played in New York City. # The word \\"Dixie\\" refers to currency issued first by the Citizens State Bank in the French Quarter of New Orleans and then by other banks in Louisiana.\\"Dixie\\" Originated From Name \\"Dix\\" An Old Currency - New Orleans American May 29 1916, Vol. 2 No. 150, Page 3 Col. 1 Louisiana Works Progress Administration (WPA), Louisiana Digital Library These banks issued ten-dollar notesTen Dollar Note George Francois Mugnier Collection, Louisiana Digital Library labeled Dix on the reverse side, French for \\"ten\\". The notes were known as \\"Dixies\\" by Southerners, and the area around New Orleans and the French-speaking parts of Louisiana came to be known as \\"Dixieland\\". Eventually, usage of the term broadened to refer to the Southern states in general. # One apocryphal account claims that the word preserves the name of a Mr. Johan Dixie (sometimes spelled Dixy), a slave owner on Manhattan Island where slavery was legal until 1827. The story as told in Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends (2008) tells that Dixie's slaves were later sold in the South, and having formerly worked \\"Dixie's Land\\", told of the relatively less harsh treatment they faced while in the North. There is no evidence that this story is true.Richard Campanella, Lincoln in New Orleans, accessed 2020.06.27.

The building serves as the base of Barrow Borough Council. The building was constructed in a four-year period almost entirely from local Hawcoat sandstone with Westmorland slate for the roof. The town hall was officially opened on 14 July 1887 by Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire to coincide with Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. At tall, it amongst the tallest buildings in Barrow and lies within a Conservation Area with Grade II* listed status. History In the mid-19th century, Barrow was little more than a small fishing village. However, after the discovery of iron ore in local mountains and the establishment of a port in the town, the local population skyrocketed to over 40,000 in the space of 20 years. In 1877 numerous architects were invited to submit proposals for a large civic building in Barrow which would represent the dramatic growth and current stature of the town. Irish-born architect, William Henry Lynn had the winning design that began construction in 1882. Financial constraints alongside changes to the design were the reason that construction didn't commence immediately after selection of the design. In 1885 the building was almost complete, however cracks were found in areas of the building and the clock tower had to be completely knocked down and rebuilt. This was most likely the result of the contractors trying to cut costs by using sub-standard stone. Despite these initial troubles, the town hall was finally complete in 1886 and the exterior of the building has remained more or less the same to this day. The town hall's main plaza is to the exterior of the building, which has led to many incorrectly believing that the building was built 'back to front'. Architecture=External The English Heritage listing of Barrow Town Hall describes the external architecture as: Snecked red sandstone with ashlar dressings, graduated slate roofs. 3 storeys and attic with 6-stage tower; 1:1:5:2:4:1:1 bays in near symmetrical composition. Bays 2 & 14 have oriel bay windows corbelled over ground floor; the 2-bay section is occupied by the tower. Gothic Revival style with Geometrical tracery. Internal The ground floor entrance hall consists of a reception and information desk alongside photos of Elizabeth II and The Duke of Edinburgh who visited the town hall in 1956. There is also a plaque commemorating the centenary of the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness which was unveiled in 1967 by The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon The largest room within the town hall is the Queen's Hall, which is located on the first floor and is dominated by stained glass windows which bear the images of William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, Lord Frederick Cavendish and Lord Edward Cavendish. A number of other panels have since been added to windows in the Queen's Hall that feature certain aspects of Barrow's shipbuilding and steelworks industries. Also on the first floor are the Council Chambers, the former Press and Public Galleries, the Drawing Room, the Ante Room and a large public Banquet Hall. Plazas Two large plazas are situated either side of the town hall. They are often focal points for mass local celebrations and events, examples being Barrow A.F.C. and Barrow Raiders victories as well as the annual Christmas lights switch-on. Town Square, originally known as Cavendish Square, to the north is framed by the town hall itself and the Forum, until the turn of the 21st century vehicular traffic ran through Town Square until it was entirely pedestrianised. The rear of the town hall is landscaped and includes the statue of Lord Frederick Cavendish which was originally located in the centre of Town Square.

This match ended as a draw; with both teams scoring one drop goal a-piece. Warren made a crucial tackle at the end of the match stopping Edinburgh's Pearson from running through at Glasgow's 22. International career Warren was capped for Scotland only the once. This was the Five Nations match of 28 February 1914 when Scotland played Ireland at Lansdowne Road. The match turned for Ireland when Scotland failed to capitalise on two chances in quick succession:- the first when John Sweet was tackled into touch when going for the try-line; and the second when Warren knocked on. The _Glasgow Herald_ noted that had Warren passed to John George Will instead, Will would have had a clear run to the line. Ireland won the match 6 - 0.

She is a co- founder of Is Not Magazine and the online pop-culture magazine The Enthusiast. Academia Campbell studied creative advertising at RMIT University, then pursued a Master of Arts degree by research at the University of Melbourne. Her research concerned the Australian cultural figure of the bogan, which she argued does not refer to a social class, a subculture or an aesthetic, but rather is a consensually imagined figure that arises in Australian media and public debate when Australian national identity is perceived as fragmentary or under threat. As part of her research, Campbell has written and spoken on the Jaidyn Leskie murder case, Ned Kelly, the television series Upper Middle Bogan and the phenomenon of \\"cashed-up bogans\\". Campbell's other academic interests include fashion and popular music. Her paper about the non-verbal vocalisations of Michael Jackson won the International Association for the Study of Popular Music's Postgraduate Prize in 2003. From 2009-11 Campbell tutored in online journalism at Monash University. In 2016 she taught Advanced Feature Writing in RMIT‚Äôs Associate Degree in Professional Writing and Editing, then returned to Monash University to teach in the Master of Communication and Media Studies program. Journalism and criticism Campbell is a freelance journalist who writes about popular culture, advertising and branding, media (particularly online media trends) and everyday life. Publications to which she contributes include The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, Meanjin, Junkee, Crikey, Guardian Australia and New Matilda. Between 2006 and 2007 Campbell was pop culture editor at Australian alternative women's magazine YEN. From 2007-8 Campbell was deputy editor at Triple J's monthly music magazine, jmag. She continued to write and review for the magazine on a freelance basis. From 2008-13 Campbell was the film editor at ThreeThousand, an online subcultural guide to Melbourne, as well as its sister sites around Australia: TwoThousand, FourThousand, FiveThousand and SixThousand. In 2013 through Affirm Press Campbell published her debut book Out of Shape: Debunking Myths about Fashion and Fit, a non-fiction investigation of clothing size and fit. In an interview at Crikey, Campbell said, \\"‚Ä¶clothes are so personal. They're part of our persona, and the feelings of shame and humiliation we feel when we get them wrong [are] very personally felt. You need to lift the lid on that.\\" Creative projects With Stuart Geddes, Natasha Ludowyk, Penny Modra and Jeremy Wortsman, Campbell co-founded Is Not Magazine in 2005. An independently published, bimonthly magazine in the form of a 1.5m x 2m bill poster, Is Not ran for eleven issues (and several special issues) before the five co-founders declared it officially defunct in August 2008. \\"We wanted to make a community around this magazine and reinvigorate public space,\\" Campbell told The Age in 2005. \\"It changes the way you approach reading, because there's no logical place for you to start. We love the way that it's physical. You look up, you bend down, we've got spaces ‚Ä¶ where you can make contributions of your own.\\" In 2008 Campbell formed the creative partnership Infinite Ape Media with fellow journalists Andrew Tijs and Daniel Zugna. Their first publication was an online magazine of culture and the popular arts called The Enthusiast. Launched in January 2009, The Enthusiast published news, features, opinion and review. The website shut down in 2014. Campbell co-wrote her debut work of fiction, a romantic comedy novel titled The Hot Guy, in collaboration with film critic Anthony Morris. The book was published in June 2017 by Echo Publishing, an imprint of Bonnier Publishing. They collaborated on a second romcom, Nailed It!, published in 2019.

She also maintains a fashion blog called Footpath Zeitgeist, where she posts research for and discussion about her published work on fashion. Campbell has contributed to Crikey's politics blog, The Stump, and is also a contributing editor at feminist blog The Dawn Chorus. In 2016 Campbell joined the hosting team of the fortnightly literary and culture podcast The Rereaders, alongside regular hosts Sam Twyford-Moore, Stephanie Van Schilt and Dion Kagan. \\"Steph and Dion laughed when I referred to this podcast as \\"the famous Rereaders\\", but to me it really is like that movie Rock Star where Mark Wahlberg plays a tribute band singer who's invited to join the band for real,\\" Campbell said in December 2015 when her role was announced. \\"Guesting on the Rereaders back in November was so much fun.

It has the shape of a drop and is white in colour. It weighs approximately 181 grains (c. 42 carats) and is one of the largest pearls ever found on earth. The size, lustre and form of the pearl distinguish it from other pearls. The origin of the Oriental Pride is most likely the Middle East, where in the region of Basra, natural pearls were found more than 100 years ago. After the rise of the oil industry in the Middle East, the pollution created by the same industry has distincted the natural pearl oysters' natural habitat. Hence there is hardly any saltwater sea left that would form a natural habitat for the oysters of natural pearls. The likelihood that this pearl is the same pearl as the Great Mogul's pearl is very high, given the size, the form and rarity of both.

Administratively a part of the Horki District of Mogilev Region. It is notable for the battlefield of the 1943 Battle of Lenino. History Historically until 1918 the village had been known as Romanovo. Since the Truce of Andrusovo of 1697 it was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and was located not far from the Polish-Muscovite border. Administratively part of the M≈õcis≈Çaw Voivodeship, it was a private property of the mighty Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. Its last owner before the partitions of Poland was Karol Stanis≈Çaw \\"Panie Kochanku\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. However, as he declined to sign an oath of loyalty to empress Catherine II of Russia, the village was confiscated and donated to a Russian family of Dondukov-Korsakov in 1774. At that time the group of villages consisted of 72 settlements with 8589 houses. In late 19th century the village itself had 700 inhabitants, roughly half of them Jews. In late July 1941, all the Jews of the village and from the surrounding area were resettled into a ghetto. Local police guarded the ghetto, which was surrounded by barbed wire on one side and enclosed by a river and a swamp on the other. On June 12, 1942, the Germans and local police shot all of them in pits that had been prepared 2 kilometers to the East of the village.http://www.yahadmap.org/#village/lenino-mogilev-belarus.660 On October 12, 1943 a major battle took place to the north of the village, later to be known by the name of battle of Lenino, even though the village itself was not targeted by any of the sides. In 1968 a Polish-Soviet Brotherhood Memorial was opened in the village, marking the battlefield. In 1989 a Polish War Cemetery was created. On the edge of the battlefield, there is a museum containing artefacts from the time and also a panorama of the battle.

Visitors can walk around inside the aviary to see the birds. It is located on the corner of Bruce Highway and Old Creek Road, Apple Tree Creek, about 50 km south of Bundaberg in central Queensland, Australia. It was opened in 2002. History The facility opened to the public in December 2002 as Flying High Bird Habitat. At the time, it had only the main aviary with about 300 birds. It is situated on land formerly occupied by the Apple Tree Creek school. The two school buildings were moved to serve other uses after the school closed in the late 1960s, and John Woodall started building the sanctuary on the land in 2001. By 2010 the complex had been expanded with additional aviaries and a macaw breeding complex, and was home to almost 3000 birds. On 19 March 2010 the facility was taken over by David and Anne Tocknell, their son Matt and his wife Leisa and was renamed Flying High Bird Sanctuary. It is the largest free-flying aviary in Australia. The Sanctuary was sold on 9 December 2015 and is now under the new management of Des and Cathy Watts. Since 2010 the Sanctuary has expanded even further with the addition of the Kangaroo and Emu enclosures, a separate enclosure for the resident owls and animal nursery. Visitors can enjoy a real hands on experience with the birds at feeding time as well purchasing food to hand feed the animals at any time of day. One of the biggest highlights for people young and old is bottle feeding and interacting with the baby goats as well as the other numerous baby chicks and ducklings. The first baby Macaw for the new owners was born March 2016. \\"Alpha\\" is hand raised and people are encouraged to interact with him and are welcome to have photos taken with him. Exhibits The main aviary covers over and is over high. It contains of trails for visitors in a rainforest setting with Australian, Asian, and South American birds. Breeding The sanctuary breeds and hand raises birds for the pet industry, including harlequin and Catalina macaws. It has also started captive breeding programs for several native birds that will be released into the wild to augment wild bird populations. The future New exhibits and features planned at this time include a koala enclosure, wetland attraction, separate South American and Asian free flight aviaries, a picnic area, emu and kangaroo enclosures, and a raptor aviary. These features are expected to be completed by some time in 2012.

Other taxonomies, e.g. Dzik (1981)Dzik, 1981. Origin of the Cephalopoda. Acta Palaeont. Polonica 26, 2, 161-191 include the Lituitidae in the Orthocerida partly on the basis of the subcentral siphuncle and thin connecting rings, on the misconception that Rhynchorthoceras is ancestral. Classification The Lituitidae comprise two basic groups, based on general form. One is represented by Ancistroceras and Holmiceras and probably includes Angelinoceras. The other is represented by Litoceras, which first appears later in the early Middle Ordovician. Characteristics The coiled juvenile portions of the Lituitidae are characterized by a deep hyponomic sinus and lateral salients at the aperture, indicating a high degree of mobility. The orthoconic adult portions are characterized by a shallow hyponomic sinus as in Ancistroceras indicating a more passive lifestyle, or a complex aperture with lappets as in Litoceras. Derivation and evolution The earliest known lituitids are Ancistroceras and Holmiceras which made their first appearances in the latter part of the Early Ordovician, well before Rhynchorthoceras. The precise ancestry for either is unknown, although evolutionary possibilities can be found in various tarphyceratid and trocholitid genera. The tendency for the adult tarphycerid shell to unwind, or straighten out, is well documented. This even occurs in some ammonoids, in the ammonitid Bacultidae and in the ceratitid Choristoceratidae.Arkell et al 1957, Mesozoic Ammonoidea. Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part L.

She sang \\"Maa Telugu Thalliki\\", the official song of the State of Andhra Pradesh. She was the winner of Miss Madras 1952 pageant and runner- up of the Miss India 1952 pageant. She was the niece of activist and politician Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu, known as Andhra Kesari, who was chief minister of Madras and Andhra. As an actress, she has won the Outer Critics Circle Award for best actress, for playing Queen Sudarshana, in Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs Off-Broadway play The King of the Dark Chamber in 1961.  Career  Suryakumari was a film star at the age of 12, when a special part was written into the film Vipranarayana (1937) to accommodate her singing talents. Suryakumari's next film Adrushtam (1939) was a success.Biography of Tanguturi Suryakumari Her other films include Katakam (1948) and Samsara Nowka (1949). Katakam was at first a Tamil play based on a lesser ‚Äì known William Shakespeare play, Cymbeline. Suryakumari acted in the Tamil version of the film. Tanguturi Suryakumari later acted in some 25 films. Among these films, Devatha and Raithu Bidda made film history and contributed to the Golden age of Telugu Cinema. In the film, Krishna Prema by H. V. Babu, Suryakumari played the role of sage Narada. And it was first time in the history of Telugu cinema; a woman played the male role of Narada. In this film, for the first time, Surya Kumari's singing talents were fully utilised as Narada and her performance won her many laurels. Tanguturi Suryakumari also acted in Hindi movies Watan (1954) and Uran Khatola (1955). In the second one, Tanguturi Suryakumari acted with Hindi movie icon Dilip Kumar and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress award in the Filmfare Awards. As singer Apart from her film career, Tanguturi Suryakumari was also well known for her private songs released as gramophone records and later as audiocassettes. The songs were melodious and had impressive lyrics. Her sweet voice added beauty to these songs. Tanguturi Suryakumari also sang some patriotic songs and in few of them Tanguturi Suryakumari praised Mahatma Gandhi. There were numerous songs sung by Suryakumari of which few of them are \\"Maa Telugu Talliki\\", \\"Mallepoodhandalu\\", \\"O Mahatma\\", \\"Satapatra Sundari\\", \\"Maamidichettunu\\" and others.https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Hour-Basic-Songs-Tanguturi-Suryakumari Tanguturi Suryakumari also sang in a feature-length documentary film about Mahatma Gandhi, which was made by a patriotic Tamil writer and journalist, A. K. Chettiar. Record companies came forward to record her voice, and at a time when gramophones were not yet common, her songs could be heard everywhere. Patrons in restaurants and outdoor cafes would pay extra if their meal was accompanied by Surya's songs, and passing traffic would stop until a song had finished. Her presence was a major attraction at meetings of the Indian National Congress, and her recordings reached rural areas unvisited by politicians. Even today, her most famous song, \\"Maa Telugu Thalli\\" (in praise of her mother tongue), is sung at the start of social functions in her home state of Andhra. Career in the West Suryakumari (sixth from left) along with other contestants at the 1952 Miss India pageant in Bombay Altogether, Surya appeared in some 25 Indian films in the 1940s and 1950s, singing and acting in a variety of languages, including Telugu, Sanskrit, Tamil, Gujurati, Hindi and English. She had her film admirers too, for her films like Raithu Bidda (1939), Bhagyalakshmi (1943), Krishna Prema (1943), Maradalu Pelli (1952) and Hindi films Watan (1954), Uran Khatola (1955). In the mid-1950s, she made her first visit to the US, as a member of a delegation from the Indian film industry invited to Hollywood by the Motion Picture Association of America (though union regulations precluded her from film work there). In 1959, she went to New York to teach at the Columbia University, and also to add to her skills by studying western classical and popular dance forms. On her arrival, she appeared on television alongside the Indian ambassador and sang Indian songs. Making her debut stage appearance in American theatre, she portrayed Queen Sudarshana in Rabindranath Tagore's play The King of the Dark Chamber in Jan Hus Playhouse Theater, in February 1961. Commending her performance, Red Bank Register wrote that she \\"displayed luminous artistry to match appealing beauty.\\" For the performance, she was awarded the Off-Broadway Award Critics' Award for Best Actress. Suryakumari had an acquaintance with the great Alfred Hitchcock. She also took the role of Princess Chitra in the dance production of Tagore's Chitra for CBS, and researched Indian stories for Alfred Hitchcock. Journey to London In 1965, Suryakumari travelled to London. Scheduled to play the Hindu deity Kali in Kindly Monkeys, a new play at the Arts Theatre, she decided at the end of the run to stay on and found India Performing Arts in Kensington with her husband Harold Elvin, a project to train performers and mount productions. Annual performances by Suryakumari herself, her students and fellow artists followed at the Purcell Room, in the South Bank Centre, for the next 40 years. From 1973, Surya was supported in her work by her husband, Harold Elvin, poet, painter and potter, reading his poetry and telling his stories as she sang and played the tanpura and sitar. Something of the flavour of these gatherings may be gained from the programmes for two events in 1982, with schoolchildren appearing alongside Ben Kingsley in Homage To Mahatma Gandhi, and Larry Adler's harmonica improvisations (complemented by Surya's instrumental accompaniment) in An Indian Pageant. Surya's political commitments were engrained in all her work, whether as chief singer at the Gandhi centenary commemoration at St Paul's cathedral in 1969, or with the Hordaland Teater of Bergen, for children in Norway, with whom she worked from 1991 to 1998. He predeceased her. Tanguturi Suryakumari, a singer, actor and dancer, died on 25 April 2005, aged 79.

It was presented by the journalist and broadcaster Michael Parkinson. The programme featured newspaper reviews and entertainment summaries with the help of journalists and a lengthy interview with a media personality. Show format The programme began shortly after the 11:00am news and was introduced by Parkinson who would outline some of the features that would be on that morning's show. These would usually be a review of the Sunday papers with a guest; a round-up of the week's entertainment news in the world of film, radio, television, music and the arts, also with a guest reviewer; and after the Midday news, an interview with a media personality from the worlds of entertainment, arts, sport and music. Between these features Parkinson would play what he termed \\"the very best in music\\" from the jazz and big-band genres, including such artists as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams. After his guest interview Parkinson would often review new album releases in the jazz and big band genres, playing a selection of tracks. The show was then wrapped up before handing over to the 1:00pm news bulletin. Guests for the newspaper review included Steve Richards from the New Statesman and Michael Prescott from The Guardian. Entertainment guests included Gillian Reynolds from The Daily Telegraph and the BBC Radio 4 journalist Quentin Cooper. Parkinnson won a Sony Radio Award for the programme in 1998. In October 2007, a few months after announcing his retirement from his television series, Parkinson said his radio show would also end. The last edition of Parkinson's Sunday Supplement was aired in December 2007. His final guest was the actor Sir Ian McKellen. It was replaced in early 2008 by a show presented by Michael Ball titled Michael Ball's Sunday Brunch.

Costumes A typical Mangalorean Catholic wedding sari (sado) Mangalorean Catholic men used to wear long loose frilled white or black coats known as kutav with buttons (a loose coat that draws from Moghul-era sherwanis), over a loose shirt zibbo (similar to short-kurtas), while a sarong called pudvem (dhoti), a piece of unstitched cloth, usually around 7 yards long, was wrapped around the waist, and in between the legs to be knotted at the waist. The turbans were usually flattened like the Coorgi turbans (Mundaas or Urmal). The Mundaas or Urmal or is a long white piece of cloth with a golden hem (todop) and is tied around the head like a turban in a peculiar manner by which they could easily be recognized as Catholics. In modern times, this mode has changed. Only a few old people can be seen wearing this traditional dress on church going occasions. Before marriage, women used to wear a kirgi (half saree) and baju (blouse). The kirgi is a piece of cloth, not longer than four feet and about three feet broad. It was wrapped around the body from the waist down. A jacket called baju with long sleeves was used to cover the upper part of the body. This dress was a sign of her virginity and she wore for the last time during the Ros ceremony. The kirgi was wrapped around the waist, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder. To wear the full sari with its end thrown over the shoulder, known as worl, was the exclusive right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The salwar kameez and longyis is another form of popular dress for contemporary females and males. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari (drape) is known as sado. It is usually a red coloured Benaresi sari made of finely woven silk decorated with elaborate gold embroidery called z√†ri (brocade). In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet long and as many broad. After the wedding was over, the Sado was well preserved and worn only on feast-days or for weddings and any other grand functions. Sometimes a particularly precious sado was handed down from mother to daughter and considered a valuable heirloom. The cost of a sado was reckoned in varahas. Saris are known for their variety by special names, such as Katari, Shilari, Gulabi, etc. Both the sado and Dharma sado were costly saris, while the sado was the most expensive, the Dharma Sado was the second most expensive. Some Mangalorean Catholic brides also wear a white sari during the Nuptial Blessing in Church, but however this style of dress has waned in the recent years. The bridegroom's dress in the early times consisted of a short sarong of hand-woven cloth (dhoti), a shawl to cover his shoulders and a red handkerchief on the head (leis). The groom's dress was gradually improved. Later, his dress consisted of a white sarong with a red and gold hem (todop), a shirt with gold buttons and a coat (kutav), a shawl on the shoulders and a towel (Urmal) on the head. The bridegroom wore a chakrasar (neck chain) around his neck. He wore a pair of sandals or at least a pair of socks. In present times, many westernised Mangalorean Catholic couples and particularly the diaspora outside South Canara, have taken to a Victorian style White weddings in which the bridegroom usually wears a two-piece black tie suit, while the bride wears a white wedding gown to Church ceremony, Nevertheless since the 1960s, some families have adopted and preserved a \\"fusion wedding\\" subculture and will follow the rules and rituals in varying degrees. After Toast raising, Wedding cake- cutting, the First couple dance& other Western rituals are done, the newly- weds will change over into Eastern wear and re-enter in a second Wedding march at the Wedding reception venue; Eastern wear today comprises of pudvem (a light coloured silk dhoti) that is usually off-white or whitish yellow, and a dark coloured short-sherwani for the groom, while the bride wears a sado (red sari) with a full length bodice or blouse (choli), this is followed by a number of native Konkani (paik) rituals, the most prominent among which is the tying of pirduk, a hybridised piece of jewellery drawing from thaali (Indian bridal necklace) and a Christian pendant blest by a priest during the Church wedding ceremony. Ornaments The earliest bridal ornament was the pirduk around the neck. It was a necklace of black glass beads strung on a thread made of the fibres of dried pineapple (ananas) leaves. This necklace was to be worn as long as the husband was alive; a widow had to take it off. It was highly prized by the women as the symbol of their married state. The pirduk could consist of a single row of beads, but in old times it often consisted of three rows. The beads were black probably because black never fades or changes. As the years passed more lustre was added to the beads. The ordinary crude pattern of the pirduk was improved in the course of time. Later longish beads of gold were inserted between the black glass beads and a pendant was added. The earliest pendant was a round disk of silver. It was called thali. Later it was changed into a golden pendant. Finally the pendant was replaced by a gold medal bearing the picture of Our Lady. This ornament is still in use in some places. Elsewhere in South Canara the pirduk has now the form of a half-moon surmounted by a cross and studded with pearls or precious stones. It is worn on the chest on a string of pineapple fibres on which gold and black glass beads are strung alternately. Another form of the pendant consists of a cross studded with precious stones. To the top of the cross is attached the figure of a dove, symbol of the Holy Ghost. While the former pendant is called minin, the latter shape is called sorpoli. It is worn on a gold chain without glass beads. At present, the necklace is made of black beads, strung on a gold wire as either as a single chain or double chain with a connecting pendant. Besides this main ornament a bride used to wear the following other ornaments: # On the neck: the kanti, a necklace of red coral beads and gold beads, between eight or ten coral beads a larger gold bead being inserted, hung down to the breast; the chakrasar consisting of a series of small round gold plates woven one into the other and forming a long chain; the fugodor, a necklace of large green stones mounted in gold. #On the ear: The most ancient ear ornament was called kap. It consisted of a round disk inserted into the lobe of the ear. It is still the typical ear ornament for married women in Canara. The weight of the kap extended the hole of the earlobes so much that the earlobes of old women hang down very low. In the course of time the kap fell into disuse among the younger generation and was replaced by a more elaborate ornament, the pespes, which is similar to the kap. In the present time the ear ornament most commonly worn is the so-called kudar (pl. kudkan), a round gold disk surrounded by precious stones. Another ear-ornament was the karap, inserted in the middle ear. A thin gold chain was attached to it which was fastened in the hair. On top of the ear the bride wore the mugud, a gold disk surrounded by pearls. The mugud too was attached to the hair by a golden chain. #Head ornaments: First was a gold pin struck through the bun of hair at the back of the head. For a bride it was a silver pin with a gold head, often ornamented. It was called kanto. The bride wore a pair of combs (dantoni). Two ordinary combs were purchased and the upper part of each one was plated with gold. They are worn in the hair on both sides of the head over the ears. Two more combs were worn by the bride, with a figure of a fish in gold inserted in each comb. These combs were therefore called masli (fish). In the centre of the forehead where the hair is parted, a gold chain was placed with a pendant. This chain was called bang. It was also used by the Hindu bride. #Arm ornaments: Every bride formerly wore three pairs of gold bangles; in addition she wore bangles of red glass. A bride must also wear one or several gold rings on her fingers. These were the traditional ornaments for a bride on her wedding day. The less sophisticated country brides still wear them though in the towns they have been replaced by modern jewellery. The modern tendency is to wear a lesser number of ornaments, but the few ornaments worn are more valuable through the addition of precious stones and through a more refined workmanship. A widow had to wear a black sari all her life, and was not allowed to wear ornaments. Notes a The Hindus call it mangalsutra or mangala sutra (the auspicious necklace). It is the symbol of the married state. b This was probably imported from Kerala where the thali is the symbol of the married state. The bridegroom has to tie it around the neck of the bride during the wedding. c Some fifty years ago the old women still wore black glass bangles and even copper bangles. The Vakkal women wear bangles of black glass on both arms even at the present time.

It cost somewhere between ¬£350,000 and ¬£500,000 and was intended to last only five years. The new building was in the shape of a long flattened tube, glazed at each end. Alsop liked to compare its shape to a disposable cigarette lighter. It was constructed using a series of oval steel ribs, clad with marine plywood and covered with external skin of PVC sheeting.Cardiff Bay Visitors Centre, Architen Landrell. Retrieved 18 March 2012. Ripple-like slots were cut into the plywood, allowing dappled daylight into the interior. It was shortlisted for the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Building of the Year award (forerunner of the Stirling Prize). The visitor centre was built to house an exhibition about the new Cardiff Bay development. In 1993 the building needed to be moved from its location east of the Pierhead Building. Rather than permanently dismantle it, the structure was put on the back of a low-loader truck and moved to another part of the Bay.

It is a major axis for long distance and regional passenger freight transport in the northern Ruhr. It is served by Intercity- Express, InterCity, Regional-Express, Regionalbahn and S-Bahn trains. It includes the central stations of Duisburg, Oberhausen, Gelsenkirchen, Dortmund and Wanne-Eickel and the regionally important stations of Essen-Altenessen and Herne. It is the middle section of the Cologne-Minden trunk line from Cologne- Deutz to Minden. It was opened in 1847 and has been modernised and developed several times since then. Today, it has two to four tracks and is electrified and classified as a main line. History  On 18 December 1843, the Prussian government granted a concession to the trunk line to the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (German, old spelling: C√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, CME) for the line, which began at what was then the CME station in Deutz (now a suburb of Cologne) with the construction of the first section to D√ºsseldorf, which was opened on 20 December 1845. Only a few weeks later, on 9 February 1846, the second section was completed to a temporary terminus at the site of present-day Duisburg Hauptbahnhof called the Cologne-Minden railway station, the first of three train stations built at the same place. The route of the next section to Oberhausen, Altenessen, Gelsenkirchen, Wanne, Herne and Dortmund to Hamm was chosen over a route close to the coal mines that were then located on the north bank of the Ruhr because it was cheaper to build as it largely avoided hills. Nevertheless, it still took well over a year until 15 May 1847 for this section to be completed and put into operation. On 15 October 1847 the last section was opened to Minden, thus completing the entire 263 kilometre long, single track railway. On the same day the Royal Hanoverian State Railways opened its Hanover-Minden Railway, completing a connection to Berlin and northeastern Germany. Branch line to Duisburg-Ruhrort  In 1848 the CME built a branch line to the docks at Ruhrort from Oberhausen station and agreed with the Aachen-D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrort Railway Company (Aachen- D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrorter Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) to construct the Ruhrort-Homberg train ferry. Holland line  The Oberhausen Station was also at the beginning of a line opened on 20 October 1856 to Arnhem via Wesel and Emmerich am Rhein, popularly known as the Holland line. Rollbahn Wanne station (now Wanne-Eickel Hbf) was from 1 January 1870, the starting point for a line to Hamburg called the Rollbahn (Rolling Line). This line along the German North Sea coast was part of the Paris-Hamburg Railway, linking with the CME‚Äôs concession from the Prussian government for a Hamburg-Venlo railway. Emscher Valley Railway From 1871 to 1878 the CME built another line from Duisburg to Dortmund along the Emscher valley largely parallel to its trunk line via Osterfeld S√ºd and Wanne through the northern Ruhr to service the growing industries and prosperous coal mines. Current situation  Since the railway line was opened from Duisburg to Dortmund it has grown in importance as the centre of coal mining in the Ruhr has migrated north and it has continually been modernized. Today the line is at least double track and electrified for its entire length. The route is now comparable to the other east-west line, in particular the central Ruhr trunk line of the former Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company. Services  Long distance trains only use parts of the line. The section from Duisburg to Oberhausen is served by Intercity-Express trains to and from Amsterdam. It is also served by Regional- Express trains on line RE 5 (Rhein-Express), terminating in Wesel, and RE19 (Rhein-IJssel-Express), terminating in Arnhem, and Regionalbahn line RB 35 (Emscher-Niederrhein-Bahn) between Gelsenkirchen and M√∂nchengladbach. Every two hours InterCity line 35 uses a large part of the line from Duisburg to Wanne-Eickel. In addition occasional trains of IC line 32, and at-least hourly regional services on lines RE 2 (Rhein-Haard-Express), RB 42 (Haard-Bahn) and RB 46 (Gl√ºckauf-Bahn) use the section from Gelsenkirchen to Wanne-Eickel. The only Regional-Express service that uses the total length of the route is RE 3 Rhein-Emscher Express, which runs from D√ºsseldorf to Hamm, all on the route of the trunk line of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company. S-Bahn line S 2 runs at 30-minute intervals between Herne and Dortmund Mengede and continues to Dortmund via the Southern route of the former Royal Westphalian Railway Company (K√∂niglich-Westf√§lische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). West of Herne, one train per hour connects to Recklinghausen and one connects via Gelsenkirchen to Essen. Formerly another S-Bahn service per hour ran along the entire historic route between Duisburg and Dortmund. Since December 2019, this has operated as the RB 32 (Rhein-Emscher-Bahn), but running only on the Duisburg‚ÄìDortmund railway route, skipping the station between Dortmund-Mengede and Dortmund. This is complemented by the RB 35 Emscher-Niederrhein-Bahn between Duisburg and Gelsenkirchen from Monday to Friday between 5 a.m. and 7 p.m. The RB 32 and RB 35 services stop at all stations between Duisburg and Gelsenkirchen, like the former S 2 service.

Defensive tackles are typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players. Depending on a team's individual defensive scheme, a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles. These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved, or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent's backfield. If a defensive tackle reads a pass play, his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback, or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm's reach. Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme. In a traditional 4‚Äì3 defense, there is no nose tackle. Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle. Some teams, especially in the National Football League (NFL), do have a nose tackle in this scheme, but most of them do not. Nose tackle Nose tackle (also nose guard or middle guard) is a defensive alignment position for a defensive lineman. In the 3‚Äì4 defensive scheme the sole defensive tackle is referred to as the nose tackle. The nose tackle aligns across the line of scrimmage from the offense's center before the play begins in the \\"0-technique\\" position. In this position, frequently taking on the center and at least one if not both of the guards, the nose tackle is considered to be the most physically demanding position in football.Dixon, D., (October 18, 2004) http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_42_228/ai_n6249316/?tag=content;col1 The Sporting News In five-linemen situations, such as a goal-line formation, the nose guard is the innermost lineman, flanked on either side by a defensive tackle or defensive end. According to Pat Kirwan, a traditional 3‚Äì4 defense demands \\"a massive man who can clog up the middle,\\" while a 4‚Äì3 defense is looking for \\"a nose tackle who relies on quickness to penetrate and move along the front.\\" A lone nose tackle in the base 3‚Äì4 defensive formation Typical 3‚Äì4 nose tackles are \\"big wide bodies who can hold the point of attack and force double teams by the guard and center.\\" They are usually the heaviest players on the roster, with weights ranging from . Also, height is critical, as they are supposed to get \\"under\\" the offensive line, which means ideal 3‚Äì4 nose tackles are no taller than . Recent examples of such nose tackles include Gilbert Brown, Casey Hampton, Jamal Williams, Vince Wilfork, and Damon Harrison. Rather uncommon are taller nose tackles, such as Ted Washington and Ma'ake Kemoeatu, who each won a Super Bowl ring, are both tall. In some 4‚Äì3 defenses, the nose tackle is one of two defensive tackles. Some teams, especially in the NFL, do have a nose tackle in the 4‚Äì3 defense, which lines up against the opposing center and very likely the weak-side or pulling guard. In a 4‚Äì3 defense, nose tackles are rather quick and supposed to \\"shoot the 'A gap' and beat the center and very likely the weak-side or pulling guard into the backfield.\\" Height is not as important, and their weight is closer to . The terms \\"nose guard\\" or \\"middle guard\\" were more commonly used with the five-man defensive line of the older 5-2 defense. Effective against most plays of the day, but with a weakness to the inside short pass, the 5‚Äì2 was phased out of the pro game in the late 1950s.Rand, Jonathan, Riddell Presents: The Gridiron‚Äôs Greatest Linebackers, Sports Publishing, 2003, p. 36Zimmerman, Paul, The New Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football, Harper Collins, 1984, p. 128. In the 4‚Äì3 defense, the upright middle linebacker replaced the middle guard. The nose guard is also used in a 50 read defense. In this defense there is a nose guard, two defensive tackles, and two outside linebackers who can play on the line of scrimmage or off the line of scrimmage in a two-point stance. The nose guard lines up head up on the center about six to eighteen inches off the ball. In a reading 50 defense, the nose guard's key is to read the offensive center to the ball. In run away, the nose guard's job is to shed the blocker and pursue down the line of scrimmage, taking an angle of pursuit. The primary responsibility of the nose tackle in this scheme is to absorb multiple blockers so that other players in the defensive front can attack ball carriers and rush the quarterback. 3-technique tackle A 3-technique tackle (also 3-tech) is often featured in a formation with four defensive linemen (such as the traditional 4‚Äì3 or the 4‚Äì2‚Äì5 Nickel defense), but can sometimes fill in as the nose tackle in a 3‚Äì4 defense. Compared to the 0 or 1-tech who is more prototypical of the nose tackle, the 3-tech is often a smaller, more agile defensive lineman (but still larger than the defensive ends) who specializes in penetrating through the line with his quickness as his bigger counterpart occupies blockers, aiming to sack the quarterback or tackle the rusher (often the running back) for a loss of yards. The 3-tech often lines up against the \\"weak side\\" of the offensive line, and therefore faces fewer double-teams as a result. Notable examples of prototypical 3-tech tackles in the NFL include Geno Atkins, Sharrif Floyd, Tyrone Crawford, Kyle Williams, Aaron Donald, and Ed Oliver. Donald and Oliver, in particular, have pushed the limits on how small the 3-tech can be, both weighing just 285 lbs. Their smaller statures have drawn criticism, but Donald and Oliver often make up for this using their athleticism. Donald has made five Pro Bowls and was twice named the AP Defensive Player of the Year.

It is a Grade II* listed building, the second highest ranking. History The mansion was commissioned by Henry Vincent, who inherited the estate from his father in 1697. He chose William Talman, an established architect with a reputation for his mercurial temperament, who was a pupil of Sir Christopher Wren and was in the service of King William III at Hampton Court. Before construction was complete, Vincent moved to Norfolk and let Fetcham Park House to Arthur Moore MP. Fetcham Park House was sold to Moore for ¬£8,250 in 1705. He invested a fortune on the house and grounds, commissioning the stairway murals and ceiling paintings by the celebrated French artist Louis Laguerre, whose work can also be seen at Blenheim Palace and Hampton Court. It was then too that Capability Brown advised on the garden design. Laguerre was born in Paris in 1663 and came to England in 1684. His father had been in charge of the royal menagerie and Louis XIV was his godfather. As well as Fetcham Park House and Chatsworth, he worked at Burghley, Blenheim, Marlborough House, Hampton Court and Buckingham House.Leatherhead & District Local History Society But Moore spent so extravagantly that after his death in 1730 there were insufficient funds to maintain the estate and it was sold in 1737 to Thomas Revell, Agent Victualler at Gibraltar. Revell's descendants sold the estate, then totalling , to John Richardson in 1788. It was soon re-sold to the London banker Thomas Hankey, whose family owned it for the next 138 years. Before his death in 1793 Thomas Hankey added two curved wings at the north and south ends of the house. By 1875 John Hankey inherited the property and commissioned a major refurbishment by the respected architect Edward I'Anson. This was designed to alter the appearance of the house and brought French and Flemish influences to the original Queen Anne design and the later Georgian additions. I‚ÄôAnson's legacy includes the mansard roof and typical Flemish turreted tower block on the west side, providing an entrance hall and two rooms above, and a two- storey wing at the south end of the house.Surrey Villages, Derek Pitt and Michael Shaw, 1971 Captain George Hankey was the last of the family to live in the house, dying there in October 1924. Many members of the Hankey family are buried in the graveyard adjoining Fetcham Park. The house remained empty for two years until it was acquired by the Reverend James Wilkie, Rector of the Parish of Badingham in Suffolk. Land to the east and south was sold for a housing development but the Rev Wilkie turned the mansion into a boys‚Äô boarding school called Badingham College. Internal alterations were made and new buildings were added in the grounds, now less than . The school thrived, but it had to be closed down in 1940 after several bombs had landed in the grounds. For the duration of the war, the building was taken over by University College Hospital's pre-clinical medical school. The Reverend Wilkie succeeded in restarting the school after the war, although he had to fight off a compulsory purchase order in the process. After he died in 1953, two of his sons took over the running of the school. In 1965, however, the school was moved to Norfolk and most of the grounds were sold off, leaving the mansion with four and a quarter acres. The house was badly neglected in the next few years, being \\"argued over, fought about and discussed but not occupied\\" (Surrey Villages, Pitt and Shaw, 1971). In 1979 the then derelict building was sold for ¬£775,000 to a company called United Trading Group, which spent around ¬£4 million returning it to its former splendour. False walls concealing Laguerre's stair and hall paintings were removed and his artwork sensitively restored after the ravages of Victorian over-embellishment, smoke damage from a fire and damp from a leaking roof. The 1980‚Äì81 alterations included an extension to the second floor and the addition of catering facilities in the basement. Two of the rooms on the ground floor east side were panelled in oak and mahogany and the Shell Room, with its magnificent ceiling painting, was among those where the plasterwork, gilding and architectural details were painstakingly restored. The first and second floors were redecorated and adorned with mainly French antique furniture and some fine paintings. The grounds were replanted and ponds and illuminated fountains were created. During the renovation, the discovery of tunnels at the front of the house led to speculation about their history but they were later found to be Second World War air raid shelters.A History of Fetcham Park House by J. F. Lachlan (produced for UTG)Fetcham Park House by A Pooley UTG House, as it was then known, was sold in 1986 and renamed Fetcham Park House before being sold, with its contents, to local property investors The Wilky Group Ltd in 1999.

Biography=Youth Jeannette Sorrell was born in San Francisco in 1965. Her father, a European immigrant, was a drama critic and linguist. Her mother, an American, was a nurse. Both parents became university professors by the time Jeannette Sorrell was 8 years old. She grew up studying piano, violin, ballet and theatre. In an interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer, she describes how she spent her first year of piano lessons (at the age of 9) practicing on a paper keyboard that she made, because the family had no piano. Her family moved to the Shenandoah Valley area of Virginia when she was 14. She took her first paid job at the age of 15, playing the piano for a Southern Baptist church. This is where she first encountered early American folk music and shape-note hymns which later developed into an artistic interest for her. At 16 she began studying conducting and composition, and founded an instrumental and vocal ensemble for which she arranged all of the music. Studies: 1988-1991  Sorrell received a full scholarship to the Artist Diploma program of Oberlin Conservatory, where she studied harpsichord with Lisa Crawford and orchestral conducting with Robert Spano. In 1989 she became one of the youngest students in the conducting program at the Tanglewood Festival, where she studied under Leonard Bernstein and Sir Roger Norrington. Upon graduating from Oberlin in 1990, she was immediately invited to join the faculty of Oberlin's summer baroque institute as chamber music coach and continuo accompanist. That summer she also served as a conducting fellow at the Aspen Music Festival. She then moved to Amsterdam to study harpsichord with Gustav Leonhardt. Following this year of intensive study with Leonhardt, she won First Prize and the Audience Choice Award in the 1991 Spivey International Harpsichord Competition held in Atlanta, GA, competing in a field of 70 contestants from Europe, the former Soviet Union, Israel and the U.S. Founding of Apollo's Fire In 1991, Sorrell returned to the U.S. and was immediately invited to interview for the position of Assistant Conductor with The Cleveland Orchestra. She had not applied for the post but had been recommended by Affiliate Artists, whose agent had seen her conducting at Aspen and Tanglewood. In various interviews, Sorrell has recounted her meeting with Cleveland Orchestra Music Director Christoph von Dohnanyi, who told her that there was no point in trying to find time in the orchestra's schedule for an audition because the audience in Cleveland would never accept a woman as a conductor. Sorrell replied that she had actually not sought this post and she really wanted to work with period instruments. Following this interview, the orchestra's artistic administrator Roger Wright offered to help Sorrell launch a period-instrument orchestra in Cleveland. Sorrell was 26. With Wright's assistance, she received start-up funding from The Cleveland Foundation. The ensemble made its debut in June 1992 under the name of Apollo's Fire - The Cleveland Baroque Orchestra. The debut concerts were sold out. Apollo's Fire began receiving touring invitations within a few months. Since then, Sorrell has led Apollo's Fire as Music Director and has developed a national and international reputation for creative programming. Career=Apollo's Fire Sorrell's focus with Apollo's Fire has been the 18th-century ideal of Affekt, in which the performers use rhetoric and dramatic inflection to move the emotional moods of the listeners. She has been credited with \\"forging a vibrant and life-affirming approach to the re-making of early music\\". Eight of her CD recordings have become bestsellers on the Billboard classical chart in the U.S. In addition, she has led Apollo's Fire on tour at Carnegie Hall, the BBC Proms, London's Wigmore Hall, the Royal Theare (Teatro Real) of Madrid, the Grand Opera House of Bordeaux, the Boston Early Music Festival and the Aspen Music Festival and extensive North American tours of the Brandenburg Concertos and the Monteverdi Vespers. In Cleveland, Sorrell's concerts with Apollo's Fire are admired for consistently drawing one of the largest audiences in the country for period-instrument music. In 1999 Sorrell established a folk wing of Apollo's Fire, consisting of hand-picked artists who are steeped in traditional British Isles and early American folk music as well as historical performance. In 2010, her 1999 CD recording of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and 2 harpsichord concertos was released into the European market for the first time, when Apollo's Fire signed on with the British record label Avie. The recording received considerable attention in the press. The Sunday Times (London) called it \\"a swaggering version‚Ä¶ The most is made of the instrumental colours Bach so exhilaratingly put on show. The keyboard part in the 5th Brandenburg is brilliantly played by Sorrell.\\"The Sunday Times, London, Sept. 5, 2010, review by Stephen Pettitt Early Music America called it \\"stunning...

This was a collaboration between Sorrell and French Canadian lutenist Sylvain Bergeron. The program interweaves excerpts from the 13th-century Vespers of St. Kentigern (patron saint of Glasgow, Scotland) with pagan carols and Celtic dances and fiddle tunes. The disc debuted at #11 on the Billboard classical chart in December of that year.Billboard Traditional Classical albums, Issue Date 2013-01-05 The CD was praised by the International Record Review(UK) for its \\"mixture of passion and reverence\\".International Record Review, Dec. 2012, review by Robert Levett In the U.S., Listen Magazine described it as \\"lovingly prepared‚Ä¶ the Christmas myth is brought to vivid life.\\"LISTEN Magazine, Winter 2012, review by Daniel Felsenfeld American Record Guide called it \\"magical‚Ä¶ an exquisite program, adroitly mixing joy, solemnity and the sacred.\\"American Record Guide,review by Parsons Early Music America called it \\"beautifully executed.

The dam failure unleashed torrents of water about high and washed away a bridge on a main highway connecting Almaty with the city of Ust-Kamenogorsk near the border with Russia. More than 600 emergency service workers traveled to the region to clear the debris and to provide tents and much-needed aid for evacuees. Security in the area was stepped up to deter looters as well. A temporary camp, with a field hospital, was established to look after at least 1000 evacuees from Kyzyl-Agash and the Kazakh military dispatched units to the area to assist. Kazakhstan's Prime Minister, Karim Massimov, also traveled to the region to personally supervise the relief efforts.

Its leader was Dr. Aleksander Majkowski, already a well-known Kashubian writerTadeusz Linkner, Aleksandar Majkowski, univ.gda.pl and author of The Life and Adventures of Remus. Other influential members of the association were the attorney Jan Karnowski and two Roman Catholic priests, Leon Heyke and J√≥zef Wrycza.  Objectives of the Society  The Society of Young Kashubians worked to awaken ethnic self-awareness among the Kashubian people, to promote understanding of Kashubian culture and to connect Kashubians with the Polish scientific movement. Emilia Szmytke, Aleksander Majkowski, naszekashuby.pl Young Kashubians published their literary works in the \\"Gryf\\" (The Griffon) magazine. Their motto was What is Kashubian is Polish at the same time, an echo of Hieronim Derdowski's famous line: No Kaszubia without Poland, no Poland without Kaszubia. In the words of the scholar Jozef Borzyszkowski:Jozef Borszyskowski, \\"A History of the Kashubs until the End of Communism,\\" in Cezary Obracht-Prondzy≈Ñski and Tomasz Wicherkiewicz (eds), The Kashubs: Past and Present (Bern: Peter Lang, 2011), p. 45. The motto What is Kashubian is Polish at the same time expressed the Society's belief that despite variations within the Kashubian language, Kashubians as a whole made up an indispensable part of the Polish nation, as confirmed by common history, culture and religion. Stanis≈Çaw Janke, 125 lat poezji kaszubskiej, naszekashuby.pl Such a belief conflicted with the position expressed by Florian Ceynowa and others that Kashubia was better associated with the pan-Slavic movement than with Poland.

An attempt at the history overview, kaszebsko.com  History and Influence  The Young Kashubians based their writing primarily on Kashubian mythology and tradition. They criticized the increasing superstition and drunkenness among Kashubians, which is shown inter alia in Majkowski's satirical epic poem Jak w Kosc√©rznie k√≤sceln√©g√≤ √≤brel√´ ab√≤ pi√£c kawaler√≥w a jedn√¥ jedin√¥ brutka (\\"How they chose the Sacristan at Koscierzyna, or Five bridegrooms and only one bride,\\" 1899) and in Jan Karnowski's volume of poetry, Nowotne spiew√´ i wiersze (\\"New Songs and Poems,\\" 1910). The Young Kashubians met with fierce opposition. Germanizers within the Kashubian community naturally opposed the Young Kashubians, as did the Polish-language journals Pielgrzym and Gazeta GrudziƒÖdzka. Accusations and recriminations were hurled, and eventually brought to court.

The Landtag assembly of the Italian South Tyrol province in 2004 by majority has rejected its adoption with regard to the Italian-speaking minority. It is however, like the Bozner Bergsteigerlied, an unofficial anthem of the German-speaking community. The lyrics were written by the German writer Julius Mosen in 1831, the German composer Leopold Knebelsberger melodized them in 1844. The song deals with the death of Andreas Hofer, an innkeeper by trade, who was the leader of the Tyrolean Rebellion against the French and Bavarian occupation during the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809. After Emperor Francis I of Austria had signed the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, Hofer fought a losing battle. Betrayed and captured, he was executed by personal command of Napoleon at Mantua in Italy on 20 February 1810 by the French forces. The song originating from the pre-1848 Vorm√§rz era became popular in the course of the veneration of Andreas Hofer as a protagonist of the Pan-German movement in the Austrian lands, especially aimed against Italian irredentism. In recent years it has therefore become subject to increasing criticism. Nevertheless, having official status as a regional anthem since 1948, it is, since 1972, forbidden by law, with a fine of up to 2000 ‚Ç¨ possibly imposed, to sing parody versions of the song or to alter the lyrics otherwise in a way that might be insulting to the Tyrolean population. Originally, it was generally forbidden to sing different lyrics to the anthem's melody. However, a popular socialist song, Dem Morgenrot entgegen, is written to the melody of the Tyrolean anthem. Dem Morgenrot entgegen was sung at an event hosted by the SP√ñ in 2004, which resulted in a legal complaint by the Tyrolean governor. The current legal situation was then established after an objection by the SP√ñ at the Austrian Constitutional Court, which said court has affirmed. Lyrics The English lyrics are roughly translated.

Plasma shaping is the study of the plasma shape in such devices, and is particularly important for next step fusion devices such as ITER. This shape is conditioning partly the performance of the plasma. Tokamaks, in particular, are axisymmetric devices, and therefore one can completely define the shape of the plasma by its cross- section. History Early fusion reactor designs tended to have circular cross-sections simply because they were easy to design and understand. Generally, fusion machines using a toroidal layout, like the tokamak and most stellarators, arrange their magnetic fields so the ions and electrons in the plasma travel around the torus at high velocities. However, as the circumference of a path on the outside of the plasma area is longer than one on the inside, this caused several effects that disrupted the stability of the plasma. During the 1960s a number of different methods were used to try to address these problems. Generally they used a combination of several magnetic fields to cause the net magnetic field inside the device to be twisted into a helix. Ions and electrons following these lines found themselves moving to the inside and then outside of the plasma, mixing it and suppressing some of the most obvious instabilities. In the 1980s, further research along these lines demonstrated that further advances were possible by using external current- carrying coils to make the lines not just helical, but non-symmetric as well. This led to a series of experiments using C and D-shaped plasma volumes.. By increasing the current in one (or more) shaping coils to a high enough degree, one (or more) 'X-points' can be created. An X-point is defined as a point in space at which the poloidal field has zero magnitude. The magnetic flux surface that intersects with the X-point is called the separatrix, and, as all flux surfaces external to this surface are unconfined, the separatrix defines the last closed flux surface (LCFS). Formerly, the LCFS was established by inserting a material limiter into the plasma, which fixed the plasma temperature and potential (among other quantities) to be equal to that of the limiter. Plasma that escaped the LCFS would do so with no preferential direction, potentially damaging instruments. By establishing an X-point and separatrix, the plasma edge is uncoupled from the vessel walls, and exhausted heat and plasma particles are preferentially diverted towards a known region of the vessel near the X-point. Cross-section In the simple case of a plasma with up-down symmetry, the plasma cross-section is defined using a combination of four parameters: * the plasma elongation, \\\\kappa={b \\\\over a}, where a is the plasma minor radius, and b is the height of the plasma measured from the equatorial plane, * the plasma triangularity, \\\\delta , defined as the horizontal distance between the plasma major radius R and the X point, * the angle between the horizontal and the plasma last closed flux surface (LCFS) at the low field side, * the angle between the horizontal and the plasma last closed flux surface (LCFS) at the high field side. In general (no up-down symmetry), there can be an upper-triangularity, and a lower- triangularity.Triangularity Tokamaks can have negative triangularity.The negative triangularity tokamak: stability limits and prospects as a fusion energy systemThe negative triangularity tokamak: Stability limits and prospects as a fusion energy system.

Education and career In 1953, he graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana under the tutelage of the sculptors Boris Kalin (1905‚Äì75) and Zdenko Kalin (b 1911). After that, he returned to Skopje exhibited sculptures, prints and drawings conceived according to his mentors' poetic interpretation of French Expressionist sculpture. By the end of the 1950s, he was invited to study at the Royal College of Art in London under the British Council postgraduate scholarship programme. His UK stay was so prolific that a year later, in 1960, Henry Moore himself opened Petar‚Äôs solo exhibition at the Grabowski Gallery in London. This was the first showcasing of Macedonian sculpture in the UK. In 1960, he joined the group Mugri in Skopje and started his series of Masks (1961-3), crafted from welded scrap- metal sheets. From the mid-1960s the influence of Lynn Chadwick and Kenneth Armitage was superseded by that of Minimalism. During the 1970s Hadji Boskov sculpted the granite monument to Kliment Ohridski in Skopje (1972) and the monument to the Fallen Combatants (1977) in Ravne na Koroskem in Slovenia. In this period, he produced tall, mineral-like objects in polished metal, as well as massive clay blocks with richly faceted planes glazed in vivid colors. From 1980 to 1993, he was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Skopje. In 2004, Boskov creates a monument, in memorial, which shows various phases of the life and works of Panko Brashnar, a great Macedonian revolutionary. At its regular assembly on May 2009, Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MANU) elected Boskov as one of its new members. In 2010, National Gallery of Macedonia, Skopje hosted an exhibition with more than 150 of his sculptures, many of which had not been seen by the public. Accomplishments He is an honorary member of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts and is considered to hold a prominent place in the development and avant-garde changes in the artistic thought in Macedonian modern art.

It plays a key role in modulating amino acid metabolism as a response to nutrient deprivation.  Introduction  GCN2 is the only known eukaryotic initiation factor 2Œ± kinase (eIF2Œ±) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It inactivates eIF2Œ± by phosphorylation at Serine 51 under conditions of amino acid deprivation, resulting in repression of general protein synthesis whilst allowing selected mRNA such as GCN4 to be translated due to regions upstream of the coding sequence. Elevated levels of GCN4 stimulate the expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes, which code for enzymes required to synthesize all 20 major amino acids.  Structure  Protein kinase GCN2 is a multidomain protein and its C-terminus contains a region homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) next to the kinase catalytic moiety. This HisRS-like region forms a dimer and dimerization is required for GCN2 function. The crucial contribution to GCN2 function is the promotion of tRNA binding and the stimulation of the kinase domain via physical interaction. Binding of uncharged tRNA to this synthetase-like domain induces a conformational change in which the GCN2 domains rotate 180¬∞ normal to the dimerization surface and thereby transpose from their antiparallel to a parallel orientation. Subsequently, the autoinhibited form of GCN2 is activated. GCN2 autoinhibition results from a conformation that restricts ATP binding. ATP binding induces autophosphorylation of an activation loop which leads to maximal GCN2 kinase activity.  Function = Regulation of translation  Figure 1:Overview over the functions of GCN2. (GCN1/GCN20=GCN1p/GCN20p binding site; PsiKD = unknown function; KD = Kinase Domain; HisRS = histidyl-tRNA synthetase) Adapted from GCN2 inhibits general translation by phosphorylation of eIF-2Œ± at serine 51 within 15 min of amino acid deprivation, which then subsequently increases the affinity for the guanine exchange factor eIF2B to sequester eIF-2Œ± leading to reduced formation of the ternary complex (TC) consisting of eIF2, GTP and the initiator Met-tRNA required for translation initiation. eIF2 containing a phosphorylated alpha subunit shows an increased affinity for its only GEF, eIF2B, but eIF2B is only able to exchange GDP with GTP from unphosphorylated eIF2. So the recycling of eIF2, needed for TC formation, is inhibited by phosphorylation of eIF-2Œ±, which in the end leads to a reduction of global translation rates. An opposing effect of the reduced availability of TC is the induction of GCN4 expression by translational regulation. Four short ORF's exist in the leader of the GCN4 mRNA. 40S Ribosomal Subunits scanning the mRNA from 5' have TC bound and translate the first upstream open reading frame (uORF). Under non-starving condition there is enough ternary complex that the subunits rebind it before they reach uORF 4. Translation is again initiated, uORF2,3 or 4 translated and the 40S Subunits subsequently dissociate from GCN4 mRNA. Under starving conditions there is less TC present. Some of the 40S Subunits are not able to rebind TC before they reach uORF 4 but eventually rebind TC before reaching GCN4 coding sequence. Therefore, the reduction in TC formation resulting from GCN2 activation by amino acid starvation leads to the induction of GCN4 translation. GCN4 is the primary regulator in response to amino acid starvation, termed general amino acid control (GAAC). It acts as a transcription factor and activates several genes required for amino acid synthesis. Recently GCN2 has also been implicated in directing eating behavior in mammals by phosphorylating eIF-2Œ± in the anterior Piriform cortex (APC) of the brain. The molecular mechanisms governing this function are not yet known, but a basic zipper transcription factor called ATF4 is a possible candidate. ATF4 is related to GCN4.  Cell cycle control  GCN2 also regulates the cell cycle by delaying entry into S phase upon ultraviolet (UV) radiation and exposure to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Thereby the cell prevents passing the G1 checkpoint and starting DNA replication when the DNA is damaged. It has been hypothesized, that UV induces nitric oxide synthase activation and NO. production, which leads to the activation of GCN2 and that the cell cycle regulation by GCN2 is independent of eIF2Œ± phosphorylation. Although the causal relationship between GCN2 and cell cycle delay is still under debate, it was suggested that the formation of the pre-replication complex is deferred by GCN2 upon UV-irradiation.  Lipid metabolism  The absence of essential amino acids causes a downregulation of key components of the lipid synthesis such as the fatty acid synthase. Following leucine-deprivation in mammals, GCN2 decreases the expression of lipogenic genes via SREBP-1c. SREBP-1c actions upon genes regulating fatty- acid and triglyceride synthesis and is reduced by leucine deprivation in the liver in a GCN2-dependent manner.  Regulation  In amino acid replete cells, GCN2 is kept inactive via phosphorylation at serine 577, which is thought to depend on the activity of TORC1. Inactivation of TORC1 by Rapamycin affects GCN2 and at least partly by dephosphorylation of serine 577. This leads to activation of GCN2 even in amino acid replete cells, probably by increasing the affinity of GCN2 for uncharged tRNA, so that even basal levels permit tRNA binding. A second stimulatory input to GCN2 is exerted by a complex of GCN1/GCN20. GCN1/GCN20 shows structural similarity to eEF3, a factor important in the binding of tRNA to ribosomes. The GCN1/GCN20 complex physically interacts with GCN2 by binding to its N-terminus. It is thought that GCN1/GCN20 facilitates the transfer of tRNA from the ribosomal A site to the HisRS-like domain of GCN2. A third way of regulation of this protein is through the conserved protein IMPACT, that acts both in yeast, nematodes and mammals as an inhibitor of GCN2.  Homologues  There are also GCN2 homologues in Neurospora crassa, C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and mice. Thus, GCN2 may be the most widespread and founding member of the eIF-2Œ± kinase subfamily.

Longford was a major director of the silent film era of the Australian cinema. He formed a production team with Lottie Lyell. His contributions to Australian cinema with his ongoing collaborations with Lyell, including The Sentimental Bloke (1919) and The Blue Mountains Mystery (1921), prompted the Australian Film Institute's AFI Raymond Longford Award, inducted in 1968, named in his honour. Biography John Walter Hollis Longford was born in Hawthorn, a suburb of Melbourne, the son of John Walter Longford, a civil servant originally from Sydney, and his English wife, Charlotte Maria. His family soon started referring to him as \\"Ray\\". By 1880 they briefly moved to Paynesville, then went to Sydney when Longford's father became a warder at Darlinghurst Gaol. Longford became a sailor and spent his early life at sea. He started acting on the stage in India under the name Raymond Hollis Longford. In the early 1900s he toured Australia and New Zealand with Edwin Geach's Popular Dramatic Organisation, and Clarke and Meynell companies. He was a stage manager for the Liliam Meyers Dramatic Company. Longford often appeared alongside a young actress called Lottie Lyell, who would become Longford's key creative partner. He was an early member of the Australian actors union, a forerunner to Actors Equity. Film career In 1907 Longford worked on a film produced by Charles Cozens Spencer about the fight between Tommy Burns and Jack Johnson, probably the first movie Longford was involved in. He then began appearing in movies for Spencer as an actor under the direction of Alfred Rolfe such as Captain Midnight, the Bush King (1911).Wasson, Mervyn J., 'Longford, Raymond John Walter Hollis (1878‚Äì1959)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University accessed 6 February 2012.\\"Raymond Longford\\", Cinema Papers, January 1974 p51 Move into directing Rolfe eventually left Spencer's company to make films elsewhere so in 1911 Spencer hired Longford to direct his first feature, The Fatal Wedding, adapted from a play in which Longford had appeared on stage and starring Lyell. Made quickly, with a limited budget and small crew, it was a major financial success and launched his career behind the camera. Longford followed this up with several other play adaptations for Spencer including The Romantic Story of Margaret Catchpole (1911), Sweet Nell of Old Drury and The Midnight Wedding (1912); Longford also wrote an original for the screen The Tide of Death. Lyell appeared in most of these and also made increasingly important contributions behind the scene as a writer, editor, producer and co-director. Freelancing Charles Cozens Spencer eventually withdrew from Australian film production due to the formation of \\"the Combine\\" (which absorbed Spencer's old company). This left Longford without his main backer and he found it increasingly difficult to secure funding for a time. He went to work for the Fraser Film Release and Photographic Company for who he made a feature and a number of shorts, however they eventually ended the contract after Longford became involved in a lawsuit following the making of the highly popular The Silence of Dean Maitland (1914). Longford had an operation in March 1915. Download He made another number of shorts for a variety of companies and taught film acting. He then made two films in New Zealand and also became embroiled in another legal battle over The Church and the Woman (1917). In September 1916 he worked for Crick and Jones preparing scenarios. Career peak: The Sentimental Bloke Longford's career revived towards the end of World War I when he helped establish the Southern Cross Feature Film Company in South Australia. He enjoyed a large box office success with The Woman Suffers (1918) (despite the film being banned in New South Wales) which enabled him to get finance for an adaptation of the poetry of C. J. Dennis, The Sentimental Bloke (1919). This was an enormous critical and popular success, and is regarded as one of the greatest Australian films of all time. Longford followed it with another hit, On Our Selection (1920), from the stories of Steele Rudd. The popularity of these two movies saw Longford move away from melodramatic convention to more realistic treatment of subject matter.Graham Shirley and Brian Adams, Australian Cinema: The First Eighty Years, Currency Press 1989 p 32 He said around this time: > You see, one might say that three parts of your picture audience is composed > of women, and women, above everything else, are impressionists. It is the > human, and not the spectacular side of a film that captures their attention > and win their sympathy and admiration. A man coming out of a picture show > will be heard to remark to his mate: ‚Äús‚Äôwonderful the way they get these > things up, ain‚Äôt it, nowadays.' He has been looking at oit in a speculative > light, but not so the woman. She says nothing, but she wipes the tears from > her eyes, tears of real sympathy, indicative of pure appreciation, and for > days thereafter, thinks, not of the construction of the plot, nor its > cleverness, but of the varied experiences and emotions through which the > hero and heroine have passed. Both Bloke and Selection led to well-received sequels which were also directed by Longford. He and Lyell had another hit with The Blue Mountains Murder Mystery. Decline As the 1920s went on, Longford again found difficulties securing finance and/or distribution for his films. He and Lyell formed a company and he made some for Australasian Films but the collaboration was not a successful one. In October 1925 Longford was appointed producer of Master Pictures. In 1925 Lottie Lyell died of tuberculosis and Longford's career never recovered. In 1926 it was announced Longford would serve on the board of the film company Phillips Film Productions Ltd, but little seems to have come of this. He gave evidence at the 1928 Royal Commission on the Moving Picture Industry in Australia where he urged the introduction of a quota for local movies and complained about the influence of the Combine of Australasian Films and Union Theatres on local production. Longford appeared in bankruptcy court in 1929 but managed to tour Europe the following year, spending 18 months touring various filmmaking facilities. \\"Naturally the talkies have revolutionised everything\\", he said. \\"And to some extent I now feel as if I am returning to my original occupation ‚Äî the talking stage.\\" He returned to Australia in February 1930 and told Gayne Dexter that : > For years and years I fought for the English industry. For years and years I > battled and agitated against the Americans. But now, after seeing the > English film men at work, I am sorry to say that I backed the wrong side. It > was only through the kindness of the American executives in London ‚Äî the > very men against whom I had fought ‚Äî that I was able to visit studios and > get an insight into production conditions. I am convinced that it is > impossible for anybody to teach England to make pictures: the producers > don't want to learn: the English distributors don't want Australian films: > and if we ever get a market there, our productions will have to be through > Australian channels. That has already been demonstrated by the fact that > English distributors have not accepted a single Australian film, even under > the quota laws, whereas the American distributors operating in the British > Isles have taken eight or ten ‚Äî and paid cash for them! Longford said UFA were the most advanced studio he saw. Sound era On his return to Australia Lonford sought financing for a film about the Australia Light Horse in World War I, Desert Legion, with a budget of ¬£50,000. He was unable to secure this and started lobbying for a quota for local films. In the early 1930s Longford worked steadily as an actor and assistant director on such films as Diggers in Blighty. He assisted Beaumont Smith with the direction of The Hayseeds (1933) and Splendid Fellows (1934) (according to contemporary reports he directed The Hayseeds). He managed to direct another feature, The Man They Could Not Hang (1934) ‚Äì although he missed the premiere due to illness which required hospitalization. That year he was elected head of the New South Wales Talking Picture Producers Association with the aim of promoting a quota for Australian films. Mastercraft In 1935 he established Mastercraft Film Corporation Ltd to take advantage of the 1935 NSW Quota Act but the hoped for boom in production did not eventuate and Matercraft never received the subscribers they needed to become viable and made no movies. The company was eventually bought out Stuart F. Doyle.http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/variety121-1936-01_0246 In 1939 Longford sued some Mastercraft executives for libel and settled out of court. Later years Longford managed to stay employed in the film industry during the 1930s but found this impossible with the advent of World War II, which brought local production to an almost complete halt. During the war he was a clerk for the U.S. military stationed in Australia, then he became a tally man and night watchman on the Sydney wharfs. In October 1950 Longford was profiled by Ernest Harrison for AM magazine, then in 1955 a complete 35 mm print of The Sentimental Bloke was discovered and screened at the Sydney and Melbourne Film Festivals, bringing renewed attention to Longford.Phillip Dutchak, \\"Raymond Hollis Longford\\", Cinema Papers, March 1991 p25-31 He died on 2 April 1959 at the age of 80. Personal life Longford married Melena Louisa Keen at St Luke's Anglican Church, Concord, Sydney, on 5 February 1900. They had one child, a son, Victor Hollis Longford. Longford and Melena later separated and he started a relationship with Lottie Lyell, but could not marry her because Melena refused to divorce him until 1926, the year after Lyell died. Melina was influenced by her father, William Henry Keen, who did not approve of divorce. William Keen died in 1922. In 1933, Longford married for a second time, to Emilie Elizabeth Anschutz. He is buried at Macquarie Park cemetery, North Ryde, NSW, Australia alongside Lottie Lyell.

The Thunderbirds franchise was formed to fill a vacancy for Dubuque hockey fans after the original Dubuque Fighting Saints of the United States Hockey League relocated operations to Tulsa, Oklahoma as the Tulsa Crude. The Dubuque Thunderbirds were a locally owned franchise that played in the Minnesota Junior Hockey League and the Central States Hockey League. The Thunderbirds played for 9 seasons in the Dubuque Five Flags Civic Center arena, often averaging crowds of between 1600 and 2400, which far surpassed all of the teams in both leagues. After the departure of the Fighting Saints, it took only a few short weeks for the upstart Thunderbirds to start finding success, which would follow the franchise its entire existence; winning 4 league playoff titles, twice finishing as league playoff runner-up, and 7 invitations to the USA Junior Hockey National Tournament.

In 2007, the entire CSHL was promoted to Junior A status. During their four years in the CSHL, the Dubuque Thunderbirds shattered individual franchise attendance records for the league, often recording close to four times the number of fans at home games than the second highest team. Because of their success on the ice and getting fans into the seats, the CSHL twice awarded the city of Dubuque the opportunity to host the entire Hurster Cup playoff tournament (2008 & 2009), with local hockey fans filling the seats to support teams throughout the tournaments in games that did not even feature the home team. The Thunderbirds were incredibly successful in the CSHL. They compiled a 151-26-4-5 record, which would be the best in the league during their tenure, winning the Hurster Cup Playoff Championship three times in four years, and receiving four consecutive invites to the USA Junior National Tournament. 2006-07 (34-6-3-2) 2nd place in CSHL * Home Attendance - 24,913 (13 other CSHL teams combined 39,208) 2007 Hurster Cup Playoff Champions USA Jr. B National Tournament Qualifier 2007-08 (43-3-1-1) 1st Place in CSHL * Home Attendance - 32,960 (12 other CSHL teams combined 48,323) 2008 Hurster Cup Champions USA Jr. A National Tournament Qualifier 2008-09 (36-8-0-1) 3rd place in CSHL * Home Attendance - 32,082 (11 other CSHL teams combined 43,488) 2009 Hurster Cup Champions USA Jr. A National Tournament Qualifier 2009-10 (38-9-0-1) 2nd place in CSHL * Home Attendance - 32,962 (12 other CSHL teams combined 42,518) 2010 Hurster Cup Runner-up USA Jr. A National Tournament Qualifier  Return of the Dubuque Fighting Saints  During the 2009-10 season, with a new 3,000+ seat ice arena in Dubuque under construction, it was announced that the Thunderbirds ownership group would dissolve the Dubuque Thunderbirds hockey franchise as they added several key partners to form a new ownership group, Northern Lights Hockey Foundation, in a bid to get a USHL expansion team.

In June 1889, The Sporting Life praised Broughton's work with St. Paul's pitchers: \\"People have got so used to seeing Cal Broughton catch game after game without a skip that his fine work is often lost sight of. Where, oh where would some of St. Paul's pitchers be now if they hadn't had Cal's 'head' back of the plate?\\" The Saint Paul Daily Globe in 1889 said of Broughton: \\"Broughton is a great coach for a young pitcher, and it takes a pretty fleet-footed runner to steal second base on him. He refuses to get rattled under any circumstances, and is always a prince of good humor.\\" Years later, the Globe wrote that Broughton had been \\"as good a catcher as the league had.\\"(available through the Library of Congress Chronicling America database) Broughton also began the 1890 season playing for the Apostles. Seattle Late in the 1890 season, Broughton traveled to the west coast where he appeared in 16 games for the Seattle Hustlers of the Pacific Northwest League. Broughton played third base for Seattle, leading The Sporting Life to write that it \\"looks rather funny to see Cal Broughton playing any position except behind the bat, but he is putting up great third base play.\\" The Seattle club finished in third place, but reportedly \\"made a remarkable showing since the addition of Broughton.\\" Final seasons He returned to the St. Paul Apostles later in the 1890 season. Broughton concluded his professional baseball career playing for the Lowell, Massachusetts team in the New England League in 1891. Family and later years Broughton was married in 1881 to Harriet Chase. After leaving major league baseball, Brougton lived in Evansville, Wisconsin, where he purchased a billiard parlor in 1895. In April 1899, he was elected chief of police in Evansville, a position that he held for 17 years. In 1900, he was in a gunfight with train robbers. Broughton and his assistant Chief of Police captured the robbers, only to have them escape from the jail. Broughton's posse found two of the robbers hiding in a corn field, and the third was captured several days later. Thirteen years later, he captured Evansville's first automobile thieves. In 1917, Broughton stepped down as chief of police and went to work for the D. E. Wood Butter Company. He returned to the Evansville police department in 1927 as the assistant chief. He remained with the police department until 1933 when, at age 72, he became an invalid. Broughton died in Evansville in 1939 and was interred at Maple Hill Cemetery there.

It was built in the 1st century BC as an aristocratic town house (domus) within the Roman city of Melite. In the 11th century, a Muslim cemetery was established on the remains of the domus. The site was discovered in 1881, and archaeological excavations revealed several well preserved Roman mosaics, statues and other artifacts, as well as a number of tombstones and other remains from the cemetery. Since 1882, the site has been open to the public as a museum, which is currently run by Heritage Malta. It was erroneously called the Roman Villa when rediscovered as it was thought to be outside the city of Melite but on further examinations it was clarified to be within city limits. History and description=Roman house The mosaic of the peristyle The Domvs Romana is believed to have been built in the beginning of the 1st century BC, and it remained in use until the 2nd century AD. The house had a colonnaded peristyle inspired by ancient Greek architecture, and its best features are the well- made polychrome Hellenistic style mosaics found in the peristyle and the surrounding rooms, which show decorative motifs or mythological scenes. Two types of tesserae were employed: opus vermiculatum, in the centre of the pavement; opus tessellatum, larger tesserae to create three-dimensional designs all around the main image. The picture sought to imitate a highly popular motif which may be first painted by an artist from Sophos. The domus also shows fine painted wall plaster imitating coloured marbles and showing partly stylized architectural elements which would place them somewhere between the 1st and 2nd Pompeian Styles. Although the house was mostly destroyed over time, its mosaics have survived largely intact, and they are comparable with those found at Pompeii or Sicily. A number of 1st century AD statues of the imperial Roman family, along with coins, glassware, tableware, bath accessories, amphorae and other fine artifacts have also been found in the domus. Muslim cemetery Sarcophagus and limestone tombstones from the Muslim cemetery, now exhibited in the museum In the 11th century, while Malta was part of the Fatimid Caliphate, the site of the domus was converted into a cemetery. At least 245 burials were discovered during the excavations, which also unearthed a number of limestone (and one marble) tombstones with Naskh or Kufic inscriptions. Some ceramics and a silver ring were also found during the excavations. Discovery and excavations The Domvs Romana was discovered accidentally in 1881 by workers during a landscaping project. It was subsequently excavated by the leading archaeologists of the time, including Antonio Annetto Caruana, Sir Themistocles Zammit, Robert V. Galea, Harris Dunscombe Colt and Louis Upton Way. Museum The Domvs Romana museum After the domus was first excavated, a museum was built on the site of the peristyle of the house in order to preserve its mosaics. The museum opened in February 1882, and it was the first building in Malta that was constructed specifically to house a museum of a particular archaeological site. The museum was originally known as the Museum of Roman Antiquities, and apart from the mosaics and other Roman or Muslim artifacts uncovered from the domus, it also exhibited some other Roman marble pieces which were found in the streets of Mdina. Eventually, many Roman artifacts found elsewhere in Malta were transferred to this museum. In 1922, the museum was enlarged to designs by the architect Galizia, and a neoclassical fa√ßade and a large display room were added. The remains of the domus were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The museum closed during World War II, and it housed a restoration centre before reopening to the public in 1945. The mosaic of the peristyle was restored in the second half of the 20th century, but was unintentionally damaged in the process. Currently, Heritage Malta is carrying out a report on how to conserve the mosaic and repair it with as little damage as possible. The displays of the museum were renovated between 2002 and 2005, and again in 2011.

It belonged to the Atikamekw First Nation of Wemotaci but had no permanent population in recent decades. The reserve was an enclave within the City of La Tuque, approximately north-west of La Tuque's town centre, but it was dissolved on January 2, 2010, and added to the city. History In 1806, explorer Jean- Baptiste Perrault reported on \\"the small K√¥uk√¥ukache River that flows by a rocky mountain where there are 11 portages to get to the Grand K√¥uk√¥ukache.\\" This name came from the word k√¥k√¥kachi, meaning \\"owl\\". It was also the name of the former Coucoucache Lake, where the Hudson's Bay Company had maintained a trading post, called Coocoocache, since at least 1823 (closed circa 1913). Coucoucache Lake, part of a chain of lakes on the Saint-Maurice River, may have been named after a small mountain in the shape of an owl that was situated at the eastern end of the lake. However, legend has it that a fight developed between the Atikamekw and the Iroquois at this lake, and when the Atikamekw imitated an owl's cry, they sprung on the Iroquois and massacred them. Plan of the Indian Reserve at Coocoocache on the Saint Maurice River In 1851, the Government enacted the allotment of of land as reserves for the use and benefit of the \\"Indian\\" tribes residing in Lower Canada. Two years later, these lands were distributed among the Atikamekw, Algonquins, and Abenakis by John Rolph, Commissioner of Crown Lands. On August 9, 1853, the reserves, including Coucoucache, were approved by the Governor General in Council. In 1895, the original Coucoucache Reserve was surveyed and covered 380 acres (1.54 km2).Natural Resources Canada - Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review - Coucoucache In 1932, the Rapide-Blanc Dam was constructed, leading to the formation of the Reservoir Blanc that inundated Coucoucache Lake and Reserve. The new Coucoucache Reserve on the north shore of the reservoir replaced the old one but was only 12 acres (0.05 km2) in size. For the loss of land, the Shawinigan Water & Power Company paid the Canadian government the amount of $380.

Magnus of Livonia besieged the town in August 1577, but was deposed and replaced by Russian forces under Tsar Ivan IV, who eventually sacked the town and castle in what became a symbolic victory. Polish forces, however, re-captured the stronghold in November and beat back a Russian counter-attack in February 1578. In October 1578, the Russian army again laid siege to the town, but was destroyed by a smaller Swedish‚ÄìGerman‚ÄìPolish relief force. This marked the turning point in the Livonian War, shifting the initiative from the Tsardom of Russia to Sweden and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. It also marked the end of the Kingdom of Livonia, which collapsed when Magnus retired to Courland. Background In 1570 and 1571, Ivan IV \\"the Terrible\\" of Russia faced internal disputes, culminating in the slaughter of Novgorod's inhabitantsFrost (2000), p. 27 and the burning of Moscow by the Crimean tartars.Peterson (2007), p. 91 Yet, he was able to recover and resume his campaigns in the Livonian War in 1572. A Swedish counter-offensive in 1574 failed.Peterson (2007), p. 93 Ivan IV had introduced a new strategy, relying on tens of thousands of his troops, Cossacks, and tartars to achieve superiority over his adversaries. Unlike the latter, he used a large number of native troops instead of a few thousand professional mercenaries. Swedish forces were besieged in Reval (Tallinn), Danish Estonia was raided, and so was central Livonia as far as D√ºnaburg (Daugavpils), since 1561 formally under Polish-Lithuanian suzerainty. The conquered territories submitted to Ivan or his vassal, Duke Magnus of the House of Oldenburg, who was declared as king of Livonia in 1570. The year 1576 marked the height of Ivan's campaign, and another 30,000 Russian forces crossed into Livonia in 1577. Magnus had fallen into disgrace when he defected from Ivan IV during the same year,Oakley (1992), p. 37 and started to subordinate castles without consulting the tsar. When Kokenhusen (Koknese) submitted to Magnus in the hope of avoiding Ivan IV's army, the tsar sacked it and executed its German commanders. The campaign then focussed on Wenden (Cƒìsis, V√µnnu), \\"the heart of Livonia\\", which as the former capital of the Livonian Order was not only of strategic importance but also a symbol for Livonia itself. 1577 Ivan IV of Russia In the summer of 1577, Magnus of Livonia laid siege to Wenden.Frost (2000), p. 28 The Russian army under Ivan IV appeared before Wenden's walls in late August. Ivan had Magnus arrested, sacked the town, and laid siege to the castle. The last 300 defenders, men, women, and children retreated to the castle's main tower and either died in an accidental explosion of gunpowder stored in the towerNolan C. J. The Age of Wars of Religion, 1000-1650: An Encyclopedia of Global Warfare and Civilization, Volume 2. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2006. P. 640 or committed collective suicide by blowing themselves up with of gunpowder, probably because the garrison had been \\"promised a terrible fate\\" by the tsar in response to them having fired at him with cannons.Allegedly responsible for the blast was the Livonian noble Hinrik (Heinrich) Boismann. Thus, Wenden fell to Ivan in September, and was made a seat of four newly appointed voivodes who were to administer the province for Russia.Angermann (1972), p. 29 The sack of Wenden was a huge symbolic victory for Ivan.Peterson (2007), p. 94 Among his opponents in the Livonian War, John III of Sweden only controlled Reval (Tallinn), Stephen B√°thory of Poland only held Riga, Frederick II of Denmark was limited to the island of √òsel (√ñsel, Saaremaa), Magnus of Livonia, though released by Ivan, abdicated in 1578 and withdrew to Piltene in Courland. Ivan's control of nearly all of Livonia and Estonia was secured by garrisons numbering 22,000 men in total. John III of Sweden 1578 John III and Stephen B√°thory formed an alliance against Ivan IV in December 1577, after B√°thory had concluded the Danzig War. Already in November, Lithuanian forces had started an offensive from the south and captured D√ºnaburg (Daugavpils). A Polish‚ÄìSwedish force took the town and castle of Wenden in early 1578. Russian forces tried to re-take the town in February, but failed. A subsequent Swedish offensive, targeted Leal (Lihula), Lode (Koluvere), Hapsal (Haapsalu), Pernau (P√§rnu), Dorpat (Tartu), and Novgorod. In September, Ivan responded by sending in an army, which the Livonian Chronicle claimed to be 18,000 strong, who re- captured Oberpahlen (P√µltsamaa) from Sweden and then marched on Wenden. Battle Stephen B√°thory of Poland Upon their arrival at Wenden, the Russian army laid siege to the town. Soon the Russian artillery breached the wall,Filjushkin A.

P. 204 but then an allied relief force consisting of 5,500 to 6,000 German, Lithuanian, Polish, Transylvanian, Bohemian, Romanian, and Swedish soldiers confronted the Russians on 21 October.Roberts (1986), p. 263 The right flank (around 2,000 cavalry) was commanded by Andrzej Sapieha, while the left flank consisted of Swedish forces (2,000 infantry) commanded by G√∂ran Boye. First, the Russian cavalry was defeated and driven off in open field, with the Tatar cavalrymen being the first to retreat, then the Russian infantry, still entrenched for the siege, was defeated or taken prisoner.

The captured cannons were taken by the Lithuanians and paraded through Vilnius, contrary to the Swedish wishes and the agreements between the allies prior to the battle. The battle was unusual insofar as only a few battles of the Livonian War were fought in the open field; usually, one of the parties took a defensive position in a fortress, while the opposing party laid siege.Peterson (2007), p. 95 Furthermore, Wenden was to remain the only occasion of a Swedish‚ÄìPolish‚ÄìLithuanian collaboration in battle, as the alliance fell apart in the following years.Roberts (1986), p. 264 The allied victory marked the turning point of the Livonian War Ivan IV was for the first time seriously defeated in Livonia.

It is an active Anglican church in the deanery of Derwent, the archdeaconry of West Cumberland, and the diocese of Carlisle. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The church dates from the early 12th century, with extensions later in that century and in the 13th century, alterations in the 15th and 17th centuries, and restorations in 1882 and 1913. It is thought that some of the stone used in the building came from the Roman fort at Old Carlisle. The architect carrying out the 1913 restoration said that he found \\"distinct traces of a Saxon building\\". Architecture=Structure The church is built in sandstone with a roof of green slate. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with north and south aisles and a north transept and a south porch, and a three-bay chancel. At the west end is an open bellcote. Within the porch is a blocked doorway, the present door having a Tudor-style surround. In the west wall is another blocked doorway, over which is a two- light window dating from the 15th century. Much of the architecture is Norman in style. The Norman features include round-headed windows in the north wall of the chancel, with similar, but blocked, windows in the south and east walls; the south doorway; and, inside the church, the arcades and the chancel arch. The chancel arch is carved with demon-like figures on the north side, and human and animals on the south side. In the south porch is a medieval gravestone; other similar gravestones have been used as lintels for the west window and for blocking the west door. The south aisle has a battlemented parapet. The ceiling of the nave was given to the church in 1689 by Thomas, the brother of the essayist Joseph Addison, and is thought to have come from the hall of a London Livery Company; it is painted with cupids and garlands. The north transept has an open timber roof dated 1614. The panelled ceiling in the chancel dates from the 19th or 20th century. Fittings and furniture The font has a carved Norman bowl on a later stem. In the south wall is a recess which probably formerly contained a medieval effigy that is now in the south aisle. In the east wall is an aumbry, and a piscina with a motif of the sun. Piscina from mithran temple thought to be close by & has bulls head The pulpit is simple and Jacobean in style. Several carving reference knights templar origins The panelled choir stalls date from 1882, while all the other furnishings are 20th-century. The stained glass includes windows by Clayton and Bell.

Historical background: Bavarian occupation of Tyrol since 1805  Der Landsturm anno 1809 by Joseph Anton Koch, c. 1820 In September 1805 the Electorate of Bavaria under Prince-elector Maximilian I Joseph of Wittelsbach, that had been allied with the Habsburg Monarchy under the common federally structured Holy Roman Empire, went over to Napoleonic France: the Bavarian Minister Count Maximilian von Montgelas, realizing the French superiority while fearing the ambitions of the newly established Austrian Empire, signed a secret defence alliance at Bogenhausen. At the end of the War of the Third Coalition shortly afterwards, Bavaria found itself on the victorious side. Upon the 1805 Peace of Pressburg it not only was elevated to a kingdom, it also gained French-occupied Tyrol, which since 1363 had been held by the Austrian Habsburgs, who, heavily defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz, were forced to renounce it. The French officially handed over the Tyrolean county including the secularized Bishopric of Trent (Trentino) to Bavaria on February 11, 1806. Tyrolean districts, 1808 In its policies, the Bavarian government under Count Montgelas angered the Tyrolean population by raising taxes there, but at the same time barring exports, e.g. of cattle, from Tyrol into Bavaria. Furthermore, the state mingled into the affairs of the church in Tyrol, banning traditional rural holidays, the ringing of church bells, processions etc. which were a vital part of Tyrolean culture. Additionally, on May 1, 1808, the County of Tyrol was disestablished and administratively split up into the three districts of Inn, Eisack and Etsch. The new Bavarian constitution also replaced the old Tyrolean constitution that had given privileges to the population, such as not having to fight in a foreign army and outside the Tyrolean borders. Conscription was thus introduced in Tyrol and Tyroleans called into Bavarian military service, which led to open revolt.  The war of the Fifth Coalition and outbreak and course of the rebellion  The Siege of the Kufstein Fortress The trigger for the outbreak of the uprising was the flight to Innsbruck of young men that were due to be called into the Bavarian army by the authorities at Axams on March 12 and 13, 1809. The partisans stayed in contact with the Austrian court in Vienna by their conduit Baron Joseph Hormayr, an Innsbruck-born Hofrat and close friend of Archduke John of Austria. The Austrian Empire, citing a breach of the conditions agreed in the Peace of Pressburg guaranteeing Tyrolean constitutional autonomy, declared war on the Bavarian-French allies on April 9, 1809. Archduke John explicitly stated that Bavaria had forfeit all rights to Tyrol, which rightfully belonged with the Austrian lands, and therefore any resistance against Bavarian occupation would be legitimate. An Austrian corps under General Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles operating from Carinthia occupied Lienz and marched against Innsbruck, but was defeated by Bavarian troops led by French Marshal Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre near W√∂rgl on 13 May. Meanwhile, an irregular army led by the innkeeper Andreas Hofer upon the war message had gathered around Sterzing and marched north towards the Brenner Pass. In the First and Second Battle of Bergisel near Innsbruck on April 12 and 25 May, the peasant troops clashed with the Bavarians, who were forced to retreat. The Tyroleans celebrated the news that Napoleon had suffered his first defeat at the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 22 May. Nevertheless, after the French again gained the upper hand at the Battle of Wagram on July 5/6, Archduke Charles of Austria signed the Armistice of Znaim whereafter the Austrian forces withdraw from Tyrol. Thus, the rebels, who had their strongholds in Southern Tyrol, were left fighting alone. They however were able to inflict several defeats to the French and Bavarians forces under Marshal Lefebvre in July, culminating in a complete French retreat after the Third Battle of Bergisel on August 12/13. Hofer now took over the administration of the unoccupied territories at Innsbruck; large parts of Tyrol enjoyed a brief period of independence. However, in the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn of October 14, the peace treaty ending the War of the Fifth Coalition, Emperor Francis I of Austria officially gave up any claims to Tyrol. Napoleon ordered the re-conquest of the province the same day. A combination of French military force under the new command of General Jean- Baptiste Drouet and diplomatic de-escalation measures by the rather pro- Tyrolean and anti-Napoleonic Bavarian commander, Prince Ludwig I, was successful in decreasing the numbers of rebel troops that were ready to fight to the death. Those last loyal troops were defeated at the Fourth Battle of Bergisel on November 1, that effectively crushed the rebellion despite minor rebel victories later in November.  Aftermath and execution of Andreas Hofer  The shooting of Andreas Hofer in Mantua, 1810 Many of the rebels were executed by the French and Bavarian forces in the following weeks. The leader Andreas Hofer fled into the mountains and hid at several places in South Tyrol. He was betrayed by a Tyrolean peasant to the French near St Martin in Passeier on January 28, 1810. Hofer was arrested and brought to Mantua, where Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, the French viceroy of Italy, first wanted to pardon him, but was overruled by his stepfather Napoleon. The death penalty was issued on February 19 and executed the next day. Hofer's mortal remains were buried at the Innsbruck Hofkirche in 1823. In consequence of the insurrection, Bavaria pressured by the French on February 28, 1810 had to cede large parts of Southern Tyrol with the Trentino to Italy and the eastern Hochpustertal with Lienz to the Illyrian Provinces. Upon Napoleon's fall in 1814 and the Congress of Vienna, all parts of Tyrol were re-united under Austrian rule. With the rise of nationalism in the 19th century, the tragic fate of the rebellion and of Andreas Hofer became a national myth especially for the German speaking Tyroleans. The song Zu Mantua in Banden deals with the death of Hofer and his vain resistance against the \\"foreign\\" occupants. It became the anthem of the Austrian State of Tyrol in 1948. Hofer's life and death was the model for the 1923 film Der Rebell by Luis Trenker.

A nurseryman by profession, he had large landholdings in Christchurch. His reputation was dented by a fraud conviction, and when he was subsequently elected onto the city council once more, five councillors resigned in protest. Early life Wilson was born in Castle Douglas in Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland. He was the eldest child of Jane Thomson and her husband, William Wilson. He arrived in New Zealand in August 1850 at Port Chalmers on the ship Mariner, and travelled to Nelson, Wellington and Auckland before arriving in Lyttelton in late July 1851. The Mariner left London on 7 April 1850 and arrived at Port Chalmers on 6 August 1850. He married Elizabeth Williams on 19 November 1856; she was 20 at the time of their wedding, 17 years his junior. His wife was the daughter of John Williams, who arrived in Lyttelton with his family in December 1850 on one of the First Four Ships, the Randolph. John Williams was found dead four days after arrival, having possibly died from heat exhaustion. Her mother Isabella worked as a draper and had a shop on Colombo Street, Christchurch. The Wilsons had 13 or 14 children, and Isabella Williams would later testify that he began beating her by the time she was pregnant the second time: \\"He beat me black and blue.\\" Their oldest son was William John (born ca. 1856), and their second son was Charles James.see photo of headstones in the commons category Professional life In Scotland, Wilson was an apprentice as a nurseryman and worked as an overseer on estates. His first nursery in New Zealand, Bricks Farm, was next to The Bricks , a locality on the Avon River in central Christchurch. Wilson lived at The Bricks for his first five years in Christchurch. Next, he owned the block of land bounded by Cashel, Madras, Lichfield and Manchester streets; this was later known as Bedford Row and is its name to the present day. He bought up land in sought after areas for his nurseries and then operated them until the land became too valuable, and he subdivided it for development. At its maximum, he held 18 acres in the central city. He specialised in shelter plants and hedges and became the dominant nurseryman in Christchurch. He was one of the first in New Zealand to publish product catalogues. He later held land in the suburb of Waltham. Apart from his extensive landholdings, he had a general trading company, a real estate and auctioneering business, a controlling stake in the Halswell quarries (purchased in 1876), and a half partnership in the trading vessel Rifleman. In 1876 Wilson was accused of fraud and as it was usual in those days, the court proceedings of well-known people were reported in fine detail in the newspapers. He lost the case on all counts and this brought to an end Wilson's public life, with him resigning from his various roles. Political career Wilson had an active political life. He was a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council on the 4th Council from June 1864 to May 1866, representing the Kaiapoi electorate despite being a Christchurch resident. He then represented the City of Christchurch electorate on the 5th Council from June 1866 to March 1870. Headstone for Wilson and his son William John in the Linwood cemetery Before 1916, elections for Christchurch City Council were held annually. He was elected onto the town and later city council four times: in 1862, 1867, 1868 and 1878. In 1867, he was nominated for a position on the city council by a current city councillor, the publican George Ruddenklau. In the subsequent council meeting, it was again Ruddenklau who nominated (or seconded; sources differ) Wilson as chairman of the town council, and he was declared elected without other nominations being put forward. The town council held a meeting on 10 June 1868 to elect its first mayor. In those days, the councillors elected one of their group as mayor, i.e. the position was not elected at large (by the voting public) as is the case today. The following councillors attended the meeting: William Wilson, James Purvis Jameson, T. Tombs, George Ruddenklau, Henry Thomson, W. A. Sheppard, W. Calvert and John Anderson, who chaired the meeting. Thomson moved that Wilson be elected as the first mayor of Christchurch, and Tombs seconded the motion. The chairman put the motion to the meeting and it was carried unanimously. With the meeting, the council had brought itself under the Municipal Corporations Act 1867. On 16 December 1868, the town council held its annual general meeting. Councillor Anderson was elected unanimously as the second mayor of Christchurch. Although Canterbury was an Anglican settlement, the first three mayors were all Presbyterian Scotsmen; Wilson in 1868, followed by John Anderson in 1869 and Andrew Duncan in 1870. Wilson stood for election to the city council once more in 1878, i.e. after his fraud conviction. At the candidates' meeting, Wilson argued with the current mayor, Henry Thomson, who acted as chairperson at the meeting, about the order of proceedings. Three positions were available contested by eight candidates, and James Gapes, Wilson, and Aaron Ayers were returned. Over the next day, five of the existing councillors handed in their resignation in protest over Wilson's election: William Pratt, William Radcliffe, George Ruddenklau, James Jameson, and Alexander William Bickerton. Radcliffe tried to withdraw his resignation, but this was not accepted by the mayor. Five new councillors were elected in a by-election the next month. Councillors were elected for one year at the time, and Wilson retired at the September 1879 election, when he did not stand again. Private life and death Wilson was involved with several clubs and societies. For many years, he chaired the Christchurch Horticultural Society. He was the first president of the Christchurch Poultry, Bantam & Pigeon Club. He was responsible for the construction of the first Town Hall in Christchurch's High Street. After he split from his wife, he tried to break into her house, but was stopped by Dr John Frankish, his brother-in-law. Wilson was arrested soon afterwards. Isabella Williams died in 1882. Wilson died on 8 November 1897. He was buried at Linwood Cemetery.

They may be initiated by the city or county or by petition of owners whose total holdings in the zone consist of a majority of the appraised property value. To get funding for a TIRZ area applicants have to follow three steps. Background With federal and state sources for redevelopment generally less available, local governments have been forced to find other ways to subsidize improvement projects in their localities, without directly raising taxes. One of the tools many states use to take up the slack by lack of federal and state funding is Tax Increment Financing (TIF), which is a public financing method used for redevelopment and community improvement projects for more than 50 years. Texas utilizes TIF by creating tax increment reinvestment zones (TIRZs) which may be initiated by the city or county or by petition of owners whose total holdings in the zone consist of a majority of the appraised property value.  Creation  There are 3 steps involved in the creation of a TIRZ: # Property owners possessing 50% or more of the appraised value of a district submit a petition to the county, city, or town requesting a TIRZ be set up, or the local government may decide to create one. A specific lifetime for the TIRZ is determined. A TIRZ may only be city-initiated if less than 10% of its land area consists of residential area. # For the purposes of existing tax-collecting entities (water districts, counties, etc.) the assessed values of properties within the new TIRZ are frozen. It is assumed that property values will increase over the lifetime of the TIRZ; the property taxes collected on this increase constitute the \\"increment\\". # Local taxing authorities besides the creating organization negotiate for how much of the tax increment they will donate to the fund instead of keeping for themselves. # The municipality or county passes an ordinance establishing a governing board for the TIRZ and the zone as a legal entity itself. The board then meets to create a budget for the lifetime of the zone, establishing what projects it will undertake and how they will be financed. This plan is passed as another ordinance.  Legal influences  A TIRZ may not simply be created without justification. In its current state, the area must have a deleterious effect on the economic future of the creating body. > [The area must] substantially arrest or impair the sound growth of the > municipality or county creating the zone, retard the provision of housing > accommodations, or constitute an economic or social liability and be a > menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare in its present > condition and use... However, this does not restrict the use of TIRZs to poor areas. Among the conditions justifying creation of a TIRZ is \\"the predominance of defective or inadequate sidewalk or street layout,\\" and wealthy areas may be included in a TIRZ; for example, Uptown Houston is a TIRZ. A county may not create a TIRZ for economic development (for example, infrastructure improvements around a new stadium), but a city may create a TIRZ for this purpose and turn the increment over to the county.

Beyond medical care, therapy, nutritional services and ventilator services, Hattie Larlham facilitates socialization opportunities for people with developmental disabilities at the Center. In the spring, the organization hosts a themed prom for residents. The 2014 theme was Willy Wonka, and the 2015 theme was Harry Potter. Every Christmas, Hattie Larlham arranges for the children at the Center to meet Santa Claus. Additionally, Hattie Larlham also brings in volunteers to the Center to interact with the residents. The organization also facilitates a card buddies program by which volunteers send greeting cards and postcards to people with developmental disabilities at Hattie Larlham's residential facilities. In 2013, volunteers dedicated 8,595 hours to the Center. Brands ;Hattie's Creative Arts Hattie Larlham Creative Arts gives participants with intellectual and developmental disabilities the opportunity to communicate through artistic expression.Hattie Larlham \\"Hattie Larlham ‚Äì Creative Arts\\" Participants work with trackers (professional artists). The trackers become an extension of the artist by asking a series of yes-or-no questions that allow the tracker to carry out the specific intent of each artist. Through the process, participants improve their ability to communicate. The artists receive all proceeds from the sales of their artwork. Pieces of art from the program have sold for as much as $2,000. The artwork is also displayed at various events, galleries, and exhibitions each year. Works from Creative Arts have appeared at the Eells Gallery at Blossom Music Center, the Taste of Hudson and the Eden Art Fest in Naples, Florida, among other locations. In 2013, artwork from Hattie Larlham Creative Arts was juried into the Orange Park Art Festival in Jacksonville, Florida, and into the Gulf Coast Fine Art Festival in Fort Myers, Florida, solely on its merits with no special consideration given to the fact that the artists had developmental disabilities.

The employees with disabilities learn sustainable, chemical-free growing practices such as crop rotation to prevent soil depletion, composting, using beneficial insects to manage crop-damaging insects, spreading mulches to suppress weeds and using disease-resistant cultivators. Hattie's Gardens maintains garden locations at Old Trail School in Bath, Ohio and the Akron Zoo in Akron, Ohio. Both gardens are organically certified by the Ohio Ecological Food and Farm Association (OEFFA).Hattie Larlham \\" Hattie Larlham ‚Äì Hattie‚Äôs Gardens\\" Hattie's Gardens at Old Trail School is a collaboration between Hattie Larlham, Old Trail School and the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park. More than 100 guests and dignitaries attended an unveiling ceremony for the garden on May 16, 2013. In addition to employing people with developmental disabilities, Hattie's Gardens at Old Trail School serves as a learning center for Old Trail School students and engages them in the entire food cycle. Old Trail School also serves produce from Hattie's Gardens in school lunches. A little less than a year after the garden at Old Trail School opened, Hattie Larlham officially announced Hattie's Gardens at the Akron Zoo in April 2014. The garden was formally unveiled at a morning press conference and an evening ribbon cutting on September 23, 2014. To create the garden, Hattie Larlham turned vacant lots owned by the zoo into sustainable gardening space. According to a press release by Hattie Larlham, the partnership between the two organizations began through a shared vision to make fresh, local food more readily accessible to surrounding residents. Hattie Larlham also cited that Hattie's Gardens at the Akron Zoo further integrates people with developmental disabilities into the community. Hattie's Food Hub In November 2014, the Plain Dealer reported that Hattie Larlham would open a North East Ohio Food Hub and Workforce Development Center near the site of Hattie's Gardens at the Akron Zoo. In the summer of 2015, Hattie Larlham officially broke ground on Hattie's Food Hub. Hattie's Food Hub held an official grand opening on June 23, 2016. Located in the Cedar Douglas neighborhood of Akron, the 4,400 square-foot facility has a grocery market open to the public, a community meeting space and a commercial processing kitchen. Hattie's Food Hub provides work training to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in an integrated work setting. Employees prepare and sell fresh produce grown at Hattie's Gardens and by Northeast Ohio farmers. Hattie's Food Hub sells produce in an area that was previously classified as a food desert, meaning no fresh produce or food was available within a one-mile radius. Free cooking demonstrations and classes are available at the location on a regular basis.

He had a close connection with three buildings (his office building, later known as the Guthrey Centre; St Andrew's Church, which is these days located at Rangi Ruru; St Paul's Church) that have later received Category I heritage registrations by Heritage New Zealand. Two of these buildings were demolished following the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. His company became even more successful under the leadership of two of his sons, and it existed until 1986. Early life Anderson was born on 7 November 1820 in Inveresk, near Edinburgh in Scotland. He was the son of Alexander Anderson (a ploughman) and his wife Jean Harper. He was married to Jane Gibson on 3 June 1845. Before her marriage, his wife was employed by the Dalmahoy family, who later helped their desire of emigrating to New Zealand by advancing ¬£300 for the move. Their first two children, Marion and Alexander, died as infants, and this is believed to have been a stimulus for them to emigrate. Their third child John was born in 1850 and the family of three came out to New Zealand on one of the First Four Ships, , arriving in Lyttelton at 10 am on Tuesday, 17 December 1850. A fourth child, Andrew, was born in 1851. Jean, Alexander, Elizabeth and Frederick were born between 1853 and 1861. Professional life In Scotland, Anderson learned the trade of a blacksmith. Following this, he was employed by railway companies. Avon River. The second hut from the right belonged to Anderson. The inserts show the First Four Ships that landed the colonists in 1850. Painted by John Dury (third hut from the right) in 1851 In New Zealand, he settled at The Bricks , a locality on the Avon River in central Christchurch, representing the most upstream location that could be reached by boat in those days. He was influenced by John Deans to settle in Christchurch rather than in Lyttelton, where most of the other settlers established themselves. Anderson was a neighbour with the surveyor Edward Jollie, who lived in the leftmost hut shown in the Drury painting. In February 1852, Anderson moved slightly south to Cashel Street, where he had bought a section. He bought up more land between Cashel Street and Lichfield Street for his expanding company. His residence 'Inveresk' was built further east on Cashel Street opposite St Paul's Church. In 1866, Anderson sent his sons John and Andrew to Edinburgh for schooling at the highly regarded Merchiston Castle School. Both started their working career in Scotland, with John as a mechanical engineer in Glasgow, and Andrew as a civil engineer in Edinburgh. Upon their respective returns to New Zealand in 1873 and 1876, they both worked in their father's business. The Guthrey Centre in 2010 In 1881, Anderson retired from the company, passing management on to John and Andrew. In the same year, the new company office was built on the Cashel Street site. It was known in later years as the Guthrey Centre and was demolished in August 2011 as a consequence of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The building was listed as a Category I heritage structure with Heritage New Zealand. Railway viaduct at Makatote under construction in 1908 Anderson's Foundry on the south side of Cashel Street, ca 1900 From small beginnings, the business had grown to cover all sorts of engineering. Machinery was produced that would process the region's products. The company expanded after Anderson's retirement and became a major player in the production of railway hardware, road and rail bridges. A Lyttelton works was opened in 1887 to build and maintain vessels. The firm built gold dredges and the steel lighthouse for Farewell Spit (1895‚Äì1896). One example of significant bridges was the Beaumont road bridge over the Clutha River, which is also known as the Dunkeld Bridge, as this was the original survey name for the township that soon took the name of Beaumont. The bridge was opened by John Anderson on 4 March 1887 with a champagne lunch. A champagne lunch of such proportions that the location for the presentation is still called Champagne Flat was held at the opening of the Waiau Ferry Bridge, these days a Category I heritage item registered with Heritage New Zealand. Another early and outstanding bridge was the Waiteti Viaduct, the northernmost viaduct on the North Island Main Trunk railway a few kilometres south of Te Kuiti. This structure was also completed in 1887. Probably the most significant structure on the North Island Main Trunk Railway is the Makatote Viaduct 12 km south of National Park. At 79 m, it is the highest on this line. It took three years to build and Andrew Anderson moved his family to the construction village, so that he could oversee the work. The viaduct was commissioned in 1908. For a long time, the company was under family membership, with all employees known to management by name, fostering a good employee / management relationship. Andersons Ltd merged with Mason Brothers Ltd in 1964 and ceased trading in 1986. Political career In 1862, the first municipal council of Christchurch was elected. 20 citizens put their names forward, and Anderson had the second highest number of votes, after John Hall, who later became a Premier of New Zealand. Elections for Christchurch City Council were held annually. He was elected on several subsequent occasions: 1867‚Äì1869 and 1871. On 16 December 1868, the city council held its annual general meeting. In those days, the councillors elected one of their group as mayor at an annual meeting, i.e. the position was not elected at large (by the voting public) as is the case today. Councillor Anderson was elected unanimously as the second mayor of Christchurch. His time as mayor is best remembered for him hosting the visit to Christchurch by the young Prince Albert, Duke of Edinburgh. The welcoming procession march was led by Anderson's foundry staff. As mayor, he presided at the official welcome luncheon. He carried out his duties to such satisfaction that citizens presented him with a silver tea and coffee service afterwards. In 1881, the year when Anderson retired from his business, he stood as a parliamentary candidate for Christchurch South. Two candidates contested the seat, and Anderson was beaten by John Holmes, who had a majority of 113 votes. Presbyterian Church hospital St Paul's Presbyterian Church in 1885 The Andersons were one of five Scottish settler families in Canterbury. Anderson was very active in the Presbyterian Church. He made long trips through Canterbury, trying to establish new congregations. In 1854, he was a founding member of the congregation of St Andrew's Church, and a request for a minister was sent to Scotland. In response, the first Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Charles Fraser (1823‚Äì1886), came to Canterbury in 1856. The crown had granted land at the corner of Tuam Street and Oxford Terrace () for the church, and St Andrew's was opened on 1 February 1857. In 1858, Fraser established Addington Cemetery () in Addington as a public burial ground. It was often called the 'Scotch Cemetery' because of its links to the Presbyterian Church, but it was open to all denominations and was thus the first 'public' cemetery in Christchurch. The cemetery was eventually taken over by the Christchurch City Council. Rangi Ruru When Fraser's more liberal views clashed with those of his congregation, Anderson was the leading person for forming the second congregation, and he laid the foundation stone at the new St Paul's Church. With two others, he travelled to Wanganui, trying and succeeding to attract Rev. Elmslie to St Paul's. Anderson's oldest daughter, Jean, was married to Elmslie in 1881, with the reception at their house Inveresk. The church was damaged in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, and partially collapsed in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. By June 2011, St Paul's had been demolished. St Paul's was listed as a Category I heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. John Anderson grave at Addington Cemetery Although Canterbury was an Anglican settlement, the first three mayors were all Presbyterian Scotsmen‚ÄîWilliam Wilson in 1868, followed by John Anderson in 1869 and Andrew Duncan in 1870. St Andrew's Church was relocated from its original site to Rangi Ruru Girls' School in 1986. The church is listed as a Category I heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust with registration number 304. Death Jane Anderson died on 20 March 1894, aged 73. The funeral service was held at St Paul's two days later. Anderson died on 30 April 1897 at his residence Inveresk in Cashel Street in central Christchurch. He was survived by four sons and two daughters. The funeral service for Anderson was held at St Paul's. The Andersons are both buried at Addington Cemetery.

Hybrid radio combines broadcast radio and internet (IP) technologies to create a harmonised distribution technology. The core technology standard (ETSI TS 103 270) relies on the Domain Name System (DNS) to allow a connected radio receiver to look up IP resources based on their broadcast parameters, such as the station identifier received within the broadcast signal. RadioDNS operates the root name server for the radiodns.org domain according to a published trust model. Although RadioDNS reserves the right to charge a small annual registration fee of USD10, this has never been charged and continues to be waived.RadioDNS Registration Process, radiodns.org The project is an open standard, initially created by a series of broadcasters and manufacturers.About RadioDNS , radiodns.org History RadioDNS was originally created as a collaborative project between Global Radio (at that time called GCap Media) and the BBC, to investigate creating a mechanism for linking Broadcast Radio and IP delivered webservices. The concept was first presented to the WorldDMB Technical Committee in Munich in May 2008. Interest in the project grew, to the extent where it was necessary to formalise the project. The First General Meeting of RadioDNS was hosted by the European Broadcasting Union in Geneva in October 2009 EBU Technical Journal - RadioDNS Gets Formal In Geneva, tech.ebu.ch The Second General Meeting of RadioDNS (held on 16 February 2010 in Geneva) adopted the Statutes,RadioDNS Statutes, radiodns.org Intellectual Rights Policy,RadioDNS Intellectual Property Rights Policy, radiodns.org Trust ModelRadioDNS Trust Model, radiodns.org and Membership Process,RadioDNS Membership Application Process, radiodns.org and thus effectively established RadioDNS as a not-for-profit organisation. At the Seventh General Meeting (held on 18 July 2013)RadioDNS Seventh General Meeting, radiodns.org, the Members unanimously voted to incorporate RadioDNS as a Company Limited by Guarantee, registered in England and Wales. The company is jointly owned by its members, is governed by ArticlesRadioDNS Articles of Association, radiodns.org and continues as not-for-profit entity. RadioDNS Limited holds the trademark registrations of the RadioDNS Logo and Words. In January 2015, the original technology standards (RDNS01 and REPG01, which had been forked from the DAB EPG standard) were migrated to standards published by ETSI. RDNS01 became ETSI TS 103 270, and REPG01 was integrated into ETSI TS 102 818 v3.1.1. Details The standard supports several radio bearers including VHF/FM, DAB, HD Radio, DRM and AMSS. Using a standardised format, a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is constructed and queried. This returns a CNAME record known as the \\"authoritative FQDN\\", which is a domain that represents the requested radio service. From this domain, SRV record lookups can be performed to verify the availability and location of various other applications that utilise RadioDNS. For example, an FM radio service is identified by its RDS parameters. To identify a radio service on 95.8 MHz with a country code of E1 and the PI code C479, the following FQDN is constructed: 09580.c479.ce1.fm.radiodns.org Querying this domain returns a CNAME record: 09580.c479.ce1.fm.radiodns.org canonical name = rdns.musicradio.com. This CNAME record can then be used to look up SRV records that advertise the availability of applications based upon RadioDNS (in this example an application identified by the name ): _radiovis._tcp.rdns.musicradio.com service = 0 100 80 vis.musicradio.com. Applications The linking of broadcast media with IP, as RadioDNS enables, allows additional functionality on receivers. Service and Programme Information (formerly RadioEPG) (ETSI TS 102 818) allows receivers to retrieve detailed metadata about radio services, programme schedules and on-demand audio. Visual Slideshow (formerly RadioVIS) (ETSI TS 101 499) specifies how to provide visuals for radio broadcasts. Demonstrations have also been made of RadioVIS running on a mobile phone. Other examples being worked on by the RadioDNS project include RadioTAG, a way for a listener to request more information, or simply bookmark a place, in a live broadcast.  Implementations  RadioDNS standards have been implemented in a variety of connected radio devices and connected vehicles.  Domestic and Mobile Receivers  * The Sensia, manufactured by PURE, is an example of a receiver with Visual Slideshow * Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 and Samsung Galaxy Express 2 LTE - Visual Slideshow, and Service and Programme Information * Revo PiXiS RS - Visual Slideshow  Vehicles  * Audi A8 * Audi A7 * Audi Q7 * Volkswagen Touareg * Porsche Cayenne Alternatives Service and Programme Information can be transmitted as a data service on DAB Digital Radio, and can include the Fully Qualified Domain Name of each radio service. This avoids the need for a DNS registration.

From a working-class background in Scotland, he emigrated to New Zealand as a young man and became a highly respected member of the Christchurch community. He is remembered for his later work as an immigration agent in Scotland on behalf of the Canterbury Province. Early life Duncan was born in western Scotland in 1834 to the gardener George Duncan (1791‚Äì1866) and his wife Christina. The four members of the Duncan family (the parents with Andrew and his younger sister Agnes) came out to New Zealand in 1858, arriving in Lyttelton on 21 September on the Zealandia. Life in New Zealand Duncan recalled in 1873 that in his early days, he was \\"not ashamed to turn his hand to whatever employment presented itself\\". He ploughed, sowed and worked in road construction. He regarded the portion of the Great North Road from the Styx River to Chaneys that he had formed as \\"one of the best in the colony\\". For some time, he was employed by Christchurch's first mayor William Wilson in his nursery before he set himself up as a nurseryman and seedsman. He had shops in Gloucester Street and later in Cashel Street in the central city of Christchurch, and nurseries in Phillipstown (in Duncan's Road, named after himself, but soon renamed Nursery Road) and later in Ensors Road. He specialised in new or rare plants, and greenhouse stock. Duncan married Isabella after he had been in Canterbury for a few years. His sister Agnes Duncan married William Boag on 17 June 1886. Boag became a wealthy man and the Christchurch suburb of Burnside is named after his residence. Agnes died on 17 September 1923, almost 20 years after Boag. The Duncans had many children. Alexander Storie Duncan was born on 28 November 1870. Ronald O. Duncan was their sixth son and was born in Christchurch in 1875. James Robertson Duncan (d. 1914) founded the nursery Duncan and Davies in New Plymouth. Political career=Christchurch City Council Elections for Christchurch City Council and the prior town council were held annually. He was elected four times: 1866‚Äì1868 and 1870. He was thus a councillor when the town council became the first city council, which held its first meeting on 10 June 1868. On 15 December 1869, the city council held its annual general meeting. In those days, the councillors elected one of their group as mayor at an annual meeting, i.e. the position was not elected at large (by the voting public) as is the case today. Councillor Duncan was elected as the third mayor of Christchurch. The councillors visited the Duncans at their home on 20 December 1870, the day before the next mayoral election. This was mainly to thank Duncan's wife Isabella for her role as mayoress and was at their place, as she had recently given birth to their son Alexander Storie Duncan (28 November 1870). At the general meeting on 21 December 1870, James Jameson was elected as the next mayor. With Duncan's term on council about to expire, he announced his intention to retire. Parliamentary ambitions Duncan stood for Parliament in January 1871 in the Christchurch East electorate. He was beaten by Jerningham Wakefield by 169 votes to 154. In his valedictory speech, Duncan vowed to never stand again for a seat in parliament. Indeed, when Duncan was urged by many quarters to stand for the 1875‚Äì1876 election in the City of Christchurch electorate, he declined. Canterbury Provincial Council hospital Duncan was a member for Heathcote on the Canterbury Provincial Council for two periods. He represented the electorate on the fifth Council from January 1868 to March 1870, and again from July 1871 to August 1873 on the 6th Council. During both Councils, he was on the Executive for brief periods, in June 1869 and from April to June 1872. Attracting immigrants to New Zealand fell within the responsibility of the central government. As the government agents were all from the North Island, the South Island provinces felt that they were missing out. The Canterbury Superintendent, William Rolleston, wrote to Premier Julius Vogel in May 1873 that his province's interests were not sufficiently looked after. The request for a Canterbury emigration agent was granted, and Duncan was asked in 1873 by the Canterbury Provincial Council to fulfil this role. He accepted and resigned in the second half of 1873, so that he could take on this post. There was a large dinner with 125 guests held for Duncan before his departure to the 'Old Country'. His strategy was to stress the class system back home, where one depended on their feudal lord and had no real future. Children had to go to work at young age, whereas in Canterbury, they would receive an education. In New Zealand, men of the highest education would help the newcomers. With six to ten years of steady work and a sober life, one could amass fortunes unimaginable back home and get ahead in life. Duncan would use himself as an example. He proved to be very effective in his role. In nine days, he interviewed 900 perspective emigrants and chose 190 to be sent out on the ship Canterbury, bringing 'as fine a lot of Scotch girls [as] have ever come to Canterbury ... good, robust, healthy and comely lasses, intelligent and educated'. Another of his ships, the Crusader, brought out some 376 emigrants, mainly agricultural workers. Duncan's new settlers were long regarded as of the finest quality. Duncan acted in this role for about one year. Public life After his return from England, Duncan became involved in education. He was appointed to the Board of Education, and later chairman, and became commissioner of School reserves. In his role, he opened several district state schools. He served on other bodies, like the Drainage Board, the Waste Lands Board, and the South Waimakariri Board of Conservation. He was a member of the Canterbury Agricultural and Pastoral Association, and chaired this organisation at the time of his death. He was a member of the Christchurch Horticultural Society, including secretary at one point. At the time of his death, he was the vice-president of the Union Rowing Club. Presbyterian Church St Paul's Presbyterian Church in 1885 Grave of the Duncan family at the Addington Cemetery; the obelisk fell over in one of the Christchurch earthquakes The Duncans were one of five Scottish settler families in Canterbury. Duncan was active in the Presbyterian Church. He was a follower of the first Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Charles Fraser (1823‚Äì1886), of St Andrew's Church. In 1858, Fraser established Addington Cemetery () in Addington as a public burial ground. It was often called the 'Scotch Cemetery' because of its links to the Presbyterian Church, but it was open to all denominations and was thus the first 'public' cemetery in Christchurch. The cemetery was eventually taken over by the Christchurch City Council. St Andrew's Church was relocated from its original site to Rangi Ruru Girls' School in 1986. When Fraser's more liberal views clashed with those of his congregation, many of his congregation left, including the Duncans. A second congregation was formed at St Paul's Church. With two others, he travelled to Wanganui, trying and succeeding to attract Rev. Elmslie to St Paul's. John Anderson's oldest daughter, Jean, was married to Elmslie in 1881, with the reception at their house Inveresk. Anderson was Duncan's mayoral predecessor. Although Canterbury was an Anglican settlement, the first three mayors were all Presbyterian Scotsmen‚ÄîWilliam Wilson in 1868, followed by Anderson in 1869 and Duncan in 1870. Death Duncan, who had always been of good health, fell ill in mid-1880. What was thought of as bronchitis was diagnosed as heart disease, and his doctor recommended a trip to Australia. He travelled to Sydney, where he improved, and Melbourne, where he suffered a relapse. He came home on 18 November and never again arose from the sick bed. He died on 9 December 1880 at his residence in Ferry Road, aged 46. He was buried at Addington Cemetery on Monday, 13 December 1880, in one of the largest funeral processions that Christchurch had witnessed for some years. The Christchurch City Council adjourned their weekly meeting out of respect.

Another older meaning probably refer to \\"age\\", the length of time that a person has lived or a thing has existed, or the old age. Also, another meaning refers to \\"make a law/ legistation about something\\". The general meaning is \\"sharpened point/ nib of the spear or lance(t)\\" which could possibly have a symbolic connotation representing a pointed arch, some referring to the niche of a mihrab, since the mihrab represent the \\"point, direction\\" of prayer to the Ka'abah in Islam. In a hadith narrated by Abu Juhaifa in Sahih al-Bukhari, \\"Once Allah's Messenger went to Al-Batha' at noon, performed the ablution and offered a two rak'at Zuhr prayer and a two- rak'at 'Asr prayer while a spearheaded stick was planted before him and the passersby were passing in front of it\\". In another tradition, the battle standard of Muhammad, known in Turkish as Sancak-ƒ± ≈ûerif (\\"Holy Standard\\"), was believed to have served as the curtain over the entrance of his wife Aisha's tent, the standard had been part of the turban of Buraydah ibn al- Khasib, an enemy who was ordered to attack Muhammad, but instead bowed to him, unwound his turban and affixed it to his spear, dedicating it and himself to Muhammad's service.

Early life Sawtell was born near Langport in Somerset, England in 1832. His parents were Mary and Thomas Sawtell. He came to Nelson, New Zealand on the John Masterman in February 1857. In August 1858, Sawtell came to Lyttelton. In 1861, he lived on town section 200 in Lyttelton. On 14 June 1862 at the Trinity Church in Lyttelton, he married Mary Ann, the daughter of Thomas Abrahams of Lyttelton. Their first son, Leonard Sefton Sawtell, was born on 11 March 1863 when they were living in Lyttelton's Oxford Street. By 1864, they were living in Christchurch's Hereford Street. His wife died in 1879, and on 20 January 1880 at St John's Church, Christchurch, he married Maria Parnham. Professional life Initially, Sawtell was a grocer in Christchurch, working for Dalgety. For some time he was in partnership with Alexander Cracroft Wilson, son of John Cracroft Wilson, and the firm carried on business as general merchants in High Street under the name of Wilson, Sawtell and Co. Political career Grave stone for Sawtell, his first wife, and two of their children Christchurch City Council Before 1916, elections for Christchurch City Council were held annually. Sawtell was elected onto the town and later city council three times: in 1868, 1871 and 1872. In those days, the councillors elected one of their group as mayor, i.e. the position was not elected at large (by the voting public) as is the case today. On 20 December 1871, Sawtell was elected to be the next mayor of Christchurch, succeeding James Jameson. Towards the end of his term as mayor, Sawtell fell ill and could not fulfil his functions. Councillor Edward Bishop filled his place during that time. The election of the next mayor was held on 18 December 1872, but The Press, the local Christchurch newspaper, already reported on 14 December of Councillor Bishop as mayor-elect. The election took place on the agreed date, and Bishop was elected unanimously. Sawtell resigned as a city councillor during February 1873 due to ill health. Whilst Christchurch City Libraries lists the 7th mayor, Michael Hart, as the one who gave the first link to the Christchurch mayoral chain, this tradition was in fact started by Sawtell, who gave the first link on the day his successor was chosen. Edward Bishop gave the second link in April 1874, some months after he was succeeded by Hart, who was thus the third person to add a link to the mayoral chain. Canterbury Provincial Council Sawtell was a member of the 6th Canterbury Provincial Council for the City of Christchurch electorate from 6 May 1870 until the end of the term on 28 February 1874, when he did not stand for re-election. Family His son Claude Sawtell married the artist Rosa Budden. Henry Sawtell was buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery.

The phrase \\"mesonet\\" is a portmanteau of the words mesoscale and network. In meteorology, ‚Äúmesoscale‚Äù refers to weather events that range in size from approximately to and can last from several minutes to several hours. Mesoscale events include thunderstorms, wind gusts, heat bursts, and dry lines. Without densely spaced weather observations, these mesoscale events might go undetected. In addition to surface weather observations, Oklahoma Mesonet stations also include environmental data such as on insolation and soil conditions, and some sites are co-located with wind profilers. The network consists of 121 automated stations covering Oklahoma and each of Oklahoma's counties has at least one station.McPherson, R. A., C. Fiebrich, K. C. Crawford, R. L. Elliott, J. R. Kilby, D.

Oklahoma Mesonet is a cooperative venture between Oklahoma State University (OSU) and the University of Oklahoma (OU) and is supported by the taxpayers of Oklahoma. It is headquartered at the National Weather Center (NWC) on the OU campus. Observations are available free of charge to the public. Background According to the Tulsa World, creation of the Oklahoma Mesonet resulted from the inability of emergency management officials to plan for the May 26‚Äì27, 1984 flood that killed 14 people in the Tulsa area. The 1984 flood demonstrated that emergency managers could not receive accurate and adequate data quickly enough about the progress of flooding from airport radars, updated hourly. The University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University collaborated with the Climatological Survey and other public and private agencies to create the Oklahoma Mesonet. This system collects weather information (e.g., wind speed, rainfall, temperature) every 5 minutes from 121 Mesonet stations throughout Oklahoma. Emergency planners can now monitor up- to-date weather information in advance of the arrival of an approaching storm.Peterson, Althea. \\"Oklahoma Mesonet had roots in the 1984 Memorial weekend flooding.\\" Tulsa World. May 27, 2014. Retrieved June 19, 2014. The article quoted an official of the Tulsa Area Emergency Management as saying that his staff uses the Oklahoma Mesonet every day. Meteorological stations The Oklahoma Mesonet consists of 121 remote stations across Oklahoma with at least one station in each of Oklahoma's 77 counties. Each Oklahoma Mesonet station is contained within a plot of land. Stations reside on a variety of locations including: University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University Research land, academic and foundation sites, federal/state/city land, airports, and privately owned property. Each site is visited at least three times per year during one of the Spring, Summer, and Fall passes. Sites are also visited by site technicians when there is a problem with a sensor or with communications. Additionally, sites are visited by a vegetation technician to ensure that the station is not overgrown by native plants. All sites generate their own electricity from solar panels and communicate mainly via radios on the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (OLETS). Instruments The Oklahoma Mesonet utilizes a variety of meteorological instruments to collect its observations. Observations are collected through a data logger within an enclosure and transmitted back to the National Weather Center for quality assurance, archival, and public dissemination.

While the Eighth Doctor initially had only one on-screen appearance, his adventures were portrayed extensively in subsequent spin-off media, including more than 70 audio dramas starring McGann.

At the end of life, the Doctor regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. McGann portrays the eighth such incarnation, a passionate, enthusiastic, and eccentric character. His only companion in the television film is Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook), a medical doctor whose surgery is partly responsible for triggering his regeneration. In the continued adventures of the character depicted in audio dramas, novels and comic books he travels alongside numerous other companions, including self-styled \\"Edwardian Adventuress\\" Charley, the alien Destrii and present-day humans Lucie and Sam.  Overview  Master. The Eighth Doctor made his first television appearance in the 1996 Doctor Who television film, the first time the Doctor had returned to television screens since the end of the original series in 1989. Intended as a backdoor pilot for a new television series on the Fox Network, the film drew 5.5% of the US audience, according to Nielsen Ratings. In the United Kingdom, it was received well, attracting over 9 million viewers and generally positive reviews. It was also generally well received in Australia.Data Extract, 121, July/August 1996, and see Doctor Who in Australia. Although the film failed to spark a new television series, the Eighth Doctor's adventures continued in various licensed spin-off media, notably BBC Books' Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, audio plays from Big Finish Productions, and the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip. These stories spanned the nine years between 1996 and the debut of the new television series in 2005. He is the longest-serving Doctor in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip. In the wake of the positive reaction to the revived television series in 2005, several of the Eighth Doctor's Big Finish audio dramas were also broadcast on BBC7 radio in an edited form. The trailers for these broadcasts explained that these adventures took place before the destruction of Gallifrey, the Doctor's homeworld, as described in the revived TV series. In 2007, BBC7 aired a new series of Eighth Doctor audio adventures, created specifically for radio broadcast. Paul McGann has continued to portray the Eighth Doctor in the various audio spinoffs. The continuity of the spin-off media with respect to the television series and to each other is open to interpretation. (The \\"Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who\\" on the BBC's classic Doctor Who website suggests this may be due to the Time War.) It has been suggested that the Eighth Doctor's adventures in three different forms (novels, audio, and comics) take place in three separate continuities. The discontinuities were made explicit in the audio drama Zagreus. In response, it has become increasingly common to consider the three ranges separately. The final Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, The Gallifrey Chronicles, obliquely references this split in timelines, even suggesting that the split results in the three alternative forms of the Ninth Doctor (a reference to the fact three different versions of the incarnation have appeared in various media). Mary's Story, a 2009 audio story by Big Finish, contradicted these suggestions, as there the Doctor mentions his companions in order, with book companions before audio companions. In \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", the Doctor \\"salutes\\" five of his companions by name, all from the Big Finish audio productions. Human Nature\\". Despite the fact the Eighth Doctor appeared on television only twice, he is the most prolific of all the Doctors (to date) in terms of number of individual stories published in novel, novella, short story and audio form. In 2007, the Eighth Doctor finally made a second appearance (of sorts) within the television series' continuity. In the episode \\"Human Nature\\" he appears on-screen as a sketch (alongside other incarnations) in the book A Journal of Impossible Things by John Smith. In 2008 and 2010 he appeared again as a brief image in \\"The Next Doctor\\" and \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" along with every other incarnation up to that time. In 2010's \\"The Lodger\\", he is shown in a flashback with his first, second, third, fourth, ninth and tenth incarnations. In 2013's \\"Nightmare in Silver\\", he is shown in a flashback along with the Doctor's other incarnations; he is also fleetingly seen running past companion Clara Oswald in the following episode, \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", though his face is not shown. Later that year, McGann reprised the role for the mini- episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", a prelude to the show's 50th anniversary special. This appearance marked the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his regeneration. \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" proved popular with fans of the series, some of whom petitioned the BBC to make a spin-off series starring the Eighth Doctor. Personality The BBC's official website calls the Eighth Doctor an \\"effortlessly charming, romantic figure\\". The site states that he is both unguarded about his own background and candid about the future of those he meets, noting the irony in an \\"open Doctor\\" remaining such a closed book. The Big Finish Productions website describes the Eighth Doctor as \\"an enthusiastic figure who explores the universe for the sheer love of it\\", always surviving on the strength of his excellent improvisational skills rather than preparing elaborate plans. The site states that he is \\"passionate, direct, sympathetic and emotionally accessible\\", but notes that these traits are \\"balanced by occasional feelings of self-doubt and weariness of his endless battles against evil.\\" Discussing \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", McGann said, \\"[Moffat's] instinctive take on the Eighth Doctor was exactly how I'd imagined this character to be, even way back, back in the 90s. You know, this... like a bruised nobility. I know it sounds wanky now, but... he's decent, but he's compromised. He's not a warrior, really, at all. There's a pacifist side to him, but he's a realist as well.\\" Television appearances=TV movie The Eighth Doctor debuts in the TV film Doctor Who. While transporting the remains of his longtime nemesis the Master to Gallifrey, the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) is caught in the crossfire of a gang shoot- out in 1999 San Francisco's Chinatown, USA. He is taken to a hospital where surgeons, confused by his double heartbeat, attempt to correct a non-existent fibrillation. These efforts instead \\"kill\\" the Doctor, and he is taken to a morgue where after several hours‚Äîdue to the effect of anaesthetic on his alien biology‚Äîhe finally regenerates into his eighth incarnation (McGann). The Master manages to cheat death, and while the Doctor is on Earth his spirit takes over the body of a paramedic named Bruce (Eric Roberts). The Master (Roberts) then attempts to steal the Doctor's remaining lives by opening the Eye of Harmony inside the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, nearly destroying the Earth in the process. However, the Doctor and his companion Dr Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook) are able to prevent the Earth's destruction, and the Master is sucked into the Eye. The TV film did not lead to the commissioning of a revived television series, and while Eighth Doctor stories continued in other media, Doctor Who did not air again on television until 2005. After this, footage and stills from the TV film would be used in later episodes \\"The Next Doctor\\" (2008), \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", \\"The Lodger\\" (both 2010) and \\"Nightmare in Silver\\" (2013). Edited archive footage in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" very briefly shows the Eighth Doctor sharing an adventure with the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton). \\"The Night of the Doctor\\"/\\"The Day of the Doctor\\" McGann reprised the role for a webcast mini-episode, \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", in 2013, which precedes the 50th anniversary special, \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". The episode begins during the raging Time War between Daleks and Time Lords when he is killed when attempting to save a young woman who rejects salvation at the hands of a Time Lord causing them both to die in a spaceship crash. He awakens in the company of the Sisterhood of Karn, who explain that he has died and been temporarily resurrected. They urge him to bring the war to an end, and give him a choice of elixirs to trigger his regeneration. Saluting his various companions from the Big Finish audio range, he drinks an elixir designed to produce a warrior, regenerating into the War Doctor (John Hurt) who declares himself to be the Doctor \\"no more.\\" In \\"The Day of the Doctor,\\" the Eighth Doctor joins all of the other incarnations of the Doctor in saving Gallifrey at the end of the Time War. He can be briefly seen on a screen in the War Room, though like the other past incarnations of the Doctor, this is achieved through archive footage. Costumes= Original TV Movie costume  The Eighth Doctor initially wore a Wild Bill Hickok costume including a battleship grey cravat tie intended for a New Year's fancy dress party, which he liberated from the lockers at the San Francisco hospital he regenerated in. He completed it with a pair of black leather shoes taken from Grace Holloway's ex-boyfriend Brian to give him the appearance somewhere between a Victorian dandy and wild west gambler.  Costume during the Time War  By the time of \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" he sported a worn and bottle green moleskin overcoat, a ruffled and midnight-blue ascot tie, a bronze grey paisley waistcoat, leather gaiters, and caramel brown US Army Cavalry boots; corresponding with his overall weary appearance, presumably as a result of many experiences during the Time War. This costume has been featured on many Big Finish Productions' audio plays set during the Time War and has also been used as promotional material after the positive reception of \\"The Night of the Doctor\\"  Big Finish costume  In 2010, Paul McGann revealed a new costume and sonic screwdriver for the Eighth Doctor which he indicated would be the new costume going forward. The cover and promotional photographs for the 2012 Big Finish story, Dark Eyes is, however, the first story to officially feature the new costume. The new outfit was originally premiered in 2010 at the Armageddon Pop Culture Expo, along with a redesigned Sonic Screwdriver, courtesy of Weta Workshop. These changes were independently produced and were not affiliated with Big Finish Productions or the BBC, but were accepted as suitable for official use after the fact. The costume consists of a royal blue leather pea coat, a white T-shirt, navy blue jeans and brown shoes. In this outfit the Doctor also carries a brown messenger bag. Spin-off appearances=Novels Almost as soon as he'd left San Francisco, the Doctor had another brief attack of amnesia, caused by a final trap of the Master's. To regain his memories, the Doctor was forced to visit all seven of his past selves and help them out with some crisis or another, at the same time acknowledging the responsibility his role gave him. Having regained his memories, the Doctor met a late twentieth-century Coal Hill School student named Samantha Jones; shortly after their encounter, the Doctor left her alone at a Greenpeace rally. For a time, the Doctor adventured with an Ice Warrior named Ssard and a human woman named Stacy Townsend, who fell in love with each other; some while after they parted ways with the Doctor, the two invited him to serve as best man at their wedding (Placebo Effect). He also, at some point, teamed up with his old companion Bernice Summerfield, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and UNIT to combat an Ice Warrior occupation of Great Britain. =Faction Paradox= Eventually, three years after his departure and one hour after he left, the Doctor returned to the Greenpeace rally. With Sam collected, the pair spent a great period wandering together, facing dozens of adventures. During their travels, Sam and the Doctor became aware of a great war, looming in the future of Gallifrey, between the Time Lords and an as-yet-unidentified Enemy, with dramatic and disturbing consequences. While exploring the issue of the war, the Doctor discovered that his Sam was not the original Samantha Jones; rather, her biodata had been manipulated by an outside agency with the intent to mould her into a prosaic distraction for him (Alien Bodies). Ultimately this plan proved a failure, as Sam developed into a much more strongly-willed companion than intended; at one point she spent three years avoiding the Doctor, so as to cope with a crush she had developed on him, but managed to survive and make a good life for herself in the future until she rejoined the Doctor as she could make more of a difference with him. The close dynamic between the pair was shifted with the introduction of Fitz Kreiner, a sixties bar singer incorrectly suspected of matricide. Fitz took on the role of a sort of younger brother to the Doctor, placing the Time Lord on as high a pedestal as Fitz had ever known. Eventually Fitz found himself abducted by Faction Paradox, a \\"time-travelling voodoo cult\\", and brainwashed into their legions. When the Doctor realised that a Faction member he had encountered was a biomass copy of Fitz- a 'clone' created and shaped based on others' memories and perceptions of Fitz-, he used the TARDIS's telepathic circuits to restore Fitz's memories and identity to the clone, believing that the original Fitz was dead and reasoning that the clone would essentially be the real Fitz in every way that mattered. With both Sam and Fitz gone ‚Äì Sam's origins established as a temporal paradox caused by exposure to a scar in reality created when the Doctor regenerated, which the 'original' Sam was only exposed to because the Doctor met blonde Sam ‚Äì the Doctor continued his travels with the clone Fitz (although he was treated as the real one and generally thought of himself as such) and Compassion, an ex-Faction agent implanted with an interface that the Doctor found compatible with his TARDIS. Unbeknownst to the Doctor, the Faction ‚Äì with the aid of the original Fitz ‚Äì had changed his history, drawing the Third Doctor to a planet he should never have visited and causing a chain of events that culminated in the Third Doctor regenerating ahead of schedule, allowing them to infect him with the Faction Paradox biodata virus. While his immune system would allow him to resist the virus for a time, it would gain a greater hold on him with each subsequent regeneration, until it would finally transform him into a faction member in his eighth incarnation (Interference: Book One and Two). Eventually, Compassion's implant, linked to the Doctor's TARDIS to prevent her being influenced by random local signals, triggered her unexpected mutation into a sentient Type 102 TARDIS, specifically the \\"mother\\" of the TARDISes that would be used in the pending War. With this knowledge, the Time Lords ‚Äì led by Romana, now in her third incarnation ‚Äì attempted to capture Compassion, intending to use her as breeding stock in preparation for the war. In response, and in light of the apparent destruction of his old TARDIS in a dimensional rift, the Doctor and Fitz retreated into Compassion and fled, the Doctor refusing to let his people enslave his friend in such a manner and resolving to keep on the run until he could find another way to deal with the issue of the War (The Shadows of Avalon). The Doctor and Fitz travelled in Compassion for some time, until the machinations of Faction Paradox came to a head back on Gallifrey. As it turned out, in the new timeline triggered by the Doctor's infection, the Doctor was destined to become \\"Grandfather Paradox\\", the mythical founder of Faction Paradox. The only factor keeping the original sequence of events in play was the Doctor's TARDIS, which had rebuilt itself after its apparent destruction on Avalon, and had now materialised in a twisted form above Gallifrey, holding within itself the Doctor's original reality where he had regenerated on Metebelis III and never been infected ever since it sensed that something was wrong when the Third Doctor regenerated ahead of schedule. In a final confrontation with his future self, the Doctor resolved the timeline conflict by channelling the TARDIS's built-up energies through its weapon systems, thereby destroying both the Faction Paradox fleet and Gallifrey itself. In so doing, the TARDIS was able to rewrite the altered timeline with the original one that it \\"remembered\\"; no longer able to contain both timelines as a result of its energy drain, one reality had to become 'real'. As a side effect, however, the Doctor's entire memory was erased, apparently from the trauma of the event (The Ancestor Cell). =Amnesia on Earth= To give the Doctor time to recover and the TARDIS time to regenerate from the extensive damage it had suffered, Compassion dropped the Doctor off on Earth in the year 1889; she then delivered Fitz to 2001, with the intent that he wait for the Doctor to catch up to him. With that, Compassion departed for parts unknown. Back in 1889, meanwhile, the Doctor awoke in a railway carriage to discover no memory as to his real identity, and no possessions save a small, shapeless box‚Äì what was left of the TARDIS after its power loss‚Äî and a note, simply stating \\"Meet me in St. Louis', 8 February 2001. Fitz\\". Despite his amnesia, the Doctor retained a wide general knowledge. However, he also showed an uncharacteristic callous streak, easily allowing others to die if he felt that they 'deserved' to perish (The Burning). To contrast, he was capable of feeling unusually poignant warmth, even dating a woman in the 1980s, and adopting a young girl named Miranda, a Time Lady from the future (Father Time). During this time, he often became involved in strange problems outside the norm, such as confronting an entity that was essentially sentient fire (The Burning). He experienced a particular funk in the 1950s, feeling that his efforts to learn about his past were pointless, but his interest in life was re-inspired when he was recruited to defeat his old enemies the Players as they sought to escalate the Cold War (Endgame). Unsure what \\"St Louis\\" was intended by the note, the Doctor created his own in London: the St Louis Bar and Restaurant. As 2001 rolled around, Fitz indeed turned up there to meet him. With the aid of new companion Anji Kapoor, the Doctor and Fitz completed the TARDIS's regeneration, dealt with a race of invading aliens, then set back again to exploring time and space (Escape Velocity). With his freedom restored, the Doctor chose to counteract his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered all manner of unusual beings ‚Äì from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (The Year of Intelligent Tigers), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold ‚Äì as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (Eater of Wasps) ‚Äì he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever had happened to him had happened for a reason, and he might as well make use of the advantages it offered. =Sabbath and parallel times= Only a few months after resuming his old lifestyle, the Doctor faced another radical change: the loss of his second heart. As it happened, the heart served as a bond with Gallifrey; with the planet gone, the heart had begun to fester within the Doctor's body, pumping it with poison. A man named Sabbath, an eighteenth-century secret agent gifted with time travel abilities, excised the blackened organ, both saving the Doctor's life and robbing the Doctor of some of his higher Time Lord abilities, including his respiratory bypass system and his ability to metabolise toxins. It transpired that Sabbath was actually after the heart for his own purposes: when implanted into Sabbath's own chest, it imparted upon him those same Time Lord powers, including allowing Sabbath to travel further from Earth in his own time machine than he had previously been capable of. An unexpected side effect of this experiment was that so long as the Doctor's heart remained within Sabbath's chest, the Doctor himself remained practically invulnerable to harm, returning to life after up to a day in a death-like state even after sustaining normally regeneration-inducing injuries such as getting his chest crushed by sandbags (though any injury sustained by the Doctor would weaken Sabbath). Eventually, after a woman Sabbath loved sacrificed herself to save the Doctor from a malfunctioning time machine, Sabbath tore out the Doctor's second heart, allowing the Doctor to begin growing a new one. Shortly after the restoration of his heart, the Doctor found himself locked in a desperate struggle with Sabbath as, along with his mysterious business associates, Sabbath hatched a plan to destroy all alternate realities. Sabbath believed that time travellers like the Doctor, every time they landed somewhere, created an alternate reality where they didn't show up, and that the universe was unable to support so many alternates without suffering damage; therefore, he attempted to trigger an explosion at Event One ‚Äì the Big Bang ‚Äì that would erase all alternate universes and leaving only one possible timeline. However, Sabbath's allies had been lying to him; in reality, Time would only split if absolutely necessary, and even then, it was nearly impossible to travel between alternate realities. In reality, Sabbath had been manipulated into creating a plan that would effectively wipe out free will itself, with the Doctor proving that Sabbath's perception was wrong when they found themselves in a situation that could only have occurred due to time travel in a single timeline. The explosion at Event One was averted when the Doctor diverted the black light that would have triggered the explosion to 1898, but instead of reality collapsing into a single controllable timeline, what occurred was reality starting to 'slide' between histories, multiple parallel realities fighting to become the dominant one. Along with new companion Trix, the Doctor, Fitz and Anji travelled through the realities, including a world where the computer was never invented, a world where Earth was devastated by a strange even as all life aged forty years in 1843, and a world where humanity had time-travelling tours, with the Doctor being forced to erase at least two of these realities as he sought to restore the original timeline. During this adventure, the Doctor appeared to become a bit more cold and calculating, sacrificing an innocent man to escape a pocket universe and even leaving alternate versions of Fitz and Anji to die to preserve continuity. However, in the end, their sacrifices paid off, the Doctor managing to stabilise reality by resolving a paradox that had been hanging over them since the beginning of the crisis, and then, with Sabbath's help, they confronted his masters; the Council of Eight, mysterious beings who gained power by foreseeing likely future events and then ensuring that they came to pass. The Doctor, as a rogue element existing outside of Time, was the only unpredictable factor in their universe, and was thus the only person who could stop them. Ironically, it was Sabbath himself who gave the Doctor the edge needed to stop the Council; realising that one of the Council members expected Sabbath to shoot the Council member with a weapon designed to send the subject into the Time Vortex, Sabbath instead shot himself, condemning himself to eternal agony in the Time Vortex, but completely undoing the Council's plan and destroying their space station, simultaneously restoring the possibility of parallel worlds to the universe. =The Gallifrey Chronicles= Some while after this, the Doctor was captured by Marnal, one of the few surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of K9 (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the Matrix within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As The Gallifrey Chronicles ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix dove into the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world. Audio dramas Paul McGann first returned to his role as the Eighth Doctor in Storm Warning, the first in a series of audio plays. In the course of his time with Big Finish, McGann would portray the Doctor in a series of continuous adventures, as well as a few more 'stand-alone' stories. One of these saw McGann portray an alternate version of the Eighth Doctor, from a timeline where the Seventh Doctor regenerates after being shot by the Nazis in the 1950s, which was first mentioned in the audio drama Colditz, and appears in Klein's Story. Under the alias \\"Schmidt,\\" the Doctor teaches Klein how to pilot the TARDIS, thereby putting her in a position to inadvertently assist the Seventh Doctor in preventing this timeline from occurring (unable to go back himself as the TARDIS security protocols would prevent him from going somewhere where he was already). In 2013, Big Finish released a special 50th Anniversary story, The Light at the End, in which the Master (Geoffrey Beevers) implements a plot to trap and destroy all eight incarnations of the Doctor by keeping him on Gallifrey. The Eighth Doctor and Charley meet up with the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and Leela (Louise Jameson), the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) and Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) and Peri, and the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and Ace (Sophie Aldred). Working together with the First Doctor (William Russell), Second Doctor (Frazer Hines), and Third Doctor (Tim Treloar)), they manage to break free of the Master's trap and prevent time from being rewritten so that the Doctor would never have left Gallifrey. Companions Susan (Carole Ann Ford), Ian Chesterton (William Russell), Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), Steven Taylor (Peter Purves), Sara Kingdom (Jean Marsh), Polly (Anneke Wills), Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines), Zoe Heriot (Wendy Padbury), Jo Grant (Katy Manning), Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding), and Turlough (Mark Strickson) also made appearances in the audio drama. In the 2013 live action mini-episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", the Eighth Doctor saluted Charley, C'rizz, Lucie, Tamsin and Molly, all companions from the Big Finish range, prior to his regeneration into the War Doctor. =Mary Shelley= Chronologically, the Eighth Doctor's earliest audio-released adventures were a trilogy, released in October through December 2011 as part of Big Finish's continuing monthly range, which saw the Doctor travel with Mary Shelley (as played by Julie Cox), first acknowledged as a friend of the Eighth Doctor's in The Company of Friends when she met a future version of the Doctor and helped his past self save his life. The first story, The Silver Turk, features the early breed of the Cybermen as seen in The Tenth Planet, The Witch from the Well tests the pair's relationship, and the trilogy concludes with Army of Death, where Mary decides to leave the Doctor. =Saving Charley= The Eighth Doctor's first released audio adventure, Storm Warning, sees the Doctor land on Earth in October 1930 aboard the doomed R101 airship. Aboard the vessel, the Doctor meets a young adventuress called Charley Pollard (played by India Fisher). In the course of his adventure, the Doctor saves Charley's life and takes her aboard the TARDIS as his latest companion. This was done in good faith, but the Doctor soon learns that Charley's rescue greatly and negatively effected the timestream. Despite established in-universe history partly relying upon her death on the R101, the Doctor is unable to return her to preserve the timeline, with Charley's continued existence forming a rough plot arc over two \\"seasons\\" of audio adventures as the Doctor discovers a series of minor historical anomalies caused by the damage to the timeline, such as the CIA existing in 1933 or Benjamin Franklin being president. The Doctor eventually learns that, due to Charley's survival, the universe has become infected with \\"anti-time,\\" leading to a conflict with the wraith-like Never People- individuals who were erased from history for crimes against reality and now seek to unleash the destructive anti-time against the universe- with the resolution of this conflict depicting the Doctor choosing to sacrifice himself and his TARDIS by absorbing anti-time energy, which seals the rift and preserves Charley's life but transforms him into the bogeyman Zagreus. Later restored to sanity but still infected with anti-time through the actions of Charley, his old companions Leela and Romana, and recreations of his immediate three preceding incarnations, the Doctor chooses again to sacrifice himself for the sake of Charley and the universe by removing himself from space and time. He enters a divergent universe for which he has no prior knowledge or frame of reference and in which there is no concept of linear time (Zagreus). Meanwhile, Charley stows away on his TARDIS, in a sense nullifying the Doctor's sacrifice by again placing herself in danger; for a time, this fact causes great friction between the characters and personal angst for the Doctor. =Divergent Universe= For another two seasons, the Doctor, Charley, and a new companion by the name of C'rizz, explore the divergent universe, gradually unravelling a deep plot designed around the Doctor by Rassilon, founder of Time Lord society, who had previously been trapped in anti-time by the Doctor for his role in the creation of Zagreus. Eventually, with the aid of his companions, the Doctor escapes the trap built for him, overcomes his emotional burden, learns that he has been purged of Zagreus, and returns to his normal universe with Charley and C'rizz (The Next Life). Following that point, which coincided with the end of the official Big Finish \\"seasons\\" in light of the return of Doctor Who to television in 2005, the trio wanders freely. The only continuing plot element involved C'rizz, whose character exhibits unusual and potentially destructive psychological development. This development culminates in C'rizz's death (Absolution), which inspires in Charley a desire to leave the Doctor's company. Due to amnesia brought on by a healing coma induced by a cyber- planner, the Eighth Doctor believes Charley has left him in 2008 Singapore (The Girl Who Never Was), when she is in fact displaced into the year 500,002, whence she is rescued by the Sixth Doctor (The Condemned). Believing that the Eighth Doctor died before their parting, Charley thus spends some time travelling with the Sixth Doctor, but their time together ends when an alien race called the Viyrans replace his memories of Charley with another woman, Mila, to preserve the timeline. =Lucie Miller= Starting New Year's Eve 2006, a new audio series titled The Eighth Doctor Adventures featuring the Doctor and new companion Lucie Miller (played by Sheridan Smith) was broadcast on BBC7. A second series followed in 2007. A third season was streamed from the Big Finish website, and was available on CD. A fourth and final season started in 2009 with the Christmas episode Death in Blackpool which dealt with Lucie's departure. Also in December 2009, the standalone episode An Earthly Child was released, in which the Doctor visits his granddaughter Susan Foreman on Earth (following up on the events of the First Doctor adventure The Dalek Invasion of Earth) and meets his great-grandson Alex Campbell. In Situation Vacant the Doctor gains a new companion, Tamsin Drew ‚Äì drawn from four prospective companions. This season puts the Eighth Doctor up against a new incarnation of the Meddling Monk, now travelling with Lucie Miller, but in the course of the season Tamsin is seduced to the Meddling Monk's way of thinking while Lucie finds the Monk's violence distasteful and re-joins the Doctor. When the Monk helps the Daleks launch an invasion of Earth, Tamsin, Lucie, and Alex are killed driving them off, although at the last minute the Monk betrays the Daleks to help save the Doctor and Susan. =Dark Eyes= In November 2012 Big Finish released a boxed set of four audio dramas called Dark Eyes, whose stories take place after To the Death. The set also introduced a new companion, Molly O'Sullivan (played by Ruth Bradley), an Irish Voluntary Aid Detachment nursing assistant in World War I. Here the Eighth Doctor changes his appearance, cutting his hair and changing into a WWI navy trench coat after his Victorian clothing is ruined. Following the success of the first Dark Eyes boxed set, Big Finish released three more sets, continuing Molly's story and introducing Liv Chenka as a new companion (Chenka having previously met the Seventh Doctor in the audio Robophobia). =Doom Coalition= The Eighth Doctor goes on to appear in a four-CD, four-part miniseries, Doom Coalition, which sees him, Liv, and new companion Helen Sinclair on the hunt for the insane Time Lord known as the Eleven, who suffers from a unique mental defect where all of his past personalities are active in his mind at once. In the course of the series, the Doctor peripherally interacts with the Eleventh Doctor's future wife River Song (although she takes care to avoid directly interacting with the Eighth Doctor unless disguised) and at one point confronts an alliance between the Monk and the Weeping Angels. Doom Coalition concludes with the Doctor thwarting the plans of the titular Coalition, who are revealed to be a group of Time Lords led by the Doctor's old schoolfriend Padrac, with Padrac's latest consultations with the Matrix having driven him to the conclusion that the only way to save Gallifrey from 'prophecies' of its own destruction is to destroy the rest of the universe. The hunt for the Eleven was intended to manipulate the Doctor into gathering the equipment needed for Padrac's plan to succeed, but the Doctor and his companions are able to disrupt Padrac's machines at the last minute. Beginning in 2017, Big Finish began releasing two separate Eighth Doctor series of box sets in the form of Ravenous and The Eighth Doctor: The Time War. =Ravenous= Ravenous is a series of four four-part box sets that serve as a direct sequel to Doom Coalition, initially depicting the Doctor and Liv's efforts to find Helen after she is trapped with the Eleven, but subsequently progresses to depict their efforts to oppose the Ravenous, an ancient race who are essentially the natural predator of the Time Lords as they evolved to feed on the energy released when Time Lords regenerate (the Ravenous are described as being the reason humans fear clowns, as they essentially resemble clowns in their natural state). The series concludes with the Doctor indirectly working with three different incarnations of the Master- including the Master of the TV movie, the War Master and Missy, the latter two of whom do not meet the Doctor face-to-face- to essentially restore the Ravenous to their original state, having determined that they drain energy from Time Lords after an ancient Gallifreyan scientist accidentally stole much of their natural energy millennia ago. =The Time War= The Eighth Doctor: The Time War is another series of four four-part box sets, set later in the Eighth Doctor's life during the early days of the Time War, depicting his efforts to protect those caught in the crossfire with the aid of his new companion Bliss, whose planet's history was undone when a Time Lord agent turned her planet into a weapons depot while her own history is in chaos due to the side-effects of the Time War. The third volume of Time War also sees the Doctor forced to face the Valeyard once again when his other self is recreated due to the Doctor being exposed to biology-manipulating technology while using a transmat, the two technologies somehow manifesting a new version of the Valeyard from the transmat after the Doctor departs. Comic stripsUnfinished business= In the Doctor Who Magazine comic strips, at an unstated time after his regeneration (and after an adventure in the 1930s involving Fey Truscott-Sade and psychic weasels), the Doctor revisited the town of Stockbridge. After being caught up in the games of the Celestial Toymaker, he picked up a new companion in lively sci-fi fan Izzy Sinclair. The two of them were soon caught up in the machinations of the Doctor's old enemies the Threshold, a mercenary organisation. The Threshold attempted to manipulate the Doctor into stopping the Daleks gaining access to the multiverse (which would kill an artificial solar system as a side effect) and dying in the attempt, but were outmaneuvered. Unknown to him, they implanted a device in Fey Truscott-Sade so that they could use her as an unwilling spy when she next encountered the Doctor. She did so in 1939, assisting him and Izzy against the vampiric Varney; the Doctor was left infected with a deadly bacillus, and he had to be taken to Gallifrey to be cured, luring him into a battle against a Time Lord cult called the Final Chapter. Working out that the Threshold were using Fey as a spy, the Doctor and his old comrade Shayde faked a regeneration. The Threshold was conned into believing they were facing a vulnerable new Doctor (Shayde in disguise), allowing the real Doctor to infiltrate their base. While he and his friends were too late to stop the Threshold from destroying every single spacecraft in the universe, they were able to bring about the organisation's destruction before it could profit. Fey returned to her time, having also bonded with Shayde to save his life. Unknowingly, the TARDIS had been taken over by the Master, who was manipulating events to gain the power of the omniversal Glory. The Doctor was specifically sent to times and places that would undermine him ‚Äì discovering he had upset the course of Grace Holloway's life in 2001, encountering an alien race with motivations uncomfortably similar to his which caused death and horror in 17th Century Japan, and almost killing the benevolent Kroton by mistake. (A slight diversion between events saw the Doctor and Izzy team up with the actor Tom Baker and other 1970s television actors against Beep the Meep in 1979.) In 17th Century Japan, the Doctor's attempt to save the life of samurai Katsura Sato, a friend of Izzy, left the man inadvertently immortal and thus robbed of both an honourable death and any sense of empathy. The Master later came for Sato, when he was mentally vulnerable, and gave him a fake religion to focus his mind on; Earth's history was altered as Sato, renamed Lord Morningstar, and his Church of the Glorious Dead conquered the planet, creating a technological advanced, highly brutal planet of jihadists. The Doctor, Izzy and Kroton wandered into their invasion of the museum planet Paradost; while the Doctor faced the Master over the Glory, Izzy and Kroton spent weeks on the occupied world. The Doctor was defeated, only for the Master discover he was not able to access the Glory, as instead Kroton and Sato had been the ones prophesied to battle for it. Kroton won the Glory, the Master was purged from the TARDIS and history was reverted, and the Doctor and Izzy took a well-earned break. =Destrii= During a battle against the body-stealing Ophidians and their gigantic snake-shaped techno-organic warship, the Doctor and Izzy encountered a brash and adventurous fish-woman called Destrii. While seemingly friendly and bonding with Izzy, Destrii was secretly on the run and she swapped bodies with Izzy to cover her escape; when Destrii was seemingly killed, Izzy seemed trapped within an alien body. The Doctor's next few journeys were spent trying to help her in this situation, both in coming to terms with the change and finding out what her new body's abilities were. Frida Kahlo helped Izzy mentally deal with the change, but the attempt at testing Izzy's abilities led her and the Doctor into a turbulent encounter with the humanised Daleks he had created in his second incarnation. Unable to prevent their tragic end ‚Äì self-destructing to escape the machinations of the malevolent psychic Kata-Phobus -, the two of them were distracted and caught off-guard when Helioth and Hassana, two of the energy- beings called the Horde, abducted Izzy thinking she was Destrii. The Doctor went on a relentless search to rescue his friend, with the help of Fey/Shayde and by forcing co-operation from Destrii, still alive in her stolen body. His quest led him to the planet Oblivion, a surreal and brutal world ruled by Destrii's mother, the Matriax. Izzy was rescued and returned to her original form, while Oblivion's court system and the menace of the Horde were both destroyed, leaving Destrii free to leave her world and explore the universe with her roguish uncle Jodafra. However, Izzy had decided she wanted to return home to her family, and the Doctor was left alone. Feeling slightly morose, the Doctor was cheered up by an unknowing encounter with his old companion Frobisher and went on several 'holiday' adventures on his own. He eventually re-encountered Destrii and Jodafra in America during the 19th Century, where the upcoming clash between General Custer and Chief Sitting Bull was interrupted by Jodafra's machinations involving the monstrous wendigo. Jodafra had made a deal with the creature: power in exchange for being fed children. Unable to stomach this and with the Doctor urging her to listen to the spark of decency in her, Destrii helped the Doctor stop her uncle. In revenge, she was left beaten and abandoned, and the Doctor took her in as a probationary companion. Together, the two of them teamed up with MI6 and faced an invasion of early 21st Century Earth by time-travelling Cybermen; they were preparing to chemically overload the emotions of humans and thus make them willingly surrender to have their emotions removed by conversion. The Doctor destroyed them through use of the Time Vortex (similar to the later \\"The Parting of the Ways\\"), almost surrendering to it but giving up its power to save Destrii. In 2007, Panini Books published Doctor Who: The Flood, the final collection of comic strips featuring the Eighth Doctor in Doctor Who Magazine. The book includes the essay \\"Flood Barriers\\" by strip editor Clayton Hickman in which he reveals that Russell T Davies had authorised the comic strip to depict the regeneration of the Eighth Doctor into the Ninth Doctor at the end of the 2004‚Äì2005 arc, The Flood. The cause of the regeneration would have been the Doctor's exposure to the Time Vortex in his efforts to destroy the Cybermen (the same cause that triggered the later Ninth to Tenth Doctor regeneration in Parting of the Ways). Destrii would have witnessed the regeneration and would have continued to travel with the Ninth Doctor in a proposed Year One arc. However BBC Wales vetoed the Year One arc and indicated the Ninth Doctor could only be shown travelling with Rose Tyler, Hickman and writer Scott Gray eventually decided not to depict the regeneration as they would have been unable to give Destrii a proper departure. The Panini collection includes the original script for the regeneration sequence, as well as never before published art showing the regeneration itself. Doctor Who: TITAN Comics - The Eighth Doctor In the Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor comic series, the Eighth Doctor ‚Äì from a point shortly before the Time War, as he is shown in the clothing and hairstyle he wore in \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" ‚Äì is visiting an old holiday house of his where he encounters a young painter named Josie Day. Intrigued at her presence, he invites her to accompany him while he checks off items on a 'To Do' list left behind in his last visit to the house. In the course of the storyline, it is revealed that Josie is actually a sentient painting given life by a wealthy woman in the future as part of the woman's plan to grant herself immortality by transferring her mind into Josie, but Josie was rescued by the Twelfth Doctor and taken into the past so that she could travel with the Eighth, the Twelfth Doctor feeling that his past self was better suited to help Josie learn how to be human.

He is portrayed by Christopher Eccleston during the first series of the show's revival in 2005. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. The production team's approach to the character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from his predecessors, with Eccleston stating that his character would be less eccentric. To fit in with a 21st-century audience, the Doctor was given a primary companion, Rose Tyler, played by Billie Piper, who was designed to be as independent and courageous as himself. He also briefly travels with Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley), a self-serving boy genius who acts as a foil to the companions but ultimately proves unworthy, and Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a reformed con man from the 51st century. The Doctor, Rose and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series finale in which each character has to make difficult choices and face sacrifice. In 2006, readers of Doctor Who Magazine voted Eccleston's Doctor the third most popular Doctor. Both mainstream press and science fiction reviewers generally credit Eccleston and his incarnation of the character as helping to re-establish the show following its hiatus between 1996 and 2005. The character's interactions with his arch-enemies, the Daleks, were particularly praised. Eccleston won several awards for his single series including the 2005 National Television Award for Best Actor. Appearances=Television The Ninth Doctor first appears in the episode \\"Rose\\" where he rescues 19-year-old shopgirl Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) from an Auton attack in the department store where she works. After Rose helps the Doctor defeat the Nestene Consciousness (living plastic), he invites her to travel with him in the TARDIS. On their first trip in \\"The End of the World\\", the Doctor takes Rose to witness the destruction of planet Earth in the year five billion. It is revealed that the Doctor's own species, the Time Lords, have been destroyed and the Doctor is the last of his kind. Following from this, they visit Cardiff in 1869 in \\"The Unquiet Dead\\", where they encounter author Charles Dickens, of whom the Doctor claims to be a big fan. When faced with a near- death situation, the Doctor tells Rose that he was glad to have met her. In \\"Aliens of London\\", when taking Rose home, the Doctor accidentally returns to Earth 12 months after they left. Because of his actions, he is treated like an Internet predator by Rose's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri) and Rose's boyfriend Mickey (Noel Clarke) has become Rose's murder suspect. After Mickey helps the Doctor and Rose defeat the Slitheen by firing a missile at their base at 10 Downing Street in \\"World War Three\\", the Doctor offers Mickey a place in the TARDIS with them but he refuses. In the episode \\"Dalek\\", the Doctor encounters a Dalek, though he had believed the race to be extinct as the Time War between the Time Lords and Daleks concluded with the mutual annihilation of both races‚Äîan event for which the Doctor himself was responsible. The Doctor tortures the surviving Dalek and at the end of the episode prepares to kill it in cold blood. He refrains once Rose calls him out on this. Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley) joins the Doctor and Rose as companion at the end of \\"Dalek\\". However, when he tries to smuggle future knowledge from Satellite Five in the year 200,000 back to his own time in \\"The Long Game\\", the Doctor expels him from the TARDIS. The Doctor is angry at Rose after he takes her to the event of father Pete Tyler's (Shaun Dingwall) death and she saves his life, causing a paradox in \\"Father's Day\\". However, when Pete dies to restore the timeline he shows compassion and encourages her to sit by his side as he passes away. In \\"The Empty Child\\", after encountering Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) (a con artist and former Time Agent from the 51st century) in 1941, the Doctor realises Jack had caused a deadly nanotechnological plague to sweep through the human race, turning humans into gas-mask zombies. Following the resolution of the situation, Jack prepares to sacrifice himself in \\"The Doctor Dances\\", but the Doctor saves him and invites him on board the TARDIS. In \\"Boom Town\\", when the Doctor encounters Blon (Annette Badland), the only Slitheen to survive the Downing Street explosion, in present-day Cardiff he has doubts over whether or not to send her home to be executed. During this episode, the Doctor first notices that he and Rose had kept coming across the words \\"Bad Wolf\\". In \\"Bad Wolf\\", the Doctor, Rose and Jack find themselves at the mercy of the Bad Wolf Corporation based on Satellite Five. However, the true enemy is revealed to be the Daleks, as the Dalek Emperor had also survived the Time War and had rebuilt the Dalek race. In \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", the Doctor sends Rose back to the 21st century to protect her before attempting to destroy the Dalek army. When he realises that doing this would destroy most of planet Earth he is unable to do so, proclaiming he would rather be a coward than a killer. Having absorbed the energies of the time vortex, Rose is able to return to the Doctor and destroy the Daleks. To save Rose from being killed by harbouring the time vortex, the Doctor removes the harmful effects by kissing her. However, the damage to his cells causes him to regenerate and the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) takes his place. The Ninth Doctor's origins were originally not explored in 2005, but were given in the show's fiftieth anniversary special, \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", in 2013. This episode also revealed that the \\"Ninth\\" Doctor was actually the Doctor's tenth incarnation; the short episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" revealed that the Eighth Doctor accepted aid from the Sisterhood of Karn after a spaceship crash to ensure that he would regenerate into an incarnation suited to fight in the war, with this incarnation being known as \\"the War Doctor\\" (John Hurt), as he officially did not consider himself to be worthy of his usual title. In the aftermath of the Time War, the War Doctor succumbs to old age, musing that his body is \\"wearing a bit thin\\". The regeneration scene is cut short before Eccleston's likeness can be fully seen, as the actor declined to return for the episode and showrunner Steven Moffat wished to honour Eccleston's decision. Eccleston does, however, appear in stock footage and stills alongside the first eight Doctors. Literature In the essay \\"Flood Barriers\\" in the 2007 Panini Books reprint collection of Eighth Doctor comic strips from Doctor Who Magazine strip editor Clayton Hickman reveals that Russell T Davies had authorised the comic strip to depict the Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the Ninth at the end of the story arc, The Flood. The regeneration would have been witnessed by the Eighth Doctor's companion, Destrii, and Hickman writes that the intent was to continue with a Ninth Doctor: Year One story arc with the Ninth Doctor and Destrii. However, when this arc was vetoed by both Russell T Davies and series producer Julie Gardner the creative team felt unable to regenerate the Doctor without Destrii's presence and the decision was made not to depict the regeneration in the comic strip. The reprint collection includes a specially-drawn panel showing how the Ninth Doctor might have looked in the comic strip immediately after his regeneration, wearing the Eighth Doctor's costume and being tended to by Destrii. The Ninth Doctor appears in the first six of the Doctor Who hardback New Series Adventures novels which tie in with the first series of the revamped show. The first three of these novels‚Äî The Clockwise Man, The Monsters Inside and Winner Takes All‚Äîwere published on 19 May 2005 and feature solely the Doctor and Rose. The Monsters Inside depicts the Doctor taking Rose to her first alien planet, Justicia. Rose mentions the visit to Justicia in the first series episode \\"Boom Town\\" which aired 4 June 2005 in an example of the television series referencing the novels. The second batch of Ninth Doctor novels ‚Äîcomprising The Deviant Strain, Only Human and The Stealers of Dreams‚Äîwere released 8 September 2005 and feature the Doctor, Rose and later companion Captain Jack. All of the Ninth Doctor novels except Only Human make reference to the \\"Bad Wolf\\" story arc of the first series although in keeping with the TV series, the Doctor does not acknowledge these as significant. The Ninth Doctor appeared in the Penguin Fiftieth Anniversary eBook novella The Beast of Babylon by Charlie Higson. Here it is shown that he had adventures between dematerialising near the end of \\"Rose\\" and re-materializing to tell Rose the TARDIS travels in time. The character featured in comic strips in Doctor Who Magazine between 2005 and 2006 as well as in several short stories in the Doctor Who Annual 2006. In Steven Moffat's Ninth Doctor short story \\"'What I Did on My Christmas Holidays' by Sally Sparrow\\" the Doctor and the TARDIS are inadvertently separated twenty years in time by a fault in the time machine and the Doctor is able to instruct Sally how to bring it back to him in the past. This short story later became the basis of the third series episode \\"Blink\\". The Ninth Doctor has appeared in IDW Comics Doctor Who: The Forgotten and Doctor Who: Prisoners of Time. Audio The Ninth Doctor made his first official, original audio story appearance in Big Finish/AudioGo's Destiny of the Doctor: Night of the Whisper, released in September 2013 for 50th anniversary of Doctor Who. He is joined by companions Rose and Captain Jack, and Nicholas Briggs reads the story and provides his voice. Briggs reprised the role for The Ninth Doctor Chronicles, released in May 2017. In 2019, Nicholas Briggs narrated a short trip from the Ninth Doctor era titled Battle Scars. On 9 August 2020, Big Finish announced that Christopher Eccleston would reprise his role as the Ninth Doctor in a new series entitled The Ninth Doctor Adventures, consisting of four box-sets each containing three episodes. The four volumes will be released from May 2021 to February 2022. Development=Casting The Doctor had been played by eight actors between when the series began in 1963 and the casting of Christopher Eccleston; the concept of regeneration‚Äîa process in which the title character takes on a new body and identity‚Äîhad been introduced in 1966 to allow the production team to change lead actors. Between 1963 and 1989 seven different actors played the part. The Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann, appeared in a BBC/Fox co-produced television film in 1996, however this did not lead to a full series. Over six weeks in 2003, the BBC posted an animated serial called Scream of the Shalka on their official website. This was originally developed as an official continuation to series, and featured Richard E Grant in the role of the Doctor. In promoting the online serial, Grant was referred to as the official Ninth Doctor by the BBC. However, following the September 2003 announcement that the series would return to television with a new actor in the title role, the canonical status of the so-called \\"Shalka Doctor\\" was left in doubt. Christopher Eccleston's casting as the Ninth Doctor was announced on 22 March 2004. He was the production team's first choice for the character. Other actors linked to the role included Bill Nighy, Richard E Grant, Anthony Head, Eddie Izzard, Hugh Grant and Alan Davies. Jane Tranter, BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning, stated in the announcement of his casting that casting an actor of Eccleston's reputation signalled \\"our intention to take Doctor Who into the 21st century, as well as retaining its core traditional values ‚Äì to be surprising, edgy and eccentric\\". Executive Producer Russell T Davies remarked that casting Eccleston \\"raises the bar for all of us\\". Eccleston cited the quality of the scripts as a reason for joining the cast, stating in an interview on BBC's Breakfast programme that he was \\"excited\\" about working with Davies. In the press-pack for the series he states that he had emailed the writer to declare his interest in the role. Eccleston enjoyed having the chance to work on a series aimed at a different demographic than his previous work, noting that \\"it's aimed at families, so I'm kind of acting for children and I feel very lucky to be able to do that\\". He felt that being cast by Davies in the series was a \\"risk\\" because as an actor he is not known for \\"charm or comedy\\" and anticipated a potential backlash due to being built up as \\"an actor of stature\\" and the difference between his own interpretation of the character and past doctors. On 30 March 2005 the BBC confirmed that Eccleston would not be staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he \\"didn't enjoy the environment and the culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in\\" and that he did not want to do any more based on the experience. He said, \\"I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it.\\" According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt. Characterisation Eccleston stated in April 2004 that he did not believe his Doctor would be \\"as eccentric and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations\\". Russell T Davies characterised the character as a \\"stripped down\\" version of previous Doctors. Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: \\"He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord ‚Äî that's eccentric enough to be getting on with\\". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent, mirroring Eccleston's natural Mancunian accent. This is addressed in \\"Rose\\" when Rose Tyler asks the Doctor, \\"If you're an alien, how come you sound like you're from the North?\\", to which the Doctor responds, \\"Lots of planets have a north!\\" Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character \\"is a scientist and an intellectual, and a lot of people seem to think you can only be those things if you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish.\\" In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather pea coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, \\"I didn't want the costume to be my performance\\" and that \\"I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting.\\" Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a \\"slight dark side\\" but also bring out a lighter side. Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be \\"very intense but also frivolous as well.\\" Eccleston felt that as a character his Doctor lives solely for the present. He avoids thinking about his past because \\"there's some pain there\\" ‚Äì and his only concern regarding the future is that \\"it's there\\". Eccleston felt that the character ultimately provides a life- affirming message stating that \\"In everything the Doctor does, he is saying 'it's great to be alive'.\\" In an interview with Newsround he stated that the Doctor accepts individuals regardless of colour and creed and expressed hope that the Doctor would encourage young children to appreciate life. However, he also drew out differences between the Doctor and traditional children's heroes. The actor described the character as \\"brutal at times\\" and \\"confrontational\\" and \\"inflexible\\" stating that he \\"sometimes creates carnage\\" and that \\"there's nobody like him in Disney\\". Matthew Sweet of The Evening Standard highlighted the dichotomy of the character being \\"brave and wise and brilliant\\" but also \\"rough and ready\\" and \\"down-to-earth\\". A loose story arc that informed the Doctor's characterisation during the 2005 series is his feelings regarding the destruction of his own race, the Time Lords, which occurred offscreen before episode one. Eccleston felt that the episode \\"Dalek\\" showed the audience why his Doctor is the way he is and \\"how he feels about his past\\". Russell T Davies remarked that the Ninth Doctor carries a lot of survival guilt; this is why he \\"strides through the universe wearing a dark leather peacoat saying \\"Don't touch me\\"\\". Davies felt that \\"Dalek\\" provided a \\"bit of therapy\\" and after this he \\"starts to rebuild himself\\". In the episode \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" the Doctor sacrifices his ninth life to save Rose. Davies felt it was important to take the Doctor away from mythological off stage concepts such as the Time War and provide a conclusion that focused on the relationship between the character and Rose. John Barrowman, who played Captain Jack, felt that the Doctor's decision to save Rose enabled a catharsis; as he sacrifices himself to save her he is \\"letting go of the burden of the Time Lords being destroyed\\". Companions Since 1963, the Doctor has travelled with various companions who generally serve to remind him of his \\"moral duty\\". The casting of Billie Piper as the Ninth Doctor's primary female companion Rose Tyler was announced in May 2004. Julie Gardner felt that the young actress and former pop star was perfect as a \\"unique\\" and \\"dynamic\\" companion for the Doctor. Press for the series focused heavily on the fact that Rose was to be more independent and courageous than previous companions. Prior to the casting of Piper, Eccleston had joked that \\"I'll be doing the running around screaming.\\" He later opined that Rose is not as \\"vulnerable\\" as previous companions and that \\"she's as brave and courageous and intelligent as he is\\" citing the fact that she saves the Doctor's life. Piper remarked that the Doctor challenges Rose more than anyone else in her life and that he in turn sees in her \\"she has huge potential, to be someone really, really great.\\" Eccleston felt that Rose is a \\"heroine\\" who \\"teaches [the Doctor] huge emotional lessons\\". He felt that the relationship between the two characters was \\"love at first sight\\" although in a more mysterious fashion than a conventional love affair. Commentators on the series noted the romantic tension between the two characters. In their book Who is the Doctor?, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith described the climactic kiss between the Ninth Doctor and Rose in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" as being something \\"we all secretly wanted, even though it ultimately killed him\\". The companions of the Ninth Doctor. From left to right, Rose Tyler, Adam Mitchell and Captain Jack Harkness. Adam Mitchell joins the Doctor and Rose in the episode \\"Dalek\\". The character was first conceived during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC: it was always the intention for Adam to join the TARDIS team after Rose developed a liking for him. Contrasting against Rose, Adam was created to show that not everybody is suited to be a companion. Davies stated that he \\"always wanted to do a show with someone who was a rubbish companion\\" and dubbed Adam \\"the companion that couldn't\\". Upon returning Adam home, the Doctor informs him that \\"I only take the best. I've got Rose\\". Fraser McAlpine, reviewing Adam's appearances as companion for BBC America's Anglophenia blog, described Adam as fulfilling a role as \\"the companion that proves the worth of all of the other companions\\". From episodes nine through thirteen, Rose and the Doctor are joined by the con man Jack Harkness. Jack's appearances were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero. John Barrowman, reflecting on the interrelationships between The Doctor, Jack and Rose, felt that \\"the subtle sexual chemistry between all three characters... was always in play\\" with the caveat that \\"the relationships were by no means driven by desire\\". SFX magazine also commented on the \\"intoxicatingly flirtatious dynamic\\" and compared the trio to \\"a Buffy-style Scooby gang who can quip in the face of danger\\". Jack parts from the Ninth Doctor with a kiss which Barrowman felt to be \\"full of fondess and respect\\" and both \\"a significant moment in the annals of the series\\" and \\"a moment full of melancholy and loss for the characters\\". Analysis and reception Eccleston's successor, David Tennant, felt that he had \\"an awful lot to live up to\\". James Delingpole of The Spectator noted that subsequent to Fourth Doctor Tom Baker's departure and prior to Eccleston, actors who portrayed the Doctor had a tendency to play the role \\"too camp, knowing, lovable or twee\\". He felt that the \\"brusque, sarky and virile\\" Ninth Doctor \\"transports us back to the golden era of Jon Pertwee when the series still had that edge of darkness.\\" Marena Manzoufas, head of ABC programming, commented after picking up the series that Eccleston \\"has brought a new dynamic energy to the role\\" and the show would appeal to both long time viewers and new fans. She cited the high viewing figures of Eccleston's debut episode‚Äîover 10 million‚Äîas proof that audiences were ready to welcome in a new era of the show. Looking back on David Tennant's era and forward to Matt Smith, The Heralds Edd McCracken comments that casting Tennant had been a risk after \\"the show's reputation and ratings\\" had been \\"restored under Eccleston\\". However he notes that due to the brevity of the Ninth Doctor's era Tennant subsequently had time to make his character more established. Richard Henley Davis of The Economic Voice also notes that Tennant \\"had big boots to fill after Christopher Eccleston's Doctor Who, which many believe to be the greatest incarnation of the lunatic time lord.\\" In a 2005 interview Tennant himself stated \\"there's an awful lot to live up to\\" after taking on the role from Eccleston, having admired his performances as a viewer. Like Delingpole, Andrew Blair found similarities between the Ninth Doctor era and the Third Doctor era, summarising Eccleston's single series as \\"a modern day season seven\\". In his retrospective of the character, he states that Eccleston's casting proved that the revival of the show \\"was not a light entertainment concern\\". He comments that in online fandom there was a sense \\"of a ship being steered in a different direction\\" and praises the plot device of the Time War as allowing the character to become mysterious again by providing him a \\"blank slate\\". He compares the Ninth Doctor to the First Doctor (William Hartnell) in that both characters are \\"an unknown who remains aggressively weird until his new-found human friends soften him up\\". Blair also felt that the Ninth Doctor's relationship with the Doctor's arch enemies the Daleks was more successful than in other incarnations giving particular praise to Eccleston's \\"spittle-enhanced and terrifyingly furious reaction\\" to the monsters in \\"Dalek\\". Blair ends his retrospective by noting that without the foundations laid by Eccleston the show \\"wouldn't have been able to move onwards towards the even more popular David Tennant era\\". Steven Moffat, who wrote \\"The Empty Child\\"/\\"The Doctor Dances\\" for Eccleston's Doctor and would become Doctor Who executive producer in 2010, observed that in 2005 there was a distinct lack of science fiction and fantasy drama in the UK. He felt that the first series had to establish itself as \\"a bit Hollyoaks\\" and \\"a bit tough detective\\" to prove itself as a \\"proper, sensible drama series\\". Moffat notes that the 2005 series \\"changed the landscape into which it once tried to fit\\" and that now Doctor Who \\"has to be the most fantastical of the fantasy shows.\\" Ahead of the series premiere on Australian Network ABC the Sydney Morning Heralds Robin Oliver predicted that older viewers \\"will find Eccleston easily the best time lord since Tom Baker.\\" However Harry Venning of The Stage, whilst enthusiastic about the revival of the show, labelled Eccleston as the \\"show's biggest disappointment\\" following the premiere episode, stating he looked uncomfortable in a fantasy role. The Guardian Stephen Kelly felt that Eccleston's Ninth Doctor had many faults, two of which he felt to be \\"looking like an EastEnders extra and bellowing \\"fantastic\\" at every opportunity\\". However, he felt that he \\"brought warmth, wit and promise\\" and a \\"formidable presence\\". Kelly believed that Eccleston was believable as a man who had destroyed two civilisations and was dealing with the repercussions and could have brought more to the show had Eccleston stayed for a second series. Seventh Doctor actor Sylvester McCoy praised Eccleston as being \\"quite alien\\" as the Doctor and that \\"we were not sure if he was on the edge of insanity or not, which was rather good.\\" Peter Davison, who played the Fifth Doctor, criticised Eccleston's decision to quit after a single series, stating \\"I don't think you can engage with the new Doctor in the way you should be able to.\\" In 2005 Christopher Eccleston won \\"Most Popular Actor\\" at the National Television Awards and the TV Quick and TV Choice award for Best Actor. He was also voted Best Actor by readers of SFX magazine. Eccleston was named Best Actor with 59.42% of the vote in BBC.co.uk's online \\"Best of Drama\\" poll in 2005. In a Doctor Who Magazine poll in 2006 Eccleston was voted the third greatest Doctor behind those portrayed by Tom Baker and David Tennant. In April 2011 IGN also listed Eccleston's Doctor as the third best Doctor, opining that he \\"gave us a tough-as-nails Doctor damaged by war and guilt, but still possessing the same spark of fun and adventure as his previous selves.\\" The entertainment website stated that in introducing a new generation to the show he \\"became an icon for a new millennium.\\" Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph named him the ninth best Doctor, noting that Eccleston was \\"a serious actor\\" and \\"his attempts at a lighter style could seem a tad forced\\", though this was \\"offset by his showdowns against the Daleks\\". Fuller also was disappointed that his \\"time was over all too swiftly\\". A 2012 poll conducted by the United States media news magazine Entertainment Weekly resulted in Eccleston being voted the fourth most popular Doctor, behind David Tennant, Matt Smith (the Eleventh Doctor) and Tom Baker.

It was Christchurch's first hotel. Hart, originally from Freshford, Somerset, England, was one of the first settlers of Christchurch. He was a colourful character and stood for elections to the Canterbury Provincial Council and Parliament, but was unsuccessful. He was elected onto Christchurch City Council in 1869, and was chosen as Mayor of Christchurch 1873‚Äì1874 by his fellow councillors. He gave the first chain to the Christchurch mayoral chain. He was the first mayor to wear regalia, modelled on the robes of the Lord Mayor of London. He intended to leave the robes to Christchurch City Council, but after a disagreement, he changed his will and the robes were buried with him. Early life Hart was born probably in 1814 in Freshford, Somerset, England. His parents were Paul Hart (yeoman, later a shearer) and his wife Mary Brennan (m. 28 October 1804). He was a plumber before he emigrated. Hart arrived in Lyttelton with his wife, Mary Ann Hart (n√©e Swan), and their sons Michael Brannan (1843‚Äì1908) and George Robert (1841‚Äì1911) on the Cressy on 27 December 1850, one of the First Four Ships reaching Canterbury. He was briefly in business in Lyttelton as a plumber with Henry Allwright. White Hart Hotel White Hart Hotel, 1902 proposed design High Street during the 1940s, with the White Hart Hotel on the right Hart and his family soon moved to Christchurch. Together with Charles Day of Sydney, he bought the block of land on the south-western side of High Street between Cashel Street and Lichfield Street. The family first lived on the site in a tent before Hart built an A-frame hut. On the High Street (then called Sumner Road) and Cashel Street corner, Hart founded the White Hart, the first hotel in Christchurch. The hotel opened on 15 November 1851, less than a year after the organised settlement of Christchurch. On 16 December 1852, Hart catered for 150 guests who had assembled to farewell John Robert Godley, the founder of Canterbury who returned to England after his short stay in the colony. Hart bought out Day in September 1854 for ‚Ç§525. A new building was built on the site in 1866. The trustees of the Hart estate decided to rebuild the White Hart Hotel in 1902. A design competition was called for and won by Sidney Luttrell. This competition win was the impetus for the Launceston-based Luttrell Brothers to move to Christchurch. The 1902 design, estimated to have cost ¬£25,000, was not built due to the No Licence vote at the election that year. A plainer design was built in 1905, which burned down three years later. A new building was erected behind the fa√ßade. The photo from the 1940s shows the White Hart Hotel to the right of the building that is these days occupied by Cheapskates. The site of the hotel is these days occupied by the Westpac high rise, which is soon to be demolished due to damage sustained in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Political career Hart stood for election to the Canterbury Provincial Council on several occasions and was always unsuccessful. Hart contested the November 1857 election for the 2nd Council, where six candidates stood for four positions in the Town of Christchurch electorate. Hart came fifth, only one vote behind the fourth candidate; the successful candidates were Richard Packer (165 votes), Charles Wellington Bishop (160 votes), Charles Berjew Fooks (152 votes) and Thomas Cass (96 votes). The 18 January 1860 Town of Christchurch by-election, caused by the resignation of Richard Packer from the Christchurch electorate, was contested by Hart and Henry Sewell, who had been New Zealand's first Premier in 1856. It was the general expectation that Sewell would be elected unopposed, but he faced strong criticism by the Lyttelton Times, whilst generally endorsing him for his obvious ability, the newspaper was demanding from him that he publicly talk about his policies and plans. Sewell eventually arranged a public meeting the evening prior to nomination day; this was the only public meeting during the election campaign. After a lengthy address, which was favourably received by the Lyttelton Times, Hart put his name forward at that meeting. Sewell won the election two days later. Hart returned to England for a few years. He returned and was elected to the Christchurch Town Council in 1869. Before 1916, elections for town, then city council, were held annually. Hart was again elected in 1872 and 1874. At the Christchurch City Council meeting on 17 December 1873, the outgoing mayor, Edward Bishop, was thanked for his service and presented by the city councillors with a gift. The councillors then proceeded to elect the next mayor from their midst. Councillor Calvert proposed Hart as mayor, as he had shown administrative skill as the chairman of the works committee. Councillor Fred Hobbs seconded the motion and Hart was elected unanimously. The former mayors William Wilson, John Anderson, James Jameson and Henry Sawtell were present at the meeting. Hart wore regalia at the occasion; the first Christchurch mayor to do so. It was a copy of the robes worn by the Lord Mayors of London and Hart had it made at his own cost. He also gave the first link to the Christchurch mayoral chain. During his term as mayor, the City Outfall Drain through Linwood, designed by Cornelius Cuff, was completed. Hart formally opened the drain by pouring a bottle of champagne into it. At the Christchurch City Council meeting on 16 December 1874, a new mayor was elected. The councillors decided unanimously on Fred Hobbs as the successor to Hart. Since his election of mayor almost exactly one year earlier, it was the first time that Hart wore the mayoral robes again. Hart intended to leave the robes to Christchurch City Council, but after a disagreement, he changed his will and the robes got buried with him on his death. Family and death Hart's first wife died on 1 June 1866 aged 53 years, and she was buried at Addington Cemetery. Hart remarried only a month later, on 3 July 1866, to Ellen Gardiner, witnessed by John Ollivier and William Wilson. They had five girls and one boy together. Hart died on 9 August 1878 at his home 'Freshford' in Lichfield Street, Christchurch. He was buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery. He had been ill for some time and not taken part in public life owing to illness. His second wife remarried on 19 February 1879 to Richard Norman Newby. Ellen Newby died in 1904 in Beckenham. She was buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery. Hartley Avenue in Strowan is named after his son Leonard Brannon Hart (1874‚Äì1960). Michael Hart gave the land for the first Town Hall, which was built on the corner of Hereford Street and Cathedral Square, from where one would look down Sumner Road (since renamed High Street).

The church is located in rural Solon, Iowa, United States. The property is on a gravel road east of Iowa Highway 1 between Solon and Mount Vernon in rural Johnson County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History Memorial to the old stone church located in the cemetery across the street. Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church was founded around 1861 to serve Czech Bohemian immigrants who began settling near Solon in 1854. It was the first Bohemian Catholic congregation in Iowa. with They initially met in area schoolhouses with or without a priest. The first church building used by the parish was built of stone and located across the road from the present building. The stone was quarried locally and the building was built by hand for $1,300. In time the building started to deteriorate and it was closed in 1916 and was torn down in 1938. A monument to the first church is located in the cemetery where its altar was located. Ground was broken for the present church building on April 18, 1916. It was dedicated on July 15, 1917. The Rev. Florian Svrdlik from St. Wenceslaus Church in Cedar Rapids, Iowa preached the sermon at the ceremony. The bid for constructing the building was $13,800. The parish, like many in rural Iowa, was a victim of declining numbers of clergy and people who opted to live and work on farms. On March 28, 1996, Bishop William Franklin announced in The Catholic Messenger that Saints Peter and Paul's would close by the end of June.Most Rev. Wm E. Franklin, Bishop of Davenport; Msgr. Leo Feeney, Chancellor, (March 28, 1996) \\"OFFICIAL: Closures\\" The Catholic Messenger, p. 3 The parish was merged with St. Mary's in Solon on June 30th of that year, and the church building was officially closed. Rev. Joseph Sparks of St. Mary's was placed in charge of pastoral management for corporate affairs. That same year members from the former parish organized to preserve the church building. They bought the church from the diocese for a dollar and raised funds to renovate the building. By 1998 the renovation project was completed and the facility is used for weddings and other events. Architecture The south elevation. Saints Peter and Paul Church is a structure that is composed of a steel frame covered with red brick and tile. The church is six bays in length. The first bay on the east end of the building is the towers and main entrance, it is followed by a four-bay nave that is divided by stepped buttresses, and the sixth bay on the west end contains the chancel, which is flanked by two sacristies. The main facade features two uneven towers that flank the man entrance. Above the entrance is an inscription in Czech: Sv. Pet≈ôe a Pavle Orodujte zanas! (Saints Peter and Paul pray for us!). The two towers are identical until the cornice level when the bell chamber on the south tower rises higher than that of the north tower. Brick corbels are located in the gables, and a circular window is located over the main entrance. Crosses are placed on the pyramid-shaped spires of both towers and on the peak of the gable. The church is built on a raised basement that was used for a parish hall. The interior is a single nave that is capped with a barrel vaulted ceiling. The Roman (round) arch predominates in the interior decor. It is found prominently in the chancel arch, the blind arches where the side altars are located, the reredos of the high altar, the stained glass windows, and the Stations of the Cross. The altars are carved wood with marbleized painted surfaces. Statues of St. Peter and St. Paul flank a central crucifix in the reredos. A bas-relief of the Last Supper is located on the altar frontal. One of the side altars contains a statue of the Infant of Prague. The primary altar used to celebrate the Mass in later years was from the first parish church. The windows in the nave depict images of saints, including those of Bohemian heritage, St. Wenceslaus, and those associated with agriculture, St. Barbara (patron saint of lightning) and St. Swithun (patron saint of drought). In the church's vestibule is a 19th-century painting portraying St. Peter and St. Paul, which was from Europe. Above the vestibule is a gallery that extends into the nave.

He is credited with having made significant improvements to the drainage system, and thus improving health in the wider Christchurch area. Upon his lobbying, The Christchurch District Drainage Act 1875 was passed, and Hobbs became the first chairman of the Christchurch Drainage Board. The family were tailors and the location of their business premises in the north-east quadrant of Cathedral Square gave the area the name of Hobbs' corner. Fred Hobbs commissioned a new building of permanent materials for the site, which became known as Cathedral Chambers and which stood there from the mid-1880s to the 1970s. The locality changed name to Broadway corner, based on the popular caf√© that occupied the first floor; this name is no longer in use in Christchurch. The Hobbs family was known for singing. Fred Hobbs was involved in establishing at least two choirs in Christchurch, and his son Frederick Henry Hobbs worked for the English D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Early life William Hobbs, the father of Fred Hobbs, during the 1860s Fred Hobbs at age 18 Hobbs was born in Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, England, in 1841. His parents were William (Bill) Hobbs and Maria Hobbs (n√©e Streek). The family knew George Gould senior (father of George Gould, the later director of The Press), who was an early immigrant to Christchurch. The letters that Gould senior sent home encouraged the Hobbs family to emigrate to Christchurch. The family with four children emigrated to New Zealand on the Caroline Agnes, and arrived in Lyttelton on 17 August 1855. Fred Hobbs had three siblings: *William Alfred Hobbs (4 March 1838 ‚Äì 12 August 1903), his older brother, married in 1862 at Holy Trinity Avonside and died at Timaru. *Anne (Annie) Hobbs (13 November 1839 ‚Äì 27 December 1900), his only sister, married the publican Jesse Hall of the Eastern Hotel (Cashel Street, Christchurch) and died at the hotel; she is buried at Linwood Cemetery. *Francis (Frank) Hobbs (3 December 1844 ‚Äì 20 January 1918), his younger brother, died in Christchurch and is buried at Linwood Cemetery. Hobbs was 13 when he left England; he received no further formal education in Christchurch, where the family settled. Professional life Cathedral Chambers, the Lyttelton Times Building, and Warner's Hotel (from left) in circa 1910 The Hobbs family had a business as tailors and woollen drapers. From 1858, they advertised as 'Hobbs & Son', and this changed to 'Hobbs & Sons' in August 1862. Whilst his father had come out to New Zealand to do manual labour, the demand for clothing was so great that he soon went back to his old trade. They leased the top floor of a building in the north-east quadrant of Cathedral Square, with a frontage to Colombo Street. The business name was prominently painted onto the weatherboard. Although the building was leased, it became known as Hobbs' Building, and over time, the north-east quadrant of the Square became known as Hobbs' corner (the latter name first appearing in the newspapers in 1868). Partners in the business were Fred Hobbs, his father William, and his brother William Alfred. The partnership was dissolved in August 1872, and his brother continued managing the branch in Timaru on his own account. The Christchurch business continued as 'Hobbs and Co', and at the time of the death of the company's founder in May 1878, it was the oldest business in Christchurch. In 1883, Hobbs and Co announced that they would replace the wooden building with a three-storey masonry structure. The building was designed by William Armson and was known as Cathedral Chambers. Hobbs' corner became known as Broadway corner, based on the popular caf√© that occupied the first floor. Cathedral Chambers was in turn replaced by the CML Building in 1975. Political career Before 1916, elections for Christchurch City Council were held annually. Hobbs was elected onto the city council four times: in 1870, 1873, 1875 and 1876. At the Christchurch City Council meeting on 16 December 1874, a new mayor was elected. The councillors decided unanimously on Hobbs as the successor to Michael Hart. Shortly after his election, Hobbs was sworn in as a Justice of the Peace. One of the dominant issues at the time was illness caused through poor drainage and open sewers. Just after the election, The Press devoted a detailed and long editorial to the topic, urging the council to act and to devise a solution that would not just address the issue in Christchurch, but also in the suburbs, which at the time were all under the control of separate councils. They praised Hobbs for the initiative that he had already shown as a councillor. Indeed, Hobbs invited suburban and local bodies to a conference in 1875 to tackle the issue in a comprehensive manner. The work and lobbying of Hobbs was instrumental in the establishment of The Christchurch District Drainage Act 1875. When the drainage board first met on 4 January 1876, Henry Tancred was proposed as chairman. H. J. Hall proposed Hobbs, not because he was the current Mayor of Christchurch, but because of his lobbying on the drainage question. After some discussion, the original motion was withdrawn, and Hobbs became the first chairperson of the Christchurch Drainage Board. During Hobbs' first term in office, The Municipal Corporations Acts Amendment Act, 1875, was passed, and this legislation stipulated that mayors had to be elected at large (i.e. by eligible voters). Hobbs was the only candidate nominated, so the returning officer, Edward Bishop, declared him elected unopposed on 17 December 1875. After having served two terms, Hobbs did not seek election for a third term. This was regretted by one of the local newspapers, The Star, as they regarded him as having \\"discharged his duties with a thoroughness and zeal which will not be readily equalled by his successor.\\" The mayor was for the first time elected by voters on 20 December 1876. The 20 December 1876 mayoral election was contested by James Gapes and Charles Thomas Ick, with Gapes representing working class interests, whereas Ick represented the wealthier part of the population. Gapes won the election, and was sworn in as mayor at the next Christchurch City Council meeting on 2 January 1877. In September 1883, a deputation asked Hobbs to run for a position on the city council again. He stood in the South-East Ward against the incumbent, Charles Kiver. Despite having the support of the influential John Ollivier and The Star newspaper, Kiver had a significant majority with 751 votes to 393. Hobbs was regarded as outspoken, and he was a man of strong opinions. In an editorial, The Star described him thus: > We admire the blunt, outspoken honesty of purpose which Mr Hobbs possesses > in an eminent degree. Everybody, we imagine, will admit that he forms his > own opinions on men and things, and that those opinions are fearlessly > stated and acted upon when occasion serves. Later in 1883, it is said that Hobbs \\"seems to have faded from the scene\\". Community involvement Hobbs was a founding member of the choir of St John the Baptist Church. He was also a founding member of the Christchurch Liedertafel, a choir founded in 1885 that still exists today. For the Liedertafel choir, he acted as treasurer and librarian. Family and death Waitati Cemetery, with plot 22 the unmarked grave of Fred Hobbs On 5 July 1866, Hobbs married Elizabeth (Bessie) Hobbs (n√©e Murray) at St John's Church, Ferry Road, Woolston. His wife was born on 17 April 1846 in Taunton, England. They had nine sons and three daughters: *Edith Mary Hobbs (17 April 1867 ‚Äì ?) *Francis William (Harry) Hobbs (24 March 1869 ‚Äì 1 March 1958 in Christchurch) *Miriam Ellen Hobbs (15 March 1871 in Christchurch ‚Äì 18 April 1957 in Christchurch) *Lewis Frederick Charles Balfour Hobbs (1 February 1873 in Taunton, England ‚Äì May 1873 in Taunton) *Frederick Henry Hobbs (29 July 1874 in Christchurch ‚Äì 11 April 1942) *John Leonard Hobbs (29 August 1876 in Christchurch ‚Äì ?) *Charles Hubert Hobbs (20 March 1878 in Christchurch ‚Äì 10 July 1957 in Christchurch) *Reginald James Hobbs (1 October 1879 in Christchurch ‚Äì 14 February 1994) *Hugh Septimus Hobbs (9 November 1880 in Christchurch ‚Äì 6 February 1963 in Christchurch) *Kenneth (Keith) Murray Hobbs (3 January 1882 Christchurch ‚Äì September 1882 in Christchurch) *Bessie Gertrude Hobbs (24 April 1883 Christchurch ‚Äì 24 December 1974) *Alan Edgar Hobbs (8 December 1887 Christchurch ‚Äì 21 December 1973), who got married at Holy Trinity Church in Devonport, Auckland. The Hobbs family had a musical background. Fred Hobbs was well known as a singer; his cousin J. W. Hobbs was a tenor in England who trained William Hayman Cummings. His son Francis William, known as Harry, was also known for his singing. His son Frederick Hobbs made an international career and worked with and then for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The 1858 jury list shows the Hobbs family as living in Armagh Street. In 1875, the family was living in Gloucester Street opposite Christchurch East School. Fred Hobbs died at Waitati near Dunedin on 13 May 1920. He is buried at Waitati Cemetery in block 10 plot 22. His grave is unmarked.

It is an example of Queen Anne Style brick architecture in the Salt River Valley.  Biography of Niels Petersen  Niels Petersen was born on October 21, 1845, to Peder Mikkelsen and Gunder Marie Nisdatter in Vilslev, Denmark, a small farming village in the southwestern portion of that country. Petersen spent several years in the English Merchant Marines, beginning in 1863, allowing him to travel the world. He continued in this stead until 1870, when he immigrated to the United States. In 1871, Petersen arrived in the Salt River Valley of central Arizona, where he decided to stake a homestead claim and begin farming. He filed a declaratory statement on July 1, 1874, claiming in section 29, southwest of Tempe (the original homestead is currently bordered by Priest, southern, Alameda and 52nd Streets). After submitting his claim, Petersen began work on the construction of a two-room adobe house. Four years later, in 1878, Petersen became a United States citizen and subsequently filed a homestead entry, the next step in permanently establishing himself in the valley. The final action in this process was the filing of a homestead proof, providing evidence that improvements to the land had been made by the claimant, which Petersen filed on May 12, 1883. By the time of his final homestead filing, Petersen had built two small adobe houses on the property and maintained in cultivation. Among his various undertakings was the operation of Tempe founder Charles Hayden‚Äôs general store when he was away on business. Additionally, he worked for the Tempe Irrigating Canal Company, eventually earning shares in the company. In 1884, Peterson married Isabel Dumphy, a teacher at Tempe Grammar School; Isabel subsequently resigned from her teaching position and moved into the Petersen house. She died during child birth one year later, in 1885, and their infant son, John Petersen, is believed to have likewise died within months of his birth. Within a few years, Petersen began acquiring properties surrounding his homestead claim, thus expanding his interest in the area. His ranch grew to more than and Petersen emerged as one of the area's leading producers of cattle and grain. Graves of Niels and Susanna Petersen located within the property which they once owned. As his financial interests grew, so too did his involvement in the Tempe community. Petersen served as a trustee for the Tempe School District and was a member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, thus asserting his interest in local education. He played a role in the development of the Tempe Methodist Episcopal Church, the Bank of Tempe, and the Tempe Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, which was chartered on March 5, 1888. Other positions held by Petersen included treasurer of the Tempe Irrigating Canal Company, president of the Farmers and Merchants Bank, and a term on the Arizona's Eighteenth Territorial Legislature from 1895-1896. By the 1890s, Petersen had emerged as one of the Salt River Valley's wealthiest and most revered citizens. In 1892, he made the decision to construct a new home, in the Queen Anne Victorian style. Architect James Creighton was commissioned by Petersen to design the new two-story home to be constructed at Petersen's ranch south of town. While the new home was being built, Petersen traveled back east, where he met his future bride Susanna Decker of South Montrose, Pennsylvania. They were married on September 1, 1892, and when he returned to his new house in Tempe his new wife accompanied him. Upon completion, Petersen's house was widely considered one of the most elegant homes in the region. Niels Petersen died in Tempe on April 27, 1923, at the age of 78. As a testament to his status in the community, flags were flown at half-mast and all schools and businesses were closed during his funeral. Originally buried in Tempe's Double Buttes Cemetery, he was exhumed and reburied on the grounds of his home next to the grave of his wife Susanna.  History of the house  The house is significant as the oldest Queen Anne Style brick residence in the Salt River Valley. When Rev. Edward Decker inherited the house in 1927, he made modifications. The house is associated with Niels Petersen, a Danish immigrant and prominent local farmer and entrepreneur. It is further important for its design by James Creighton, a well-known Arizona architect. The house was built for Petersen who came to Tempe in 1871 and developed substantial land holdings, was president of a local bank, co-founder of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and representative at the 18th Territorial Legislature. Creighton, the architect, worked for many years in Arizona, and among his extant works are the Pinal County Courthouse, Old Main (Arizona State University), and the Tempe Hardware Building on Mill Ave. in Tempe. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

History The station first broadcast under the callsign KACL May 14, 1993. It then changed to KMKZ on August 1, 1993. Briefly the station became KNID from July 12, 2000 to July 24, 2000 when it received its current callsign, KXLS. KXLS was also formerly the call sign for KOMA. The KXLS call letters first appeared in northwest Oklahoma at 99.7 FM in early 1981. Using a frequency assigned to Alva, the station had a primary studio on Broadway near downtown Enid while using an auxiliary studio in Alva on weekend mornings. The initial owner was Zumma Broadcasting, with main owner William Lacy serving as General Manager. Lacy purchased an Oklahoma City FM station in the early 80's, changed its call letters to KZBS and played music very similar to KXLS. Both were modeled after the success of KVIL-FM in Dallas. For a short period, long- time KVIL afternoon host Mike Selden was part of the KXLS lineup. KXLS called itself \\"Class FM,\\" and gained national attention in the summer of 1982 for its \\"Zumma Beach\\" promotion. A hot tub was set up outside the station door, with sand surrounding it to give the impression of an oceanside beach hundreds of miles from the coast.

Forming out of a tropical disturbance on March 9, 2010, designated 14F by the Fiji Meteorological Service, the system gradually organized within an environment favoring intensification. By March 11, the disturbance had strengthened sufficiently to be classified as Tropical Cyclone Tomas, the eighth named storm of the 2009-10 South Pacific cyclone season. Modest intensification took place over the following few days, with the system attaining severe tropical cyclone status on March 13\\\\. On March 14, Tomas began to impact parts of Fiji while continuing to gain strength. As it passed near Vanua Levu on March 15, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) and a pressure of 930 hPa (mbar) according to the FMS. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed it as a Category 4 equivalent storm with 1-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (135 mph). Cyclone Tomas proved to be very destructive throughout Fiji, leaving many homeless and entire villages under water. At least one person has been confirmed to have been killed by the storm after being swept out to sea while rescuing family members. Reports from outlying islands state that entire homes have been flattened by wind gusts up to . Meteorological history Shortly after the first advisory on Tropical Disturbance 13F was issued on March 9, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began monitoring a new disturbance, designated 14F, further east. The following day, deep convection began to develop around the disturbance's low-level circulation, prompting the JTWC to begin monitoring it for possible cyclonic development. Later on March 10, the FMS upgraded the system to a tropical depression as it continued to become better organized. Located within an environment characterized by low wind shear, further intensification was anticipated as convection continued to develop over the expanding system. Around 1500 UTC on March 11, the JTWC issued their first advisory on the cyclone, classifying it as Tropical Storm 19P. Several hours later, the FMS upgraded the system to a Category 1 cyclone and gave it the name Tomas. Rapid intensification was expected to take place over the following 48 hours as sea surface temperatures ahead of the storm averaged , well-above the threshold for tropical cyclone development. Cyclones Tomas (right) and Ului (left) on 16 March Throughout the day on March 12, Tomas steadily intensified, and early the next day, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 equivalent hurricane with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Convective banding substantially increased on March 13, allowing Tomas to become the fourth severe tropical cyclone of the season early the next morning. Around the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm to have attained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), ranking it as a Category 2 cyclone. By the afternoon of March 14, Tomas had developed a banding-eye feature surrounded by deep convection. At this point, the FMS assessed the storm to have winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and a pressure of 950 hPa (mbar). The JTWC also noted further intensification, upgrading Tomas to a Category 3 equivalent storm. As it passed near Vanua Levu on March 15, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) and a pressure of 930 hPa (mbar) according to the FMS. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed it as a Category 4 equivalent storm with 1-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (135 mph). Impact One person was killed on Vanua Levu after being swept out to sea by large swells while trying to rescue her two sisters, a niece and a nephew near Namilamila Bay. In the northernmost islands of Fiji, communication with Cikobia and Qelelevu was lost on March 15 as the cyclone passed through the region. Officials feared that severe damage and loss of life occurred on the island. Many homes along rivers and the Pacific were washed away by rising waters and tides exceeding . Parts of the region have been soaked with upwards of of rain over a two-day span with more falling. Power and running water was disrupted to numerous islands, forcing thousands to seek shelter. During the initial assessment of damage, at least 50 homes were confirmed to have been destroyed by Tomas. This prompted Fijian officials to declare a State of disaster for the northern and eastern divisions of Fiji. On its way, the cyclone has passed near Futuna island, heavily damaging an important part of houses and other buildings and cutting the water and electricity supply, but leaving no human casualties. The most severed was the north-eastern part of the island and notably the village of Poi and its surroundings. There, the islands only road was washed away and most of the houses were completely demolished by strong wind and rising waves. After the storm, the governments of New Zealand and Australia each sent $1 million in their respective currencies to Fiji. The New Zealand Air Force sent relief supplies, including tarps and water purifying equipment.

It is located at 150 Katimavik Road, south of Highway 417, in the Katimavik-Hazeldean community of the Kanata area. It contains approximately of gross floor area. Once intended as the first phase of a central business district for the (then) City of Kanata, the focal point of the planned commercial core for Kanata was later shifted to lands to the north of Highway 417.Batt, Diana. Kanata Town Centre Plan Finally Approved, Ottawa Citizen, 18 January 1980, page 4. The office component of the Kanata Town Centre served as the City of Kanata's first permanent city hall. History In 1978, March Township was amalgamated with parts of Goulbourn Township and of Nepean Township to form the new City of Kanata. Prior to the amalgamation, March Township Council proposed the development a new \\"Town Centre\\", located in the geographic centre of the urban portion of the new municipality, to serve as a new retail and office core for what would become Kanata. Before the plans for the first phase of the proposed Town Centre were completed, Goulbourn Township approved a competing proposal for a new shopping centre, later named Hazeldean Mall, in the part of Goulbourn that would be joining the new municipality. March Township Council initiated legal action, ultimately unsuccessful, to significantly reduce the size of the Hazeldean Mall development on the grounds that it would adversely affect the market potential of the Town Centre.Conners, Stanikys. Hazeldean Mall gets green light from Goulbourn, Ottawa Journal, 9 August 1978, page 13; Jackson, Wendy. Glen Cairn shopping centre approved, Ottawa Citizen, 9 August 1978, page 4; March carrying on the fight over Hazeldean shopping mall, Ottawa Journal, 16 August 1978, page 3. The first phase of the Kanata Town Centre was developed by Campeau Corporation and opened on August 19, 1981, almost two years after the opening of the much larger Hazeldean Mall. The main tenants in the mall component of the Town Centre were a Loblaws supermarket, a Boots pharmacy, a Brewers Retail outlet and a Cineplex cinema. The City of Kanata's municipal offices and Council chamber were located in the office component. All of these tenants, except the supermarket (now a Food Basics), have since relocated elsewhere. The lands surrounding the Kanata Town Centre building remained largely undeveloped. In 2000, the City of Kanata approved a plan to shift the focus on the city's town centre central business district to lands to the north, on the other side of Highway 417 and away from the existing Kanata Town Centre building. The town centre developments to the north initially consisted mainly of big-box store retail development, but subsequent phases included the more pedestrian-oriented urban development originally contemplated for Kanata's core. Transportation The OC Transpo transit hub was moved from the Kanata Town Centre north to the big-box Kanata Centrum retail centre in 2005 with the construction of Terry Fox Station. Rapid- transit route 96 and local route 168 continued to stop at the building entrance of the Kanata Town Centre until 20 April 2014, when OC Transpo stopped diverting buses onto the Town Centre property. Both routes were still available on nearby Katimavik Road until 28 June 2015, when route 168 was re- routed through Beaverbrook and Marchwood-Lakeside. Kanata Town Centre served as a Greyhound bus (passenger and cargo) pick-up and drop-off. In 2016, Greyhound service also moved to the Terry Fox Station.Greyhound References Category:Buildings and structures in Ottawa ","title":"Kanata Town Centre"},{"id":"26564840","text":"Harris Academy FPRFC is a rugby union club based in Dundee, Scotland, that was founded for the former pupils of Harris Academy on 5 November 1926. The club ceased to exist throughout the latter part of the 1990s and the early 2000s due to dwindling numbers. However, the club was reformed in August 2007 by former players combined with a large senior squad of players who had left the school the previous season. Those places had had a successful tour to Latvia in which they beat a local club side before beinvolved beaten by a Latvian under 19 select squad. The club plays its home games at Elliot Road and a new partnership with the Hillcrest Bowling Club who provide a club house offering post-match food and beverages. Harris FP's currently compete in Caledonia Midlands League 2 having been relegated in the 2018/19 season. The club are currently going through a rebuilding phase during a difficult time for rugby in Dundee with player numbers dwindling across the city. Despite this, the club committee, under the leadership of current President Mr Marc Wilson have worked tirelessly to develop the club and alongside the coaching team have increased player number to 40 registered players for the current season. The club is coached by Ryan Beattie (Head Coach) and club stalwart Kenny Clarkson (Assistant Coach) with training sessions held on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at Elliot Road. Player numbers are bolstered with excellent links with the Higher Education institutions in Dundee with some excellent young players pulling on the hoops in recent years.  2008/09 season In this season, Harris made its first real promotion fight. The club began the season by making Bruce \\"Brucee\\" Beckett Head Coach; he far exceeded their coaching expectations having been with the much better Dundee HSFP. Under his direction Harris narrowly missed out on promotion to Alloa RFC, and reached the 3rd round of the Scottish Cup competition where they were narrowly defeated by Hillfoots RFC (a club 3 leagues above Harris).  2007/08 season  Pre-season training began in late June for the club's first season back at competitive level. Numbers were constantly increasing in the buildup to the season, with Harris playing \\"friendly\\" warm up matches in the form of Madras RFC and an inner squad match. Coaching for this season came largely in the form of sessions taken by Kenneth Clarkson at both Elliot Road when weather permitted it and in the Harris Academy boys gym. On match day Bruce Dyer (club treasurer) acted largely as the club manager. In this season the club qualified for the top half of the split, as they finished in the top half of the league after round 1 of games eventually finishing 5th in the Caledonia 2 proving that they were a more than adequate addition to the roster. The club reached the quarter finals of the Scottish Plate competition who were they eliminated by eventual winners Aberdeen University RFC. The club went on to tour to Whitley Bay and Newcastle where they competed in a 10-a-side tournament.

The Zosimades () or Zosimas brothers were 18th-19th century Greek benefactors and merchants. The Zosimades were six brothers: *Ioannis Zosimas (1752‚Äì1771) *Anastasios Zosimas (1754‚Äì1828) *Nikolaos Zosimas (1758‚Äì1842) *Theodosios Zosimas (1760‚Äì1793) *Zois Zosimas (1764‚Äì1828) *Michael Zosimas (1766‚Äì1809) They were born in Ioannina, a city that was under Ottoman rule and a major center of the Greek Enlightenment that time. Their father was a local merchant, Panagis Zosimas. At 1875, Nikolaos, Theodosios and Michael started their trading activities in Livorno, Italy, while Ioannis, Anastasios and Zois ran their trade business in Nizhyn (Ukraine) and then in Moscow. Their trade network soon became profitable and they managed to make a fortune. Benefaction After Theodosis' death (1793), he wrote in his testament that they should financially support the education of their home city Ioannina. So they donated astronomical amounts of money for the establishment and function of various schools and public libraries. Another huge donation went for the National Library, of Adamantios Korais, one of the major contributors of the Greek Enlightenment movement. Apart from educational institutions, orphanages were also financed. The Zosimades also subsidized the publication of several books. At 1820, after Zois' death, they supported the establishment of a new school in their home place, which became known as Zosimaia. This institution would become the center of Greek education the following century in the region of Epirus. During the following outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1830) the remaining Zosimades became active members of the patriotic organization Philiki Etaireia and supported financially the struggle. Zosimades also completely financed the erection of the Monetary Museum of Athens, donating their personal collection of Ancient Greek and Roman currency, as well as the orphanage in Patmos.

The church building is located on the corner of 4th and Court Streets in downtown Ottumwa, Iowa, United States. It is part of the Central Park area, which is the civic center of the community. It includes: the Wapello County Courthouse, the Ottumwa Public Library, and the Ottumwa City Hall. The church is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, but it has not been listed. History Old St. Mary's Church (right) and the courthouse. St. Mary of the Visitation Parish was established in 1849 when Bishop Mathias Loras of the Diocese of Dubuque sent the Rev. Jean Villars from St. John the Evangelist in Keokuk to purchase two lots for the church and rectory and a larger piece of land for a cemetery in Louisville, as Ottumwa was known at the time. The price paid for the church property and that for a cemetery was $1,100. He organized the congregation and supervised the building of a small brick church. Rev. Alexander Hattenberger was sent to be pastor of the entire Des Moines Valley in 1850. He was the first priest to celebrate Mass in what would become Des Moines. However, he found the assignment too difficult and in 1853 he was transferred to St. Joseph‚Äôs Church in Fort Madison. He was replaced by a newly ordained priest, the Rev. John Kreckel, who stayed in Ottumwa until his death in 1899. Not only was he responsible for Ottumwa and Wapello County, but his territory also covered Jefferson, Van Buren, Keokuk, Mahaska, Polk, Jasper, Marion, Monroe, Davis, Appanoose, Wayne and Decatur Counties. He founded churches in Eddyville, Georgetown, and Bauer. A new and larger church building was constructed of stone in 1860 on the site of the present church. Two other parishes were established in Ottumwa, which reduced St. Mary‚Äôs in size. St. Patrick‚Äôs was established on the south side of town in 1879. Both parishes became part of the Diocese of Davenport when it was established in 1881. Ottumwa‚Äôs third parish, Sacred Heart, was started on the east side of town in 1897. It closed in the 1990s. The number of Spanish speaking people have moved into the Ottumwa area, and Masses are celebrated in Spanish at St. Mary‚Äôs. Church Building By the 1920s it was determined the church building was too small for the growing congregation, so plans were made to replace it with the current structure. The present St. Mary of the Visitation Church was designed by C.I. Krajewski, an architect from Dubuque, Iowa. He designed the building in the Late Gothic Revival style, which was popular at the time. The building features an asymmetrical facade with a corner bell tower. The exterior is constructed of blocks of Bedford limestone. The tower is crenellated across the top, and features finials on three of the corners and a copper-covered lantern topped by a cross on the fourth. The main entrance of the church is deeply recessed within a Gothic arched opening. The original wooden doors matched the tympanum area's inset panels above the doors. The doors were replaced to meet fire code. On either side of the front doors is a carved fleur-de-lis, a symbol of purity that is used to represent the Blessed Virgin Mary under whose patronage the church is dedicated. The interior reveals a traditional Latin Cross floor plan. The long, narrow nave ends in the altar area. Before the altar is the transept wing that forms the cross. Two side aisles flank the main nave and are separated from the nave with Gothic arches. The interior walls are constructed of tannish-brown brick, highlighted by inset carved stone panels. The altar area was simplified following the Second Vatican Council. The ceiling is built on large wooden trusses that hold up ornately painted ceiling panels. Large stained glass clerestory windows line the walls of the main nave and depict different saints. Narrow windows light the side aisles. All of the windows in the church were created by Emil Frei, Inc. of St. Louis, Missouri. The light fixtures were designed and constructed by the Beardslee Chandelier Company of Chicago, Illinois. A large pipe organ was placed in the church in the 1990s. Catholic schools In 1862 the Visitation Sisters established a convent and academy for girls. In 1877 the Congregation of the Humility of Mary started a school for boys in the basement and in one other room of the rectory. In 1890 they purchased the Visitation convent and academy for their motherhouse and were responsible for the education of both the boys and the girls at the parish school. In 1926 St Mary‚Äôs added high school grades to the school. In 1935 the three Ottumwa parishes joined to support Central Catholic High School. A new high school building was built in 1954 and the school was renamed Walsh. In 1970 the Catholic people of Ottumwa voted to close Walsh, along with all the parish grade schools in Ottumwa. There was an attempt to raise money to save the schools, but the campaign came up short. In 1975 a new grade school, supported by all three Ottumwa parishes, was opened and named Seton. Classes were held in the St. Mary‚Äôs and St. Patrick‚Äôs school buildings.

The film is based on three short stories from the 1951 collection The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury: \\"The Veldt,\\" \\"The Long Rain,\\" and \\"The Last Night of the World.\\" Plot Set in the backroads of America, the film enacts three of Bradbury's short stories set in the future, with Steiger as a man named Carl telling tales behind some of his tattoos, which he insists are not to be called tattoos, but only ever \\"skin illustrations\\", which come to life and tell the illustration's story when stared at directly. The stories are about virtual reality (\\"The Veldt\\"), a mysterious planet (\\"The Long Rain\\") and the end of the world (\\"The Last Night of the World\\"). Carl, accompanied by his dog, Peke, tells his tales to Willie, a traveler. The tie-in prologue tells of how Carl came to be tattooed after he encountered a mysterious woman named Felicia (Claire Bloom) in a remote farmhouse. The plot comes to a terrifying conclusion when Willie looks at the only blank patch of skin on Carl's body and sees an image of his own murder at Carl's hands. Willie attempts to kill Carl and then flees into the night, pursued by a still-living Carl, with the audience left undetermined as to Willie's fate. Story summaries * \\"The Veldt\\" - Parents in a futuristic society worry about their children's mental health when their new virtual reality nursery, which can produce any environment the children imagine, continually projects an African veldt populated by lions feasting on carcasses. A child psychologist suggests that the automated house is not good for the children's development, and insists they disable the automation and become more self-sufficient. The children are not pleased with this decision, but later coolly agree to it. The children trap their parents in the nursery, where they become prey to the lions. They later have lunch on the veldt with the child psychologist, who sees the lions feasting. Unlike the original story, the psychologist realises what has happened and is horrified. * \\"The Long Rain\\" - A group of astronauts are stranded on Venus, where it rains continually and heavily. The travelers make their way across the Venusian landscape to find a \\"sun dome\\", a shelter with a large artificial light source. The first sun dome they find has been destroyed by the native Venusians. Searching for another sun dome, the characters, one by one, are driven to madness and suicide by the unrelenting rhythm of the rain. At the end of the story, only one sane astronaut remains to find a functional sun dome. *\\"The Last Night of the World\\" - Every adult on Earth has had the same vision of the Earth ending that night. A husband tells his wife that the ruling council has decided that there is nothing else to do except await the inevitable, and not to tell any children of this (to spare them). The couple and their children go through their normal routines, knowing and accepting the fact that there is no tomorrow. Unlike the original story, the ruling council has decided that all children will be put to death painlessly to spare them \\"the end\\" by taking a poison pill before going to bed, but the couple awaken the next morning to find the Earth did not end and are horrified that they have needlessly killed their children. Cast * Rod Steiger as Carl * Claire Bloom as Felicia * Robert Drivas as Willie * Don Dubbins as Pickard * Jason Evers as Simmons * Tim Weldon as John * Christine Matchett as Anna Production The Illustrated Man comprises three science fiction short stories from Ray Bradbury's collection of short stories The Illustrated Man. Howard B. Kreitsek wrote the screenplay that encompassed the stories \\"The Veldt,\\" \\"The Long Rain,\\" and \\"The Last Night of the World\\"; Jack Smight directed the film. Bradbury was not consulted for the adaptation. Since the collection included eighteen short stories, Smight chose three stories and used the carnival sideshow freak who appeared in the collection's prologue and epilogue as the film's primary narrative. As the tattooed man, the director cast Rod Steiger, whom he had known since the 1950s. Reception The Illustrated Man was considered a critical and financial failure. Time wrote, \\"Responsibility for the failure of The Illustrated Man must rest with Director Jack Smight. He has committed every possible error of style and taste, including the inexcusable fault of letting Steiger chew up every piece of scenery in sight.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Kreitsek's screenplay is unsharp, without focus, working into and out of the hallucinations with great awkwardness.\\" Canby found the film to have \\"moments of eerie beauty\\" but believed that the director was limited by the screenplay. The critic said, \\"Everything remains foetus-like and underdeveloped, although shrouded in misty pretensions of grandeur.\\" Echoing Canby, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \\"Smight's confused, wandering film never does quite come to terms with what it wants to be.\\" Ebert pointed out the film's weaknesses to be acting and character but did not find them to be fatal. He believed that the film's major flaw was \\"inadequate attention\\" to the audience's expectations, distracting it with logic and lack of logic in the film's three stories. He concluded, \\"And so the film finally doesn't work for the same reason that comic Westerns usually fail: Because it's risky to fool around with a genre unless you know what you're doing.\\" Ray Bradbury said: \\"Rod was very good in it, but it wasn't a good film ... the script was terrible.\\" According to John Stanley, \\"a major disappointment, for producer Howard B. Kreitsek's script fails to capture the poetry or imagination of Ray Bradbury's famous collection. Jack Smight is too conventional a director to give this the technique it screams out for.\\"John Stanley. Creature Features: The Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Movie Guide\\". NY: Berkley Boulevard, Aug 2000 (updated ed), p. 260 The film was nominated for the 1970 \\"Best Dramatic Presentation\\" Hugo Award, but did not win. When The Illustrated Man was released on DVD in 2006, a retrospective review of the film wrote that the counterculture of the 1960s was evident in the film and that its depiction of the future did not age well. The 2019 Quentin Tarantino film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood features a radio advertisement of The Illustrated Man, as well as appearing on the film's soundtrack. Remake In August 2007, Zack Snyder signed on to direct a remake of The Illustrated Man with Watchmen co- screenwriter Alex Tse as screenwriter.

Currently the manuscript is dated by the INTF to the 12th or 13th century. The manuscript was presented by Presbyter Nicephorus in 1291 to the Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula. It was brought from Sinai to Berlin by Heinrich Brugsch (along with the codex 653 and Minuscule 654). Wilhelm Wattenbach published a facsimile of one pager of the codex in 1876. Gregory saw the manuscript in 1887. It was housed in Berlin in the Preu√üische K√∂nigliche Bibliothek (then Prussian State Library, then Berlin State Library) with the shelf-number Gr. quarto 47. At the end of 1943, the frequency of the bombing of Berlin increased. The Prussian State Library sent many collections out of Berlin to be sheltered in Silesia for safekeeping.

Trinity Accies competes in the East Regional League Division Two.  History = Early days  Trinity Accies has not been a club to keep detailed records. As a result, details from its earliest days are impossible to establish. The club's earliest challenge games began in 1913/14 from get-togethers of former Trinity Academy pupils (opened in 1892 as Craighall Road School) in a shelter at Starbank Park, Newhaven. The players formed a team to play challenge matches against the lower ranks of existing clubs. The \\"Lomond\\" Trinity had no link to the school. They became members of the SRU in 1903 and played in purple and white hoops. They amalgamated with Edinburgh Borderers in 1945, becoming Trinity Borderers until 1947. Early Trinity Accies games were played at Victoria Park on an irregular basis with the club playing in blue with a red badge bearing the Leith Coat of Arms. After the war the club changed to black with a gold band as their playing jersey.  Between the wars  No rugby was played during World War I. In October 1920 (the season was October to March) the club resumed playing on a regular basis. Between the 2 World Wars Trinity was a lower grade, fairly average in terms of results, junior club. Frank Trotter, then Executive Officer of Education for Leith, gave the club access to a regular home ground, Bangholm, which was opened on 2 December 1920. Fixtures in the 1920s and 1930s were mainly with still familiar clubs: RDVC (probably the strongest junior club over this 20 years), Leith Accies, Broughton, Boroughmuir, Bruntsfield, Edinburgh Borderers, Linlithgow, Moray House, Edinburgh Northern, Lismore, Penicuik and Lasswade. Less familiar names now largely forgotten include: Brunstane, Kenard, Westhall, Warriston, Gala Star, Edinburgh Rover Scouts, Kenmore, United Colleges, James Clarks FP, Grange, Broxburn HSFP, Balvaird and Dunedin. Away games took place at equally forgotten grounds: Forkenford, Broom Park, Ravelston, Hillend, Lady Napiers Park and Morgan Park. From 1926‚Äì1931 the standard of play improved when James Hossack was appointed captain. He had played for Boroughmuir before being appointed as Head Geography teacher at Trinity Academy, which led to representative recognition for Trinity players with the Edinburgh Junior side (Edinburgh and District Union) for the first time. As early as 5 November 1929 short reports on some of the club's games appeared in the press. On that date Trinity Accies beat Trinity at Lomond Park: \\"... with tries scored by Armstrong, Cowe and Furnivall.\\"  After the war  Few games were played during World War II. 7-a-side tournaments were played at Bangholm in 1942 and 1943. Most senior clubs expected lower teams to beat their 2nds over a number of years before they would be considered for a 1st xv fixture. It was ranked by percentage of wins against these teams. Trinity started being featured in the 1963/64 season's table until 1972‚Äì73. Few games were played in 1945‚Äì46 with former players returning from the war. However, 14‚Äì6 and 24‚Äì3 wins over Fettes and 6‚Äì8 and 12‚Äì14 losses to Edinburgh Wanderers / Academicals (\\"Charie Maclean scoring 3 tries\\") suggest playing improvements since before the war. By the 1950s we had regular fixtures with: Melrose, Langholm, Stewarts, Edinburgh Wanderers, Melville College and Selkirk (who by tradition we played away on 1 January.) Fixtures were slowly improving and the club joined the SRU as a full member in 1950. The goal was always to create a fixture list which would lead to the Press including us in the unofficial championship. A strong run of results ‚Äì including victories over Stewarts (in a year when they won the championship), Melrose, RHS, Selkirk and Langholm ‚Äì led to our appearing in the league table from 1963‚Äì64. At the end of the 1964‚Äì65 season Trinity Accies were ranked 17th of the 35 teams in the championship.  The arrival of the leagues  After many years in favour of an organised league structure, Trinity gave its full support to the SRU's proposal to introduce a formal system in 1973. Twelve teams were placed in each league playing each other once.

In September 1968 the backs with a number of forwards making up the numbers, all played in the club's 65-0 win over Melville College‚Äîa 95-0 win using current scoring values. The game took place a week after 5 of the club's backs played in a full Edinburgh trial. Of these Gordon Connell was our first Scottish international and British Lion, Graeme Plenderleith played for Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Rab Murdoch played for Edinburgh.  7-a-side  Little had been heard of the club in pre-war 7s. On 16 April 1945 the club's 7s were won for the first time. Reports list the team as: A Fairfull, D Graham, C Hepburn, J Meikle, E Cessford, G Armstrong and J Scott, with victories over Leith 15-0, Stewarts 9-0 and Edinburgh Wanderers / Accies 8-0. Unfortunately, after they won their first tie, \\"howling wind and torrential rain\\" stopped the 7s for the first time in 24 years. With more tournaments being started Trinity continued to have many successes. Walkerburn was won for the first time in 1948 with an 11-10 victory over Hawick Y M in the final. Many wins at Walkerburn were to follow. Stirling County started its own 7s in 1948. The club won the first three finals. Peebles and Moray were other venues where cups were won on a number of visits.  Youth/School  Over the years the efforts of Alex Harper, Alan Spencer, and the long term rector Peter Galloway have kept the club well-supplied with players from school.  Touring  Early trips to Chesterfield have been followed by more exotic tours including Burnham (England), Hanover (Germany), Juan les Pins (France), St Gallen (Switzerland), Munich (Germany) and Avignon (France). Trinity Accies have hosted teams from all over the world.

The juvenile spiral portion has a deep indentation on the ventral side of the aperture for the water-jet funnel, known as a hyponomic sinus, that becomes broad and shallow in the straight-shelled adult portion.

Prof. James Cumming (26 September 1777 ‚Äì 10 November 1861) was the ninth Professor of Chemistry in Cambridge from 1815 to 1860. Cumming is remembered for his research-led teaching and his lectures during which he would literally shock the audience with a galvanic apparatus. He was also known to electrocute a cat during a demonstration. Childhood and education Cumming was born in Piccadilly, London, on 26 September 1777, but his home moved to the Buxton Hall Hotel (now called Old Hall Hotel) in Buxton where his father was the hotelier from 1791. His father rented the hall, which had been a home to Mary, Queen of Scots, from the 5th Duke of Devonshire. His father was considered socially more than a mere hotelier, and the hotel's clientele included bishops and visiting aristocracy. Cumming was sent to school at Marlborough before he became a student at Trinity College, Cambridge. Graduating he took holy orders earlier than most aspiring academics under the Bishop of Lincoln, George Tomline, in 1802. Career Cumming was appointed to the professorship in 1815, although no records survive of his work prior to that date. Like all professors at that time, he had to compete with rival professors for the attention of his students. Study of his curriculum reveals that he was keeping abreast of the current research in his subject. In 1816 he was admitted to the Royal Society, in company with Lord Byron, as well as the Geological Society. All Saints' Church in North Runcton where Cumming was rector. In 1819 he was given the rectorship of North Runcton near King's Lynn. This small Norfolk parish of 400 people was \\"in the gift\\" of Trinity College and Daniel Gurney, the banker. With this substantial income he was able to marry Sarah Humphrey of Cambridge. In the same year Cumming was a founder member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.(Cumming was later to serve as its President) Cumming was said to lecture every day in the 1820s accompanied by three assistants so that he could cover a large amount of material in an hour's lecture. His students included George Stokes and Charles Darwin's elder brother, Erasmus. Erasmus Darwin commented on the entertainment value of Cumming's lectures where Cumming compared the results of one of his experiments to artificial diamonds (they weren't). The professor would include many historical and literary anecdotes as he commented on the danger implicit in his experiments. He would point out where previous experiments had blown a hole in the ceiling and how other professors had been maimed by an ill-considered demonstration. His research included investigating galvanometers and electricity. He was noted for giving electric shocks to his audience and for a demonstration in which he would electrocute a cat. His style of teaching is highlighted today as he was an early example of science educators who were actively involved in research which informed, and inspired, their teaching. In the 1840s his lectures did not attract the same audiences, but it must be remembered that they were not compulsory to students if they were not taking medicine. Students at Cambridge could graduate in mathematics or in classics without taking any \\"professional\\" lectures in additional subjects like chemistry. Moreover, students were coming under increasing pressure to improve their performance in the core subjects. Cumming died and was buried in All Saints Church in North Runcton. He had been the Professor in Cambridge until a year before his death on 10 November 1861.

Life The son of Henri Jean- Louis (called Baghio'o, author of La Bible africaine and the first Black magistrate in the French West Indies) and of Fernande de Virel, a gifted violinist, Victor Jean-Louis was sent to France for his studies along with his older brother Edward, as early as 1923. Having graduated from the Institut √©lectrotechnique of Grenoble in 1930, the young engineer went to Egypt to participate in the construction of hydroelectric dams before redirecting his career towards sound-recording for the radio and the cinema. Between 1939 and 1945 he was an officer in the French Army. Captured by the Germans he managed to flee to Switzerland before joining the R√©sistance with Robert Desnos, L√©on- Gontran Damas and Marguerite Durashttp://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ile.en.ile/paroles/damas.htm and participating, as the technical assistant in Pierre Schaeffer's Studio d'Essai, in the \\"liberation of the waves\\" in Paris. After the war he was nominated technical director of the Overseas Broadcasting Service with the French Radio Broadcasting (Radio-diffusion fran√ßaise). In this capacity Jean- Louis Baghio'o protested violently against the racism of some of his colleagues and against what he called \\"la coloniaiserie\\" (a pun combining the words \\"colonialism\\" and \\"stupidity\\"). He also began writing his first literary texts and published the tale of Issandre le mul√¢tre. From 1951 to 1954 he returned, for the first time since his departure in 1923, to the Antilles to stay with his ailing father. During this period he settled with his wife and five children at Gourbeyre in Guadeloupe. There he taught mathematics at the Coll√®ge technique Saint-Jean-Bosco on the slopes of the Soufri√®re volcano. He also gave literary form to his rediscovery of the West Indies in a publication gathering some of his father's and some of his own poems (Les Jeux du soleil) and in sketches of what was going to become his masterpiece, the novel Le Flamboyant √† fleurs bleues (The Blue Flame-Tree), a lusty saga of the O'Os of Guadeloupe and a ferocious satire of colonialism, crowned with the literary award Prix des Cara√Øbes. Back in France, the sound-engineer was entrusted by the French Broadcasting Company (ORTF) with the construction and management of several radio stations in Africa, in the difficult context of decolonization. There too retracing his father's itinerary (who had long been a French judge in Africa), he conceived the autobiographic novel and \\"two-voiced memoir\\", Le Colibri blanc, in which telepathy serves as a means of communication between protagonists spread out between France,the Caribbean and Africa. After his retirement from the ORTF, Jean-Louis Baghio'o devoted even more time to the work of an homme de lettres. He became a tireless student of languages (various Creoles, Italian, Spanish) and of literatures, earning an M.A. degree from the Universit√© de Vincennes in 1981 with a thesis on the poetry of C√©saire and of Saint-John Perse. As a member of the Prix des Cara√Øbes jury, he was delighted to read the production of the young generation of Caribbean writers, while also maintaining a passionate interest in literary theory and history. Jean-Louis Baghio'o died of a stroke in Paris on 20 December 1994, the day before his 84th birthday, a few hours only after his daily morning walk at the Parc de Vincennes and after his daily translation of a page from Don Quixotte. He had also just finished correcting the proofs of his last novel, Choutoumounou, a sequel to Le Flamboyant √† fleurs bleues and a colorful evocation of the \\"Paris antillais\\" of the 1920s and 1930s. If there is a unifying element in Jean-Louis Baghio'o's work it is the permanent exaltation communicated by an author whose style leaned towards the baroque. To him, the real ‚Äì in the West Indies or elsewhere ‚Äì was never dull but marvelous. In that he felt akin to Alejo Carpentier, whose novel El Siglo de las luces (The Century of the Enlightenment) he admired deeply. It might be noted that Victor Jean-Louis's sister, C√©cile Jean-Louis, born in Bordeaux in 1918, knew a great career as a creole singer under the name Moune de Rivel(fr),http://alrmab.free.fr/moune.html mostly appearing at La Canne √† sucre, an Antillean club in Paris, between 1945 and 1996.

In total, he was an umpire for 435 games during his 14-season career that lasted from 1872 until 1890. McLean was the umpire in the first official National League game, played at the Jefferson Street Grounds in Philadelphia on April 22, 1876. August 20, 1874, McLean alleged that some of the Philadelphia Whites had fixed a game with the Chicago White Stockings. John Radcliffe of Philadelphia had offered him $175 in exchange for favoring Chicago, and had implicated teammates Bill Craver, Candy Cummings, Nat Hicks, and Denny Mack, the manager. The Philadelphia ballclub moved against Radcliffe alone and expelled him but the decision was overturned before the next season, on Radcliffe's appeal to the Association.

This battle was fought between Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore and Dharma Raja, Maharaja of Travancore. Mysore army attacked the fortified line at the Travancore border known as the Nedumkotta in Thrissur district. The Mysore army was successfully repulsed by Travancore army under the leadership of Raja Kesavadas Dewan of Travancore Situation in Travancore The strength of the Travancore Nair Army was greatly reduced after several earlier battles with Hyder Ali's forces. The death of the Dutch-born commander Valiya-kappitan Eustachius De Lannoy in 1777 further diminished the morale of the soldiers. The death of Makayiram Thirunal and Asvati Thirunal in 1786 forced the Travancore royal family to adopt two princesses from Kolathunad. As the threat of an invasion by Tipu Sultan loomed in the horizon, Travancore's maharajah Dharma Raja tried to rebuild his army by appointing Chempakaraman Pillai as the dalawa and Kesava Pillai as the sarvadhikaryakkar. Preparations for the battle Tipu Sultan planned the invasion of Travancore for many years, and he was especially concerned with the Nedumkotta fortifications, which had prevented his father Hyder Ali from annexing the kingdom. Towards the end of 1789, Tipu Sultan marched his troops from Coimbatore. Tipu's army consisted of 20,000 infantry, 10,000 spearmen and match-lockmen, 5,000 cavalry and 20 field guns. Travancore purchased the strategic forts of Cranganore and Ayacottah from the Dutch to improve the country's defenses. The deal was finalized by Dewan Kesava Pillai and Dutch merchants David Rabbi and Ephraim Cohen under the observation of Maharajah Dharma Raja and Dutch East India Company Governor John Gerard van Anglebeck. under whose terms two battalions of the Company army were stationed at the Travancore-Cochin frontier. Both Tipu Sultan and Governor John Holland of Madras objected to these purchases because the forts, though they had long been in Dutch possession, were in the Kingdom of Cochin Kesava Pillai was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Travancore Army. To boost the strength of the armed forces, several thousand young militiamen were called up from all over the kingdom. The forts of Cranganore and Ayacottah were repaired and garrisoned. Tipu sent a letter to the King of Travancore demanding the withdrawal of the Travancori forces garrisoned in Cranganore Fort, the transfer to him of Malabar lords that had been sheltered by the king, and the demolition of Travancori ramparts built within the territory of Cochin. The king refused the sultan's demands. The battle A number of Mysorean soldiers encroached into Travancori jungles, ostensibly to apprehend fugitives, and came under fire when discovered by Travancori patrols. On 28 December 1789, Mysorean troops attacked the eastern part of the Travancori lines and captured the ramparts as the Travancoreans retreated, but were eventually stopped when the Travancori force of 800 Nair soldiers made a stand with six-pounder guns; Travancori reinforcements arrived during the four-hour battle, and they inflicted heavy casualties on the Mysoreans, who lost 1000-1500 soldiers and fled in panic. Several Mysorean troops were captured as prisoners of war, including soldiers of European and Maratha origin. Travancoris recovered the sword, the palanquin, the dagger, the ring and many other personal effects of Tipu Sultan from the ditches of the Nedumkotta and presented them to the ruler of Travancore. Some of them were sent to the Nawab of Carnatic on his request. After approximately 2 months after this incident, on 1 March 1790, 1,000 Travancore troops advanced onto Mysore territory, where they were stopped and pushed back with considerable losses by Mysorean troops. On 9 April 1790, a similar attempt was made once again by 3,000 Travancore troops on Mysore territory, however, they were once again stopped by Mysorean troops and repulsed. Further battles On 12 April 1790, Tipu decided to attack the Travancore lines and within approximately three days was able to breach three quarters of a mile of the lines, On 15 April 1790 he took approximately 6,000 soldiers and advanced on the Travancore position. The Travancore troops were taken by surprise and fled. On 18 April 1790, Tipu arrived within one mile of Cranganur and erected batteries. On 8 May 1790, Tipu successfully occupied Cranganur. Soon other forts such as Ayicotta and Parur surrendered without fighting. Tipu Sultan destroyed the Travancore lines and advanced as far as Verapoly, The Travancorean forces regrouped, but the onset of monsoons prevented Tipu from moving south. He finally reached the Periyar river banks at Aluva and camped there. However, by this time a small group led by Vaikom Padmanabha Pillai and Kunjai Kutty Pillai went upstream and managed to break the walls of a dam at Bhoothathankettu causing heavy flash floods downstream Periyar river. All the ammunition and gunpowder of Tipu's army got wet and became inactive. He was thus forced to return. Information that the British army was planning an attack on Srirangapatnam hastened his retreat. Aftermath Mysore actions against Travancore brought it into further conflict with the British Empire, and led to the Third Anglo-Mysore War.

Born in Wilhelmshaven, Hengelbrock studied the violin with Rainer Kussmaul. He started his career in W√ºrzburg and Freiburg im Breisgau. He worked as an assistant to Witold Lutos≈Çawski, Mauricio Kagel and Antal Dor√°ti and played with ensembles such as the Concentus Musicus Wien. In 1985, he cofounded the Freiburger Barockorchester, where he worked as a violinist and a leader of the ensemble. In 1991, Hengelbrock founded the Balthasar Neumann Chor in Freiburg. Subsequently, in 1995, he established the Balthasar Neumann Ensemble as a parallel orchestra with its namesake choir, to perform works from Baroque to contemporary music in Historically informed performances. He continues to work both Balthasar Neumann ensembles regularly. From 1995 to 1999, he was the first artistic director of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen. He was music director of the Volksoper Wien from 2000 to 2003. In 2001, he founded the \\"Feldkirch Festival\\" in Feldkirch, Vorarlberg, and served as its artistic director until 2006. In 2011, Hengelbrock became chief conductor of the NDR Symphony Orchestra in 2011. During his tenure, the orchestra took up new residence at the new Elbphilharmonie concert hall in Hamburg, and changed its name to the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra. In June 2017, the orchestra announced that Hengelbrock is to conclude his tenure with the ensemble at the close of the 2018-2019 season. In December 2017, Hengelbrock expressed his displeasure with the timing of the announcement of his designated successor, Alan Gilbert, within the same month as the original announcement of the previously scheduled conclusion of his tenure. Hengelbrock thus announced his intention to stand down as chief conductor of the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra at the end of the 2017-2018 season, one season earlier than originally planned.

Following its independence, the Slovenia committed itself to protecting the ≈†kocjan Caves area; for this reason, it established ≈†kocjan Caves Regional Park and its managing authority, the ≈†kocjan Caves Park Public Service Agency.http://www.park-skocjanske-jame.si/en/read/the-skocjan- caves/the-significance-of-the-skocjan-caves  Position and surface  The Reka Gorge The narrow protected area covers 4.15 km¬≤ and encompasses the area above ≈†kocjan Caves, the Reka Gorge, and the surrounding collapse dolines. It comprises the villages of ≈†kocjan, Betanja, and Matavun. The area of influence of the park comprises the entire Reka River watershed and covers 450 km¬≤. It lies at the extensive junction of the karst and nonkarst areas. At the easternmost border of the area of influence, the 1,796 m Mount Sne≈ænik (Sne≈ænik, Slovenia (mountain))reigns; it is the highest non-alpine mountain in Slovenia. At first sight, the ≈†kocjan Karst surface appears to be flat, but in reality it is very dynamic. This characteristic landscape that developed in limestones is named karst, derived from the name of the Karst area. The solubility of rocks that form the Earth's surface is the most effective agent of karstification. Falling water in the Karst sinks and drains underground through fissures. The caves are formed in this way; on the surface this occurs in different karst depressions of various sizes. The most frequent karst depressions are sinkholes.Andrej Mihevc: Climate, Geology and Geomorphology (pp. 58-65)  Natural heritage  Limestone polls in the ≈†kocjan Caves Natural heritage in the protected area is protected by law. In 1996, the following natural phenomena from ≈†kocjan Caves Regional Park were declared to be natural monuments due to their outstanding natural and aesthetic value: * Mala dolina and Velika dolina all the way to the collapse doline edge * Okroglica abyss * Walls and banks of the Reka Valley in the radius of 150 m before the entry into Mahorƒçiƒç Cave * Caves in the area of the Park: :* ≈†kocjan Caves (≈†kocjan cave system) :* Jama na Prevali II.

Collapse dolines and their surroundings offer shelter to rare and endangered bird species and several bat species, and an extraordinary ecosystem that has developed due to particular geomorphologic and microclimatic conditions has been preserved. The underground is rich with several species of cave animals: both those living on land and those living in water.Rajko Slapnik: Flora and Fauna (pp. 66-79)  The Reka River The cave was formed by the disappearing Reka River, which gathers most of its waters on the impermeable flysch rock. It flows from the ≈†kocjan Caves through the Karst underground and emerges to the surface in Italy some 35 km away at the springs of the Timavo River. Its flow is for the most part unknown and can only be reached in few deep shafts (up to 320 m deep), but the siphons hinder any further exploration along the underground channels. During a high water period, the Reka River flow can exceed 300 cubic m per second. Because of this, following heavy rains, it floods in the cave, usually reaching levels up to 30 m; the highest recorded rise in the water level was 132 m.Andrej Mihevc: Climate, Geology and Geomorphology (pp. 58-65)  Cultural heritage  From time immemorial, the landscape in the area of ≈†kocjan Caves Park has attracted people; it is exceptionally rich in archaeological sites. The nature of this area is also reflected in the preserved medieval ground plan of the village of ≈†kocjan and its position on a large natural bridge beneath which the Reka River carved out Mahorƒçiƒç and Mariniƒç caves. This position is not coincidental. The village of ≈†kocjan named after the church of St. Cantianius (sv. Kancijan) was presumably settled in the prehistoric period and undoubtedly in the Roman period. It was around this church that the village developed, leaning on the partly preserved hill fort walls inside which it is situated. In present times, the village is almost deserted except for during the tourist season, when visitors to the two permanent museum exhibitions bring it back to life. ≈†kocjan is so far registered as settlement monument in the park. Cultural heritage properties in the area are protected by law and since 1996 some structures have been declared as cultural monuments due to their special value. Since then, the park contains various settlement monuments, archaeological monuments, historical art monuments, ethnological monuments, technical monuments, and historical monuments.Eda Dra≈°ƒçek, Nada Osmuk, Jasna Svetina: Poselitev.

Sredska was composed of seven hamlets, which had the following brotherhoods and families: *Hamlet of Rakoƒçi‚ÄìRaƒçeviƒái or Raƒçojci (27 houses) *Jak≈°iƒái, hailing from Herzegovina, settled at the end of the 17th- and beginning of 18th century. *Hamlet of Pejƒçiƒái (15 houses), Mandu≈°iƒái with several branches *Jankoviƒái, Dobrosavci and Kaƒçareviƒái *Hamlet of Palicojki (30 houses), Ljamovci‚ÄìLjamoviƒái *Ogarovci *Velikinci *Zrnzevci‚ÄìZrnzeviƒái *≈†o≈°evci (5 houses) *Kabasovci‚ÄìRadivojeviƒái *ƒåukalovci *≈†ipovci, D≈æinovci and Softiƒái *Hamlet of Krajci or Krajƒçiƒái‚ÄìKaralejiƒái *Sopkinci‚Äì≈Ωivkovci *Jeftiƒái and Radovci‚ÄìRadiƒái *Hamlet of Stajkovce (31 houses) *Hamlet of Bogosevce or Bogo≈°ovce *Kovaƒçevci *Tanaskovci *Hamlet of Milaƒçiƒái (?) Apart from the native families (starosedeoci), all other families were settled between the 16th and 18th centuries.  Churches =Church of the Holy Virgin At the hamlet of Pejcici, today north of the highway, there is the biggest but also the youngest church in the group of churches of the Sredska district, dedicated to the Holy Virgin. One-nave, semi-ovally domed temple, with the altar apse which is shallow and three-sided from outside and in the shape of niche in its interior, had been probably built several years before it was painted, i.e. in 1646/1647. It was built thanks to the contributions of a great number of villagers whose names are mentioned in the founders‚Äô fresco inscription. The well preserved paintings include the zones of standing figures, saints‚Äô busts in medallions, compositions of the cycles of the Suffering and Great Holidays arranged in two separate columns and the standard decoration of the altar and dome areas. With the gamut reduced to colour and the prominent drawing, the paintings of this church are rather illustrative than having artistic value. In the second half of the 19th century, a square storeyed priprata and a light wooden belfry above it were built in front of the church. Church of St. Djordje In the middle of the village of Sredska, by the village road, there is a miniature church for which the villagers say that it was a family chapel and which is certainly the oldest and the most interesting monument of this district. This status of the church is ensured because of its simple architecture (one-nave foundation with the apse hardly rounded from outside, semi-oval vault and exterior dimensions of little over 5 m of length and 3 m of width) and the exceptionally high quality of its frescoes. An unknown painter did not pay any attention to the dimensions of the building and, already in the first zone below the painted arcades, he painted monumental and exceptionally modelled figures of holy doctors and holy warriors clad in lively aristocratic garments. He painted the homage to the lamb and Virgin‚Äôs bust with angels in the small altar niche and archdeacon Stefan in the prothesis niche. The light translucent colours and the inclination towards decorativeness contribute to the fact that, out of the previously offered years in the literature, we accept the year of 1530 as the most acceptable. Finally, it should be added that these frescoes attract attention also because of the painting technology since they were painted on the mud mortar with coarse chaff. www.kosovo.net/kosovo.html  Notable people  *Vuk Isakoviƒá (1696-1759), Austrian soldier *ƒåolak-Anta (1777-1853), Serbian revolutionary *Jake Allex (1887-1959), Serbian-American soldier NotesReferencesFurther reading * * Category:Villages in Prizren Category:Serb communities in Kosovo Category:Medieval Serbian sites in Kosovo Category:Cultural heritage of Kosovo ","title":"Sredska, Kosovo"},{"id":"26565511","text":"Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U.S. 188 (1948), was a United States Supreme Court case that denied a federal district court jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas corpus if the person detained is not within the territorial jurisdiction of the court when the petition is filed. The 6-3 ruling was handed down on June 21, 1948, with the majority opinion written by Justice William O. Douglas and the dissent written by Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge. The decision was substantially overturned in Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky (1973), which held that territorial jurisdiction is derived from the location of the custodian, those responsible for the indictment, rather than the location of the detention. Overview The United States District Court for the District of Columbia had been petitioned by 120 German detainees being held on Ellis Island for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge in court their detention and imminent deportation. The deportation order had been issued by Attorney General Tom C. Clark, using wartime powers granted by President Harry Truman in the waning months of World War II. The detainees argued that the US Court for DC had jurisdiction because they were being held \\"subject to the custody and control\\" of the Attorney General. The government argued that their case should be dismissed because Ellis Island is outside of the territorial confines of the District of Columbia. The Supreme Court, the federal appeals courts, and the federal district courts had the power to grant writs of habeas corpus \\"within their respective jurisdictions\\"; the case hinged on whether the words \\"within their respective jurisdictions\\" implied a territorial limitation. The court held that they did. OpinionDissent Judge Wiley Blount Rutledge was concerned that the Court's decision was narrowly construing the great writ of habeas corpus. He wrote: Significance The case was newly significant in the 21st century because the question of territorial jurisdiction arose during the U.S. War on Terror following the 9/11 attacks. The United States detained hundreds of foreign captives at a US Navy facility in Guantanamo Bay, which it held was outside the territorial jurisdiction of all federal district courts. Detainees petitioned the federal courts for habeas corpus challenges of their detention, and some cases reached the US Supreme Court. Justice John Paul Stevens had clerked for Justice Wiley Rutledge during the term Ahrens v. Clark was decided. He helped draft Justice Rutledge's dissenting opinion in the case and knew his reasoning. He also knew of Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court (1973), in which the Supreme Court held: Justice Stevens used his background from the cases when drafting the majority opinion in Rasul v. Bush (2004). The Court held that the US courts had jurisdiction in the US Circuit Court for the District of Columbia over the officers of the executive branch who were the policymakers and ultimate custodians of the detainees and the facility at Guantanamo.

She was replaced by the Nazi regime by an athlete later discovered to be an intersex man. The film, based on a true story, was released in Germany on September 10, 2009. Reporters at Der Spiegel challenged the historical basis for many of the events in the film, pointing to arrest records and medical examinations indicating German authorities did not learn Dora Ratjen was male until 1938.. Accessed September 2, 2010  Plot  The athlete Gretel Bergmann wins the high jump championships in the United Kingdom. Since the Nazi racial laws prevented her continuing her training in Germany, being a Jew, her father had sent her to England, where she could live more safely and continue her sporting career. At the Berlin Olympics in 1936, the Americans and the IOC (International Olympic Committee) demand that Jewish athletes are not to be excluded from the event, especially the high jumper Gretel Bergmann of international fame, thus putting the Nazi Olympic Committee in great difficulty. A victory by a Jewish athlete would seriously humiliate the Nazi party. When her family in Germany is threatened, Gretel returns to Germany. She is included in the German Olympic high jump team, seemingly with the same rights as the other athletes in the training camp. Hans Waldmann, the coach of the team, is enthusiastic about the skills and discipline of Gretel and adopts a policy of impartiality based solely on sportsmanship. However, Waldmann is dismissed by Nazi party officials and replaced as coach by Sigfrid Kulmbach, loyal to the party. Kulmbach attempts, instead, by every means to discourage the young athlete and undermine her self-esteem. Her roommate and sole competitor in talent is Marie Ketteler. Marie, however, is really a man, by whom the Nazis want to attain the gold medal in high jump. Between Marie and Gretel, despite numerous threats from outside, a friendship forms. Despite being the most promising athlete in high jump training, Gretel is suddenly excluded from competition under false pretences, only a few days before the Games. She is replaced by Marie, the second best athlete. Marie, however, behaves in strange ways: she never takes a bath with her companions, shaves her legs several times a day and has a deep voice. Gretel, therefore, discovers her true identity. Meanwhile, Marie discovers that Gretel was excluded from the race under false pretenses. So Marie decides to deliberately lose the final and decisive leap. The dislodged bar spells the shattering of hope of victory in the German officials, who are dumbstruck. Marie gains only the fourth place. Marie and Gretel, the latter observing the contest as a spectator, exchange a secret happy smile, for their common opposition led to the defeat of the cruel Nazi ambitions and ideals.

The film received a critics generally positive. The film has been called \\"interesting\\" by the German magazine Der Spiegel and placed in the category \\"play\\" with the German weekly Die Zeit. In January 2010, the film was presented in the Palm Springs International Film Festival. On the same date, the film was presented in the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival and the New York Jewish Film Festival, a film festival that engages with Jewish history. During the presentation of the movie in the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival, the consular officer Lutz G√∂rgens compared the theme of the movie to Jeremy Schaap's book Triumph, which tells the story of the American athlete Jesse Owens, who won the gold medal in the 1936 Olympic Games, despite the strong discrimination he suffered. G√∂rgens said that \\"the book and the movie teaches us about the bad politics of sport. They remind us of the preciousness of political freedom, the excellence of athletic futility, and the true value of friendship\\". In fact, unlike the film, Gretel Bergmann, as a young woman did not know her partner was really a man, but she learned it only in 1966, reading an article in Time. Bergmann told the magazine Der Spiegel, at the age of 95 years, \\"I never suspected anything. We all wondered why she never got naked in the shower. Being so shy at seventeen, it seemed absurd, but we thought, well, it is bizarre and weird\\".

His pioneering work in nutrition sciences over the past 50 years, inspired by humanistic values and views, has been recognized by the Iranian academic community, industry and governmental organizations, as well as international food and nutrition authorities. Early life and education Habibollah Hedayat was born in the city of Shahreza (previously Ghomsheh) near Esfahan, Iran in 1917. His early education was completed in Shahreza, and he received his high school diploma in Esfahan. Hedayat was then admitted to Tehran University Medical School in 1936 where he finished his medical education with honors in 1941. Upon finishing his medical internship in Tehran's Women's Hospital, he performed his military service for one year in the Iranian Army Health Services and then departed for France in 1948 to attend medical school at the University of Paris. He completed his thesis under Professor Varangot at the Port-Royal Paris Hospital where he received his OB/GYN specialty diploma. While studying courses in his specialization of gynecology, he also took general hygiene and workers‚Äô medicine courses in the evenings with the hope of establishing a hygiene research institute back in Iran. Career and Services Upon returning from France to Iran in 1951, Hedayat and his colleagues established the Hafez specialty clinic in Tehran which remained open until 1953. After long discussions with the then Minister of Health, Jahanshah Saleh, Hedayat obtained approval for a research project on Iran's workers‚Äô health. As part of this research project, Hedayat observed malnourished Iranian girls weaving carpets in Kerman in poor working conditions and this caused an internal revolution in him. He decided to focus on \\"nutrition\\" as the vital factor in the health and wellbeing of the Iranian people - a subject not taken seriously by the medical community at the time. thumbleft Hedayat (right) with his long-time colleague and friend, Vaez Zadeh (2006) Since neither he, nor his colleagues in Iran, had formally studied or specialized in the field of nutrition, Hedayat decided to study nutrition sciences overseas under Professor Colin B.S. Platt (Prof. of Nutrition and President of Human Research Centre) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (University of London) as well as the Medical Research Council. Hedayat's master thesis in nutrition was entitled: \\"A Study of Nutrition in Persia, Including a Laboratory Investigation of the Nutritive Value of Typical Dietaries.\\" Upon his second return to Iran in 1961, Hedayat was appointed Director General of Health Affairs for the Tehran province. It was during this period in his career that he established the Institute of Nutrition and Food Science of Iran (INFSI). The initiative started with modestly sized classes, few laboratories, and a library at the Firouzgar hospital in Tehran. The name of the Institute was later changed to National Nutrition & Food Technology Research Institute (NNFTRI). It was during the establishment of INFSI that Hedayat became acquainted with his long-time colleague and friend, Shahab Vaez Zadeh. These two scientists pledged to work together to make the INFSI, a vital necessity for Iran, into a success. The Institute, in collaboration with the nutrition section at the Embassy of France under the auspices of Professor Tremoulier, organized seminars and conferences and granted scholarships to students interested in the field. The Institute was to soon find international fame. United Nations entities such as Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), and UNICEF started supporting the Institute. These organizations provided 28 academic scholarships for staff and students. Hedayat was invited to a UNICEF conference in New York where Sir Herbert Broadley, the former acting Director-General of FAO and UNICEF's representative in Great Britain, indicated that establishment of the Institute of Nutrition and Food Science in Iran had inspired several other Middle Eastern countries to follow suit and establish similar institutes in their respective countries. As an integral part of the Institute, Iran's College of Nutrition Sciences and Food Chemistry was established. Additionally, a rural research center was established in Gorg-Tapeh, a rural area in Varamin, near Tehran. Later, in cooperation with Abdolrahim Emami, who had been sent by Hedayat to London to receive his specialty under supervision of Prof. Platt, a branch of the Nutrition Institute was established at the Esfahan University in Esfahan, Iran. In 1970, the Iranian Diabetes Society was also established with Hedayat as a founding member and Chairman of the Board. Scientific Works Hedayat is author or co-author of six books, thirty-three academic papers, over fifty research reports on food and nutrition, and over one hundred presentations at national and international conferences (in Persian, English, and French). He was the founder and editor-in-chief of the Nutrition Journal published in Persian by NNFTRI. He was also a member of the editorial board of Ecology of Food and Nutrition published in English in London, Washington, and Tokyo. One of his major scientific achievements was overseeing the evaluation of the nutritional status and needs of the Iranian people conducted by survey teams in 30 different urban, rural, tribal and industrial locations. The result of this survey (published in Persian and English) which was reported to FAO, was considered as the most reputable nutritional survey in the third world and used as a reference for developing countries. Hedayat also managed research projects on Favism and Endemic Goiter in Iran. Honors and awards Hedayat's pioneering work in nutrition sciences over the past 50 years, inspired by his humanistic values and views, has been recognized by the Iranian academic community, industry and governmental organizations as well as international food and nutrition authorities. A significant number of Iran's current leaders in nutrition and food sciences are alumni of the college he established, the College of Nutrition Sciences and Food Chemistry. In 2005, Hedayat was elected as a member of the distinguished faculty of the College of Food Technology of Scientific Research Unit, part of Islamic Azad University. In 2006, Dr. Hedayat (together with Shahab Vaez-Zadeh) was officially recognized for his pioneering work in nutrition and food science by all sectors of the Iranian society including Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, former President and Chairman the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran. Dr. Hedayat's lasting legacy is manifested by the \\"Dr. Hedayat Award\\", the highest award in Iran bestowed annually by the Iranian Food Science and Technology Association (Chairman: Seyed Mohammad Hosseini) to the most achieved Iranian persons or institutions in the field of nutrition and food science. In 2008, dozens of his former students gathered together with him in Los Angeles to celebrate with him his myriad lifetime achievements. Family life Hedayat has three sons.

Studies have revealed unexpected things about human agency, moral responsibility, and consciousness in general. One of the pioneering studies in this domain was conducted by Benjamin Libet and colleagues in 1983 and has been the foundation of many studies in the years since. Other studies have attempted to predict participant actions before they make them, explore how we know we are responsible for voluntary movements as opposed to being moved by an external force, or how the role of consciousness in decision making may differ depending on the type of decision being made. Brodmann's area 25, related to long-term depression. The field remains highly controversial. The significance of findings, their meaning, and what conclusions may be drawn from them is a matter of intense debate. The precise role of consciousness in decision making and how that role may differ across types of decisions remains unclear. Thinkers like Daniel Dennett or Alfred Mele consider the language used by researchers. They explain that \\"free will\\" means many different things to different people (e.g. some notions of free will believe we need the dualistic values of both hard determinists and compatiblistsSmilansky, S. (2002). Free will, fundamental dualism, and the centrality of illusion. In The Oxford handbook of free will., some not). Dennett insists that many important and common conceptions of \\"free will\\" are compatible with the emerging evidence from neuroscience. Overview The neuroscience of free will encompasses two main fields of study: volition and agency. Volition, the study of voluntary actions, is difficult to define. If we consider human actions as lying along a spectrum of our involvement in initiating the actions, then reflexes would be on one end, and fully voluntary actions would be on the other. How these actions are initiated and consciousness‚Äô role in producing them is a major area of study in volition. Agency is the capacity of an actor to act in a given environment that has been debated since the beginning of philosophy. Within the neuroscience of free will the sense of agency‚Äîthe subjective awareness of initiating, executing, and controlling one's volitional actions‚Äîis usually what is studied. One significant finding of modern studies is that a person's brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them. Researchers have found delays of about half a second or more (discussed in sections below). With contemporary brain scanning technology, scientists in 2008 were able to predict with 60% accuracy whether 12 subjects would press a button with their left or right hand up to 10 seconds before the subject became aware of having made that choice. These and other findings have led some scientists, like Patrick Haggard, to reject some definitions of \\"free will\\". To be clear, it is very unlikely that a single study could disprove all definitions of free will. Definitions of free will can vary wildly, and each must be considered separately in light of existing empirical evidence. There have also been a number of problems regarding studies of free will. Particularly in earlier studies, research relied on self-reported measures of conscious awareness, but introspective estimates of event timing were found to be biased or inaccurate in some cases. There is no agreed-upon measure of brain activity corresponding to conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions, making studying processes related to consciousness difficult. The conclusions drawn from measurements that have been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings represents. Such a dip might have nothing to do with unconscious decision because many other mental processes are going on while performing the task. Although early studies mainly used electroencephalography, more recent studies have used fMRI, single-neuron recordings, and other measures. Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest that consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected ‚Äì challenging any versions of \\"free will\\" where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process. Free will as illusion An activity like playing the piano may be intentional, but is generally regarded as requiring many practiced actions. Studies suggest that each key press could be initiated unconsciously. It is quite likely that a large range of cognitive operations are necessary to freely press a button. Research at least suggests that our conscious self does not initiate all behavior. Instead, the conscious self is somehow alerted to a given behavior that the rest of the brain and body are already planning and performing. These findings do not forbid conscious experience from playing some moderating role, although it is also possible that some form of unconscious process is what is causing modification in our behavioral response. Unconscious processes may play a larger role in behavior than previously thought. It may be possible, then, that our intuitions about the role of our conscious \\"intentions\\" have led us astray; it may be the case that we have confused correlation with causation by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in neurostimulation, brain damage, but also research into introspection illusions. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for moral responsibility or lack thereofHeisenberg, M. (2009). Is free will an illusion?. Nature, 459(7244), 164-165. Neuroscientist and author Sam Harris believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is \\"intuitive\\": he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues: \\"Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion\\".\\"The Moral Landscape\\", p. 112. Neuroscientist Walter Jackson Freeman III, nevertheless, talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes: \\"our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly trying to keep up with what we do.\\"Freeman, Walter J. How Brains Make Up Their Minds. New York: Columbia UP, 2000. p. 139. To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness. An important distinction to make is the difference between proximal and distal intentions. Proximal intentions are immediate in the sense that they are about acting now. For instance, a decision to raise a hand now or press a button now, as in Libet-style experiments. Distal intentions are delayed in the sense that they are about acting at a later point in time. For instance, deciding to go to the store later. Research has mostly focused on proximal intentions; however, it is unclear to what degree findings will generalize from one sort of intention to the other. Relevance of scientific research Some thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies think that these studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that physical factors in the brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that \\"We feel we choose, but we don't\\". Researcher John-Dylan Haynes adds: \\"How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?\\". Philosophers Walter Glannon and Alfred Mele think that some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because \\"free will\\" can mean many things: it is unclear what someone means when they say \\"free will does not exist\\". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any dualistic notions of free will ‚Äì but that is an \\"easy target for neuroscientists to knock down\\". Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in materialistic terms. In these cases, \\"free will\\" means something more like \\"not coerced\\" or that \\"the person could have done otherwise at the last moment\\". The existence of these types of free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about what goes on in the brain during decision making. This issue may be controversial for good reason: There is evidence to suggest that people normally associate a belief in free will with their ability to affect their lives. Philosopher Daniel Dennett, author of Elbow Room and a supporter of deterministic free will, believes that scientists risk making a serious mistake. He says that there are types of free will that are incompatible with modern science, but he says that those kinds of free will are not worth wanting. Other types of \\"free will\\" are pivotal to people's sense of responsibility and purpose (see also \\"believing in free will\\"), and many of these types are actually compatible with modern science.. Discussion of free will starts especially at 24 min. The other studies described below have only just begun to shed light on the role that consciousness plays in actions, and it is too early to draw very strong conclusions about certain kinds of \\"free will\\"\\". Lewis, M. (1990). The development of intentionality and the role of consciousness. Psychological Inquiry, 1(3), 230-247. It is worth noting that such experiments so far have dealt only with free-will decisions made in short time frames (seconds) and may not have direct bearing on free-will decisions made (\\"thoughtfully\\") by the subject over the course of many seconds, minutes, hours or longer. Scientists have also only so far studied extremely simple behaviors (e.g. moving a finger). Adina Roskies points out five areas of neuroscientific research: 1) action initiation, 2) intention, 3) decision, 4) inhibition and control, 5) the phenomenology of agency; and for each of these areas Roskies concludes that the science may be developing our understanding of volition or \\"will\\", but it yet offers nothing for developing the \\"free\\" part of the \\"free will\\" discussion. There is also the question of the influence of such interpretations in people's behaviour. In 2008, psychologists Kathleen Vohs and Jonathan Schooler published a study on how people behave when they are prompted to think that determinism is true. They asked their subjects to read one of two passages: one suggesting that behaviour boils down to environmental or genetic factors not under personal control; the other neutral about what influences behaviour. The participants then did a few math problems on a computer. But just before the test started, they were informed that because of a glitch in the computer it occasionally displayed the answer by accident; if this happened, they were to click it away without looking. Those who had read the deterministic message were more likely to cheat on the test. \\"Perhaps, denying free will simply provides the ultimate excuse to behave as one likes\\", Vohs and Schooler suggested. However, although initial studies suggested that believing in free will is associated with more morally praiseworthy behavior, some recent studies have reported contradictory findings. Notable experiments=Libet experiment A pioneering experiment in this field was conducted by Benjamin Libet in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain (in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), which was discovered by Kornhuber & Deecke in 1965Kornhuber & Deecke, 1965. Hirnpotential√§nderungen bei Willk√ºrbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pfl√ºgers Arch 284: 1‚Äì17.). Although it was well known that the \\"readiness potential\\" () preceded the physical action, Libet asked how it corresponded to the felt intention to move. To determine when the subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock and report its position when they felt that they had felt the conscious will to move. Libet's experiment: (0) repose, until (1) the Bereitschaftspotential is detected, (2-Libet's W) the volunteer memorizes a dot position upon feeling their intention, and then (3) acts. Libet found that the unconscious brain activity leading up to the conscious decision by the subject to flick their wrist began approximately half a second before the subject consciously felt that they had decided to move. Libet's findings suggest that decisions made by a subject are first being made on a subconscious level and only afterward being translated into a \\"conscious decision\\", and that the subject's belief that it occurred at the behest of their will was only due to their retrospective perspective on the event. The interpretation of these findings has been criticized by Daniel Dennett, who argues that people will have to shift their attention from their intention to the clock, and that this introduces temporal mismatches between the felt experience of will and the perceived position of the clock hand.Dennett, D. (1991) Consciousness Explained. The Penguin Press. (UK Hardcover edition, 1992) (paperback). Consistent with this argument, subsequent studies have shown that the exact numerical value varies depending on attention. Despite the differences in the exact numerical value, however, the main finding has held.Banks, W. P. and Pockett, S. (2007) Benjamin Libet's work on the neuroscience of free will. In M. Velmans and S. Schneider (eds.) The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness. Blackwell. (paperback). Philosopher Alfred Mele criticizes this design for other reasons. Having attempted the experiment himself, Mele explains that \\"the awareness of the intention to move\\" is an ambiguous feeling at best. For this reason he remained skeptical of interpreting the subjects' reported times for comparison with their \\"Bereitschaftspotential\\".Bigthink.com. =Criticisms= Typical recording of the Bereitschaftspotential that was discovered by Kornhuber & Deecke in 1965). Benjamin Libet investigated whether this neural activity corresponded to the \\"felt intention\\" (or will) to move of experimental subjects. In a variation of this task, Haggard and Eimer asked subjects to decide not only when to move their hands, but also to decide which hand to move. In this case, the felt intention correlated much more closely with the \\"lateralized readiness potential\\" (LRP), an event-related potential (ERP) component that measures the difference between left and right hemisphere brain activity. Haggard and Eimer argue that the feeling of conscious will must therefore follow the decision of which hand to move, since the LRP reflects the decision to lift a particular hand. A more direct test of the relationship between the Bereitschaftspotential and the \\"awareness of the intention to move\\" was conducted by Banks and Isham (2009). In their study, participants performed a variant of the Libet's paradigm in which a delayed tone followed the button press. Subsequently, research participants reported the time of their intention to act (e.g., Libet's \\"W\\"). If W were time-locked to the Bereitschaftspotential, W would remain uninfluenced by any post-action information. However, findings from this study show that W in fact shifts systematically with the time of the tone presentation, implicating that W is, at least in part, retrospectively reconstructed rather than pre-determined by the Bereitschaftspotential. A study conducted by Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena (2009) suggests that the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) signal in Libet's experiments doesn't represent a decision to move, but that it's merely a sign that the brain is paying attention. In this experiment the classical Libet experiment was modified by playing an audio tone indicating to volunteers to decide whether to tap a key or not. The researchers found that there was the same RP signal in both cases, regardless of whether or not volunteers actually elected to tap, which suggests that the RP signal doesn't indicate that a decision has been made. In a second experiment, researchers asked volunteers to decide on the spot whether to use left hand or right to tap the key while monitoring their brain signals, and they found no correlation among the signals and the chosen hand. This criticism has itself been criticized by free-will researcher Patrick Haggard, who mentions literature that distinguishes two different circuits in the brain that lead to action: a \\"stimulus-response\\" circuit and a \\"voluntary\\" circuit. According to Haggard, researchers applying external stimuli may not be testing the proposed voluntary circuit, nor Libet's hypothesis about internally triggered actions. Libet's interpretation of the ramping up of brain activity prior to the report of conscious \\"will\\" continues to draw heavy criticism. Studies have questioned participants' ability to report the timing of their \\"will\\". Authors have found that preSMA activity is modulated by attention (attention precedes the movement signal by 100 ms), and the prior activity reported could therefore have been product of paying attention to the movement. They also found that the perceived onset of intention depends on neural activity that takes place after the execution of action. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the preSMA after a participant performed an action shifted the perceived onset of the motor intention backward in time, and the perceived time of action execution forward in time. Others have speculated that the preceding neural activity reported by Libet may be an artefact of averaging the time of \\"will\\", wherein neural activity does not always precede reported \\"will\\". In a similar replication they also reported no difference in electrophysiological signs before a decision not to move and before a decision to move. Despite his findings, Libet himself did not interpret his experiment as evidence of the inefficacy of conscious free will ‚Äî he points out that although the tendency to press a button may be building up for 500 milliseconds, the conscious will retains a right to veto any action at the last moment. According to this model, unconscious impulses to perform a volitional act are open to suppression by the conscious efforts of the subject (sometimes referred to as \\"free won't\\"). A comparison is made with a golfer, who may swing a club several times before striking the ball. The action simply gets a rubber stamp of approval at the last millisecond. Max Velmans argues however that \\"free won't\\" may turn out to need as much neural preparation as \\"free will\\" (see below). Some studies have, however, replicated Libet's findings, whilst addressing some of the original criticisms. A recent study has found that individual neurons were found to fire 2 seconds before a reported \\"will\\" to act (long before EEG activity predicted such a response). Itzhak Fried replicated Libet's findings in 2011 at the scale of the single neuron. This was accomplished with the help of volunteer epilepsy patients, who needed electrodes implanted deep in their brain for evaluation and treatment anyway. Now able to monitor awake and moving patients, the researchers replicated the timing anomalies that were discovered by Libet and are discussed in the following study. Similarly to these tests, Chun Siong Soon, Anna Hanxi He, Stefan Bode and John-Dylan Haynes have conducted a study in 2013 claiming to be able to predict the choice to sum or subtract before the subject reports it. William R. Klemm pointed out the inconclusiveness of these tests due to design limitations and data interpretations and proposed less ambiguous experiments, while affirming a stand on the existence of free will like Roy F. Baumeister or Catholic neuroscientists such as Tadeusz Pacholczyk. Adrian G. Guggisberg and Anna√Øs Mottaz have also challenged Itzhak Fried's findings. A study by Aaron Schurger and colleagues published in PNAS Gholipour, B. (2019, September 10). A famous Argument Against Free Will has been Debunked. The Atlantic.challenged assumptions about the causal nature of the Bereitschaftspotential itself (and the \\"pre-movement buildup\\" of neural activity in general when faced with a choice), thus denying the conclusions drawn from studies such as Libet's and Fried's. See The Information Philosopher, New Scientist, and the Atlantic for commentary on this study. Unconscious actionsTiming intentions compared to actions= A study by Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, published in 2008, claims to have replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock memorization on the part of participants. The authors believe that their method can identify the time (T) at which a subject becomes aware of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the readiness potential). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement. The experiment It is difficult to identify exactly when a person becomes aware of his action. Some findings indicate that awareness comes after actions have already begun in the brain. Matsuhashi and Hallett's study can be summarized thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after it has already been started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause. To test this hypothesis, Matsuhashi and Hallet had volunteers perform brisk finger movements at random intervals, while not counting or planning when to make such (future) movements, but rather immediately making a movement as soon as they thought about it. An externally controlled \\"stop-signal\\" sound was played at pseudo-random intervals, and the volunteers had to cancel their intent to move if they heard a signal while being aware of their own immediate intention to move. Whenever there was an action (finger movement), the authors documented (and graphed) any tones that occurred before that action. The graph of tones before actions therefore only shows tones (a) before the subject is even aware of his \\"movement genesis\\" (or else they would have stopped or \\"vetoed\\" the movement), and (b) after it is too late to veto the action. This second set of graphed tones is of little importance here. In this work, \\"movement genesis\\" is defined as the brain process of making movement, of which physiological observations have been made (via electrodes) indicating that it may occur before conscious awareness of intent to move (see Benjamin Libet). By looking to see when tones started preventing actions, the researchers supposedly know the length of time (in seconds) that exists between when a subject holds a conscious intention to move and performs the action of movement. This moment of awareness, as seen in the graph below, is called \\"T\\" (the mean time of conscious intention to move). It can be found by looking at the border between tones and no tones. This enables the researchers to estimate the timing of the conscious intention to move without relying on the subject's knowledge or demanding them to focus on a clock. The last step of the experiment is to compare time T for each subject with their event-related potential (ERP) measures (e.g. seen in this page's lead image), which reveal when their finger movement genesis first begins. The researchers found that the time of the conscious intention to move T normally occurred too late to be the cause of movement genesis. See the example of a subject's graph below on the right. Although it is not shown on the graph, the subject's readiness potentials (ERP) tells us that his actions start at ‚àí2.8 seconds, and yet this is substantially earlier than his conscious intention to move, time \\"T\\" (‚àí1.8 seconds). Matsuhashi and Hallet concluded that the feeling of the conscious intention to move does not cause movement genesis; both the feeling of intention and the movement itself are the result of unconscious processing. Analysis and interpretation A simple \\"signalling noise\\" is used, but it is to warn participants that they must prevent any actions they are aware of. This study is similar to Libet's in some ways: volunteers were again asked to perform finger extensions in short, self-paced intervals. In this version of the experiment, researchers introduced randomly timed \\"stop tones\\" during the self-paced movements. If participants were not conscious of any intention to move, they simply ignored the tone. On the other hand, if they were aware of their intention to move at the time of the tone, they had to try to veto the action, then relax for a bit before continuing self-paced movements. This experimental design allowed Matsuhashi and Hallet to see when, once the subject moved his finger, any tones occurred. The goal was to identify their own equivalent of Libet's W, their own estimation of the timing of the conscious intention to move, which they would call \\"T\\" (time). Testing the hypothesis that \\"conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun\\" required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses to tones before actions. The idea is that, after time T, tones will lead to vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There would also be a point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses to tones while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses to tones during a certain period of time during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses to tones when the subjects do not have the time to process the tone and prevent an action ‚Äì they have passed the action's \\"point of no return\\". That is exactly what the researchers found (see the graph on the right, below). Graphing tones as they appeared (or didn't) in the time before any action. In this case, researchers believe that the subject becomes aware of his actions at about 1.8 seconds (this is time \\"T\\"). A typical subject's ERP recordings suggest movement preparation as early as ‚àí2.8 seconds. The graph shows the times at which unsuppressed responses to tones occurred when the volunteer moved. He showed many unsuppressed responses to tones (called \\"tone events\\" on the graph) on average up until 1.8 seconds before movement onset, but a significant decrease in tone events immediately after that time. Presumably this is because the subject usually became aware of his intention to move at about ‚àí1.8 seconds, which is then labelled point T. Since most actions are vetoed if a tone occurs after point T, there are very few tone events represented during that range. Finally, there is a sudden increase in the number of tone events at 0.1 seconds, meaning that this subject has passed point P. Matsuhashi and Hallet were thus able to establish an average time T (‚àí1.8 seconds) without subjective report. This, they compared to ERP measurements of movement, which had detected movement beginning at about ‚àí2.8 seconds on average for this participant. Since T, like Libet's original W, was often found after movement genesis had already begun, the authors concluded that the generation of awareness occurred afterwards or in parallel to action, but most importantly, that it was probably not the cause of the movement. =Criticisms= Haggard describes other studies at the neuronal levels as providing \\"a reassuring confirmation of previous studies that recorded neural populations\\" such as the one just described. Note that these results were gathered using finger movements and may not necessarily generalize to other actions such as thinking, or even other motor actions in different situations. Indeed, the human act of planning has implications for free will, and so this ability must also be explained by any theories of unconscious decision making. Philosopher Alfred Mele also doubts the conclusions of these studies. He explains that simply because a movement may have been initiated before our \\"conscious self\\" has become aware of it does not mean that our consciousness does not still get to approve, modify, and perhaps cancel (called vetoing) the action. Unconsciously cancelling actions The possibility that human \\"free won't\\" is also the prerogative of the subconscious is being explored. =Retrospective judgement of free choice= that humans cannot tell the difference between \\"deciding\\" to keep driving and having no time to decide at all. Recent research by Simone K√ºhn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness may not be what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it easy to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the introspection illusion. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to \\"veto\\" an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place. The experiment The experiment involved asking volunteers to respond to a go-signal by pressing an electronic \\"go\\" button as quickly as possible. In this experiment the go-signal was represented as a visual stimulus shown on a monitor (e.g. a green light as shown on the picture). The participants' reaction times (RT) were gathered at this stage, in what was described as the \\"primary response trials\\". The primary response trials were then modified, in which 25% of the go-signals were subsequently followed by an additional signal ‚Äì either a \\"stop\\" or \\"decide\\" signal. The additional signals occurred after a \\"signal delay\\" (SD), a random amount of time up to 2 seconds after the initial go-signal. They also occurred equally, each representing 12.5% of experimental cases. These additional signals were represented by the initial stimulus changing colour (e.g. to either a red or orange light). The other 75% of go-signals were not followed by an additional signal, and therefore considered the \\"default\\" mode of the experiment. The participants' task of responding as quickly as possible to the initial signal (i.e. pressing the \\"go\\" button) remained. Upon seeing the initial go-signal, the participant would immediately intend to press the \\"go\\" button. The participant was instructed to cancel their immediate intention to press the \\"go\\" button if they saw a stop signal. The participant was instructed to select randomly (at their leisure) between either pressing the \\"go\\" button or not pressing it, if they saw a decide signal. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown after the initial go-signal (\\"decide trials\\"), for example, required that the participants prevent themselves from acting impulsively on the initial go-signal and then decide what to do. Due to the varying delays, this was sometimes impossible (e.g. some decide signals simply appeared too late in the process of them both intending to and pressing the go button for them to be obeyed). Those trials in which the subject reacted to the go-signal impulsively without seeing a subsequent signal show a quick RT of about 600 ms. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown too late, and the participant had already enacted their impulse to press the go-button (i.e. had not decided to do so), also show a quick RT of about 600 ms. Those trials in which a stop signal was shown and the participant successfully responded to it, do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant decided not to press the go-button, also do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant had not already enacted their impulse to press the go-button, but (in which it was theorised that they) had had the opportunity to decide what to do, show a comparatively slow RT, in this case closer to 1400 ms. The participant was asked at the end of those \\"decide trials\\" in which they had actually pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go- signal stimulus) or based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data, however, it appears that there was discrepancy between when the user thought that they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses) ‚Äì in this case deciding to press the go-button, and when they thought that they had acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal) ‚Äì where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed. The rationale Kuhn and Brass wanted to test participant self-knowledge. The first step was that after every decide trial, participants were next asked whether they had actually had time to decide. Specifically, the volunteers were asked to label each decide trial as either failed-to-decide (the action was the result of acting impulsively on the initial go-signal) or successful decide (the result of a deliberated decision). See the diagram on the right for this decide trial split: failed- to-decide and successful decide; the next split in this diagram (participant correct or incorrect) will be explained at the end of this experiment. Note also that the researchers sorted the participants‚Äô successful decide trials into \\"decide go\\" and \\"decide no-go\\", but were not concerned with the no-go trials, since they did not yield any RT data (and are not featured anywhere in the diagram on the right). Note that successful stop trials did not yield RT data either. The different types of trials and their different possible outcomes Kuhn and Brass now knew what to expect: primary response trials, any failed stop trials, and the \\"failed-to-decide\\" trials were all instances where the participant obviously acted impulsively ‚Äì they would show the same quick RT. In contrast, the \\"successful decide\\" trials (where the decision was a \\"go\\" and the subject moved) should show a slower RT. Presumably, if deciding whether to veto is a conscious process, volunteers should have no trouble distinguishing impulsivity from instances of true deliberate continuation of a movement. Again, this is important, since decide trials require that participants rely on self-knowledge. Note that stop trials cannot test self- knowledge because if the subject does act, it is obvious to them that they reacted impulsively. Results and implications The general distribution of reaction times for the different trials. Notice the timing of the two peaks for trials labelled \\"successful decide\\". Unsurprisingly, the recorded RTs for the primary response trials, failed stop trials, and \\"failed- to-decide\\" trials all showed similar RTs: 600 ms seems to indicate an impulsive action made without time to truly deliberate. What the two researchers found next was not as easy to explain: while some \\"successful decide\\" trials did show the tell-tale slow RT of deliberation (averaging around 1400 ms), participants had also labelled many impulsive actions as \\"successful decide\\". This result is startling because participants should have had no trouble identifying which actions were the results of a conscious \\"I will not veto\\", and which actions were un-deliberated, impulsive reactions to the initial go-signal. As the authors explain: In decide trials the participants, it seems, were not able to reliably identify whether they had really had time to decide ‚Äì at least, not based on internal signals. The authors explain that this result is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a conscious veto, but is simple to understand if the veto is considered an unconscious process. Thus it seems that the intention to move might not only arise from the subconscious, but it may only be inhibited if the subconscious says so. This conclusion could suggest that the phenomenon of \\"consciousness\\" is more of narration than direct arbitration (i.e. unconscious processing causes all thoughts, and these thoughts are again processed subconsciously). Criticisms After the above experiments, the authors concluded that subjects sometimes could not distinguish between \\"producing an action without stopping and stopping an action before voluntarily resuming\\", or in other words, they could not distinguish between actions that are immediate and impulsive as opposed to delayed by deliberation. To be clear, one assumption of the authors is that all the early (600 ms) actions are unconscious, and all the later actions are conscious. These conclusions and assumptions have yet to be debated within the scientific literature or even replicated (it is a very early study). The results of the trial in which the so-called \\"successful decide\\" data (with its respective longer time measured) was observed may have possible implications for our understanding of the role of consciousness as the modulator of a given action or response, and these possible implications cannot merely be omitted or ignored without valid reasons, specially when the authors of the experiment suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated. It is worth noting that Libet consistently referred to a veto of an action that was initiated endogenously. That is, a veto that occurs in the absence of external cues, instead relying on only internal cues (if any at all). This veto may be a different type of veto than the one explored by K√ºhn and Brass using their decide signal. Daniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from Benjamin Libet's experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events are involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it seems to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur:\\"Freedom Evolves\\" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231.Dennett, D.

The point of no return  In early 2016, PNAS published an article by researchers in Berlin, Germany, The point of no return in vetoing self- initiated movements, in which the authors set out to investigate whether human subjects had the ability to veto an action (in this study, a movement of the foot) after the detection of its Bereitschaftspotential (BP). The Bereitschaftspotential, which was discovered by Kornhuber & Deecke in 1965, is an instance of unconscious electrical activity within the motor cortex, quantified by the use of EEG, that occurs moments before a motion is performed by a person: it is considered a signal that the brain is \\"getting ready\\" to perform the motion. The study found evidence that these actions can be vetoed even after the BP is detected (i. e. after it can be seen that the brain has started preparing for the action). The researchers maintain that this is evidence for the existence of at least some degree of free will in humans: previously, it had been argued that, given the unconscious nature of the BP and its usefulness in predicting a person's movement, these are movements that are initiated by the brain without the involvement of the conscious will of the person. The study showed that subjects were able to \\"override\\" these signals and stop short of performing the movement that was being anticipated by the BP. Furthermore, researchers identified what was termed a \\"point of no return\\": once the BP is detected for a movement, the person could refrain from performing the movement only if they attempted to cancel it at least 200 milliseconds before the onset of the movement. After this point, the person was unable to avoid performing the movement. Previously, Kornhuber and Deecke underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be increased or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.Kornhuber & Deecke, 2012. The will and its brain ‚Äì an appraisal of reasoned free will. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, USA, .  Neuronal prediction of free will  Despite criticisms, experimenters are still trying to gather data that may support the case that conscious \\"will\\" can be predicted from brain activity. fMRI machine learning of brain activity (multivariate pattern analysis) has been used to predict the user choice of a button (left/right) up to 7 seconds before their reported will of having done so. Brain regions successfully trained for prediction included the frontopolar cortex (anterior medial prefrontal cortex) and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (medial parietal cortex). In order to ensure report timing of conscious \\"will\\" to act, they showed the participant a series of frames with single letters (500 ms apart), and upon pressing the chosen button (left or right) they were required to indicate which letter they had seen at the moment of decision. This study reported a statistically significant 60% accuracy rate, which may be limited by experimental setup; machine-learning data limitations (time spent in fMRI) and instrument precision. Another version of the fMRI multivariate pattern analysis experiment was conducted using an abstract decision problem, in an attempt to rule out the possibility of the prediction capabilities being product of capturing a built-up motor urge. Each frame contained a central letter like before, but also a central number, and 4 surrounding possible \\"answers numbers\\". The participant first chose in their mind whether they wished to perform an addition or subtraction operation, and noted the central letter on the screen at the time of this decision. The participant then performed the mathematical operation based on the central numbers shown in the next two frames. In the following frame the participant then chose the \\"answer number\\" corresponding to the result of the operation. They were further presented with a frame that allowed them to indicate the central letter appearing on the screen at the time of their original decision. This version of the experiment discovered a brain prediction capacity of up to 5 seconds before the conscious will to act. Multivariate pattern analysis using EEG has suggested that an evidence-based perceptual decision model may be applicable to free-will decisions. It was found that decisions could be predicted by neural activity immediately after stimulus perception. Furthermore, when the participant was unable to determine the nature of the stimulus, the recent decision history predicted the neural activity (decision). The starting point of evidence accumulation was in effect shifted towards a previous choice (suggesting a priming bias). Another study has found that subliminally priming a participant for a particular decision outcome (showing a cue for 13 ms) could be used to influence free decision outcomes. Likewise, it has been found that decision history alone can be used to predict future decisions. The prediction capacities of the Soon et al. (2008) experiment were successfully replicated using a linear SVM model based on participant decision history alone (without any brain activity data). Despite this, a recent study has sought to confirm the applicability of a perceptual decision model to free will decisions. When shown a masked and therefore invisible stimulus, participants were asked to either guess between a category or make a free decision for a particular category. Multivariate pattern analysis using fMRI could be trained on \\"free-decision\\" data to successfully predict \\"guess decisions\\", and trained on \\"guess data\\" in order to predict \\"free decisions\\" (in the precuneus and cuneus region). Contemporary voluntary decision prediction tasks have been criticised based on the possibility the neuronal signatures for pre-conscious decisions could actually correspond to lower- conscious processing rather than unconscious processing. People may be aware of their decisions before making their report, yet need to wait several seconds to be certain. However, such a model does not explain what is left unconscious if everything can be conscious at some level (and the purpose of defining separate systems). Yet limitations remain in free-will prediction research to date. In particular, the prediction of considered judgements from brain activity involving thought processes beginning minutes rather than seconds before a conscious will to act, including the rejection of a conflicting desire. Such are generally seen to be the product of sequences of evidence accumulating judgements. Other related phenomena=Retrospective construction It has been suggested that sense authorship is an illusion. Unconscious causes of thought and action might facilitate thought and action, while the agent experiences the thoughts and actions as being dependent on conscious will. We may over-assign agency because of the evolutionary advantage that once came with always suspecting there might be an agent doing something (e.g. predator). The idea behind retrospective construction is that, while part of the \\"yes, I did it\\" feeling of agency seems to occur during action, there also seems to be processing performed after the fact ‚Äì after the action is performed ‚Äì to establish the full feeling of agency. Unconscious agency processing can even alter, in the moment, how we perceive the timing of sensations or actions. K√ºhn and Brass apply retrospective construction to explain the two peaks in \\"successful decide\\" RTs. They suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated, but that the impulsive early decide trials that should have been labelled \\"failed to decide\\" were mistaken during unconscious agency processing. They say that people \\"persist in believing that they have access to their own cognitive processes\\" when in fact we do a great deal of automatic unconscious processing before conscious perception occurs. Criticism to Wegner's claims regarding the significance of introspection illusion for the notion of free will has been published.For example, criticism by H. Andersen in his article \\"Two Causal Mistakes in Wegner's Illusion of Conscious Will\\" and \\"On the alleged illusion of conscious will\\" by Van Duijn and Sacha Bem.Pronin, E. (2009). The introspection illusion. Advances in experimental social psychology, 41, 1-67. Manipulating choice Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnetism to safely stimulate or inhibit parts of the brain. Some research suggests that TMS can be used to manipulate the perception of authorship of a specific choice. Experiments showed that neurostimulation could affect which hands people move, even though the experience of free will was intact. An early TMS study revealed that activation of one side of the neocortex could be used to bias the selection of one's opposite side hand in a forced-choice decision task. Ammon and Gandevia found that it was possible to influence which hand people move by stimulating frontal regions that are involved in movement planning using transcranial magnetic stimulation in the left or right hemisphere of the brain. Right- handed people would normally choose to move their right hand 60% of the time, but when the right hemisphere was stimulated, they would instead choose their left hand 80% of the time (recall that the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere for the right). Despite the external influence on their decision-making, the subjects continued to report believing that their choice of hand had been made freely. In a follow-up experiment, Alvaro Pascual-Leone and colleagues found similar results, but also noted that the transcranial magnetic stimulation must occur within 200 milliseconds, consistent with the time-course derived from the Libet experiments. In late 2015, a team of researchers from the UK and the US published an article demonstrating similar findings. The researchers concluded that \\"motor responses and the choice of hand can be modulated using tDCS\\". However, a different attempt by Sohn et al. failed to replicate such results; later, Jeffrey Gray wrote in his book Consciousness: Creeping up on the Hard Problem that tests looking for the influence of electromagnetic fields on brain function have been universally negative in their result. Manipulating the perceived intention to move Various studies indicate that the perceived intention to move (have moved) can be manipulated. Studies have focused on the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement. In a similar study, it was found that people with no visual awareness of their body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating premotor brain regions. When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported an urge (intention) to move a specific limb (that they wanted to do so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so. This suggests that awareness of an intention to move may literally be the \\"sensation\\" of the body's early movement, but certainly not the cause. Other studies have at least suggested that \\"The greater activation of the SMA, SACC, and parietal areas during and after execution of internally generated actions suggests that an important feature of internal decisions is specific neural processing taking place during and after the corresponding action. Therefore, awareness of intention timing seems to be fully established only after execution of the corresponding action, in agreement with the time course of neural activity observed here.\\" Another experiment involved an electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while the participant was led to believe that they were entirely self-conducted. The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones, and it was found that if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones, they were more likely to say that they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires: priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses). Lau et al. set up an experiment where subjects would look at an analog-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, and the other was given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed that the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16 ms, and shifted back the 14 ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200 ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that if free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior. Related models The idea that intention co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement is reminiscent of \\"forward models of motor control\\" (FMMC), which have been used to try to explain inner speech. FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction, the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they are in control of a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see self serving biases) and top-down processing (reasoning and inferences about the situation). In this case, it is by the application of the forward model that one might imagine how other consciousness processes could be the result of efferent, predictive processing. If the conscious self is the efferent copy of actions and vetoes being performed, then the consciousness is a sort of narrator of what is already occurring in the body, and an incomplete narrator at that. Haggard, summarizing data taken from recent neuron recordings, says \\"these data give the impression that conscious intention is just a subjective corollary of an action being about to occur\\". Parallel processing helps explain how we might experience a sort of contra-causal free will even if it were determined. How the brain constructs consciousness is still a mystery, and cracking it open would have a significant bearing on the question of free will. Numerous different models have been proposed, for example, the multiple drafts model, which argues that there is no central Cartesian theater where conscious experience would be represented, but rather that consciousness is located all across the brain. This model would explain the delay between the decision and conscious realization, as experiencing everything as a continuous \\"filmstrip\\" comes behind the actual conscious decision. In contrast, there exist models of Cartesian materialismKenny, A. J. P. (1970). Descartes: philosophical letters (Vol. 94). Oxford: Clarendon Press. that have gained recognition by neuroscience, implying that there might be special brain areas that store the contents of consciousness; this does not, however, rule out the possibility of a conscious will. Other models such as epiphenomenalism argue that conscious will is an illusion, and that consciousness is a by-product of physical states of the world. Work in this sector is still highly speculative, and researchers favor no single model of consciousness. (See also Philosophy of mind.)  Related brain disorders  Various brain disorders implicate the role of unconscious brain processes in decision-making tasks. Auditory hallucinations produced by schizophrenia seem to suggest a divergence of will and behaviour. The left brain of people whose hemispheres have been disconnected has been observed to invent explanations for body movement initiated by the opposing (right) hemisphere, perhaps based on the assumption that their actions are consciously willed. Likewise, people with \\"alien hand syndrome\\" are known to conduct complex motor movements against their will.  Neural models of voluntary action  A neural model for voluntary action proposed by Haggard comprises two major circuits. The first involving early preparatory signals (basal ganglia substantia nigra and striatum), prior intention and deliberation (medial prefrontal cortex), motor preparation/readiness potential (preSMA and SMA), and motor execution (primary motor cortex, spinal cord and muscles). The second involving the parietal-pre- motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping (premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex, and back to the premotor cortex). He proposed that voluntary action involves external environment input (\\"when decision\\"), motivations/reasons for actions (early \\"whether decision\\"), task and action selection (\\"what decision\\"), a final predictive check (late \\"whether decision\\") and action execution. Another neural model for voluntary action also involves what, when, and whether (WWW) based decisions. The \\"what\\" component of decisions is considered a function of the anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in conflict monitoring. The timing (\\"when\\") of the decisions are considered a function of the preSMA and SMA, which is involved in motor preparation. Finally, the \\"whether\\" component is considered a function of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex.  Prospection  Martin Seligman and others criticize the classical approach in science that views animals and humans as \\"driven by the past\\" and suggest instead that people and animals draw on experience to evaluate prospects they face and act accordingly. The claim is made that this purposive action includes evaluation of possibilities that have never occurred before and is experimentally verifiable. Seligman and others argue that free will and the role of subjectivity in consciousness can be better understood by taking such a \\"prospective\\" stance on cognition and that \\"accumulating evidence in a wide range of research suggests [this] shift in framework\\".

The Cowboys currently lead the all-time series 17‚Äì15. The two teams met in the Super Bowl three times. They play in different conferences (In which the Dallas Cowboys are in the NFC East and the Pittsburgh Steelers are in the AFC North), they only meet once every four regular seasons and occasionally in the preseason. Similarities between the two regions Western Pennsylvania with the Pittsburgh Tri-State area (including parts of Northern West Virginia and Eastern Ohio) and the entire state of Texas are known to be football hotbeds at all levels. High school football in both regions draws crowds in the tens of thousands and gets regular press coverage in both regions. The local communities in both regions usually shut down local businesses for these games, which also serve as the largest social gathering for many of these communities. College football is popular in both regions, and have produced powerhouse football teams. Four of the ten Big 12 Conference schools are located in Texas, while Pitt Panthers, Penn State Nittany Lions and West Virginia Mountaineers are in the Pittsburgh Tri-State Region with many fans of the nearby Ohio State Buckeyes residing in the area. In addition to these traditional powers, during the birth of the college game the Pittsburgh city schools of Duquesne University, Carnegie Mellon University and Washington & Jefferson College all qualified for multiple major-bowls in the 1910s through the 1940s and annually ranked in the top 10 of the AP. While in Texas the Longhorns have had at least one player selected in each of the last 71 NFL Drafts dating back to 1938, while Penn State itself had a 53-year draft streak that ended in 2005. Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive lineman Ernie Stautner, who played his entire 14-year career with the Steelers, later served as defensive coordinator under Cowboys head coach and fellow Hall of Famer Tom Landry during the Cowboys successful run in the 1970s, while the Cowboys would later draft another Hall of Famer, Tony Dorsett, the Pitt standout and Heisman Trophy winner and native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Hopewell Township.

Former Buffalo Bills head coach Chan Gailey served as offensive coordinator in Pittsburgh before becoming the head coach of the Cowboys for two years in the late 1990s. There have also been demographic shifts in both regions that have contributed to Pittsburgh fans living in Dallas, and Dallas fans living in Pittsburgh. In the 1980s the Pittsburgh region was hit hard by the decline and closure of many steel mills and related industries in the region. Many left the region to find work elsewhere, including Texas.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/business/economy/08collapse.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&adxnnl;=1&adxnnlx;=1338474337-iJrNlZ4IxiQcQEBug4LpCg Since this was shortly after the Super Bowl teams of the 1970s, fans' allegiance to the Steelers naturally stayed strong ‚Äì the beginnings of Steeler Nation.

History=1952‚Äì1960: Before the Cowboys The roots to the Cowboys‚ÄìSteelers rivalry can be traced several years before the Cowboys played a game, and to another team entirely. Following the 1951 NFL season, New York Yanks owner Ted Collins sold his team back to the NFL due to financial difficulties competing with the New York Giants in the same market, as well as the All-America Football Conference folding just two years before and putting a severe drain on the team. Not wanting the team to compete with the Giants in the same market, the NFL decided to move the rights to the franchise to either the Dallas ‚Äì Fort Worth Metroplex or Baltimore. Baltimore had previously been home to an NFL team, the original Baltimore Colts which had come over from the AAFC along with the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers, but had folded after the 1950 NFL season due to financial difficulties despite strong fan support. Dallas, and the state of Texas in general, was a true expansion market that was untapped, and the NFL owners liked the appeal that Dallas offered due to the aforementioned following of football in the state. The NFL owners voted 10‚Äì1 to award the assets of the Yanks to the Dallas group led by Giles Miller as opposed to the Baltimore group, which became the Dallas Texans. The lone holdout was Steelers founder and owner Art Rooney.75 Seasons: The Complete Story of the National Football League, p. 103 Rooney, an Irish Catholic, was more tolerant of African Americans than the other owners (most of whom were Protestant and had their own discrimination towards Catholics) and was concerned about the racism that existed in the Southern United States at the time and the subsequent civil rights movement that would take place later in the decade. Rooney's assumptions would be later proven correct: while the Texans struggled on the field, it also struggled at the gate partly because two of the team's best players, George Taliaferro and Buddy Young, were both black, which made fans in Texas automatically turn away from the team simply because of prejudice. The Texans folded after the 1952 NFL season and their assets would be sold to Carroll Rosenbloom to form the new Baltimore Colts, which currently play in Indianapolis. 1960‚Äì1969: Early years After the failure of the Texans, the NFL had no plans to return to the state in the foreseeable future. However, in 1959, Lamar Hunt, the son of oil tycoon H. L. Hunt, approached the NFL about putting another expansion team in Dallas. The NFL said no, stating that the league was not expanding at the time. He then approached the Chicago Cardinals about buying the team from owner Violet Bidwill Wolfner, who ultimately decided to keep the team and whose son Bill Bidwill remains the owner (the Cardinals did move to St. Louis, Missouri for the 1960 NFL season; the team currently is based in Phoenix, Arizona; the Cowboys and Cardinals were divisional rivals from 1961‚Äì66, and again from 1970‚Äì2001). Due to these rebuffs, Hunt formed the American Football League with his own Dallas team, the AFL's incarnation of the Dallas Texans. In response, the NFL suddenly reversed course and awarded an expansion team to Dallas for the 1960 season that ultimately became the Cowboys. The plan worked: although the Texans were by far the better team on the field and won the 1962 AFL Championship, due to the Cowboys being part of the more- established NFL, the Texans took their AFL Championship north to Kansas City, Missouri, where they remain as the Kansas City Chiefs. In the meantime, the Cowboys started play in the NFL in 1960. Their first game was against the same Steelers team that voted against putting an NFL team in Dallas eight years earlier, with the Steelers coming away with a 35‚Äì28 victory at the Cotton Bowl, en route to an 0‚Äì11‚Äì1 first season for the Cowboys. The following year, the two teams met again in the season opener at the Cotton Bowl and the results would be different: the young Cowboys beat the veteran-filled Steelers 27‚Äì24, the first victory for the Cowboys in franchise history. The two teams would head in opposite directions the rest of the decade, with the Cowboys competing for the NFL championship in 1966 and 1967 (both losses to the Vince Lombardi-led Green Bay Packers, the latter matchup in the Ice Bowl) while the Steelers would be among the NFL's worst teams, culminating in a 1‚Äì13 record in 1969 that saw the team win its season opener against the Detroit Lions, then lose every game afterwards in the first season of Hall of Fame head coach Chuck Noll. The Cowboys defeated the Steelers 10‚Äì7 at Pitt Stadium in week 12 of the 1969 season, the final meeting between the clubs before the AFL-NFL merger. 1970‚Äì1979: Teams of the 1970s The Steelers would be moved to the newly formed American Football Conference as a result of the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger for the 1970 NFL season while the Cowboys would be placed in the National Football Conference. The Cowboys would split the first two Super Bowl matchups of the decade while the Steelers started improving. Around this time, both teams would have firm identities. Both were strong on defense with the Steelers' famed Steel Curtain defense, called a \\"Stunt 4‚Äì3\\", while the Cowboys boasted the Doomsday Defense, based around Landry's \\"Flex\\" 4‚Äì3 defense. On the offensive side of the ball brought key differences, as the Cowboys had Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach and his aerial attack, as well as his reputation for fourth-quarter comebacks, earning him the nickname \\"Captain Comeback\\". The Steelers meanwhile, were powered offensively by the running game, led by Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris. The teams met in September 1972 at Texas Stadium, with the Cowboys prevailing 17‚Äì13. The Steelers would go on to win the AFC Central division and qualify for the playoffs for the first time. In the postseason, Pittsburgh defeated the Oakland Raiders 13‚Äì7 on Franco Harris' \\"Immaculate Reception\\", but lost the AFC championship game to the eventual Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins 21‚Äì17. Dallas qualified for the playoffs as the NFC wildcard team, where they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round 30-28, but lost the NFC championship game to their division rivals, the Washington Redskins, 26-3. The two had their first postseason meeting in Super Bowl X, with both teams vying to tie the Packers and Miami Dolphins for their second Super Bowl Championship. The Steelers won this game, 21‚Äì17, after safety Glen Edwards intercepted a Staubach pass in the end zone to seal the victory. The hostility was evident in the third quarter when Steelers kicker Roy Gerela missed his second field goal, a 33-yard attempt. After the miss, Cowboys safety Cliff Harris mockingly patted Gerela on his helmet and thanked him for \\"helping Dallas out\\", but was immediately shoved to the ground by Steeler linebacker Jack Lambert. Lambert could have been ejected from the game for defending his teammate, but the officials decided to allow him to remain.No. 13 of 100 Greatest Super Bowl Moments, espn.com (Last retrieved October 28, 2005) After the Cowboys won Super Bowl XII, the two would meet again in Super Bowl XIII, considered one of the greatest Super Bowls ever played and consisted of a combined 20 players, coaches, and front-office administration that ended up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, an NFL record. The Steelers would once again come victorious, holding off the Cowboys 35‚Äì31. By this point, both teams would have rabid fan bases established nationally due to prominent television exposure. The two would meet in the regular season in 1979 at Three Rivers Stadium, a 14‚Äì3 Steelers victory that many thought would be preview of Super Bowl XIV. While the Steelers did go on to win Super Bowl XIV that season, the Los Angeles Rams crashed the party, having upset the Cowboys in the divisional round of the playoffs 21‚Äì19 in Staubach's last game en route to meeting the Steelers in Super Bowl XIV. 1980‚Äì1989: Down years Age eventually caught up to both teams once the 1980s hit, though both remained competitive into the middle of the decade. The highlight of the decade for this rivalry would come in the 1982 season opener at Texas Stadium, when the Steelers ended the Cowboys NFL-record 17-year season-opening winning streak with a 36‚Äì28 victory against the Cowboys. By the middle of the decade, both teams were rebuilding. The 1986 NFL season would be the first year since the 1965 NFL season that both teams missed the playoffs, which would happen for two more years before the Steelers clinched a wild card spot in 1989. During this time, the Steelers, with a mix of aging veterans and younger players, remained competitive in the AFC Central while the wheels fell off completely in Dallas. In 1988, both Tom Landry and Chuck Noll appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated together, asking if both coaches had lost their touch. Though both teams had young future Hall of Famers in Michael Irvin and Rod Woodson, the Cowboys and Steelers would finish 3‚Äì13 and 5‚Äì11, respectively, for 1988. New Cowboys owner Jerry Jones fired Landry after the season. Noll would retire just three seasons later after missing the playoffs by just a few games each year after his breakout 1989 wild-card spot and two playoff thrillers, a 26‚Äì23 overtime victory in Houston and a 24‚Äì23 loss at Denver. 1990‚Äìpresent: Return to prominence The Cowboys would return to prominence in the 1990s, winning three Super Bowls, while the Steelers would return to AFC Championship contention under head coach Bill Cowher. The rivalry resumed in the 1990s, but unlike the 1970s matchups that were dominated by Pittsburgh, Dallas got the upper hand this time around. The Cowboys swept all four matchups between the two teams in the decade. The possibility of Cowboys‚ÄìSteelers III for Super Bowl XXIX existed, as both teams advanced to their respective conference championships. Such a matchup would be a rematch from Week 1 of the regular season, which the Cowboys won 26‚Äì9. The Cowboys were the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, while the Steelers behind their \\"Blitzburgh\\" defense was the favorite to win the AFC. However, the favored Steelers were upset by the San Diego Chargers 17‚Äì13 while the San Francisco 49ers, who had lost in the NFC Championship game the previous two years to the Cowboys, beat the Cowboys 38‚Äì28. Fans would only have to wait another year for Cowboys‚ÄìSteelers III in the Super Bowl, as both teams advanced to Super Bowl XXX. Like the previous two matchups, the game was close, but this time favored the Cowboys, who won 27‚Äì17 after Steelers quarterback Neil O'Donnell threw two interceptions to Cowboys cornerback Larry Brown, who would be named Super Bowl MVP for his efforts. The Steelers have remained competitive since, winning two more Super Bowls (Super Bowl XL, Super Bowl XLIII) and losing one (Super Bowl XLV), while the Cowboys have not been back to the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXX and have won only four playoff games from 1996 onward without reaching the NFC Championship. The two teams have only met four times since the 1998 NFL season. The Steelers defeated the Cowboys in the first two games, winning 24‚Äì20 in 2004 and 20‚Äì13 in 2008. The Cowboys then defeated the Steelers in 2012 by a 27‚Äì24 margin in overtime and again in 2016 by a 35‚Äì30 margin.

History  The community derives its name from the city of Multan, situated in Pakistan. Multani literally means an inhabitant of the city of Multan. They are said to have emigrated from Multan during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Begada. The Multani are said to have originally belonged to the cotton/ salt traders community. They are further divided into four territorial groupings, the Zhalmed (those from Ahmadabad, the Gohilvad (from Surat), the Chorasi (from Rajkot) and the Kathiawari (from Kathiawar). Each division consists of ten to twelve clans. For example, the Zhalmed Multanis have the following clans, the Hamod, Makhyola, Chauhan, Phor, Ghori, Vakani, Babar Phanota and Solanki. Like many Gujarati Muslim communities, they maintain the principles of gotra exogamy.  Present Situation  Many modern day Multanis are of the Lubana caste. The community's are now occupied in cotton carding or ginning, but they are distinct from the Mansoori, another community associated with this occupation. Many Multanis are also employed in the diamond industry that has sprung up in the city of Surat. Like other Gujarati Muslims, they have their own caste association, which maintains social control over the community. In fact, each of the four divisions have their own caste associations. Current day members of the Multani caste are involved in modern-day applications. Many members of the Multani caste live in both India and Pakistan, due to the creation of Pakistan, many migrated to India after the Partition of India.

Arriving before the town on 5 February 1791, Cornwallis captured the town by assault on 7 February, and after six weeks of siege, stormed the fortress on 21 March. The Bangalore fort, ca. 1791, was described as follows: Tipu Sultan followed Cornwallis' army, placing him in the awkward position of having an undefeated enemy army at his back while besieging the a strong fortification. Tipu kept away hoping to take assault when underway in flank. Over the next twelve days, two companies of the Madras Pioneers provided sappers for eight batteries, dug several parallels and a trench up to the fort ditch. Cornwallis attacked secretly on the night of 21 March 1791. The Madras Pioneers, led by Lt Colin Mackenzie, crossed the ditch with scaling ladders, mounted the breach and entered the fort, while the artillery engaged the fort with blank ammunition. With a breach made, the main stormers rushed in and the fort was captured after a hand-to hand fight in which a thousand defenders were killed. Cornwallis captured the fort and secured the force against Tipu. The Madras Pioneers, went on to make Bangalore their permanent home.

However, the resistance lasted a few hours, and the fort fell to the British. Loss of the Bangalore Fort resulted in severe loss of morale amongst Tippu's soldiers. The British occupied the Bangalore Fort only for a year, as it was returned to Tippu Sultan, following the defeat of Tippu Sultan in 1792 and the consequent Treaty of Seringapatam. However, after the fall of Tippu Sultan in 1799, the Bangalore Fort came under British control. A British garrison was stationed at the fort till 1888, when it was handed over to the civil authorities. Today, very little remains to remind people of the battle, except for a plaque (see picture), which reads \\"Through this breach the British assault was delivered. 21 March 1791.\\" Fort Cemetery and the Demolished Cenotaph Cenotaph, Bangalore Hudson Memorial Church can be seen in the background. (The memorial was vandalised on 28 October 1964) The Fort Cemetery, where the officers who fell in the Siege of Bangalore were buried, is illustrated in Robert Home's book, Select Views in Mysore, the country of Tippoo Sultan, published by Robert Bowyer, London, 1794. Home's painting shows the graves of Captains James Smith, James Williamson, John Shipper, Nathaniel Daws and Jeremiah Delany, Lieutenant Conan and Lieutenant-Colonel Gratton. As recorded in 1895, The cemetery was located just outside the Fort Church, with the church being responsible for its maintenance. The cemetery had cypress trees, rose bushes and flowers. The Government of Mysore, had constructed a wall and gate for the cemetery. However, as recorded in 1912 by Rev. Frank Penny in his book The Church in Madras: Volume II, the cemetery no longer existed. The record of the offers who fell in the battle for the Bangalore Fort in 1791, were transferred to the cenotaph, raised by the Government of Mysore. The 35 feet tall cenotaph pillar was raised in memory of the lives lost in the Siege of Bangalore, opposite to the present Corporation Building, and Hudson Memorial Church. Kannada activists led by Vatal Nagaraj and others made violent demands to demolish the cenotaph. As a result of these protests, the Bangalore City Corporation demolished the memorial on 28 October 1964, and the name of the road was also changed from Cenotaph Road to Nrupathunga Road. The engraved stones were destroyed, and not even a single stone remains. A small piece of the Cenotaph has been placed as a bench in the Corporation Office. Historians, and heritage lovers of Banaglore City are however enraged with this destruction of history. Well known blogger on Bangalore, Samyuktha Harshitha, calls it as 'official vandalism', comparing it with the destruction of the Bamiyan statues.

Life and work Edwin Edwards was born in Framlingham, Suffolk in 1823 the son of a Norfolk squire.Lucie-Smith, E. Henri Fantin-Latour (Rizzoli, 1977) He trained as a lawyer and held the legal post of the King's Proctor and Examiner of the Courts of Civil Law and the High Court of Admiralty courts until 1861, when at the age of 38 he retired from the profession and devoted himself to art.Lucie-Smith, E.

A treatise on the jurisdiction of the High Court of Admiralty of England (Benning & Co, 1847). Edwards was inspired to become an etcher by the French artist Henri Fantin- Latour, whom he first met in Paris in 1861. Fantin-Latour made a return visit to Edwards at his Sunbury-on-Thames home and legend has it Edwards decided to become an artist that instant.The Connoisseur, Volume 12 (1905) Edwards went on to become a successful landscape painter and etcher, based in Sunbury and London. His subjects were mainly views in the south of England, especially Devon and Cornwall.Wood, C. The Dictionary of Victorian Painters (Antique Collectors Club, 1978) He was well connected within European artistic circles, befriending and being encouraged in particular by Alphonse Legros and James McNeil Whistler, the latter also sharing a passion for vocal music. In 1861 Edwards made an etching trip along the Thames with Whistler, Fantin-Latour and Francis Seymour Haden during which he executed a portrait of Whistler sketching, seated, at Moulsey lock.From realism to symbolism: Whistler and his world (Columbia University, 1971) Charles Keene was also a friend of Edwards as well as Jacques-Emile Blanche, √âdouard Manet, Swinburne and Jacquemart.Clement, W. Portraits of a lifetime (J.M. Dent & Sons ltd., 1937) In a letter of 1874 Fantin-Latour described a projected double portrait which would depict Edwards sitting working at his etching table with his wife at his side 'like a guardian angel'. By February 1875 the couple were in Paris for the sittings. In the final painting, the artist produced a modified version of his first idea. Edwards sits at an angle, seemingly unaware of the spectator, while his wife faces the viewer with an uncompromising stare. The portrait was exhibited at the Salon of 1875, where it received a second-class medal. It was donated to the Tate Gallery by Ruth Edwards in 1904 and is currently on loan to the National Gallery, London.Mr and Mrs Edwin Edwards (1875 Portrait by Fantin-Latour) A French art critic wrote in 1879, \\"Edwin Edwards ira √† la posterit√©, non seulement par ses ≈ìuvres, mais aussi par ses amiti√©s.

To the east is the summit of the Kapuzenturm, a striking and isolated rock pinnacle. In 1883 the first summit cross was erected on the mountain top. The base camp for climbing tours on this mountain is the Grutten Hut mountain hut on its southern flank, at a height of 1,620 m. There is also the unoccupied, tiny Babenstuber Hut, immediately below the summit. This shelter and emergency refuge has stood on the Ellmauer Halt since 1891, but is not weatherproof. In any case the peak should only be climbed in good weather with dry conditions by experienced climbers with secure footwear, no fear of heights and climbing agility. Due to the popularity of the Ellmauer Halt there is a high risk of falling rocks, especially on the normal path, the Gams√§ngersteig. A helmet and even a Klettersteig set are therefore recommended.  Routes  Two well-known Klettersteigs (climbing paths) lead to the summit: * The Gams√§ngersteig from the Grutten Hut is the normal route and is of medium difficulty. It is generally well secured, but is used on good summer's days by countless climbers, so there is a high risk of falling rocks. It takes 2.5 hours to climb. * The Kaisersch√ºtzensteig is a demanding alternative to the normal route. It is much longer, harder and technically more difficult than the Gams√§ngersteig. In addition, in starting from the Kaisertal, a substantial approach march and greater height difference have to be overcome. The starting points are the Anton Karg Haus or Hans Berger Haus. The Kaisersch√ºtzensteig is very scenic and crosses all three summits of the massif: the Kleine Halt, the Gamshalt and the Ellmauer Halt and offers some impressive views. Climbing time: 4 hours. Also: * Rote-Rinn-Scharte (Rote Rinn wind gap) which is the marked climb running from the Hans-Berger-Haus via the Scharlinger Boden up to the Rote-Rinn-Scharte. This saddle is also used by the Gams√§ngersteig, enabling the Grutten Hut to be reached. This route acts as a link between the Kaisertal in the north and the Grutten Hut in the south. * The so-called Kopft√∂rlgrat is the eastern ar√™te of the Ellmauer Halt over which a very popular climbing route runs (UIAA grade III-IV).

In 1825, he published a Historical Sketch of the Formation of the American Confederacy (8 vol.), and from 1827 to 1835 he edited the American Annual Register. He also published Speeches, Reviews, and Reports (1843) and Merchants' and Shipmasters' Assistant (1829 and 1848). He was long a leading Whig and protectionist.

These activities include initiating and nurturing partnerships, networks, and alliances between and among faculty at their institutions and funding agencies; and designing and implementing strategic services for their faculty and researcher constituents (such as workshops, trainings, program officer visits, proposal editing, PR communications, funding opportunity searches and dissemination, budget preparation, forms and submission assistance, research team building, and administering campus limited submission reviews).http://nordp.org/ Research development professionals initiate and nurture critical partnerships and alliances throughout the institutional research enterprise and between institutions and with their external stakeholders. With the goal of enabling competitive individual and team research and facilitating research excellence, research development professionals build and implement strategic services and collaborative resources that span across disciplinary and administrative barriers within their organizations and nothing beyond.Levin, J. 2011. The Emergence of the Research-Development Professional. Chronicle of Higher Education, March 27, 2011. http://chronicle.com/article/The-Emergence-of-the/126906/ Research development differs significantly from university development (institutional fundraising or advancement) in that RD is not aimed at attracting contributions or donations. Rather, RD strengthens research programs and proposals to make them more competitive for extramural contracts and grants from governmental, private and non-profit funding agencies. Similarly, RD should not be confused with research and development (R&D;) which refers to investments in (often) corporate scientific and technological research that leads to new products and applications. Recent contractions in the availability of public and private research funding have intensified competition for fewer resources among universities. This trend has amplified the need for research development assistance and interventions at universities in order to enhance research excellence and competitiveness.Mason, E. and L. Learned. 2006. The Role of ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù in a Research Administration Office. J. Res. Admin. 37(1): 23-34. These services have not traditionally been offered through university-sponsored research and projects offices that administer the submission of grant proposals and research funds management. In response to these challenges, research development is increasingly becoming a standard practice at universities, particularly research universities (defined, by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, as universities that place a high priority on research and rely heavily on extramural funding).The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/ Research development professionals and services are typically housed in a university's central \\"Office of Research\\" (or similar), or within a more specific department or research unit devoted to a particular discipline or school. Research development activities are also included in some sponsored research and projects offices. There are also independent consulting firms that provide research development services. According to the US-based National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP), there are currently over 800 research development professionals employed at over 300 institutions (colleges/universities, teaching/not-for-profit hospitals, independent not- for-profit research organizations, national laboratories, research organizations wholly organized and administered by a college or university, consortia of colleges and universities, associations/societies with individual or institutional members predominantly from colleges and universities) across the United States

The organization grew from an informal network of over 100 individuals engaged in research development activities at universities and research institutions across the United States. The central goals of NORDP are to serve these professionals, by providing a formal organization to support their professional development, to enhance institutional research competitiveness, and to catalyze new research and institutional collaborations.NORDP. http://nordp.org/index.php Team science Team science is \\"scientific collaboration, i.e., research conducted by more than one individual in an interdependent fashion\\"Cooke, N.J. and Hilton, M.L., eds. 2015.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as an ocean escort. She was named for Kamloops, British Columbia. Background Flower-class corvettes like Kamloops serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Originally named Jasper for Jasper, Alberta, she was ordered on 14 February 1940 as part of the 1939-1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down on 29 April 1940 by Victoria Machinery Depot Co. Ltd. at Victoria, British Columbia and launched 7 August later that year. Before commissioning, her name was changed to Kamloops due to a name conflict with Royal Navy vessel and she was commissioned as such into the Royal Canadian Navy on 17 March 1941 at Victoria. Kamloops had two major refits during her career. The first took place at Liverpool, Nova Scotia beginning in February 1943 and took three months to complete. The second refit began mid-December 1943 and was completed in April 1944. The refit took place at Charlottetown during which her fo'c'sle was extended. War duty HMCS Kamloops with diffused lighting camouflage fittings on struts around the funnel Kamloops arrived in Halifax in June 1941. She was assigned to Halifax Force and spent the rest of the year as a local escort. In September 1941, she took part in the Canadian Navy's secret trials of diffused lighting camouflage, a technology for concealing ships from submarines at night. In January 1942 she began use as an anti-submarine training ship in Halifax and Pictou, which lasted until January 1943 before heading off for refit. After the refit, Kamloops joined Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) in March 1943 for a brief period before transferring Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-2 in June. She remained with this group until the end of the war. During her service with C-2, Kamloops took part in the severe convoy battle for ONS 18/ON 202, which lost six merchant ships and three escorts. At the end of the war, Kamloops was paid off on 27 June 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold for scrap later that year on 19 October and broken up at Amherstburg, Ontario.

Military service Randall joined the Royal Flying Corps as a cadet, and was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 4 April 1917, being appointed a flying officer (observer) and confirmed in his rank on 15 July, with seniority from 17 May. He served for some time in No. 3 Squadron RFC as an observer/gunner, before training as a pilot, being promoted to lieutenant, finally being appointed a flying officer on 20 May 1918. He was then posted to No. 20 Squadron RAF, flying the Bristol F.2 Fighter, and shot down eleven German fighter aircraft between 24 July and 10 November 1918. His last two victories, on the day before the Armistice, won him a Distinguished Flying Cross. His observer/gunners included Sergeant Arthur Ernest Newland.

In the ravine (Sparchenklamm) on the valley floor flows the stream of the Kaiserbach (Sparchenbach), which discharges north of Kufstein into the Inn (river). It is home to several, scenic isolated farms (e.g. the Pfandlhof and Veitenhof). A popular calendar image is St. Anthony's Chapel (Antoniuskapelle) on the Kaisertal footpath in the centre of the valley. The Kaisertal lies within the Kaisergebirge Nature Reserve (created in 1963) and, until 1 June 2008, could only be reached on foot. The most frequently used approach route runs from Eichelwang (Ebbs) over ca. 280 steps on the Kaiseraufstieg into the valley. The Kaisertal was the last inhabited valley in Austria without a road link. The cars and motorcycles of the farmers in the Kaisertal were either flown in by helicopter or transported in pieces over the Kaiseraufstieg. For years there were discussions about improving access to the Kaisertal. Suggestions included the construction of an inclined lift (Schr√§gaufzug) or an improved form of the existing aerial ropeway (Materialseilbahn) from Kufstein. The first cut of the spade for the construction of a road from Ebbs through a ca. 800 m long tunnel to the Kaisertal took place on 19 May 2006. For reasons of nature conservation the road was only to be used by the inhabitants, firms and emergency vehicles (secured with barriers and keys). The building of the road was only agreed after years of negotiations by the village of Ebbs with the town of Kufstein (the largest land owner in the Kaisertal). For a long time Kufstein was against the road in the Kaisertal for conservation reasons and had offered to upgrade the existing cable car for the inhabitants there so that vehicles could be transported there. This was rejected by the village of Ebbs. On 10 March 2007 the tunnel broke through into the Kaisertal. The development of the tunnel and the road were completed in autumn 2007; work then began on canalisation in the valley. On 31 May 2008 the tunnel was officially opened to traffic.

These messengers requested the asylia, or inviolability, of a sanctuary of Asclepius. The Decree, one of four cities‚Äô, is an agreement to respect this request of. The asylia would later be revoked by the Roman emperor Diocletian. History of Asylia From the 260s BCE to early Roman imperial times, Greek cities sought and received recognition of their asylia from other parts of the Greek world‚Äîkings, cities, leagues‚Äîand eventually from the Roman Empire itself. Asylia means inviolatibility, or freedom from desecration. What the asylia pertained to in each city‚Äôs case was different. The city could be asking for the asylia of an important sanctuary belonging to the city, the city itself and the territory surrounding it, or a combination of both. According to M.M. Austin, the reasons for these requests stemmed from the instability of the times. With groups such as the Aetolians inflicting random acts of violence in a time of peace, cities sought protection from their neighbors. What actual benefits came out of these decrees is unclear; they merely state that they recognize the asylia of the requested area. The city of Cos Cos, or Kos, is located on the Greek island of the same name. The Dorians invaded in the 11th century, with a strong portion of their people bringing along their Asclepius cult for which the city would become very famous for. The city was also well known for its wine. After the Greco-Persian Wars, Cos joined the Delian League and became a strong Athenian outpost in the Aegean Sea. The city reached its high point during the Hellenistic Period. It was allied with Egypt, and housed an extension of the Alexandrian Library. It was also the home of the famous physician Hippocrates, who is acclaimed as the father of western medicine. The Asclepius cult garnered a lot of attention for Cos. Asclepius was the Greek god of medicine and healing, a mortal who was granted immortality by Zeus. The original center for the cult was at Epidauros, founded around 500 BCE. However, Cos became another major center due to the large group of people from Epidauros who came with the Dorians. Other centers for the cult were at Pergamon and Athens. The cult itself was elective, in that people, both men and women, from all kinds of social background could participate in cult practices; it was not limited to people who had been chosen for the cult by their parents or who sought initiation later in life. The cult was open to all. To participate, any ill Greek would seek guidance in their dreams by spending the night in the sanctuary. If the god appeared in their dream and either healed them, or suggested a possible cure, then the sick person would make an offering. The cult reached the pinnacle of its popularity in the 4th century BCE. The decree In approximately 242, the city of Cos sent envoys to many Macedonian as well as Greek cities. They were received by Heracleodorus, son of Aristion. The messengers requested that these cities recognize the asylia of the Asclepius sanctuary in Cos. In the Decree, the city of Philippi agrees to recognize the sanctuary is inviolate, or asylos. Basically, the Philippians announced that they will not desecrate or disturb the sanctuary based on this truce. The rest of the Decree details how the ‚Äúsacred ambassadors‚Äù honored the government of Philippi and its king, Antigonus, and how the government in turn honored them. The ambassadors provided a sacrifice to Asclepius and the truce with Philippi, and they also renewed kinship with the city. In return, the ambassadors were provided for during their stay in the city, and were also granted escort and money to ‚Äúensure their safe journey to Neapolis.‚Äù The Decree is found on SEG 12.373, lines 35-55, Rigsby (1996), 138-40, and Hatzopoulos (1996), II no. 36. Other responses to envoy The Decree of Philippi is inscribed on the same tablet at two other cities, and the city was only one out of four who responded to the request of Cos. The other cities who responded are Cassandrea and Amphipolis, with decrees inscribed with Philippi‚Äôs, and Pella, whose decree was inscribed separately. These cities also agreed to uphold and respect the asylia of the Asclepius sanctuary at Cos. The city of Cos would have benefited greatly from these agreements, since the other cities‚Äîespecially Philippi and Pella‚Äîwere important cities in Macedonia. Pella served as administrative capital, and Philippi, the ancient stronghold of Crenidas, was named after Alexander the Great's father Philip II.

Typically the supplier performs the FAI and the purchaser reviews or approves the report. Another method is for both the supplier and purchaser perform the First Article on the ordered product. The evaluation report consists of assuring all the properties and features are compliant to its specifications, for example a drawing. Despite the name, the inspected article may not necessarily be the 'first' produced, but an item or random sample of parts from the first lot. First article inspection is typically called for in a purchase order contract between the producer and buyer of a manufactured article. Depending on the inspection capability, the type of product and the governing specification, a first article inspection may be conducted by an approved 2nd party supplier that is a dimensional metrology laboratory using a variety of calibrated tools such as coordinate-measuring machines (CMM), cmm/vision systems and programmable 3-axis measurement systems. First article inspections are commonplace for military subcontractors. The protocol is, however, required for design verification, purchasing controls, from the supplier and the purchasers receiving inspection in many non-military industries, particularly aerospace, automotive and medical manufacturing. Manufacturers delivering products to government bodies or in regulated industries such as medical device must typically meet more stringent requirements than international requirements. If there are special test requirements outside of the suppliers capability then test maybe subcontracted to a 3rd party accredited testing lab.First Article and Production Lot Testing Defense Contract Management Agency Medical Device 21 CFR 820. This is normally called First Article Test and is a separate activity from FAI. Some general standards which apply to first article inspection are produced by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization), the SAE AS (Society of Automotive Engineers Aerospace Standards), the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), the IAF (International Accreditation Forum) the ILAC (International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation) however more stringent regulations may apply in the U.S. in regulated industries. First article inspection can fulfill the process validation requirement of a quality management system such as ISO9001, EN9100, and AS9100. Within the Aerospace industry SAE AS9102 Aerospace First Article Inspection Requirement is used. This standard also supports the Aerospace Series ‚Äì Requirements for Advanced Product Quality, Planning and Production Part Approval Process. Type *To verify the accuracy of drawings and ensure that they reflect any changes made to parts design during the prototype design. *To verify the production process in every parameter, rather than just concentrating on ‚Äúcritical‚Äù dimensions. *To verify all tooling used to produce a part, to ensure that it is capable of producing parts to specifications. *To verify the ability of the manufacturer to meet the needs of production. Enhanced first article inspections With the use of modern computers in the manufacturing environment, first article inspections are no longer being used with the traditional three form layout on paper but instead recorded digitally and stored on servers for easy access and organization. Recording the first article digitally eliminates errors with the help of software that keeps track of the FAIs and generates reports immediately after successful completion of an FAI. By industry=Aviation and aerospace AS9102 is the North American aerospace standard for First Article Inspection Requirements (like SJAC9102 for Japanese Aerospace Standards and EN9102 for European Aerospace Standards). First article inspection can be documented on Forms 1 (Part Number Accountability), 2 (Product Accountability), and 3 (Characteristic Accountability, Verification and Compatibility Evaluation). Form 3 may often be referred to 3D data models or 2D technical data sheets (also called ballooned drawings), where the characterics are uniquely identified. Some software solutions insert a grid on the 2D data sheets, so that the measured characteristics may be uniquely identified by the part number and the related revision number of the 2D data sheet, and the relative position of the characteristics on it (e.g.: in quarter A2, C10). In a 3D data model, the point of each measured characteristics is uniquely identified by three numbers: the coordinate vector, that gives his Triangulation in a 3D space. First Article Inspection is part of AS9145, Requirements for Advanced Product Quality Planning and Production Part Approval Process (APQP/PPAP), Phase 4 and is a required document for APQP/PPAP approval. See Production Part Approval Process. Many large aerospace companies including Bombardier Aerospace, and Spirit AeroSystems have recently switched to enhanced first article inspections in order to keep track of the numerous first articles received by different companies within the company's supply chain. Suppliers to these companies, including Machine Shops, are also turning to enhanced first article inspections to improve manufacturing productivity and throughput by eliminating the manual process of creating FAIs. Customers who perform such inspections are recommended to identify this in the contract, and to use specific forms to document the results.

Pi√±a was a pioneer in the mixture and fusion of tropical sounds with many of his works having elements of cumbia, regional mexicano, cumbia sonidera, ska, reggae, rap/hip-hop, R&B;, etc. Pi√±a is also known as El Rebelde del acorde√≥n or the Cacique de la Campana.  Early life  Celso Pi√±a Arvizu was born on April 6, 1953, in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico.  Career  Fusion Festival 2012 Germany. Pi√±a started playing music in his hometown with his brothers Eduardo, Rub√©n and Enrique. They formed a band called Celso Pi√±a y su Ronda Bogot√° and together they would go to several homes and perform for local citizens, especially teenage girls from their neighborhood. In 1980, Celso Pi√±a bought his first accordion and was introduced to the world of musica norte√±a. He spent numerous hours of practice and work in the popular district of La Colonia Independencia, south of Monterrey. Having lived for a majority of his life there, he titled one of his songs Mi colonia Independencia, which is located at the heavily populated area of Cerro de la Campana, near of the downtown in Monterrey.

The group decided to switch into the genre of cumbia, and became what today is Celso Pi√±a y su Ronda Bogot√°. Pi√±a taught himself how to play the accordion with no formal training. As a result, he was able to create the unique sound he is well known for. His most popular songs include, La quebradita de la paz, El tren, Como el viento and La piragua by Jos√© Barros. He was featured in the song Sufran con lo que yo gozo along with Mexican singer Gloria Trevi. Celso had several successful international tours that included countries as Germany, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Czech Republic, Italy, France, Switzerland, Morocco, Colombia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Argentina, Chile, Canada and the United States.

History Founded in 1958 as Beijing Institute of Light Industry (BJILI), the university was under direct administration of former State Ministry of Light Industry and had been the first higher educational institute focusing on light industry since the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949. Then in 1970 BJILI was relocated to Xianyang City of Shaanxi Province where it merged with the Preparatory Office of Xianyang College of Light Industry and was granted a new name: Northwest Institute of Light Industry (NWILI). In 1978, NWILI was identified by the State Council as one of the 88 national key universities in China. After twenty years till 1998, NWILI was handed over to local provincial government from the central ministry and was incorporated in the system of \\"co-governance from central and provincial government with local governance as main part\\". Approved by the Ministry of Education in 2002, NWILI was named Shaanxi University of Science & Technology (SUST). After 2004, SUST opened a new campus in Xi'an. Then two years later in 2006, the mainpart of the university moved eastward to Xi'an, the capital city of Shaanxi Province. Education File:library.jpg Science and Technology[1] SUST is well known for its light industry education, which includes four national and provincial key disciplines: paper-making engineering, materials engineering, leather-making engineering, and packaging engineering. For more detailed information, go to the Research page about specific projects and the Academics page, which describes each college.

He was the first head coach of the UCF Knights men's basketball team that represents the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida. Then named Florida Technological University, Clark served as the university's head basketball coach from 1969 to 1983.2010-11 UCF men's basketball media guide During his 14-year tenure at UCF, Clark never had a losing season, and built the Knights into a national power, leading the team to five Sunshine State Conference regular season championships, one conference tournament championship and six NCAA tournament appearances in eight years. In 1978, Clark led the Knights, which at the time were riding a 24‚Äìgame winning streak, to the Final Four. During his tenure, the Knights were ranked in the top 10 nationally for seven consecutive years. Coaching career Clark served as UCF's, at the time FTU's, first head basketball coach.In December 1978, Florida Technological University was renamed the University of Central Florida. In 1969, Clark, who was a Wisconsin high school coach, was responsible for starting the university's basketball program from scratch. In their first year, as a club level team, the Knights went 11‚Äì3, including a 99‚Äì38 victory in their first game over Massey Tech. The first season would serve as an omen for UCF basketball, with Clark bringing the university unprecedented success as a Division II team. As the Knights head coach, Clark earned Sunshine State Coach of the Year honors four times and won the conference's coach of the decade award. While at UCF, Clark coached both of his sons, Bo and Mike. All three men are members of the UCF Athletic Hall of Fame, and Clark is a member of the Sunshine State Conference Hall of Fame. Bo is the Knight's all-time leading scorer with Mike second on the list, and as a freshman in 1976 Bo was the nation's leading scorer. The father-son duo were featured in a 1979 Sports Illustrated issue. Clark coached his last game as a Knight on February 26, 1983, with UCF falling to Florida Southern. During his tenure, Clark's squads went 274‚Äì89, winning 20 or more games in a season seven times. In the decade after Clark retired, the Knights had only one winning season, the year after he left. Before coaching men's college basketball, Clark was the basketball coach at Xavier High School in Appleton, Wisconsin. Among the players he coached there was Bob \\"Rocky\\" Bleier, who later overcame debilitating war wounds suffered in the Viet Nam War to become running back for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and earn four Super Bowl rings -- as they became the first team to do so, in 1975, '76, '79 and '80. Under Clark, the Xavier varsity basketball team had an outstanding run almost every year in the Wisconsin Catholic Interscholastic Athletic Association State Championships. Xavier opened its doors for the first time in the fall of 1959, and as young man Gene \\"Torchy\\" Clark 'moved' from St. Mary's Grade School in Appleton to become the first head coach for the football and basketball teams at the city's first Catholic high school. He also coached the boys tennis teams and was the athletic director at XHS. His legacy at Xavier almost seems made up, as he quickly established a very successful and strong tradition... one that still makes the school widely respected in athletic circles. He coached 10 seasons at Xavier (the 1959 football season was against JV teams as the school opened with only freshmen and sophomores, and, XHS joined a conference in '61). Torchy's teams won almost 90% of the time, and, they earned plenty of 'hardware' to fill the school's trophy cases: XHS won 7 conference championships in 8 years in football, and, they captured 8 conference titles in 8 seasons in basketball. His record for football and basketball at Xavier was 277-35-2 -- a phenomenal 88% over 10 years. His basketball teams went to the State Tournament in Milwaukee 6 times in 9 years, and the Hawks returned to Appleton with a trophy each time: Xavier won the State Title in 1963, was 2nd in '64, was 4th once, and claimed 3 Consolation honors. A then-single- game-record-crowd of 7,095 witnessed the '63 state finals, eager to see Xavier top Marquette High, 71-66, in a raucous, 'mostly-blue' Milwaukee Arena. His basketball teams won 49 straight, but their shot at the '64 state title and 50-in-a-row came up short against Marinette Central & Coach Marty Crowe, 43-37. Torchy's teams also had a 62-game regular season win streak -- before Chicago St. Pat's put an end to that string, 66-54, before an as-always packed-in-crowd in the noisy & hot XHS gym. The post-season Football Playoffs in Wisconsin did not start until 1969 -- after Clark left Xavier for a college coaching position in Florida. The gym at Xavier was dedicated in honor of Torchy Clark on Saturday, Feb. 21, 2004. Many alumni came back for the special night, including Rocky Bleier, who introduced Coach Clark. The MC for the event was Peter Bates, Xavier Class of 1979 and the Voice of the Hawks for XHS athletic events for 30 years. Torchy ‚Äì and his wife, Claire ‚Äì plus the many dedicated coaches and the hard-working, gifted student athletes who first walked the hallways at Xavier were very instrumental in establishing the Hawks‚Äô athletic tradition. His football teams posted a record of 69-9-2 overall, as 3 times XHS was 9-0 and 3 times was 8-1. Xavier shut out its opponents in nearly 50% of their games, as the Hawks averaged 27 points per game and allowed just 6 points a game... over 9 football seasons. The ‚Äô62 and '63 teams were rated # 1 Catholic School in the state by the Associated Press. His basketball teams were 208-26, and, after his first two years never had more than 3 losses in any of 8 straight seasons. XHS was undefeated in 6 seasons at home, and in two other seasons had just one loss at home ‚Äì as his home-court advantage was 95-7 over 10 seasons. The Hawks outscored opponents in those 10 years by an average of 70.7 points to 50.7 points per game. Torchy's record for football and basketball at Xavier was 277-35-2 -- a phenomenal 88% over 10 years. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame for the Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association in 1981, and Torchy was the first Xavier coach to be so honored. http://www.xavierhawkssports.com/torchy- clark.html Torchy died April 22, 2009 http://www.legacy.com/ns/eugene- clark%20-obituary/126508551 after a battle with cancer.

He developed the techniques through his experience as a street fighter during the 1960s in Bandung. Tarung Derajat is officially recognized as a national sport and used as a basic martial art training for the Indonesian Armed Forces and Indonesian National Police. \\"Aku Ramah Bukan Berarti Takut, Aku Tunduk Bukan Berarti Takluk\\", is the motto of the martial art which translates to \\"I am friendly but it does not mean I am afraid, I am reserved but it does not mean I surrender\\" in English. \\"BOX!\\" is the brotherhood greeting among the members of Tarung Derajat. Although Tarung Derajat emphasizes on Striking and kicking, it also focuses on grappling and sweeping which are also included in its training method. As a stand-up martial art, Tarung Derajat was nicknamed as \\"BOXER\\". A practitioner of TD is called Petarung, which translates to \\"fighter\\" in English. The main principles of Tarung Derajat are: Strength, Speed, Accuracy, Courage and Tenacity. Since the 1990s, Tarung Derajat has been refined for sport. In 1998, the Tarung Derajat organization officially became a member of KONI. Since then, Tarung Derajat has a spot in Pekan Olahraga Nasional, a national multi-sport competition held every four years. Tarung Derajat main association KODRAT (Keluarga Olahraga Tarung Derajat) now has sub- organizations in 22 provinces in Indonesia. Tarung Derajat was introduced as an exhibition number in the 2011 Southeast Asian Games in Palembang, Indonesia, Tarung Derajat was proposed to be included on SEA GAMES 2013 in Myanmar, however it was later cancelled. Young Tarung Derajat petarung (fighters). History Tarung Derajat was created by Haji Achmad Dradjat. He grew up in a tough society in Bandung, where the youngsters were used to fighting on the street. This situation insisted Guru Haji Achmad Drajat to be a street-fighter. He didn't start the fight, but the situation required him to fight in order to survive. Then he decided to create his own way of fighting. He realized that there are 4 basic movements in a fight, those are: punching, kicking, blocking/dodging, and grappling. In 1968, when he was 18 years old, his friends and other youngsters came to him and asked him to teach them. Then in 1972, he created a shelter for his students, called AA BOXER. In his opinion, a martial art created in Indonesia must have a name in Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian language), so he changed \\"BOXER\\" to \\"Tarung Derajat\\". The word \\"tarung\\" means fight and the word \\"derajat\\" means pride, dignity, or prestige. So concisely, 'Tarung Derajat' means fighting for pride.

Lyon (4 March 1803, Glasgow ‚Äì 28 November 1889) was a Scottish Latter Day Saint poet and hymn writer. Biography=Early Years John J. Lyon was born to Thomas Lyon and Janet McArthur, a poor and illiterate family in the slums of Glasgow. He was the only child of Thomas and Janet's four children to live to adulthood. Thomas' sister Margaret, who had lost all of her children, adopted five-year-old John in order to alleviate some of her brother's monetary expenses. After less than a year, young Lyon returned to Glasgow after the passing of Margaret's wealthy husband. A year or so later, his father died. At age eight, Lyon began attending school and did so for only a year and a half. That was the extent of his formal childhood schooling. Young Lyon became an apprentice to an accomplished weaver at age nine (1812). That same year the weaving industry struggled immensely, but Lyon kept at his seven-year apprenticeship. By the time he was twelve, the industry had plummeted enough that young Lyon's shop master quit his trade and granted freedom to Lyon and the rest of his apprentices. Lyon then began pursuing a career in spinning, but after three years in his new apprenticeship, his new shop master released all of his apprentices as had occurred previously. Marriage and Family Lyon continued to pursue a career in weaving and set-out (at age seventeen) to live on his own because his mother was remarried and he did not want to be a part of their new life. In 1824 he moved to Kilmarnock where he had great success in the weaving industry. It is there that he met sixteen year old Janet Thomson. They were married in the Presbyterian church on 23 February 1826 and in September their first child, Thomas, was born. The couple had a total of twelve children, seven of which lived to adulthood. Lyon's lack of schooling as a child pushed him to make sure that his children were well-educated. His children were weavers as he was, but they learned to read and write at an early age. Religious Affiliations John Lyon As a child, Lyon was familiarized with the Bible and in turn introduced the Bible to his own children while they were young. He and his wife had no real affiliations with a specific church or congregation during the early years of their marriage. Many religious reforms occurred in Scotland during the 1830s and 1840s. The Church of Scotland, which was Presbyterian, was challenged and many new religious freedoms were granted during this time. In 1837, missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints arrived in England and soon after made their way to Scotland. The missionary William Gibson, went to preach in Kilmarnock where he became good friends with Lyon. After reading The Book of Mormon, attending religious sermons, and pondering what he had learned, Lyon was baptized on 30 May 1844. Janet was baptized five weeks later along with their eldest son Thomas. Some of their other children would also be baptized by Gibson in the following months. On 20 June 1844, Lyon was ordained as an elder in the church and committed himself to the preaching of the gospel. In February of the following year, Gibson was forced to leave Kilmarnock to find work and Lyon was called to fill his place as the presiding elder of the rapidly growing Kilmarnock Branch. After taking-on such a great responsibility, Lyon stopped working for his religious newspapers and traveled and preached using what little money his family made from weaving. By the end of 1848 there were 107 members of the LDS church in Kilmarnock. In 1846, Franklin D. Richards traveled to Scotland to help with church growth in that region. When arriving in Kilmarnock, he met with Lyon who was well known by many American members because of his works published in the Millennial Star. Lyon accompanied Brother Richards to Glasgow to conduct some church business. On arrival they met with Samuel Richards and apostles Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor. Missionary Work In 1849, Lyon received a letter from Orson Pratt, Apostle and president of the British Mission, calling him to serve as a missionary and president of the Worcester Conference in England. Leaving a struggling family in Scotland, Lyon served from January 1849-December 1851. During the first four months of his mission two of his sons died. He baptized roughly 360 people during his time in the Worcester Conference. Before being released from his missionary service he was already extended a call to be the president of the Glasgow conference, beginning on 1 January 1852. He returned home from his mission and promptly moved his family to Glasgow. The Gathering to Zion After years of waiting and preaching about the gathering, on 27 November 1852 Lyon and his family heard the news that they could begin their journey to Zion. They spent months preparing for what would be an 8,000 mile, seven month excursion. The Lyon family was part of the 11,000 European saints that emigrated between 1853-1856. On 19 February 1853 Lyon and family got on the Princess Royal steamship and traveled from Glasgow to Liverpool. They then joined a group of 425 saints on the International and headed toward the United States on a 54 day long voyage. Each night Lyon and other church leaders lead the saints (and anyone else who wanted to participate) in prayer and gospel sermons. Because of these daily sermons and good relations between voyagers, all 48 non-Mormon passengers were baptized, including the captain and crew, making this specific emigration voyage unique. On 23 April 1853 the International docked in New Orleans. On their last day on the International, Lyon was appointed to lead the 237 Ten Pound Saints (referring to the fact that they each paid ten pounds for the journey to Zion). The Ten Pound Saints stayed in New Orleans for four days before boarding the a Mississippi steamer called the Leah Tunah and prepared for the 1,200 mile, eight day trip to St. Louis. The morning after arriving in St. Louis, the saints boarded the Jenny Dean, a small paddle-wheeler, heading to Keokuk, Iowa. They arrived in Iowa on 8 May 1853 and would now be walking the rest of the trip. Because of insufficient funds, the saints stayed in Iowa for one month as some of the men got jobs in order to subsidize money for the necessary travel provisions. On 2 June 1853 Lyon's group of fifty saints and eighteen wagons left Iowa to begin their journey across the plains as part of the Gates Company. They walked an average of twelve miles a day through what was often wet and uncomfortable terrain. After a month, the saints stopped in Council Bluffs for a couple weeks, then crossed the Missouri River and began the last 1,031 miles to arrive in the Great Salt Lake Valley. The Gates Company reached the Great Salt Lake Valley on 30 September 1853. The Lyon family settled near other Scottish emigrants in Salt Lake. In order to support his family, Lyon would work in carpentry and weaving. Life in Zion On 12 January 1854, shortly after settling in Salt Lake, Lyon was sustained as a seventy and then as the president of the 37th Quorum of the Seventies and would serve in that capacity for the next thirty years. Lyon joined the Deseret Dramatic Association, the Universal Scientific Society, the Deseret Press Association, the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing society, and others. Lyon became great friends with a William C. Staines who would eventually marry Lyon's eighteen-year-old daughter as his second wife. This was the first time that the Lyon family would show their acceptance of plural marriage, commonly practiced in the LDS church at that time. Lyon and Staines worked in the Council House together administering temple ordinances until the Endowment House was built. In March 1855, after the Endowment House was completed and dedicated, Lyon was asked to be its superintendent and worked in that capacity for thirty years. During the 1855 October General Conference of the church, Brigham Young called Lyon, along with twenty-nine other men, as \\"home missionaries\\" to strengthen the members in Zion and hold conferences in the area. In 1856 Lyon had a dream that he entered into plural marriage and did so in March of that same year. At age fifty-three, Lyon was sealed to sixteen-year-old Caroline Holland who in the following years would bear seven children. In August 1857 the saints in Salt Lake found-out that an army was coming to stop a rumored rebellion in Utah. This caused 30,000 saints, including Lyon's family, to move south along with important church documents and other valuables. He, along with 300 other brethren, would stay in Salt Lake until Brigham Young gave the order to return on 28 June 1858. When famous visitors such as Mark Twain and Horace Greeley came to the region, Lyon was able to meet these men and show them his impressive book collection and other gems unique to the Salt Lake area. At the end of 1859 the last of Janet and John's children made it to the Salt Lake Valley after years of postponed travel west. Even with all of his responsibilities in the church, Lyon found time to teach aspiring young actors important elements for acting and was the critic at the Salt Lake Theatre. He taught drama to Maude Adams who would become a famous actress. From 1867-1869, after some conflicting ideas between Lyon and other church leaders regarding free trade and other economic practices, Lyon and his family invested much time and effort into being baptized for their ancestors who had died without becoming members of the LDS church. Lyon was sealed by proxy to four deceased women in 1871 and six more deceased women in 1874. On 7 May 1872, Wilford Woodruff ordained Lyon to be a patriarch in the LDS Church with the approval of Brigham Young, Daniel H. Wells, John Taylor, George Q. Cannon, Brigham Young Jr., and Joseph F. Smith. When he reached the age of seventy, many saints gave him the title of \\"Father Lyon\\" as a sign of respect and friendly intimacy. In 1885, Lyon resigned his service at the Endowment House. On 28 November 1889 at age eighty-six, \\"Father\\" John Lyon died due to old age and was outlived by both of his wives. Writing career In 1827, Lyon joined an intellectual fraternity where each member would compose a topic to be discussed. At this point in time, Lyon knew very little about reading and writing. Even with such disadvantages, the other members were so intrigued by Lyon's contributions that he was inspired to better his literary skills. After years of study, practice, and drafts, he eventually began publishing his written works in local newspapers and would continue to do so for the next eighteen years. As was customary during this time period, many of Lyon's first works were written and published anonymously in order to protect the author from any form of harassment or blame. During his writing career in Scotland he wrote for eight known newspapers including The Ayr Advertiser, The Kilmarnock Chronicle, and The Witness. He mainly wrote for newspapers in Ayrshire, but in 1834 the first newspapers in Kilmarnock were organized. Because of differences in opinion, Lyon left the papers in Kilmarnock and began writing for more religiously-minded papers. Poetry Before his conversion to the LDS Church, Lyon normally wrote poetry relating to Romanticism, which was popular at the time. Once Lyon was converted, his poems began portraying more optimism and light. The LDS Church newspaper The Millennial Star published copious amounts of work by what they described as \\"The Scottish Bard\\". He debuted in Millennial Star on 15 November 1845, when it published his poem \\"Man\\". The Star would publish over forty more of his poems. Lyon wrote at least seventy poems during his mission in Worcester, eighteen of which were published in the Star. He began expanding his poetic horizons, authoring many sonnets, songs, and hymns during that same time. Most of his writings referred to essential LDS doctrine, such as the Gathering to Zion. Writing in January 1849, Orson Spencer said to Orson Pratt that: > Amongst the worth of contributors to the Star, I shall not be deemed > invidious to name, distinctly and prominently, our highly esteemed brethren > Elders Lyon and Mills. Their genius in the poetic department and the > devotedness of their productions to the service of God and his people > deserve the fostering care of all the Saints who love the high praise of God > in sacred and commemorative songs. The excellent songs and hymns of our > poets preach with unmistakable melody and power. Of Lyon's many poems, 104 of them were collected in his book, The Harp of Zion, which was one of the first complete books of poetry by a Mormon writer, published in 1853. Within a year, 979 copies of The Harp of Zion were sold. All of the proceeds were donated to the church's Perpetual Emigration Fund, allowing European saints to make the journey to Zion. These poems varied from devotional poems, to epics such as \\"The Apostate\\", songs, and hymns. Before being published in The Harp of Zion, ten of Lyon's hymns were already published in the 1851 LDS hymnal (ninth edition). By 1948 only two of his hymns remained in the hymnals and he currently has no authored works in the LDS hymnal. Writing in Zion Because he was so well known among the saints due to his publications in the Millennial Star and his book of poetry, The Harp of Zion, Lyon had access to many of the different LDS publications. Some of these include Deseret News, the Mountaineer, the Mormon, the Contributor, Tullidge's Quarterly Magazine, and others. \\"Reflections\\", Lyon's first published work after arriving in Salt Lake, recounted some of the hardships faced on the journey across the plains. His first publication that spoke specifically about life in Utah tells a story of a polygamist husband in Arabia as not to offend the LDS community while being humorous regarding a topic which members considered to be a sacred practice. Lyon had a strong friendship with Brigham Young and was with him often. At the time of Young's death, Lyon composed a poem in admiration of his friend entitled Brigham, the Bold. After Lyon's death in 1889 his son began a printing business and began collecting his father's works which were scattered in different journals and other mediums across Utah.In 1923, seventy-one poems and fourteen stories were compiled and published in one volume called Songs of a Pioneer. All of these works were written between 1854 and 1885. See also * List of Latter Day Saint practitioners of plural marriage References * * Lyon, T.

Life During the 1670s, in the western islands of Scotland, Janet began publicly \\"demonstrating\\" said sight by seeking out \\"images\\", objects allegedly made by witches. The phenomenon of second sight was often considered witchcraft itself. By the time she moved to Glasgow, traveling alone at the age of eleven, she was mobbed by people wanting to discover if witchcraft was the cause of their ill luck, given word already reached the city before her arrival. After she had told several members of the crowd where they could the images, the crowd stirred itself into such a frenzy that the magistrates quickly put her under protective custody. Soon the Privy Council of Scotland summoned her. Her arrival in Edinburgh in 1678 was as chaotic as her entrance into Glasgow ‚Äî if not more so. She directly accused several members of the crowd of practicing witchcraft. Judicial officials and other notables unsuccessfully interrogated her as to her background, parentage, and how she performed. After Edinburgh, Janet's race disappeared. She was eventually released, and rumour holds that she fled to the West Indies.  Witchcraft and Second Sight  The case of Janet Douglas combines the two phenomenon of witchcraft and second sight.Hunter p.3 Janet claimed to use her skill of second sight in order to find out cases of witchcraft. The form that her 'second sight' typically took was to identify that a person's suffering was the result of an 'image' created by a witch. For example, George Hickes in his letter to Samuel Pepys in 1700 claims that Janet told a Goldsmith in Glasgow that his trade was not thriving because a witch had made an image against him.Hunter, p.175 In the later seventeenth century the relationship between second sight and witchcraft was disputed by different writers. In his letter to Pepys, Hickes clearly suggests that witchcraft was related to second sight, whereas Robert Kirk in his classic text 'The Secret Commonwealth' argues that Second Sight was an entirely innocent skill.

The series focuses on a trio made up of the alien princess Ilana, the strict, but rebellious soldier Lance, and the robot Octus; the three are able to combine to create the titular Sym-Bionic Titan. A preview of the series was first shown at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, and further details were revealed at Cartoon Network's 2010 upfront. The series premiered on September 17, 2010, and ended on April 9, 2011. Cartoon Network initially ordered 20 episodes; Tartakovsky had hoped to expand on that, but the series was not renewed for another season, as the show \\"did not have any toys connected to it\\". While Sym-Bionic Titan has never been released to DVD in The United States, all 20 episodes were available for purchase on iTunes and the Windows Store. On October 7, 2012, reruns of the series began airing on Adult Swim's Toonami block along with the 2011 television series of ThunderCats. On September 22, 2014, Cartoon Network wrote-off Sym-Bionic Titan for financial reasons. The series was later re-released on Netflix in 2019.https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=81235603&jbp;=0&jbr;=1 Overview Billed as \\"an exciting hybrid of high school drama and giant robot battles\\", Sym-Bionic Titan features \\"the adventures of three beings from the planet Galaluna who crash-land on Earth while attempting to escape their war-torn world\\". The series follows the lives of Lance (voiced by Kevin Thoms), Ilana (Tara Strong) and Octus (Brian Posehn), two alien teens and a robot in the form of humanoids who arrive on Earth, an \\"identical\\" planet to Galaluna, while fleeing an evil general who has taken over their home planet with the help of monstrous creatures called Mutraddi. The three main characters include Ilana, princess of the royal family; Lance, a dark-hearted but capable soldier; and Octus, a bio-cybernetic robot, all of whom must now blend into everyday life in Sherman, Illinois. Posing as high school students, Lance and Octus work to conceal Princess Ilana from General Modula (Don Leslie) and his hideous space mutants sent to kill the sole heir of Galaluna. When called into battle, the Galalunans are outfitted with individual armor that provides more than ample protection. It is when the gravest of danger appears that Octus activates the sym-bionic defense program and he, Ilana, and Lance unite \\"Heart, Body and Mind\\" and come together to form the spectacular cyber-giant Sym-Bionic Titan. Production Series co-creator Genndy Tartakovsky, known for creating Dexter's Laboratory and Samurai Jack, drew inspiration from many sources. He grew up with mecha anime series from the 1970s and 1980s like Speed Racer, Macross and Voltron and states: \\"For whatever reason, I have always loved the idea of kids driving giant robots.\\" His biggest influence were John Hughes movies such as Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, as well as 1980s pop culture, but the relationship between the two teenage leads was also inspired by Pazu & Sheeta, the two leads in Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky. An episode of Samurai Jack with a similar plot, \\"Jack and the Flying Prince and Princess\\" (which had two aliens and a robot fleeing to seek help for their planet), may have also provided inspiration. Tara Strong voiced the princess in said episode as well. Tartakovsky came up with Octus and the high-school setting first and then later, together with co-creators Paul Rudish and Bryan Andrews, added Ilana and Lance as protagonists. The creators of the show took a long time to develop the female lead, Princess Ilana. \\"A positive strong female character is something I've always wanted to create\\", Tartakovsky said. Tartakovsky called Sym-Bionic Titan \\"the most challenging project I have ever done.\\" Despite airing on Cartoon Network, Tartakovsky said that he \\"doesn't consider Sym-Bionic Titan a kids show\\".\\"Wiredinterveiw\\" EpisodesCancellation On March 29, 2011, it was reported that Sym- Bionic Titan has been canceled due to being unable to acquire a toy license. On September 22, 2014, it was revealed on Adult Swim's Tumblr that both Beware the Batman and Sym-Bionic Titan were written off by the network. In a 2018 interview with Syfy, Tartakovsky revealed that he and his crew had written 10 more episodes before the show was cancelled. Award nominations Sym-Bionic Titan received two nominations at the 38th Annie Awards in 2011: Stephen DeStefano for Best Character Design in a Television Production, and Scott Wills for Best Production Design in an Animated Television Production.

The garden was designed under Jarvis's ownership by Gertrude Jekyll in 1922, and extended by Percy Cane in 1928.  Career  During World War I, Jarvis was an advisor to government on labour relations, and after the war the government continued to seek his advice on financial matters. In recognition of these services, he was created a Baronet in 1922, of Hascombe Court in the County of Surrey, in 1922.  Jarrow  In early 1934 he was elected as High Sheriff of Surrey, and shortly afterwards visited Jarrow, a shipbuilding town on Tyneside which had been particularly badly hit by the Great Depression. The Depression caused a collapse in demand for ships, and the closure of Palmers shipyard in Jarrow, leading to 80% unemployment in the town. Jarvis launched an appeal named the \\"Surrey Fund\\" which eventually raised ¬£40,000; the funds were used to buy materials to enable men in Jarrow to continue working, on tasks such as the constructing playgrounds and sports facilities and the redecoration of houses. Using his own wealth, Jarvis also bought the decommissioned liner RMS Olympic (a sistership of the Titanic) for a reported ¬£100,000 and had the ship brought to Tyneside to be broken up, followed in 1938 by the liner Berengaria. The breaking of Berengaria was promised to directly employ 200 men in skilled and semi-skilled tasks in the new Jarrow Shipbreaking Company (based on the former Palmers shipyard), while the metal was to be used in Jarvis's new metal industries in the area, which employed several hundred people. Through Jarvis's efforts, several other new businesses were established in the Jarrow area. Jarvis also bought unemployed miners from Jarrow to Hascombe Court, his country estate in Surrey, where they built a Japanese style water and rock garden. Set against the scale of the economic problems in Jarrow, the impact of Jarvis's efforts is contested. In a letter published in The Times on 2 October 1936, Jarvis listed some of the achievements of the fund as a \\"step in the right direction\\". However, on the following day Jarrow MP Ellen Wilkinson praised Jarvis's support for the town but criticised \\"his over-sanguine optimism\\", noting that the employment generated had been small-scale and temporary. Wilkinson complained that charitable works were inadequate, and that a solution to the problem required addressing the underlying cause, which was the forced closure of the shipyard. For his efforts, Jarvis was made a freeman of Jarrow in 1935, but the ceremony on 4 June was boycotted by Labour Party councillors because Jarvis had been selected as a Conservative candidate for the coming general election.  Parliament  Guildford's Conservative MP Charles Rhys announced in January 1934 that he would not contest the next election. At a meeting of the Central Council of the Guildford Division Conservative and Unionist Association on 25 February, Jarvis was invited to be the National Conservative candidate at the next election, and it was reported on 9 March that he had accepted. However, the parties in the National Government had agreed not to oppose each other at elections, so a question arose as to whether the National Government-supporting candidate for the forthcoming vacancy in Guildford should be a Conservative or a Liberal. S. Stopford Brooke, who had contested Guildford for the Liberal Party at the 1929 general election, had stood aside in favour of the Conservatives at the by- election in August 1931 and at the general election later that year. Brooke announced in February that he had resigned from the Liberal Party, and intended this time to stand as National candidate \\"without prefix or suffix\\". He was supported by local representatives the Liberal, Conservative and National Labour parties. However, in August 1935, Brooke's candidacy was halted by the local National association, which announced that since the collaboration of parties in the constituencies had not developed across the country at large, \\"no useful purpose would be served by running a purely National candidate in this division in support of this principle\\". At the general election in November 1935, Brooke signed Jarvis's nomination papers. The only other candidate was Andrew Campbell of the Labour Party, who was a stranger to the constituency and had a weak local organisation. Jarvis was elected with nearly 75% of the votes, and was made a Deputy Lieutenant of Surrey in 1936. He was re-elected in 1945, and held the seat until he stood down from the House of Commons at the 1950 general election. In November 1943 he wrote to The Times newspaper to summarise his experiences in Jarrow, asserting that it was better to bring work to people in depressed areas than to encourage them to move in search of work. Jarvis died on 2 October 1950, aged 74.

Benjamin Smith was one of five sons and five daughters of William Smith, the famous MP and abolitionist.Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900 Of his sisters, Frances (Fanny) Smith, married into the Nightingale family and produced a daughter, Florence Nightingale, the nurse and statistician; another married into the Bonham Carter family. William Smith wanted his son Benjamin to marry Mary Shore, the sister of William Nightingale, now a relative by marriage (she later married Benjamin's brother Samuel). His home was in Marylebone, London, but in 1816 he inherited and purchased property near Hastings: Brown's Farm near Robertsbridge, with a house built around 1700 (extant), and Crowham Manor, Westfield, which included . Although a member of the landed gentry, Smith held radical views. He was a Dissenter, a Unitarian, a supporter of free trade, and a benefactor to the poor. In 1826, he bore the cost of building a school for the inner-city poor at Vincent Square, Westminster, and paid a penny a week towards the fees for each child, the same amount as paid by their parents. On a visit to a sister in Derbyshire in 1826, Benjamin met Anne Longden. She became pregnant by him and he took her to a rented lodge at Whatlington, a small village near Battle, East Sussex. There she lived as \\"Mrs Leigh\\", the surname of his relations on the nearby Isle of Wight. The birth of their first child, Barbara (the future founder of Girton College as Barbara Bodichon), created a scandal because the couple did not marry; illegitimacy carried a heavy social stigma at the time. He rode from Brown's Farm to visit them daily, and within eight weeks Anne was pregnant again. When their son Benjamin was born, the four of them went to America for two years, during which time another child was conceived. After their return to Sussex, they lived openly together at Brown's Farm and had two more children. After their last child was born in 1833, Anne became ill with tuberculosis and Smith leased 9 Pelham Crescent, which faced the sea at Hastings; the healthy properties of sea air were highly regarded at the time. A local woman, Hannah Walker, was employed to look after the children. Anne did not recover, so Smith took her to Ryde, Isle of Wight, where she died in 1834.

Inspired by the Loughton incinerator thefts, the film stars Caroline Quentin as Bridget Watmore, a cleaner at the Bank of England who hatches a plot \\"for impoverished workers to pinch cash\\" before it is incinerated. The film was commissioned by ITV in January 2001, as one of two new projects to star Quentin, with the other, Blood Strangers, following in 2002. Nick Elliott, then controller of drama at ITV, described Quentin as being \\"...very good at playing very ordinary women.\\" Filming began in February 2001. The film received a 44% audience share between 9pm and 11pm, where it was screened against a Panorama investigative special programme on BBC One. Consolidated figures revealed the film drew 9.62 million viewers on its debut broadcast.http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/weekly-top-30/ Reception by newspaper critics ranged from \\"inadequate script\\" (Daily Mail; Daily Telegraph) to \\"thrilling comedy caper\\" (Mirror). In 2008, the film was remade in the United States under the title Mad Money, starring Diane Keaton as Bridget, Katie Holmes as Jackie, Queen Latifah as Nina, and Ted Danson as Don. Lindsay Lohan was initially cast to play Jackie, but was replaced due to a lack of completion bond.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0951216/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv Plot Hot Money tells the story of three workers at the Bank of England incinerating plant in Essex. The trio, led by Bridget (Caroline Quentin), hatch a plan to steal thousands of pounds by stashing the notes in their underwear. Method Each of the cages containing money set to be incinerated is locked with two padlocks; one black and one white. The key to the white padlock is held by supervisor Liz Hoodless (Melanie Hill), while the only person who holds a black key is boss Mr. Glover (Shaun Curry). Together, they open a cage, the money is counted, placed back in the cage, padlocked again with two new locks by Jackie Haggar (Georgia Mackenzie), and sent to the vault, before it is incinerated. Cleaner Bridget (Caroline Quentin) enlists the help of her colleagues Liz and Jackie to steal the money using the following method: ‚Ä¢ While cleaning, Bridget discreetly takes two of the padlocks used to lock the cages of money to be incinerated, a black one and a white one. ‚Ä¢ In the bathroom, Bridget spray paints the white padlock black, masking the scent with strong smelling toilet cleaner. She hides the painted padlock in a toilet cistern. ‚Ä¢ Jackie, whose job it is to re-padlock the cages after they have been counted, retrieves the painted padlock from the toilet cistern and palms it to the counting room. ‚Ä¢ In the counting room, Jackie collects a new white padlock, and pairs it together with the painted black padlock. She locks the cage closed. ‚Ä¢ Passing Bridget, who is cleaning in the corridor, she whispers the number of the cage with the painted padlock on it. ‚Ä¢ Liz, a supervisor who is a holder of the white key, throws away a cigarette packet containing the white key in to Bridget's bin as they pass in the corridor. ‚Ä¢ Bridget heads to the vault, where she quickly locates the correct cage, unlocks the white padlock and the painted black padlock with the same white key, empties the money in to her bin, and locks it back up again with the original white padlock, and a genuine black padlock she stole earlier. ‚Ä¢ Back in the bathroom, she meets Liz and Jackie, where they all fill their underwear with the stolen cash. Bridget returns the white key to Liz and washes the black paint off the white padlock with white spirit. ‚Ä¢ Bridget returns the painted padlock, now back to being white, in to its case. ‚Ä¢ The trio leave work with their contraband.

The decentralization of managing tactics enables local people to deal with the unique social, political and ecological problems their community might face and find solutions ideal to their situation. Overwhelming national or local economic, political and social pressures can affect the efficiency of CBM as well as its long term application. CBM varies across spatial and temporal scales to reflect the ever-changing distinctive physical and/or human environment it is acting within. While the specifics of each practice might differ, existing research maintains that community based management, when implemented properly, is incredibly beneficial not only for the health of the environment, but also for the well-being of the stakeholders.  Cultural change and sustainability  Social ideologies and cultural divides between regions and often within regions challenge the implications of CBM. The process of identifying stakeholders and maintaining policies needs to fluctuate culturally to imply the sustainability of CBM. Scrutiny of inequality issues and the level of self-management a community will take on needs to be evaluated for each CBM implementation. Therefore, cultural beliefs can be communicated politically whether the community agrees with CBM or not.  Natural resources  The community-based management concept is often integrated in the conservation and development projects of natural resources. Referred to as community-based natural resources management (CBNRM), these projects aim to develop a partnership between wildlife and communities while generating a revenue to benefit the community as well as its resources management.

Drita was one of the first magazines in the Albanian language. It has been published for 127 years with some interruptions. History: 1883-1922 Drita was one of the first magazines published in Albanian. It was initially printed in Istanbul, Turkey (then Ottoman Empire) in 1883 for the first time. The Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights, the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings and their president, Sami Frash√´ri, were the main contributors of the magazine, however their identity was secret at that time. The magazine's publisher was Petro Poga. Drita changed its name to Dituria (meaning in English \\"Knowledge\\") after the third issueSAMI FRASH√ãRIOR ≈†EMSEDDIN SAMI ?MYTHOLOGIZATION OF AN OTTOMANINTELLECTUAL IN THE MODERN TURKISH ANDSOCIALIST ALBANIAN HISTORIOGRAPHIES BASEDON ¬´ SELECTIVE PERCEPTION ¬ªB√ºlent Bilmez* p. 18 and moved the magazine's base to Bucharest. The magazine was placed under the direction of Pandeli Sotiri. The publication was known to be against the wishes of the authorities and one of the writers, Naim Frash√´ri signed his name as just \\"D\\" to try to avoid being identified. The committee that supported the magazine also published books of the bible in Albanian. They managed to publish both the Gospel of Matthew and the book of Genesis in Albanian Tosk, and the Gospel of Matthew in Macedo-Roman (now called Aromanian). This magazine was not just the first scholarly magazine in Albanian, it was part of the first modern use of written Albanian. The magazine was only possible because of the work of Koto Hoxhi, Sami Frash√´ri, Pashko Vasa and Jani Vreto who had devised an alphabet for expressing the Albanian language in 1879. Based on this it was possible to create the first alphabet book in Albanian, translate the Bible and publish Drita. To avoid censureship, the magazine focused mainly on cultural issues. Publications continued through 1885 until the Ottoman Government halted its publication completely. At the same time the Ottoman government halted the existence of the Society for the Printing of the Albanian writings, that had been established in Istambul by Sami Frash√´ri.George Walter Gawrych The crescent and the eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874-1913 p. 88. Publications restarted later in the 19th century first in Bucharest, Romania, and later in Sofia, Bulgaria, by Shahin Kolonja and the magazine retook its original name, Drita. Several articles published by Petro Nini Luarasi, who was editor-in-chief at that time, appeared on the magazine in the 1906-1908 period. History: 1922-1945 In 1922 the magazine restarted its publications again under Petro Poga. This time it was published in Gjirokaster, and now in an independent Albania.Drita, Issue of 12 october 2008 first page Urani Rumbo published several articles in Drita, which discussed the need to improve the rights and education of girls and women in Albania. In 1920 Urani Rumbo and others had published a declaration which signified the birth of the Women's Union in Albania (, the first prominent feminist organization in Albania. The magazine closed again in 1924 due to clashes with the Fan Noli government. and reopened later and published by Zoi Xoxa. During the Fascist Italy presence in Albania in 1939-43 and the Nazi Germany presence in Albania in 1943-44 the magazine had to close for the third time. History: 1945-present The magazine reopened in 1945 right after World War II and became the official magazine of the Albanian League of Writers and Artists. Editor in chief of the magazine for some time was Teodor Keko, a well known Albanian writer. The disbandment of the League in 2007, had the Association of the Young Modern Artists of Albania take over the magazine, which is still currently published. In 1995 the magazine had 4,000 readers in the country.

The text is written in one column per page, 21-22 lines per page, in very small letters. The text is divided according to the (chapters), which numbers are given at the margin, with their (titles) at the top. The text of the four Gospels is also divided according to the Ammonian Sections (in Mark 234 Sections ‚Äì the last Section in 16:9), with references to the Eusebian Canons (written below Ammonian Section numbers). It contains the Epistula ad Carpianum, lists of the (tables of contents) before each book. It contains liturgical books with hagiographies (Synaxarion and Menologion) at the end of the codex, and pictures of the Evangelists are placed before each Gospel.  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden classified it as Kx. Kurt Aland placed it in Category V. According to the Wisse's Profile Method it belongs to mixed Byzantine text in Luke 1 (fragmentary), to the Œ†a in Luke 10 (weak), and to the Kx in Luke 20.  History  C. R. Gregory dated it to the 11th century. Currently the manuscript is dated by the INTF to the 11th or 12th century. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by F. H. A. Scrivener. Gregory saw it in 1887. Currently the manuscript is housed at the Berlin State Library (Graec. octavo 12), in Berlin.

The parent isotope 68Ge has a half-life of 271 days and can be easily utilized for in-hospital production of generator produced 68Ga. Its decay product gallium-68 (with a half-life of only 68 minutes, inconvenient for transport) is extracted and used for certain positron emission tomography nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures, where the radioisotope's relatively short half-life and emission of positrons for creation of 3-dimensional PET scans, are useful. Parent isotope (68Ge) source  The parent isotope germanium-68 is the longest-lived (271 days) of the radioisotopes of germanium. It has been produced by several methods.Note on Ge-68 production methods in 1996. Accessed March 15, 2010 In the U.S., it is primarily produced in proton accelerators: At Los Alamos National Laboratory, it may be separated out as a product of proton capture, after proton irradiation of Nb-encapsulated gallium metal. At Brookhaven National Laboratories, 40 MeV proton irradiation of a gallium metal target produces germanium-68 by proton capture and double neutron knockout, from gallium-69 (the most common of two stable isotopes of gallium). This reaction is: 69Ga(p,2n)68Ge. A Russian source produces germanium-68 from accelerator-produced helium ion (alpha) irradiation of zinc-66, again after knockout of two neutrons, in the nuclear reaction 66Zn(Œ±,2n)68Ge.  Mechanism of generator function  When loaded with the parent isotope germanium-68, these generators function similarly to technetium-99m generators, in both cases using a process similar to ion chromatography. The stationary phase is either metal-free or alumina, TiO2 or SnO2, onto which germanium-68 is adsorbed. The use of metal-free columns allows direct labeling of 68Ga without prepurification, hence making production of gallium-68-radiolabeled compounds more convenient. The mobile phase is a solvent able to elute (wash out) gallium-68 (III) (68Ga3+) after it has been produced by electron capture decay from the immobilized (absorbed) germanium-68. Currently, such 68Ga (III) is easily eluted with a few mL of 0.05 M, 0.1 M or 1.0 M hydrochloric acid from generators using metal-free tin dioxide or titanium dioxide adsorbents, respectively, within 1 to 2 minutes. With generators of tin dioxide and titanium dioxide-based adsorbents, there remains more than an hour of pharmaceutical preparation to attach the gallium-68 (III) as a tracer to the pharmaceutical molecules DOTATOC or DOTA-TATE, so that the total preparation time for the resulting radiopharmaceutical is typically longer than the 68Ga isotope half-life. This fact requires that these radiopharmaceuticals be made on-site in most cases, and the on-site generator is required to minimize the time losses. Indications for gallium-68 PET scanning Gallium-67 citrate salt imaging is useful for imaging old or sterile abscesses. Gallium-68 is useful in direct tumor imaging, especially leukocyte-derived malignancies and prostate cancer metastases.

He rode a wave of enthusiasm for gourmet luxury foods using fresh, high-quality local ingredients in Hawaii. Lappert's Aloha Ice Cream grew to have annual revenues exceeding $15 million in six U.S. states and produced 18,000 gallons of unique flavors of ice cream each month. Using Belgian chocolate, vanilla beans from Madagascar, local macadamia nuts, guava, and coffee beans from Kona, Lappert created a menu of 125 flavors. Location of first Lappert's, Hanapepe, Kauai Life Before Ice Cream Lappert was born in Austria to a French father and an Austrian mother. He grew up in Prague, with Austrian grandparents who owned a shop \\"where they made apple strudels and sold coffee, and in summertime, when the fruit was ripe, they made peach or strawberry ice cream.\\" Later this shop would become the model for his retail outlets. Lappert joined the French Army at 17, earning the rank of lieutenant, and was wounded in combat during World War II. He was fluent in eight languages. After the war, Lappert spent many years in South America where he was a distiller in Ecuador and became the purveyor of liquor to the Venezuelan military. Moving to the United States, he had a crepe shop in San Francisco and seafood restaurant in Sausalito, California. A Brief Retirement At age 61, Walter Lappert retired to the Hawaiian island of Kauai, turning over his restaurant business to his son, Michael. Retirement, however, soon evolved into a new business venture when he found local dessert fare wanting. He and his wife invested half their savings, $150,000, to set up a factory to make ice cream in the town of Hanapepe, far from the tourist and commercial areas of Kauai. His first batch of 4,500 gallons (about 17,000 liters) was created on December 21, 1983 and sold out in two weeks, which convinced them they were going to be successful. (The 1980 population of Kauai was under 40,000 people.) A store in Koloa, a historic town near the popular sunny beaches of Poipu, and near Lappert's one-bedroom apartment, followed. Lappert adopted the Koloa store as an unofficial headquarters and was often found there, dressed in quintessential Hawaiian fashion of shorts, sandals, and flowered shirt, wearing a small cap and a white beard and accompanied by his black Labrador Maxi, chatting with tourists and locals after a dip in the surf. He made his personality part of his brand, integrating his smiling face into his labels and ads and encouraged the sobriquet, \\"the Hanapepe Ice Cream Man,\\" although to some, he was the Colonel Sanders of Hawaii while others considered the popular figure a Hemingway look-alike. By the late 1980s, Lappert's ice cream sold through some 75 stores across Hawaii and six states in the western part of the USA plus a franchise in Japan. The business branched out to roast its own coffee in 1985 and also began producing baked goods in some locations. Succession Walter Lappert died in 2003. His former wife Mary Pratt (who had remained his business partner after their divorce in 1991) and Michael (one of his sons) each inherited half of the company. Two companies now exist: Lappert's Hawaii, led by Mary Pratt and headquartered in Hanapepe, Kauai, Hawaii; Lappert's Ice Cream, led by Michael Lappert and headquartered in Richmond, California. Lappert's Ice Cream on the US mainland still uses the original logo that features Walter Lappert's distinctive silhouette in their branding.

He has been called \\"Japan's Bob Dylan.\\" His childhood home was his father's church (established by William Merrell Vories, the founder of OMI Medical Supplies Corp). His current residence is Kameoka, Kyoto. Originally a Christian, he began to doubt his family's work with juvenile delinquents and searched for an escape. He threw himself into socialism, and after meeting folk singer Takashi Tomoya, he started to play guitar. Career After receiving his education at Oumikyoudai Middle School and Shiga Prefecture Ritsuyoukai City Senior High School, in 1966 Okabayashi entered the theology department of Doushisha College. In 1968, he participated in the third \\"Folk Camp\\" in Tokyo. In September with Victor Records, he released \\"Sanya Blues\\", a song about living in Sanya with day laborers. In the following year he released singles such as \\"Friend,\\" ‚ÄúThe Letter,\\" ‚ÄúThe Tulip‚Äôs Applique\\" ‚ÄúThe Fuck-Off Song,\\"Kusokurae, Single, Okabayashi Nobuyasu and \\"The Skeleton Song.\\" Because of the material in his songs, many of them were banned from broadcasting. For conquering a generation, he was called a \\"god of Folk\\", but due to the Workers Music Council's strife, the pressure he felt from his surroundings to maintain his image, and the intentions of his own camp (He was already beginning to feel he had reached a dead end with his direct protest songs, and he was exploring with transitioning to rock as a solution), in May of the following year he temporarily disappeared from the public eye. In 1970, an unsigned band newly renamed Happy End started to play as Okabayashi's backing band and together they recorded his second album . However, 1971 was the last year of his headlining open-air concert in Hibya called the \\"Off-season Flowering Live Performance\\" as well as the last year of \\"Folk Jamboree\\" in which he participated. Thus, once again, Okabayashi disappeared from the stage. In 1973, Okabayashi started his career back up and changed labels to Sony. He released rock albums such as \\"Golden Lion\\" and \\"Who Gives This Child Love.\\" Songs containing Dylan-esque metaphors such as \\"Until That Daughter is Far Away\\" and \\"The 26 Numbers of Fall\\" were one part of his albums that were well received, but as usual, his fan's expectations were high. During the time these records were released, Okabayashi was removed several times from the list of guest performers at concerts, and eventually, Okabashi faced this consciousness by silencing himself by living in an agricultural community near Kyoto. During this time he performed Enka. He collaborated with Misora Hibari on \\"The Moon of the Night Train.\\" In 1975, Okabayashi changed labels to Columbia Music Entertainment, and following his \\"enka-stage,: released ‚ÄúA Copied Picture.\\" and performed a one-man concert. With Columbia he released two more albums, a self-titled compilation of his best hits and a self- narrated album called \\"Love Songs.‚Äù In 1978 Okabayashi began working on his \\"Serenade\\" album he developed a strongly parody-flavored sound, which he dubbed his \\"new music-stage.\\" Once again he was signed by his former label, Victor, and he strengthened his \\"new music-stage\\" with the songs \\"The Street is a Nice Carnival,\\" ‚ÄúStorm,\\" and \\"Graffiti.\\" The songs that came to represent this period for Okabayashi were \\"Good-bye My Darling,\\" ‚ÄúA Love Song to Lift You Up,\\" and \\"Face the Mountain.\\" In 1980, he sang, \\"The Prayer of G,\\" which was used as the ending theme song for the television drama \\"Hattorihanzou, The Shadow of the Army Corps\\" or \\"Shadow Warriors\\" which starred Sonny Chiba. In the middle of the 1980s, having been dropped from the major record labels, he started the \\"Bare Knuckle Review\\" tour where he traveled all around Japan, in accompaniment with a guitar and a harmonica, singing in his former folk style. From this period on, he started singing songs that he was known for in his earlier days. Furthermore, during the same time he took on a Japanese folksong inspired rhythm, and created a unique rock genre he called \\"enyatto.\\" When searching for a new sound for this genre, he was enlightened when he first heard Korean procession instrument played in group called Samul Nori. In 1987 he released and independent tape called \\"Dancing to Enyatto.\\" After that he released an album with Toshiba and performed a country-wide tour. Because he heard that the \\"Old fans weren‚Äôt that happy,\\" even though he was still in his \\"enyatto- stage,\\" on October 20, 2007, he performed at the first \\"Off-Season Flowering Live Concert\\" in 36 years.

The Ostrogothic Papacy was a period from 493 to 537 where the papacy was strongly influenced by the Ostrogothic Kingdom, if the pope was not outright appointed by the Ostrogothic King. The selection and administration of popes during this period was strongly influenced by Theodoric the Great and his successors Athalaric and Theodahad. This period terminated with Justinian I's (re)conquest of Rome during the Gothic War (535‚Äì554), inaugurating the Byzantine Papacy (537-752). According to Howorth, \\"while they were not much interfered with in their administrative work, so long as they did not themselves interfere with politics, the Gothic kings meddled considerably in the selection of the new popes and largely dominated their election. Simony prevailed to a scandalous extent, as did intrigues of a discreditable kind, and the quality and endowments of the candidates became of secondary importance in their chances of being elected, compared with their skill in corrupting the officials of the foreign kings and in their powers of chicane.\\"Howroth, 1913, p. 406. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"[Theodoric] was tolerant towards the Catholic Church and did not interfere in dogmatic matters.

The papal election of March 483 was the first to take place without the existence of a Western Roman emperor. While Simplicius still lived, the praetorian prefect, Caecina Decius Maximus Basilius, called together the Roman Senate, Roman clergy, and the leading local bishops in the Imperial Mausoleum. Simplicius had issued an admonitio declaring that no election of his successor should be valid without the consent of Basilius. Basilius was both the leader of the Roman aristocracy and the Chief Minister of Odoacer the \\"king of Italy\\".Richards, 1979, p. 58. Simplicius was succeeded by Pope Felix III (483-492), Pope Gelasius I (492-496), and Pope Anastasius II (496-498). The first schism The role of the Ostrogoths became clear in the first schism. On November 22, 498, both Pope Symmachus and Antipope Laurentius were elected pope. Symmachus was approved by the Roman Senate, but both Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I and the Gothic King Theodoric the Great originally supported Laurentius, who was installed in the Lateran Palace. Symmachus and Laurentius resorted to bribing Theodoric for his support, with funds from the Roman aristocrats who supported them.Richards, 1979, p. 70. This is the first documented case of papal simony, wherein both candidates attempted to bribe the royal councilors, if not Theodoric himself, to influence his choice.Baumgartner, 2003, p. 9. According to DeCormenin and de Lahaye, also influencing Theodoric to side with Symmachus and expel Laurentius from Rome was his fear that the latter was too influenced by the Byzantine ruler,DeCormenin and de Lahaye, 1857, p. 98. but according to Richards this is \\"simply not borne out by the evidence.\\"Richards, 1979, p. 79. In announcing his decision, Theodoric cited the majority of clerical support and the fact of prior ordination.Richards, 1979, p. 77. On March 1, 499, Symmachus declared to a synod in Old Saint Peter's Basilica his plan for campaign finance reform in future sede vacantes. Laurentius was among those who signed his statute, having been appointed as Bishop of Nuceria in consolation for having lost his claim to the papacy. Symmachus decreed that reigning bishops would be able to designate their own successors, ending the participation of the laity for at least a half-century. When the supporters of Laurentius tried to depose Symmachus for having celebrated Easter according to the wrong calendar, Theodoric called the pope before him in Ariminum to resolve the matter.Richards, 1979, p. 71. When Symmachus arrived, he discovered that the charges against him included unchastity and maladministration of church property, and fled back to Rome. His flight bolstered the Laurentian party, who succeeded in persuading Theodoric to send a visitor to Rome to have Easter celebrated according to the Greek calendar and to convene a synod to consider the charges against Symmachus. Peter of Altinum, the bishop of Istria, came to Rome to oversee the new Easter celebration and took over the administration of the Holy See pending the outcome of the synod. In the first two sessions, the assembled Italian bishops were unable to agree on the appropriate procedures to settle the matter, but the third session acquitted Symmachus.Richards, 1979, pp. 71-73. Theodoric took a rather hands-off approach to the synod, refusing repeated requests for him to travel to Rome and resolve the matter personally.Richards, 1979, pp. 77-78. According to Richards: :There is something really rather shocking about the way in which the assembled bishops of the Catholic church fell over themselves to persuade a heretic barbarian to decide who the pope should be. It makes nonsense of the idea of an articulation of papal monarchial theory in which the church was superior to the lay authorities. Both the Symmachian and Laurentian factions appealed to the king for arbitration in 489 and both sides accepted his convocation of a synod. Symmachus, indeed, finally submitted a decision about his case to God and the king, hardly the sort of behavior one would accept from a champion of papal supremacy. Indeed, the regularity with which both sides invoked the intervention of the king suggests a widely held view of his impartiality.Richards, 1979, p. 78. Despite the synod, Laurentius was able to return to Rome, take over much of the papal patrimony and churches of the city, and rule from the Lateran Palace while Symmachus remained in St. Peter's.Richards, 1979, p. 73. After Symmachus According to Richards, \\"the death of Pope Symmachus in July 514 was a crucial test for the election regulations after nearly sixteen controversial years of Symmachian rule.\\"Richards, 1979, p. 100. However, the \\"Symmachian old guard\\" controlled a supermajority of the priests and deacons and thus were able to elect Pope Hormisdas (514-523) after only seven days. Hormisdas was likely appointed by Symmachus himself, \\"a procedure which was implicit in the electoral regulations.\\" Hormisdas had prepared complicated written instructions for his envoys to the East long before his election and kept Theodoric well apprised of his negotiations with the Byzantines. Hormisdas was succeeded by Pope John I (523-526). Theodoric married his daughters to the kings of Burgundy, the Visigoths, and Vandals, fellow adherents of Arianism.Richards, 1979, p. 111. However, Clovis, king of the Franks, renounced Arianism in 506, as did Sigismund of Burgundy in 516 ‚Äì acts that could possibly describe the act of having \\"converted to Catholicism.\\" In 523, Eutharic, king of the Visigoths, ceased persecuting non-Arians, around the same time that the Eastern Church began its persecution of Arians. Theodoric created an Ostrogothic navy and sent an emissary to the East, headed by Pope John I himself in 526. Pope Felix IV (526-530) was the first successor of Symmachus to have trouble designating a successor. John I was succeeded by Pope Felix IV (526-530) with the recommendation of Theodoric and his election was confirmed by Athalaric.Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. 1842. Penny cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. C. Knight. p. 320. He was thus appointed \\"for all practical purposes\\" by Theodoric.Holland, David. 1989. The Encyclopedia Americana. Grolier Incorporated. . p. 87. The process of predecessor appointment was used without serious issue until the death of Felix IV, who had given his pallium to Pope Boniface II on his deathbed in 530 and decreed excommunication of any who refused to accept the succession. The Roman Senate disliked the lack of election and denounced Felix, affirming a decree of Pope Anastasius II which had prohibited the practice of a pope designating a successor. Boniface II was supported only by a minority of the clergy, with the larger share supporting Dioscorus, with only Dioscorus's death halting the schism. Boniface II attempted to re-entrench the practice of appointing his successor, but the public outcry was too great, resulting in a highly disputed election in 532 characterized by widespread accounts of bribery and coercion, which resulted in Pope John II (the first to take a papal name).Baumgartner, 2003, p. 10. Pope John was chosen by Athalaric to avoid a split between the Byzantine and Gothic factions.Coulombe, 2003, p. 96. Athalaric, the Ostrogoth king, forced John II to approve decrees that banned any private agreements to elect a pope and enacting limits on the amount of money that could be spent during a papal election (an early example of campaign finance reform). In fact, Athalaric himself was able to engineer the election of Pope Silverius, the son of Pope Hormisdas, upon John II's death. Theodahad threw his support behind Pope Agapetus I and was thus \\"well placed to coerce the new pope Agapetus, for he had been elected with his support.\\"Evans, James Allan Stewart. 2002. The Empress Theodora: Partner of Justinian. University of Texas Press. . p. 65. Theodahad also played a decisive role in the selection of Pope Silverius (536-537), the legitimate son of Hormisdas.Coulombe, 2003, p. 99. Effects of Justinian's reconquest After Justinian I retook Rome in the Gothic War (535‚Äì554), \\"to interfere in the papacy had been one of the first things Justinian had done as soon as his armies got a foothold in Italy.\\"Richards, 1979, p. 141. Long before he had completed his victory over the Ostrogoths, Justinian I had his commander Belisarius depose the pro-Gothic Pope Silverius (536‚Äì537) and install Pope Vigilius (537‚Äì555), the former papal apocrisiarius to Constantinople, in his place. Silverius died and Vigilius was ordained in 537, while the Goths rallied and laid siege to Rome. In 542, King Totila recaptured Rome and by the time Justinian's new general Narses recaptured the city in 552, Vigilius was no longer in Rome. ReferencesBibliography *Baumgartner, Frederic J. 2003.

Sotiri was one of the most important Rilindas figures that contributed in the propagation of the Albanian language. He also worked on one of the versions of the Albanian alphabet. The Congress of Monastir based Albanian's alphabet mostly on Sotiri's precedent work. Biography Sotiri was born in 1843 in the village of Selck√´ in the Lunxh√´ri region, Janina Vilayet of Ottoman Empire (now Pogon municipality, Gjirokast√´r District, Albania) . Along with Petro Nini Luarasi he was an alumnus at the Greek teacher seminary in Qestorati, Gjirokast√´r, where Koto Hoxhi secretly taught in Albanian and inculcated Albanian nationalistic ideals to his students. Sotiri was part of the Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights created in Istanbul in 1877, and its branch Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings (), Istanbul, 12 October 1879. In 1884 he took over the publishing of the first magazine entirely written in Albanian, the magazine Drita, which had first been published by Petro Poga. However Sotiri had to issue a new permit and to change the name of the magazine into Dituria (meaning \\"knowledge\\" in English). In early 1887 Sotiri was issued the permit to open the first Albanian school of modern times in Kor√ß√´. On March 7, 1887 the school () opened in the building offered by the Terpo brothers, an Albanian patriotic family. He had married a Greek woman, the niece of an Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church and had to leave the city for Greece that same year. As a result, the M√´sonj√´torja was left in the hands of Thanas Sina and Petro Nini Luarasi.

It was constructed as a stop on the Pennsylvania Railroad's Main Line near the location where the rail line now crosses Interstate 476 between Villanova station and Radnor station, both of which are still operational as part of SEPTA Regional Rail Paoli/Thorndale Line service. Closure A possibly apocryphal reason regarding the closure of the station has been attributed to former Pennsylvania Railroad president A. J. Cassatt. According to the story, a wealthy land owner that leased property to the railroad to have the station built on was angered when a train passed without stopping to allow guests of his to board at the station. After the incident, the land owner complained directly to Cassett in person. Cassett gave his word that a train would never fail to make a scheduled stop at the station again. To fulfill his promise, Cassatt promptly had the station closed and torn down before the next scheduled stop, with service redirected to the nearby Villanova and Radnor stations, making certain that the train would never miss a scheduled stop at Upton station again. The station is noted on an 1887 geological map of the area, suggesting service was available at least as late as that time.http://www.lowermerionhistory.org/atlas/maps/geo/large.jpg References Category:Former Pennsylvania Railroad stations Category:Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line Category:Former railway stations in Pennsylvania ","title":"Upton station (Pennsylvania Railroad)"},{"id":"26567357","text":"F9F-8s launching from c. 1955 FJ-3M in 1957 F3H in 1956 F-4J lands at NAS Miramar in 1978 VF-121 (Fighter Squadron 121) of the US Navy was a former Pacific Fleet Replacement Air Group (RAG) unit.

On 24 May 1961, Project LANA- the 50th Anniversary of Naval Aviation Transcontinental Race for the Bendix Trophy, was won by a VF-121 crew. Aircrews came from other aircraft types and became qualified in the flight, navigation, and operation of the F4H Phantom. Maintainers came from other squadrons and 'A' schools to learn the Phantom as well. Gunnery and weapons training was obtained while deployed to MCAS Yuma, AZ. Carrier Field Landing Practice (FCLP). Their skills were graded by a Landing Signals Office (LSO) the same way as on a carrier. Once qualified they could advance to actual carrier day/ night launch/ recovery qualifications. After this training, the aircrews were assigned to a fleet squadron and sea duty.

Gladys and her brother, Julian Rockmore, spent the next five years getting used to new schools as the family moved from place to place in Canada. ‚ÄùI spent the following five years getting used to one school, only to find myself moved on to another. This successive uprooting did not stop me from giving every moment of my spare time to drawing and painting. We finally returned to the United States and landed in San Francisco.‚Äù Although neither of her parents had any artistic inclinations, they encouraged her and sent her to Saturday classes at the California School of Fine Arts. ‚ÄúOf this period, I have fascinating memories of the caverns below the school which were the ruins of the original building destroyed in the great earthquake. It was in San Francisco that I first studied from life, and won my first prize. After two years, the family moved again and we finally settled in Chicago. It was there that I got my real start in the world of art.‚ÄùDavis, Gladys Rockmore, Gladys Rockmore Davis, published by the American Artist Group Inc., New York, NY, 1945 ISBN B000H261KY 1917‚Äì1925: education and early career At the age of sixteen, she entered the Art Institute of Chicago where she studied with John Norton and George Bellows. She spoke affectionately of Norton who \\"taught me to look, to see, really to use my eyes. He showed me the vast difference between the actual distortion of reality and the 'pretty' distortion of the average point of view.\\" She praised the Art Institute of Chicago, not only for its teaching, but also for having a museum where the students could compare their work with the works of masters. \\"Great paintings put us in our places,\\" she said. ‚ÄúAs I look back, I realize that a truly remarkable spirit existed in the school at that time. That‚Äôs what happens when there are both good teachers and eager students.‚Äù ‚ÄúAfter graduating in 1920, I was faced with the necessity of earning a living. Commercial art seemed to be the answer. I spent the next eleven years as an advertising and fashion artist. This proved to be not only remunerative, but a most instructive experience in many ways. Actually, it taught me much in the way of judgment, discipline, and facility.‚ÄùDavis, Gladys Rockmore, Gladys Rockmore Davis, published by the American Artist Group Inc., New York, 1945 ISBN B000H261KY Gladys Rockmore‚Äôs artwork appeared in several major fashion catalogs over the next few years including Marshall Fields and Vogue. She was recognized as a fine artist and often did the front or back cover. She was then hired at Grauman Brothers Advertising in Chicago. She was the first woman ever hired by the firm in a staff of all men. Gladys Rockmore met Floyd Davis who was the top artist at Grauman's for illustrations and commercial work. They began a secret relationship and eventual courtship. As soon as Gladys entered the studio Floyd's output dwindled, and as the weeks went by, became practically non-existent. At the end of two months the management asked her to leave; she and Davis subsequently married.Watson, Ernest, \\"Floyd Davis ‚Äì An American Illustrator of Great Originality\\", American Artist January 1942, Vol. 6 Num 1, Published by Watson-Guptill Publications, PA, 1942 1925‚Äì1936: marriage and family In 1925, Davis left the studio and became a freelance advertising artist. After their marriage, the couple moved to New York where Floyd, dividing his time between advertising and magazine illustration, soon became top man in both fields. Then, art editors had to compete with art directors of advertising agencies for his drawings.Watson, Ernest, \\"Floyd Davis ‚Äì An American Illustrator of Great Originality\\", American Artist January 1942, Vol. 6 Num 1, Published by Watson-Guptill Publications, PA, 1942 ‚ÄúI was married in 1925, to Floyd Davis, who, at that time was already a well-known artist. His unfailing interest and flawless taste have been a continuous source of inspiration to me. We moved to New York and set up house- keeping in the old Sherwood Studios. On December 15, 1928 and February 1, 1930 respectively, Noel Montgomery Davis and Deborah Davis, our son and daughter made their appearance.‚Äù \\"In 1932 (at the height of the Great Depression), we decided to go abroad for a year. So, having unlimited optimism, and the fearlessness of youth, we packed up bag, baggage, nurse and babies and departed. We finally settled down in Cannes, for a period of about six months. Our house was only a short distance from the house in Le Cannet where Renoir spent the last twenty-five years of his life.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe returned after a year to New York, and to my astonishment I discovered that I had completely lost the knack of turning out commercial work. I floundered for a couple of months and then went back to school. I studied at the Art Students League for a few months, then later spent some time working with George Grosz, whose intelligent interest was most helpful. After this period, I threw away all leading strings, and plunged myself into the exciting world of painting.‚ÄúDavis, Gladys Rockmore, Gladys Rockmore Davis, published by the American Artist Group Inc., New York, NY, 1945 ISBN B000H261KY Mrs. Davis always set out to paint the things with which she was familiar.

Her first book, Pastel Painting was published in 1943. At the Metropolitan Opera House in 1944, Mrs. Davis made many intimate sketches of the ballet from backstage and other studies in the dressing rooms for Life magazine.

He spent almost two full seasons with the reserve side, making his first-team debut on 2 October 1977 by playing the full 1‚Äì0 home win against Atl√©tico Madrid, shortly before his 21st birthday. In his first season Argote scored 11 La Liga goals in 28 games, helping to a final third place. He went on to form an efficient offensive trio with Dani and Manuel Sarabia, also groomed at the club; as Athletic won back-to-back leagues in 1983‚Äì84 he appeared in 65 matches combined, netting ten times. From 1984 onwards, Argote appeared intermittently for Athletic due to injuries. Late into the 1986‚Äì87 campaign, he suffered a leg injury which put him out of action for several months; at the time of his injury the team stood fourth in the table, but eventually finished in 13th position. After 332 first division games for Athletic, in 13 years, Argote rejoined his first football club Zarautz, in the fourth division for the first time in its history. He retired after one year, aged nearly 35. International career Argote played twice for Spain, both matches occurring in December 1978: on the 13th, he started in the 5‚Äì0 win against Cyprus for the UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying stages, in Salamanca. A week later, he played the first half of a 0‚Äì1 friendly loss with Italy, in Rome. Personal life Argote was an accomplished accordion player. Indeed, shortly after winning the 1982‚Äì83 national championship, he recorded an album which met relative success in the Basque Country. Argote also enjoyed playing golf, a sport at that time not very common among footballers. In his childhood, he was a caddie at the golf course in his hometown.

It is 39.70 meters long and 10.10 meters wide.  History  The formation of the Armenian community in Heshmatiyeh (like the other Armenian-populated districts of Tehran) began in the late 1940s. In earlier time there was the Saint Gregory the Illuminator chapel located in a place where today is the \\"Shahaziz\\" Sports and Cultural Union. It was destroyed by fire in 1967. At beginning when the community was strong in number and there was no church in this area, so therefore they felt to have a church in their locality which was a need for survival of the community in this area. There was a school named ‚ÄúSahakian‚Äù in Dahmetri Aramane Ave. and the school had a hall for religious ceremonies which was large in size. Since there was no land in the area to build a church, so the school hall was modified into a church. With the help of the Armenian Prelacy of Tehran and certain circumstances that was caused after Iranian revolution, the church was finally established and then anointed on 13 June 1986.’ç’°÷Ä’§’°÷Ä’°’∫’°’ø ÷Ñ’°’≤’°÷Ñ’°’¥’°’Ω’´ ’ç. ’é’°÷Ä’§’°’∂’°’∂÷Å ’•’Ø’•’≤’•÷Å’´’∂’ù 30 ’ø’°÷Ä’•’Ø’°’∂.

The church was named after an Armenian saint named Vartan from the 5th century who was martyred for the sake of the faith in Christ. Vardan Mamikonian fought the Battle of Avarayr against Sassanid army in defense of his faith and people. St. Vartan fought with handful number of small army against Sassanid army who were outnumbered than Armenia's army. Physically the battle was lost and St. Vartan with all his men in arms was martyred but in long run they won the battle morally in honor and dignity.

It was blessed by Aram I, the Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia during each of his three visits to Iran in 1996, 2005 and 2008. The Armenian bishop Artak Manukian who was the prelate of Armenians in Tehran died in 1999; in the same year a new bishop, Sepuh Sargsyan, was appointed for Prelacy of Armenians in Tehran.

His goal was to address the mounting flow of declassified information available since the end of the Cold War. The Raleigh Spy Conference is considered the top intelligence conference for the lay public by the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO). The first conference featured former KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin; Christopher Andrew, leading intelligence scholar from Cambridge University; CIA‚Äôs Brian Kelley ; Hayden Peake, CIA‚Äôs Historic Intelligence Collection curator; and Nigel West, former member of Parliament and intelligence expert. The RSC discussed the connection between intelligence and the war on terrorism in 2004. The conference featured Al-Qaeda expert Bruce Hoffman of RAND Corporation, suicide bomber researcher Kim Cragin and US embassy security officer Dennis Pluchinsky. The 2005 conference featured Cold War scholars Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, Ronald Radosh, Jerrold Schecter and Steve Usdin who addressed the changing interpretation of the era based on newly declassified documents and the negative reaction in the academic establishment. The 2006 conference addressed Castro and Cuba the same week Fidel Castro became ill and turned over his presidency to his brother Ra√∫l Castro. Featured speakers included: Brian Latell, assigned to watch Cuba for the CIA; Gene Poteat who worked with the U-2 flights over Cuba during the Missile Crisis; Cold War scholar and Nixon Library director Tim Naftali; and Miami Herald reporter Don Bohning. Famous unsolved spy cases were reenacted during the 2008 conference that featured Washington Post associate editor and espionage novelist David Ignatius as the keynote speaker. Speakers included former FBI special agent IC Smith on Chinese espionage; CIA's Brian Kelley on the Robert Hanssen case; David Robarge - chief historian at CIA - on the life and career of James Angleton; and a special appearance by former CIA officer Tennent Bagley on the controversial Yuri Nosenko case. In 2009, the RSC covered ‚Äúsexspionage,‚Äù the role of female spies and the art of seduction in the most famous spy cases of the 20th century. Nigel West delivered the keynote address. Speakers included Ron Olive of NCIS who tracked down Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard; British historian Terry Crowley; and IC Smith on the notorious Katrina Leung spy scandal. There was no RSC in 2010, but the conference will resume in August 24‚Äì26, 2011.http://www.afio.com/ The theme will be \\"Spies Among Us: The Secret World of Espionage Illegals.\\" Retired General Michael Hayden will serve as keynote speaker.

Douglas Waller, author of the best-selling biography Wild Bill Donovan about the founder of the Office of Strategic Services, will anchor an Authors Roundtable during the conference. And new this year: The Historical Collections Division of the Office of Information Services of the CIA, will provide published works of recently declassified secret documents, ranging from the Korean War, the Warsaw Pact, Air America, martial law in Poland, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the papers of controversial CIA director Richard Helms. Officials from CIA‚Äôs Historical Division will be on hand in Raleigh to discuss their work and to answer individual questions. The RSC is held every year in Raleigh, NC. The conference is presented by Raleigh Metro Magazine and other area sponsors. For summaries of past conferences, speaker bios and information on upcoming events visit www.raleighspyconference.com. Origins and Purposes: The role of espionage in correcting the historical record piqued the interest of editor and publisher of Raleigh Metro Magazine Bernie Reeves who believes intelligence is the calculus of history in the modern era. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what really happened until someone declassifies something,‚Äù said Reeves, ‚Äúbeginning with the declassification of the British Ultra Secret program from World War II, followed by the American Venona decrypts from the Cold war and continuing in earnest since the collapse of the USSR.‚Äù Reeves founded the Raleigh Spy Conference in 2003 in an effort to dramatize the dramatic flow of declassified data, and to honor the contributions made by scholars who have researched and published influential works drawn from newly available material. Speakers featured at the first RSC include Christopher Andrew of Cambridge, the world‚Äôs most well known intelligence expert and the author of Defend the Realm, the authorized history of MI5, the British security service; Oleg Kalugin, former KGB major general and chief of Soviet counterintelligence; Hayden Peake, curator of the CIA collection; Brian Kelley former chief of the Soviet desk at CIA; and Nigel West, researcher, author and former Member of Parliament. The second conference addressed the connection between intelligence and terrorism, featuring Bruce Hoffman of RAND, the leading expert on al-Qeada Dennis Pulchinsky an officer with US embassy security, and Kim Cragin, the top expert on the profiles of suicide bombers. The third conference focused on the Cold War scholarship and featured co-authors Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes; as well as former communist Ronald Radosh, author of the Rosenberg File and Red Star Over Hollywood. Jerry Schecter reviewed the highlights of the Cold War from his perspective as long-time Time magazine bureau chief in Moscow. Steve Usdin discussed new information on the Americans who began the computer age in the USSR and I.C. Smith spoke about the rising dangers of Chinese espionage. The fourth RSC discussed Castro and Cuba, during the same week Fidel Castro fell ill. The keynote speakers were CIA Cuba expert Brian Latell; author and researcher Tim Naftali, CIA‚Äôs Gene Poteat, who was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis; anti-Castro activist Humberto Fontova; and journalist Don Bohning, who covered Cuba beginning in 1959 for the Miami Herald.. Three parts of the conference were aired on CSPAN. Former CIA officer Tennent Bagley, author of the controversial book Spy Wars, was a featured guests during the fifth RSC, along with CIA historian David Robarge; Brian Kelley on the most famous double-agent cases of the Cold War; and David Ignatius, Washington Post associate editor and espionage novelist, \\"Sexpionage and Subtle Art of Seduction\\" was the title of the sixth conference that focused on the role of female spies and the use of sex in intelligence operations. The 8th annual Raleigh Spy Conference will be held August 22‚Äì24, 2012 at the North Carolina Museum of History. Entitled Dramatic Revelations: J. Edgar Hoover, Castro, Deep Throat, Carlos the Jackal and Secrets from the CIA, the event signifies a culmination of the event's basic theme: recently declassified information is re-writing history.

Born in Victoria and raised in Western Australia, he graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, before transferring to the RAAF in 1928. He was considered one of the service's leading flying instructors and aerobatic pilots between the wars, and was appointed to his first squadron command in 1937. Over the course of World War II, Walters led No. 1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron in Singapore, No. 1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, Northern Territory, No. 72 Wing in Dutch New Guinea, and Northern Command in Papua New Guinea. He was decorated with the Air Force Cross in 1941 for his work with No. 1 Squadron, and mentioned in despatches in 1944 for his service with No. 72 Wing. Walters was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1946 for his service with Northern Command. Already marked out for senior roles in the post-war RAAF, his positions during the 1950s included Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Southern Area Command, AOC RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London, Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in Washington, D.C., AOC Home Command, Air Member for Personnel, and AOC Support Command. He was promoted acting air vice marshal in 1952 (substantive in 1954), and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1956. Popularly known as \\"Wally\\", he was twice a candidate for Chief of the Air Staff, and twice passed over. He retired from the RAAF in 1962 and made his home in Melbourne, where he died in 1968 at the age of sixty-two. Early career Allan Leslie Walters was born on 2 November 1905 in Ascot Vale, Victoria, to schoolteacher Ferdinand Walters and his wife Edith. The family soon moved to Perth, Western Australia, and Allan completed his education at Perth Modern School, where he joined the cadets. After leaving school and spending eight months in the militia, he entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in February 1924. At Duntroon he specialised in field artillery, and excelled at athletics. Graduating as a lieutenant in December 1927, he transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 1 February 1928. Walters' preferred career path in the military was engineering, and it was only when he failed to gain selection for this field after his graduation that he applied to transfer to the Air Force, which, having no cadet college of its own, had arranged with Duntroon to take one of its artillery specialists each year for secondment as a pilot.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 191‚Äì192, 196 He commenced his course at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, in mid-1928, and graduated as a flying officer in March 1929. Walters showed an aptitude for instruction, and after further training was graded an 'A1' flight instructor, a rare distinction. Posted to No. 3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, operating Westland Wapitis, he also made a name for himself performing aerobatics at air shows throughout the country.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 31‚Äì33 Walters put this particular talent to use in pursuit of his wife-to-be, Jean Manning, stunt flying above All Saints Church, North Parramatta, where her father was rector. Reverend Manning married the couple there on 30 June 1930; their daughter Robin was born in Richmond. alt=Overhead view of three single-engined biplanes in flight Walters was granted a permanent commission in the Air Force in 1930. On 5 January 1931, by now promoted flight lieutenant, he won a trophy in an air obstacle race at the Cootamundra Air Pageant. In May the following year, he took out the NSW Air Derby and Evening News Cup.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 38‚Äì39 He temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron during October 1933, in the absence of Squadron Leader Bill Bostock. At the time, the commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron also held command of RAAF Station Richmond.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 46, 123 Walters was posted to Britain in 1936 to attend the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and was promoted to squadron leader in March 1937, while still overseas.Coulthard- Clark, Air Marshals of the RAAF, p. 34 He also undertook a naval reconnaissance course at RAF Manston. Returning to Australia in May, he took command of No. 22 Squadron in June, flying Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons out of Richmond until February 1938.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 115 Between 6 and 23 February 1938, Walters piloted the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he flew the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Richard Williams, to Singapore in a Tugan Gannet.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 394 He returned to Richmond in May 1938 to lead No. 3 Squadron, operating Demons, and again took part in aerobatic displays. On 25 October 1938, his Demon crashed in scrub at Tumbi Umbi, New South Wales, when the engine failed shortly after taking off for Richmond, but he was not injured. Completing his Richmond appointment in May 1939, Walters transferred to Melbourne as Director of Staff Duties at RAAF Headquarters. Later that month, he joined Group Captain Henry Wrigley as an expert assessor on the panel of an inquiry into a recent series of three Anson accidents; the full report handed down in October found human error the likely explanation for at least one crash and that training on the type followed the syllabus laid down, but that pilots needed more practical experience in dealing with potential in-flight incidents.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 349‚Äì350 World War II Val Hancock (centre), Air Commodore Joe Hewitt (second from right), and newly appointed Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones (right, seated)alt=Five men, four standing and one seated, wearing dark-coloured military uniforms Walters' first operational appointment following the outbreak of World War II was as commanding officer of No. 1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, which he led to Sembawang, Singapore, in July 1940.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 141‚Äì142 His promotion to temporary wing commander was announced the same month. He had earlier travelled incognito to Singapore on a Qantas Empire flying boat, which had been specifically requested to deviate from its normal flight path so that he could reconnoiter airfields in the Dutch East Indies.Helson, The Forgotten Air Force, pp. 54‚Äì55 Deployed in response to fears of Japanese expansion in Malaya, No. 1 Squadron was the first Australian unit equipped with Lockheed Hudson light bombers, which were employed primarily for maritime patrol work. Walters was awarded the Air Force Cross for his \\"very active part in all operations\\" and for training his unit to \\"a particularly high standard\\"; the honour was gazetted in the 1941 King's Birthday Honours. He succeeded Frank Lukis as commanding officer of RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, in May the same year, and was promoted acting group captain.RAAF Historical Section, Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations, pp. 144‚Äì145 In May 1942, he joined Allied Air Forces Headquarters, South West Pacific Area (SWPA), in Melbourne as Assistant Director of Operations.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, p. 112 He was made a temporary group captain in September, and transferred to Headquarters RAAF Command as senior air staff officer.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 588 On 7 October 1942, Walters took command of a new formation, No. 1 (Fighter) Wing, at RAAF Station Richmond. Established to boost the air defence capability of Australia's North-Western Area, the wing comprised three Supermarine Spitfire squadrons that had been transferred from Europe: No. 54 Squadron RAF, No. 452 Squadron RAAF and No. 457 Squadron RAAF. With Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying ace of the war, as his wing leader, Walters began deploying aircraft and men to Darwin, Northern Territory, in December, providing a fillip for morale in the region.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 83‚Äì84Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 651‚Äì652 Proudly declaring himself Australia's oldest fighter pilot, Walters was reported as taking every opportunity to join his men in the air. He flew as Caldwell's wingman in No. 1 Wing's first major action against the Japanese over Darwin on 2 May 1943.Alexander, Clive Caldwell, pp. 109‚Äì111 Eight Spitfires crashed and several others made forced landings, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 46‚Äì49 Walters narrowly avoiding being shot down when he warned Caldwell of an attacking enemy fighter, to the detriment of his own safety. After they landed, Caldwell chided his commander, \\"You silly old so-and-so. You want to look after your own skin instead of worrying about someone else's!\\" On 20 June, Walters participated in the wing's most successful combat against the Japanese to that time, personally accounting for one of fourteen raiders claimed by the Spitfires, for the loss of two of their own number.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 59‚Äì60 He posted out of Darwin a few days later, having earned the admiration of Caldwell and the rest of the wing's personnel.Alexander, Clive Caldwell, p. 141 alt=Three men in light- coloured uniforms with peaked caps seated on a jeep bonnet Walters assumed command of No. 5 Service Flying Training School in Uranquinty, New South Wales, on 30 June 1943, but the next month was posted to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea to take over No. 72 Wing following reassignment of its original commander, Group Captain Charles Eaton.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, p. 108 Comprising No. 84 Squadron (flying CAC Boomerang fighters), No. 86 Squadron (Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk fighters), and No. 12 Squadron (Vultee A-31 Vengeance dive bombers), No. 72 Wing came under the control of RAAF North-Eastern Area Command, and undertook air defence and patrol tasks in and around western New Guinea.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 114‚Äì116 Group Captain Bill Hely assumed command of No. 72 Wing in May 1944, and Walters was appointed Director of Staff Policy and Plans at RAAF Headquarters. He was mentioned in despatches on 28 October 1944 for his \\"Gallant & distinguished service\\" in North-Eastern Area, the award being promulgated on 9 March 1945. In February 1945, Walters was promoted to acting air commodore and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Northern Command, directing its operations in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville until the end of the war.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, pp. 295 Headquartered at Madang in Papua New Guinea, Northern Command had previously been a large mobile formation known as No. 9 (Operational) Group but had evolved into a garrison force, its mobile function supplanted by No. 10 (Operational) Group (later First Tactical Air Force).Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 335 Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 144, 168 Northern Command's operational formations included No. 71 Wing in northern New Guinea, No. 74 Wing at Port Moresby, and No. 84 Wing on Bougainville. No. 71 Wing, commanded by Group Captain Val Hancock, supported the Australian 6th Division during the Aitape‚ÄìWewak Campaign, despite ordnance deficiencies that at one stage led to its squadrons arming their Bristol Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 335, 343‚Äì347 No. 84 Wing suffered shortages in pilots and equipment during the Bougainville Campaign, and morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation; as a result, the wing's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report, the tone of which earned a rebuke from Walters.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 326 In September, Walters represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender ceremonies in Wewak. Post-war career Walters was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the King's Birthday Honours on 25 June 1946, for his \\"conspicuous service in operations against the Japanese\\" while leading Northern Command during the war. After completing his term as AOC Northern Command that year, Walters again became Director of Staff Plans and Policy at RAAF Headquarters. He attended the Imperial Defence College, London, in 1947. Walters was among a small coterie of highly regarded operational commanders, including Air Commodores John McCauley, Fred Scherger and Val Hancock, earmarked by the Australian Air Board for senior leadership roles in the post- war RAAF.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, p. 238Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 24‚Äì27, 73 In the short term, he remained a temporary air commodore‚Äîwith the substantive rank of group captain from May 1947‚Äîas the officer corps shrank drastically with demobilisation. He was selected as AOC Southern Area Command, hub of the RAAF's training organisation, in March 1948.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 73‚Äì75 The following month, he flew to Morotai to preside over a court- martial for an RAAF airman accused of killing an officer of the Dutch merchant marine; the airman was acquitted. alt=Head-and-shoulders portrait of a caucasian man in light-coloured uniform with peaked cap and pilot's wings on left-breast pocket In January 1951, Walters was appointed AOC RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London. That December, he was part of the Australian contingent at the Commonwealth Air Forces Conference, where an RAAF presence was sought in the Middle East; this eventually resulted in No. 78 Wing being re-formed and deployed to Malta in July 1952. Although Walters was keen to use the opportunity to acquire the RAAF's first North American F-86 Sabres, political realities led him to negotiate a deal whereby the wing was equipped with leased British de Havilland Vampire FB.9s.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 202‚Äì203 In October 1952, Walters was promoted to acting air vice marshal and posted to Washington, D.C., to head up the Australian Joint Services Staff as successor to Air Vice Marshal Scherger. Walters' rank was made permanent in January 1954, when he succeeded Air Vice Marshal McCauley to become AOC Home Command. Walters held this post, responsible for directing the RAAF's combat units, for three years. His tenure witnessed the introduction of the CAC Sabre to operational service with the Air Force, when No. 3 Squadron took delivery of its first machine in March 1956.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 75, 348‚Äì349 Walters was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1956 New Year Honours. In March 1957, he was one of three candidates, along with Air Vice Marshals Scherger and Hancock, touted as possible successors to Air Marshal Sir John McCauley as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Though Walters was considered to be very able, Scherger had long been regarded as outstanding and was \\"easily the best material on offer\\" according to a former CAS, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman.Stephens; Isaacs, High Fliers, p. 123 Scherger gained the appointment, and Walters became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 21 October.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 499‚Äì500 As AMP he occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the CAS.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 52 In this role Walters endorsed the recommendations of a review by the AOC Training Command, Air Vice Marshal Ian McLachlan, that led to a policy of RAAF College cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the college was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy.Frost, RAAF College & Academy, pp. 36‚Äì38Stephens, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 188‚Äì189 Walters served as AMP until August 1959. The following month he was appointed AOC Support Command, a new organisation created by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 76 When Scherger's term as CAS was due to complete in May 1961, Walters and Hancock were once more put forward to the Minister for Air as potential replacements. \\"Walters was again unlucky\\", in the words of Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Jeff Isaacs, Hancock's \\"professional ability, operational experience and personal qualities\\" being deemed more appropriate for the role.Stephens; Isaacs, High Fliers, p. 137 Retirement Walters left the RAAF on 16 May 1962, after completing his posting at Headquarters Support Command. His pending retirement and succession by Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy had been announced the previous November. Walters followed horse racing in private life. Survived by his wife and daughter, he died from cardiorenal failure in Heidelberg, Melbourne, on 19 October 1968. He was accorded an Air Force funeral at The Scots Church, Melbourne, and cremated. His pall bearers included two former CASs, Air Marshals Sir Richard Williams and Sir George Jones, along with Air Vice Marshals Henry Wrigley, Joe Hewitt, Colin Hannah, and Douglas Candy.

He ran into Jacob by chance, after which he joined them in forming the Saefkow-Jacob-B√§stlein Organization. It was one of the larger resistance groups in Germany. They focused on disseminating information that they were able to glean from foreign newspapers and from radio broadcasts from Moscow. Franz Jacob, 1964 stamp from the GDR They also organized the Bewegung Freies Deutschland (Free Germany Movement) to work with people in factories, military units, opposition parties and others, growing to several hundred people. In his publication, Am Beginn der letzten Phase des Krieges (\\"At the beginning of the last phase of the war\\"), Jacob wrote that to end the war and overthrow the fascist dictator, Communists should concentrate all their strength \\"on developing a broad, national front composed of all groups that stand opposed to fascism. Bernhard B√§stlein, 1964 stamp from the GDR The goal was to give the splintered resistance a central leadership. Together with B√§stlein and Jacob, Saefkow formed the head of the organization, later also known as the \\"Operative Leadership of the Communist Party in Germany\\". There were strong links to other resistance groups in many of the bigger German cities, such as Magdeburg, Leipzig, Dresden and Hamburg. The plan was to build a united front, with anti-fascist circles of the Social Democrats and the middle class, that would topple Adolf Hitler through sabotage and other acts. The 500 members of the Saefkow-Jacob-B√§stlein group, one of the biggest resistance groups in Germany, included not just workers, but doctors, teachers, engineers and artists. About one-quarter of the members were women. The largest factory group of the organization was at Teves, a machine and tool manufacturer, with about 40 members (a very small percentage of their roughly 2,400 employees). A plaque there now honors their memory. (See photo, below.) Following a betrayal in 1944, over 280 members of the organization were arrested.

According to historian Peter Steinbach, they knew that this military resistance was an effort without a broad foundation of support and they, as leaders of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the KPD, as well as trade unions, had the contacts to make this act of resistance without broad support into an act of resistance with support. An additional meeting was planned for July 4, 1944 to discuss concrete measures. They were denounced by an informer, however, and when Jacob, Saefkow and Reichwein arrived at the appointed place, the Gestapo arrested them all. Leber was arrested a few days later.

The town was noted for production and trade in palm oil and kernel. In recognition of its strategic importance, the Colonial administration established a river port at Ekpene Okpo, with a colonial court . The court is still in operation today. One of the distinguishing features of Ntak Ibesitt is the network of colonial roads. There is a road linking Ikot Okoro, Mbon Ebre, Ukpom and Ekparakwa- all neighbouring towns and villages. A very popular market in Ntak Ibesit is Urua Ekenyong Obom, which is centrally located to serve Ukpom Edem Inyang, Mbon Ebre, Ediene Ikot Ebom. The road linking Ikot Afanga town and Ntak Ibesit was named after a man called Udo Anwa-the Man Leopard. He was a commander who was arrested during the Ekpe Ikpa Ukot War, of the late 1940s. The MAN LEOPARD killings were believed to be one war fought, in the southern Annang, to draw the attention of the colonial administrators to the plight of the locals in the area, who were regarded mainly as drawers of waters and hewers of wood. The struggle has engaged the attention of many authors internationally (see: G I Nwaka: The Leopard Killings of Southern Annang 1943-48, 1986). Ntak Ibesit was seriously affected by the Nigerian civil war, to the extent that the Ummanis and other foreign traders who settled and carried out business at Ekpene Okpo (the river port of the town) left and did not return. The footprints of the White Missionaries are very visible in Ntak Ibesit, the Qua Iboe Mission cathedral and the St John's African Church Primary School, built in 1940. Ikot Okoro, which is about away from Ntak Ibesit is a tourist destination, mostly to those who would like to study the settlement patterns of the colonial administrators. They were headquartered there as the administrative centre of the southern Annang. Ntak Ibesit shared some common boundaries with Asanga and it is made up of five town units namely: Ikot Esikan, Ikot Okoetok, Ikot Udo Aduak, Ataha Essien and Ataha Ntak. Another town unit was proposed which was named Ikot Ama Odung. Chief Ezekiel Sunday Ibanga was the proponent of the proposed town unit. The Akwa Ibom State Government has proposed to establish a skill acquisition centre for Ntak Ibesit to take care of youth un-employment.

It fought in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and on the Eastern Front. It was officially transformed into the 24th Panzer Division in late 1941.  Operational history  The campaign in Western Europe began in the Netherlands before it was assigned to the 4th Army and sent to France. The division crossed the Somme on 7 June and fought near Meulen. On 18‚Äì19 June it fought around Saumur and attempted to capture a bridge across the Loire but the attack failed when it was blown up by English troop with a patrol still on it. The division reached La Rochelle when the fighting in France ended. After the French capitulation the division was stationed in France on occupation duties until the early summer of 1941 when it was moved east in preparation for the attack on the Soviet Union. It was assigned to the XXIV Army Corps in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. The division fought in the southern sector of the front, seeing action around the Berezina and Dniepr rivers, especially in efforts to clear the Pripet Marshes of by-passed Red Army units. It was withdrawn to France in November 1941 and its 17,000 horses were handed over to infantry divisions.

The sitcom's target audience was teenagers. The series began production on February 15, 2010, with stars Mitchel Musso and Doc Shaw departing fellow Disney series Hannah Montana and The Suite Life on Deck respectively, and premiered on September 10, 2010 on the Disney Channel. The show is filmed before a live studio audience, but uses a laugh track. On November 20, 2010, Disney XD announced Pair of Kings had been renewed for a second season, which premiered on June 13, 2011. In December 2011, the series was renewed for a third season, however Disney announced Musso would be replaced with actor Adam Hicks who has worked with Disney on previous projects such as Zeke and Luther. The third season premiered on June 18, 2012. However, on November 3, 2012, it was announced on Adam Hicks's Twitter page that Disney XD would not renew Pair of Kings for a fourth season. The series revolves around a pair of Chicago teens who discover they are rulers of a fictitious Pacific island nation. Premise The series tells the story of brothers Brady (Mitchel Musso) and Boomer (Doc Shaw), a pair of teenage fraternal twins raised by their aunt and uncle in Chicago who live a normal existence. However, when Mason (Geno Segers), the royal adviser to the throne of the island of Kinkow, arrives at their high school, they learn that they are the heirs to the throne of the island, and after Mason tells Brady and Boomer of their lineage, they begin to realize that their lives are about to change drastically and will try to be brave and face their fears. Seventeen years earlier, the boys' mother, Annabelle, was an archeologist who was brought to the island and married King Kunu, their father, thus marrying into the Kinkowan royal line. Kaita the Bat- Rider, leader of the Tarantula People, killed Annabelle and Kunu during the Tarantula Wars. Kaita was later mummified. The brothers relocate to the fictional island of Kinkow to assume their roles as the co-kings of the island nation, which has many odd customs and superstitions ‚Äì while trying not to cause problems. Actually, the oldest twin was supposed to rule alone, but, since all records of which twin‚ÄîBrady or Boomer‚Äîis elder were lost, the two of them must rule together. In an episode in early October 2011, there was a chance to find out who was older, but the scroll that held the answer fell into a volcano, so no one will ever find out who has the seniority to be the lone ruler. Boomer and Brady's efforts are often aided by Mason's teenage daughter Mikayla (Kelsey Chow) and hindered by Lanny (Ryan Ochoa), a disgruntled cousin who is out to sabotage the boys and take the throne for himself, because he was supposed to be heir to the throne before they found out about Brady and Boomer.Disney XD Medianet In the third season premiere, Brady overhears Mikayla talking with her friend Candace, and learns that Mikayla will not date him because she finds him too immature. Brady leaves a note to Boomer, telling him that he will be leaving the island and heading for Chicago until he is mature enough to date Mikayla. When Boomer was about to take a hot air balloon to bring Brady back to Kinkow, a storm struck. The storm was about to destroy the island. Mason, Mikayla, the villagers, and the guards were to bring Boomer inside. Lanny, instead, tried to get Boomer killed in the storm while Boomer was attempting to get Brady. The storm passed and the next morning, they discovered a crashed boat. Several people exited the crashed ship, including King Boz (Adam Hicks) of Mindu. The new arrivals told how their island was destroyed by the storm and how they crash-landed on Kinkow. The inhabitants discovered that King Boz had a Kinkow-shaped birthmark on his bellybutton. Boomer and Brady were revealed to be two of a set of triplets, not just twins. Boz was lost as a child and subsequently was raised by apes. Later, the king and queen of Mindu found him and raised him as their own son. In the finale, Boz accidentally revives Kaita, who faces off against the kings. Kaita is destroyed in the island's volcano by the power of the King rings, fueled by the tribe gems. EpisodesCharacters=Main * Mitchel Musso as King Brady (seasons 1‚Äì2) - One of the two protagonists of the series in seasons 1 and 2. Inherited his father's skin complexion. He has a crush on Mikayla. He is more illogical and in certain situations more serious than Boomer and he appears to be somewhat childish. He often uses his history of being bullied to help figure out how to solve a problem. He plays the guitar. He moved back to Chicago in season 3 after he overheard Mikayla say he was immature and he would never mature so long as he was a king. * Doc Shaw as King Boomer - One of the two protagonists of the series. Inherited his mother's skin complexion. Boomer has moments of carelessness and is rarely serious, unlike his brother Brady, but in season 2, he begins to behave in a slightly more responsible and brave manner than Brady. In season 3, he is still getting used to having another brother and has become the voice of reason between him and Boz. In the third season two parter, he was revealed to know ballet. He also opened his own club called \\"Boomerama\\" in Season 3. In the episode \\"Bond of Brothers\\", it is revealed \\"Boomer\\" is in fact a nickname, but Boomer is interrupted before revealing his real name. * Adam Hicks as King Boz of Mindu (season 3) - One of the two protagonists of the series in season 3. Inherited his father's skin complexion. He is Brady and Boomer's long lost triplet brother, who was lost in a storm on Mindu 17 years ago. He was raised by apes until he was ten, after which he was found and adopted by the king and queen of the island of Mindu. He does not like Mikayla very much because he feels that she looks like his ex-girlfriend even though it is very clear they look nothing alike. He tends to act like a real monkey from time to time, making him wild and unpredictable. Boz also possesses the power to converse with animals, as seen when he saves Boomer and Mikayla from a gorilla. It is made quite clear in the first few episodes of season 3, that of the triplets, Boz is the most intelligent. He is also the only one who appears to have at least average intelligence, if not over. In \\"I Know What You Did Last Sunday\\", it was revealed that in attempt to look for shelter, he unclogged Mindu's storm drain which caused the island to sink rapidly. * Kelsey Chow as Mikayla Makoola - Mason's only daughter, Mikayla assists the triplets on many occasions. She is fearlessly tough and can handle anything, especially since she has inherited her father's fighting skills. She is shown to be very good with her machete, which she calls \\"Stabitha\\". Mikayla is the kind of person who tells the kings everything that they need to know, not just what they want to hear. Brady has a crush on her, but she continuously rejects him when he wants to go out with her. In the finale of season 2, Mikayla believes she may actually like Brady after having a dream of them almost kissing. She questions this and eventually kisses him to break him from a spell placed on him by the evil king. In the first episode of season 3, Mikayla does feel guilty upon hearing that Brady had left Kinkow. * Ryan Ochoa as Lanny - Brady, Boomer and Boz's evil cousin who was heir to the throne until Boomer and Brady arrived. He is the main and inept antagonist of the series. He usually spends his time trying to think of ways to get rid of Brady and Boomer and attempts to cause them trouble. While at first indifferent to Lanny, the kings have built up an inexplicably large amount of love and trust for him and misinterpret any action he does as trying to help them. When Brady leaves Kinkow, Lanny takes the King Ring off of Mikayla, in order for Mikayla to return a favor to him. In the season 3 episode \\"O Lanada\\", Boomer and Boz give Lanny the island nation of Lanada without realizing the gold-producing gopher of Kinkow lives there. In the end, Lanny keeps Lanada. When Lanny wanted to donate his spit to restore Kaita the Bat-Rider, the Tarantula People planned to take Lanny's spit by force in front of Mikayla. After Kaita the Bat-Rider is restored and Mikayla confronts Lanny for his actions, Lanny declares that it is time for his favor to be called in and wants her to keep silent of his treachery. However, in the battle, Lanny decides to help the kingdom by destroying the zombies using a canon. He soon learned that Kinkow is his real home and decides to be nice. * Geno Segers as Mason Makoola - The strong and fearless Royal Advisor and loyal friend to the kings' parents. He is the overly protective father of Mikayla and always threatens any boy who attempts to ask her out, including King Brady (Mikayla reveals her father's overprotectiveness is why she had to attend her school prom with a zebra for her date). He is often nicknamed \\"Sasquatch\\". Recurring * Vincent Pastore as Yamakoshi - Lanny's one-hundred-year-old pet fish and only friend, though they are constantly at odds. He is malevolent and perpetually grumpy. It would seem that Yamakoshi is the true schemer against Brady and Boomer, but being confined to a fish-bowl makes it impossible to carry out his plans without Lanny. Only Lanny can understand Yamakoshi when he talks. In the Season 2 1-hour finale \\"The Evil King,\\" it is revealed that Yamakoshi is really Kalakai, the evil twin of Malakai, first king of Kinkow, who founded the dark side. He was defeated and transformed into a fish by his brother. He regained his human form when the twin moons appeared in the sky and he tricked Lanny into placing him on the throne of the evil castle, which restored his true form, so long as he did not leave his castle, which would result in the curse activating again. However, he was defeated by Brady and Boomer, and fell into the river, which caused him to leave his castle, and change back into his fish form. He then returned to being Lanny's pet. He is not seen in season 3, making his whereabouts unknown. * James Hong as Timothy Kalooka-Khan - Kinkow Island's head elder and shaman who learned everything from Kinkow Community College and is the go-to guy for the kings, though he openly dislikes them. In the season three episode \\"Mysteries of Kinkow,\\" his real name is revealed on the Mysteries of Kinkow TV show when he was interviewed by Candace. His wife throws him out in the first part of the series finale after he makes fun of her cooking on TV. In the third part, he abandoned the island and left for Las Vegas to become a cab driver. * Brittany Ross as Candace - Candace is Mikayla's pretty, but naive gossip-loving friend. She was the most popular student in Mikayla's school, and has her own TV show called Mysteries of Kinkow. Candace is arrested by Mikayla in the series finale after nearly causing Kinkow to be destroyed. * Martin Klebba as Hibachi - A dwarfish bully with 6 toes on each foot, Hibachi was the Kahula of Shredder Beach before Boomer and Brady defeated him in a surfing contest over who would be the Kahula. It was discovered that he cheats in order to win. Shredder Beach is a dangerous beach in Kinkow where the best surfer rules, and not even the kings have jurisdiction. He also makes an appearance on Boomer's Junga ball team, and as a bouncer in Brady's club. * Logan Browning as Rebecca \\"Awesome\\" Dawson - Boomer's crush in school who thinks she said yes to going to prom with him. They wind up dancing anyway. She also comes to the island for a date with Boomer. When she visited Kinkow in \\"An Ice Girl for Boomer,\\" she was taken away by a jealous caveman yet was rescued by Boomer and the caveman's girlfriend. She eventually dumped Boomer because he was too childish and \\"due to the fact that he sent her a painting of his butt\\". She then reappears and they get back together in the season 3 episode \\"Bond of Brothers\\". In \\"Meet the Parents,\\" it is revealed that Rebecca's father was an exiled shaman of the Tarantula People who was part of a group that did not agree with their people's violent ways. Rebecca's father sought refuge with Boomer's parents who helped them escape to Chicago. In order to keep her safe following a fight against the Tarantula People, her father and Boomer used amnesia powder to make her forget everything about Kinkow and dating Boomer. However, Rebecca found the Bat Medallion that Boz hid at her house from the Tarantula People which ends up dragging Rebecca back to Kinkow and the amnesia powder wears off. When Rebecca finds out that she herself is a Tarantuala Person, she decides to stay to help the Kinkow army to help fight the forces of Kaita the Bat-Rider. Following the fight with Kaita, Boomer and Rebecca rekindle their relationship. *Eric Petersen as Catawampus - Lanny's second-in-command in the third season. He is well aware of Lanny's true nature, but follows him nonetheless even being determined to accept his abuse so he will one day respect him. Catawampus gains his wish in the series finale after saving Lanny and he becomes good. * Doug Brochu as Oogie - A Flaji who befriends Boomer, making Brady jealous. They mistakenly think he is a cannibal, but he turns out to be vegetarian. After the kings apologize to him, they are still unable to stop Mason from blasting him (who still believed he was a cannibal). He later develops a crush on a Dirt Fairy named Priscilla.

It is a circumpolar genus, mainly restricted to arctic-alpine habitats in northern Canada, Europe, and Russia.Halonen, P. L. Myllys, S. Velmala, & H. Hyv√§rinen. 2009. Gowardia (Parmeliaceae)-a new alectorioid lichen genus with two species. The Bryologist 112(1): 138‚Äì146. Taxonomy and naming Gowardia was previously included within the genus Alectoria, but is now differentiated from this genus on the basis of its chemistry and colour, as well as by molecular phylogenetics. Gowardia was named after Trevor Goward, a lichenologist in British Columbia, Canada, in recognition of his \\"remarkable and ongoing work on North American lichens\\". This genus currently contains three species, Gowardia arctica, Gowardia nigricans, and Gowardia zebrina, the last of which was described in 2020. Examination of North American herbarium specimens filed under A. nigricans suggests that there are several additional species of Gowardia that have yet to be described. The species G. nigricans was previously called Alectoria nigricans (Ach.) Nyl., while G. arctica was not differentiated as a species until the creation of this genus. Description Gowardia are shrubby to decumbent hair lichens that are greyish to blackish in colour. They look similar to Alectoria, but Alectoria contains usnic acid, which gives it a yellowish to greenish-yellow hue, while Gowardia lacks this chemical and instead contains melanic pigments which make it greyish to blackish in colour. The pseudocyphellae of Gowardia are always white. The species of Gowardia could be confused with several other hair lichens. Bryoria nitidula looks similar but contains fumarprotocetraric acid and has dark-coloured pseudocyphellae. Bryocaulon divergens is red-brown in colour instead of greyish. Alectoria ochroleuca also looks similar, but contains usnic acid and always has some yellow parts to its thallus, while Gowardia does not. Habitat and Distribution Gowardia is found in arctic and alpine tundra in northern Canada, Europe, and Russia. G. arctica grows on dry to moist tundra soil in northern regions of Canada and Russia, along the Arctic Ocean coast and islands. G. nigricans has a wider distribution, and is found in arctic and alpine tundra habitat in northern and northwestern North America, as well as in northern Europe and Asia. Although G. nigricans normally grows on tundra heath, it is occasionally found on low branches of trees or shrubs. Traditional use by people Gowardia nigricans, along with A. ochroleuca, B. divergens, and B. nitidula, is called tingaujaq by the Inuit. It is known to be a favorite food of caribou, and is used by children to lure fawns close enough to touch them.Wilson, M. R. 1979. Notes on ethnobotany in Inuktitut.

An accomplished penalty kick taker, his entire professional career was spent with Athletic Bilbao with which he appeared in nearly 300 official matches, winning four major titles including two La Liga championships. Club career Born in Barakaldo, Biscay, Urtubi grew in Athletic Bilbao's youth system, Lezama. On 2 November 1980 he made his debut with the first team, playing two minutes in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Sporting de Gij√≥n in what would be his only La Liga appearance of the season. In the summer of 1981, Urtubi moved to the Balearic Islands for his compulsory military service, spending a few months playing with RCD Mallorca in Segunda Divisi√≥n and finishing the campaign with amateurs CD Margaritense, in both cases on loan. Upon his return he wasted no time making an impact in the Lions' main squad, scoring 13 goals in 62 games combined as the Basque won back-to-back national championships and conquering the double in the latter season. In the 1985 Copa del Rey final, against Atl√©tico Madrid, referee Miguel P√©rez awarded the Colchoneros a penalty kick after a controversial handball by Urtubi ‚Äì Bibao eventually lost it 1‚Äì2. In the following league campaign the side finished in third position, with the player missing his first penalty ever, against H√©rcules CF, and manager Javier Clemente was also fired after five highly successful years. Urtubi continued to be an undisputed starter with the following coaches, Jos√© √Ångel Iribar and Howard Kendall, with Athletic finishing 13th and fourth, respectively, and reaching the semifinals of the domestic cup in 1987, bowing out to neighbouring Real Sociedad. On 15 February 1989, during a cup match against Real Valladolid, he suffered a severe injury in his left knee (posterior cruciate ligament, external and internal meniscus), but astonishingly recovered fully in a short period of time, although he later suffered a relapse. In 1989‚Äì90, manager Txetxu Rojo, a former Athletic player and assistant coach during Kendall's spell, suggested Urtubi gained match fitness with the reserves. After the player refused he would make no more official appearances, but saw his importance in the squad increase after Clemente returned in June 1990, after elections at the club brought a new chairman. On 16 March 1991, after a 0‚Äì2 loss at CD Castell√≥n (in the previous matchday, Bilbao lost 0‚Äì6 at home against FC Barcelona), Clemente was fired, in what was Urtubi's last match in the Spanish top division. In 1991‚Äì92 his output consisted of one cup tie against Deportivo Alav√©s, scoring Athletic's goal through a penalty to help to a 1‚Äì1 draw in √Ålava and leaving the club after ten full seasons as a professional, amassing totals of 277 games and 37 goals. Urtubi ended his career in 1995 at the age of 34, after playing amateur football with local sides SD Balmaseda FC and Zalla UC. Ten years later he had his first coaching experience, leading CD Mirand√©s to the second position in Tercera Divisi√≥n. International career On 14 November 1984, Urtubi won the first of his two caps with Spain, starting in a 1‚Äì3 loss against Scotland for the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, in Glasgow. Two months later, he replaced Barcelona's Julio Alberto in the dying minutes of a 3‚Äì1 friendly win with Finland, in a match played in Valencia.

It is also known as the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program, being directed towards what are designated as Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs). Historical background The United States Higher Education Act of 1965 was signed into law on November 8, 1965. The law was intended \\"to strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary and higher education\\".The Higher Education Act The research that led to the creation of Title V found that HSIs provided a significant proportion of postsecondary opportunities for Hispanic students, whilst receiving less in State and local funding per student than other institutions of higher education. This was found to be limiting their ability to expand and improve programs and institutional strength. HSIs were defined as those with low education and general expenditures, and 25 percent or more full-time equivalent undergraduate Hispanic students of whom 50 percent or more were low-income. Provisions of Title V Title V funding was granted to higher educational institutions to enable them to improve and expand their provision for Hispanic students and other low-income students. Such activities could include the renovation of instructional facilities, faculty development, the purchase of scientific or laboratory equipment for teaching, financial and administrative management, development and improvement of academic programs, joint use of facilities, academic tutoring, counseling programs, and student support services. Grants covered a period of up to 5 years.East Los Angeles College Foundation: Programs and Projects Impact In 2006, $95 million was awarded to 151 HSIs under Title V. Research found that the \\"sustained institutional funding\\" provided under Title V had an effect on the number of degrees awarded. Title V expansion In 2009 Title V was expanded. For the first time it provided funding for graduate programs of HSIs in its new \\"Part B\\" section (\\"Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans\\"). The stated purposes were to expand postbaccalaureate educational opportunities for, and improve the academic attainment of, Hispanic students; and to expand and improve postbaccalaureate academic programs in those institutions of higher education that were educating large numbers of Hispanic and low-income students.Title V‚ÄîDeveloping Institutions: Sec. 501: Authorized Activities, reproduced by National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.

Life James was born in 1703, at Kinvaston in Staffordshire, to Edward James, a major in the English army, and his wife Frances, a sister of Sir Robert Clarke. His early education was at Lichfield Grammar School, where he became acquainted with his fellow student Samuel Johnson. He then attended St John's College, Oxford, from which he received the degree of A.B. on 5 July 1726. He was admitted as an extra- licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 12 January 1727/8, and in May of the same year was created doctor of medicine at Cambridge by royal mandate. He practiced at Sheffield, Lichfield, and Birmingham before moving to London, where he was admitted as a licentiate of the Royal College on 25 June 1765. He died on 23 March 1776, aged seventy-three. A page from James's Medicinal Dictionary James's most notable publication was his three-volume Medicinal Dictionary (1743‚Äì1745), for which his friend Samuel Johnson wrote the \\"proposals\\", as well as several of the dictionary's articles (mainly at the beginning of the alphabet), including those for actuarius and Aretaeus. This work was immediately translated into French (as Dictionnaire universel de m√©decine, 1746‚Äì1748) by the team of Denis Diderot, Fran√ßois-Vincent Toussaint, and Marc-Antoine Eidous; and it retained its popularity for so long that Mark Twain felt justified in writing a scathing critique of it nearly 150 years later, in 1890.Twain, Mark. \\"A Majestic Literary Fossil\\". Harper's Magazine, Feb. 1890. Rpt. in Quackery His fever powder, which he patented in 1747, was one of the most successful of 18th-century patent medicines, though he is said to have \\"tarnished his image by patenting his powders, and falsifying their specification\\". (It was considered unbecomingly mercenary to patent a medicine, and his falsification of the ingredients in the patent documentation would have been designed to prevent others from replicating his formulation.) The use of this preparation, a compound of antimony and phosphate of lime, has been cited as a contributing factor in the death of Oliver Goldsmith.
